                "Reception history of Jane Austen\n\nThe reception history of Jane Austen follows a path from modest fame to wild popularity. Jane Austen (1775–1817), the author of such works as \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813) and \"Emma\" (1815), has become one of the best-known and most widely read novelists in the English language. Her novels are the subject of intense scholarly study and the centre of a diverse fan culture.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Austen's novels brought her little personal fame. Like many women writers, she chose to publish anonymously, but her authorship was an open secret. At the time they were published, Austen's works were considered fashionable but received only a few reviews, albeit positive. By the mid-19th century, her novels were admired by members of the literary elite who viewed their appreciation of her works as a mark of cultivation, but they were also being recommended in the popular education movement and on school reading lists as early as 1838. The first illustrated edition of her works appeared in 1833, in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, which put her titles before thousands of readers across the Victorian period.\n\nThe publication in 1870 of her nephew's \"Memoir of Jane Austen\" introduced her to a wider public as an appealing personality—dear aunt Jane—and her works were republished in popular editions. By the start of the 20th century, competing groups had sprung up—some to worship her and some to defend her from the \"teeming masses\"—but all claiming to be the true Janeites, or those who properly appreciated Austen. The \"teeming masses,\" meanwhile, were creating their own ways of honoring Austen, including in amateur theatricals in drawing rooms, schools, and community groups.\n\nIn 1923, the publisher and scholar R. W. Chapman prepared a carefully edited collection of her works—which some have claimed is the first serious scholarly treatment given to any British novelist. By mid-century, Austen was widely accepted in academia as a great English novelist. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship, which explored numerous aspects of her works: artistic, ideological, and historical.\n\nWith the growing professionalisation of university English departments in the second half of the 20th century, criticism of Austen became more theoretical and specialized, as did literary studies in general. As a result, commentary on Austen sometimes seemed to imagine itself as divided into high culture and popular culture branches. In the mid- to late 20th century, fans founded Jane Austen societies and clubs to celebrate the author, her time, and her works.\n\nAs of the early 21st century, Austen fandom supports an industry of printed sequels and prequels as well as television and film adaptations, which started with the 1940 \"Pride and Prejudice\" and evolved to include the 2004 Bollywood-style production \"Bride and Prejudice\".\n\nJane Austen lived her entire life as part of a large and close-knit family on the lower fringes of the English gentry. Her family's steadfast support was critical to Austen's development as a professional writer. Austen read draft versions of all of her novels to her family, receiving feedback and encouragement, and it was her father who sent out her first publication bid. Austen's artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. With the release of \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1811), \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813), \"Mansfield Park\" (1814) and \"Emma\" (1815), she achieved success as a published writer.\n\nNovel-writing was a suspect occupation for women in the early 19th century, because it imperiled their social reputation by bringing them publicity, viewed as unfeminine. Therefore, like many other female writers, Austen published anonymously. Eventually, though, her novels' authorship became an open secret among the aristocracy. During one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her, through his librarian, James Stanier Clarke, to view his library at Carlton House; his librarian mentioned that the Regent admired her novels and that \"if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to dedicate it to the Prince\". Austen, who disapproved of the prince's extravagant lifestyle, did not want to follow this suggestion, but her friends convinced her otherwise: in short order, \"Emma\" was dedicated to him. Austen turned down the librarian's further hint to write a historical romance in honour of the prince's daughter's marriage.\n\nIn the last year of her life, Austen revised \"Northanger Abbey\" (1817), wrote \"Persuasion\" (1817), and began another novel, eventually titled \"Sanditon\", which was left unfinished at her death. Austen did not have time to see \"Northanger Abbey\" or \"Persuasion\" through the press, but her family published them as one volume after her death and her brother Henry included a \"Biographical Notice of the Author\". This short biography sowed the seeds for the myth of Austen as a quiet, retiring aunt who wrote during her spare time: \"Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives ... [S]o much did she shrink from notoriety, that no accumulation of fame would have induced her, had she lived, to affix her name to any productions of her public she turned away from any allusion to the character of an authoress.\" However, this description is in direct contrast to the excitement Austen shows in her letters regarding publication and profit: Austen was a professional writer.\n\nAusten's works are noted for their realism, biting social commentary, and masterful use of free indirect speech, burlesque and irony. They critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. As Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert explain, Austen makes fun of \"such novelistic clichés as love at first sight, the primacy of passion over all other emotions and/or duties, the chivalric exploits of the hero, the vulnerable sensitivity of the heroine, the lovers' proclaimed indifference to financial considerations, and the cruel crudity of parents\". Austen's plots, though comic, highlight the way women of the gentry depended on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Like the writings of Samuel Johnson, a strong influence on her, her works are fundamentally concerned with moral issues.\n\nAusten's novels quickly became fashionable among opinion-makers, namely, those aristocrats who often dictated fashion and taste. Lady Bessborough, sister to the notorious Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, commented on \"Sense and Sensibility\" in a letter to a friend: \"it is a clever novel.  ... tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it.\" The fifteen-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, Princess Charlotte Augusta, compared herself to one of the book's heroines: \"I think Marianne & me are very like in \"disposition\", that certainly I am not so good, the same imprudence, &tc\".\n\nAfter reading \"Pride and Prejudice\", playwright Richard Sheridan advised a friend to \"[b]uy it immediately\" for it \"was one of the cleverest things\" he had ever read. Anne Milbanke, future wife of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, wrote that \"I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice, which I think a very superior work.\" She commented that the novel \"is the most \"probable\" fiction I have ever read\" and had become \"at present the fashionable novel\". The Dowager Lady Vernon told a friend that \"Mansfield Park\" was \"[n]ot much of a novel, more the history of a family party in the country, very natural\"—as if, comments one Austen scholar, \"Lady Vernon's parties mostly featured adultery.\" Lady Anne Romilly told her friend, the novelist Maria Edgeworth, that \"[\"Mansfield Park\"] has been pretty generally admired here\" and Edgeworth commented later that \"we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park\".\n\nDespite these positive reactions from the elite, Austen's novels received relatively few reviews during her lifetime: two for \"Sense and Sensibility\", three for \"Pride and Prejudice\", none for \"Mansfield Park\", and seven for \"Emma\". Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels. Moreover, as Brian Southam, who has edited the definitive volumes on Austen's reception, writes in his description of these reviewers, \"their job was merely to provide brief notices, extended with quotations, for the benefit of women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral\". This was not atypical critical treatment for novels in Austen's day.\n\nAsked by publisher John Murray to review \"Emma\", famed historical novelist Walter Scott wrote the longest and most thoughtful of these reviews, which was published anonymously in the March 1816 issue of the \"Quarterly Review\". Using the review as a platform from which to defend the then disreputable genre of the novel, Scott praised Austen's works, celebrating her ability to copy \"from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\". Modern Austen scholar William Galperin has noted that \"unlike some of Austen's lay readers, who recognized her divergence from realistic practice as it had been prescribed and defined at the time, Walter Scott may well have been the first to install Austen as the realist par excellence\". Scott wrote in his private journal in 1826, in what later became a widely quoted comparison:\n\n\"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", published together posthumously in December 1817, were reviewed in the \"British Critic\" in March 1818 and in the \"Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany\" in May 1818. The reviewer for the \"British Critic\" felt that Austen's exclusive dependence on realism was evidence of a deficient imagination. The reviewer for the \"Edinburgh Review\" disagreed, praising Austen for her \"exhaustless invention\" and the combination of the familiar and the surprising in her plots. Overall, Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her novels—for example, they misunderstood her use of irony. Reviewers reduced \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\" to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice.\n\nIn the \"Quarterly Review\" in 1821, the English writer and theologian Richard Whately published the most serious and enthusiastic early posthumous review of Austen's work. Whately drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, praising the dramatic qualities of her narrative. He also affirmed the respectability and legitimacy of the novel as a genre, arguing that imaginative literature, especially narrative, was more valuable than history or biography. When it was properly done, as in Austen, Whately said, imaginative literature concerned itself with generalised human experience from which the reader could gain important insights into human nature; in other words, it was moral. Whately also addressed Austen's position as a female writer, writing: \"we suspect one of Miss Austin's great merits in our eyes to be, the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female heroines are what one knows women must be, though one never can get them to acknowledge it.\" No more significant, original Austen criticism was published until the late 19th century: Whately and Scott had set the tone for the Victorian era's view of Austen.\n\nAusten had many admiring readers during the 19th century, who, according to critic Ian Watt, appreciated her \" to ordinary social experience\". However, Austen's novels did not conform to certain strong Romantic and Victorian British preferences, which required that \"powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing\". Victorian critics and audiences were drawn to the work of authors such as Charles Dickens and George Eliot; by comparison, Austen's novels seemed provincial and quiet. Although Austen's works were republished beginning in late 1832 or early 1833 by Richard Bentley in the \"Standard Novels\" series, and remained in print continuously thereafter, they were not best-sellers. Southam describes her \"reading public between 1821 and 1870\" as \"minute beside the known audience for Dickens and his contemporaries\".\n\nThose who did read Austen saw themselves as discriminating readers—they were a cultured few. This became a common theme of Austen criticism during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes articulated this theme in a series of enthusiastic articles in the 1840s and 1850s. In \"The Novels of Jane Austen\", published anonymously in \"Blackwood's Magazine\" in 1859, Lewes praised Austen's novels for \"the economy of easy adaptation of means to ends, with no aid from superfluous elements\" and compared her to Shakespeare. Arguing that Austen lacked the ability to construct a plot, he still celebrated her dramatisations: \"The reader's pulse never throbs, his curiosity is never intense; but his interest never wanes for a moment. The action begins; the people speak, feel, and act; everything that is said, felt, or done tends towards the entanglement or disentanglement of the plot; and we are almost made actors as well as spectators of the little drama.\"\n\nReacting against Lewes's essays and his personal communications with her, novelist Charlotte Brontë admired Austen's fidelity to everyday life but described her as \"only shrewd and observant\" and criticised the absence of visible passion in her work. To Brontë, Austen's work appeared formal and constrained, \"a carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but no glance of bright vivid physiognomy, no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck\".\n\nAusten's novels appeared in some European countries soon after their publication in Britain, beginning in 1813 with a French translation of \"Pride and Prejudice\", quickly followed by German, Danish, and Swedish editions. Their availability in Europe was not universal. Austen was not well known in Russia and the first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967. Despite the fact that Austen's novels were translated into many European languages, Europeans did not recognise her works as part of the English novel tradition. This perception was reinforced by the changes made by translators who injected sentimentalism into Austen's novels and eliminated their humour and irony. European readers therefore more readily associated Walter Scott's style with the English novel.\n\nBecause of the significant changes made by her translators, Austen was received as a different kind of novelist in continental Europe than in Britain. For example, the French novelist Isabelle de Montolieu translated several of Austen's novels into a genre in which Montolieu herself wrote: the French sentimental novel. In Montolieu's \"Pride and Prejudice\", for example, vivacious conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy were replaced by decorous ones. Elizabeth's claim that she has \"always seen a great similarity in the turn of [their] minds\" (her and Darcy's) because they are \"unwilling to speak, unless [they] expect to say something that will amaze the whole room\" becomes \"Moi, je garde le silence, parce que je ne sais que dire, et vous, parce que vous aiguisez vos traits pour parler avec effet.\" (\"Me, I keep silent, because I don't know what to say, and you, because you excite your features for effect when speaking.\") As Cossy and Saglia explain in their essay on Austen translations, \"the equality of mind which Elizabeth takes for granted is denied and gender distinction introduced\". Because Austen's works were seen in France as part of a sentimental tradition, they were overshadowed by the works of French realists such as Stendhal, Balzac, and Flaubert. German translations and reviews of those translations also placed Austen in a line of sentimental writers, particularly late Romantic women writers.\n\nA study of other important dimensions of the French translations, such as free indirect discourse (FID) do much to nuance our understanding of Austen's initial \"aesthetic\" reception with her first French readership. Austen uses a narrative technique known as free indirect discourse (FID) to represent Anne Elliot's consciousness in \"Persuasion\". Indeed, the portrayal of the heroine's subjective experience is central to its narration. The frequent use of FID imbues \"Perusasion\"'s narrative discourse with a high degree of subtlety, placing a huge burden of interpretation on Austen's first translators. Recent studies demonstrate that FID from \"Persuasion\" was translated extensively in Montolieu's \"La Famille Elliot\". Indeed, Montolieu was aware of the propensity of Austen's narrator to delve into the heroine's psychology in \"Persuasion\" as she comments on this in the preface to \"La Famille Elliot\". She characterises it as \"almost imperceptible, delicate nuances that come from the heart\": \"des nuances délicates presque imperceptibles qui partent du fond du cœur, et dont miss JANE AUSTEN avait le secret plus qu'aucun autre romancier\". Montolieu's extensive translations of Austen's FID demonstrate that she was in fact one of Austen's first critical readers, whose own finely nuanced reading of Austen's narrative technique meant that her first French readers could also share in Anne Elliot's psychological drama in much the same way that her English readership could.\n\nFor decades, Scott's and Whately's opinions dominated the reception of Austen's works and few people read her novels. In 1869, this changed with the publication of the first significant Austen biography, \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\", which was written by Jane Austen's nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh. With its release, Austen's popularity and critical standing increased dramatically. Readers of the \"Memoir\" were presented with the myth of the amateur novelist who wrote masterpieces: the \"Memoir\" fixed in the public mind a sentimental picture of Austen as a quiet, middle-aged maiden aunt and reassured them that her work was suitable for a respectable Victorian family. James Edward Austen-Leigh had a portrait of Jane Austen painted, based on the earlier watercolour, softening her image and making her presentable to the Victorian public. The engraving by Bentley which formed the frontispiece of \"Memoir\" is based on the idealised image.\n\nThe publication of the \"Memoir\" spurred a major reissue of Austen's novels. The first popular editions were released in 1883—a cheap sixpenny series published by Routledge. This was followed by a proliferation of elaborate illustrated editions, collectors' sets, and scholarly editions. However, contemporary critics continued to assert that her works were sophisticated and only appropriate for those who could truly plumb their depths. Yet, after the publication of the \"Memoir\", more criticism was published on Austen's novels in two years than had appeared in the previous fifty.\n\nIn 1913, William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, descendants of the Austen family, published the definitive family biography, \"Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters—A Family Record\". Based primarily on family papers and letters, it is described by Austen biographer Park Honan as \"accurate, staid, reliable, and at times vivid and suggestive\". Although the authors moved away from the sentimental tone of the \"Memoir\", they made little effort to go beyond the family records and traditions immediately available to them. Their book therefore offers bare facts and little in the way of interpretation.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century, the first books of critical analysis regarding Austen's works were published. In 1890 Godwin Smith published the \"Life of Jane Austen\", initiating a \"fresh phase in the critical heritage\", in which Austen reviewers became critics. This launched the beginning of \"formal criticism\", that is, a focus on Austen as a writer and an analysis of the techniques that made her writing unique. According to Southam, while Austen criticism increased in amount and, to some degree, in quality after 1870, \"a certain uniformity\" pervaded it:\n\nAmong the most astute of these critics were Richard Simpson, Margaret Oliphant, and Leslie Stephen. In a review of the \"Memoir\", Simpson described Austen as a serious yet ironic critic of English society. He introduced two interpretative themes which later became the basis for modern literary criticism of Austen's works: humour as social critique and irony as a means of moral evaluation. Continuing Lewes's comparison to Shakespeare, Simpson wrote that Austen:\n\nSimpson's essay was not well known and did not become influential until Lionel Trilling quoted it in 1957. Another prominent writer whose Austen criticism was ignored, novelist Margaret Oliphant, described Austen in almost proto-feminist terms, as \"armed with a 'fine vein of feminine cynicism,' 'full of subtle power, keenness, finesse, and self-restraint,' blessed with an 'exquisite sense' of the 'ridiculous,' 'a fine stinging yet soft-voiced contempt,' whose novels are 'so calm and cold and keen'\". This line of criticism would not be fully explored until the 1970s with the rise of feminist literary criticism.\n\nAlthough Austen's novels had been published in the United States since 1832, albeit in bowdlerised editions, it was not until after 1870 that there was a distinctive American response to Austen. As Southam explains, \"for American literary nationalists Jane Austen's cultivated scene was too pallid, too constrained, too refined, too downright unheroic\". Austen was not democratic enough for American tastes and her canvas did not extend to the frontier themes that had come to define American literature. By the start of the 20th century, the American response was represented by the debate between the American novelist and critic William Dean Howells and the writer and humourist Mark Twain. In a series of essays, Howells helped make Austen into a canonical figure for the populace whereas Twain used Austen to argue against the Anglophile tradition in America. That is, Twain argued for the distinctiveness of American literature by attacking English literature. In his book \"Following the Equator\", Twain described the library on his ship: \"Jane Austen's absent from this library. Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn't a book in it.\"\n\nThe \"Encyclopædia Britannica's\" changing entries on Austen illustrate her increasing popularity and status. The eighth edition (1854) described her as \"an elegant novelist\" while the ninth edition (1875) lauded her as \"one of the most distinguished modern British novelists\". Around the start of the 20th century, Austen novels began to be studied at universities and appear in histories of the English novel. The image of her that dominated the popular imagination was still that first presented in the \"Memoir\" and made famous by Howells in his series of essays in \"Harper's Magazine\", that of \"dear aunt Jane\". Author and critic Leslie Stephen described a mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\"—it was only after the publication of the \"Memoir\" that readers developed a personal connection with Austen. However, around 1900, members of the literary elite, who had claimed an appreciation of Austen as a mark of culture, reacted against this popularisation of her work. They referred to themselves as \"Janeites\" to distinguish themselves from the masses who, in their view, did not properly understand Austen.\n\nAmerican novelist Henry James, one member of this literary elite, referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as among \"the fine painters of life\". But, James thought Austen an \"unconscious\" artist whom he described as \"instinctive and charming\". In 1905, James responded frustratingly to what he described as \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's \"intrinsic merit and interest\". James attributed this rise principally to \"the stiff breeze of the special bookselling body of publishers, editors, illustrators, producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines; who have found their 'dear,' our dear, everybody's dear, Jane so infinitely to their material purpose, so amenable to pretty reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful, and in what seemingly proves to be salable, form.\"\n\nIn an effort to avoid the sentimental image of the \"Aunt Jane\" tradition and approach Austen's fiction from a fresh perspective, in 1917 British intellectual and travel writer Reginald Farrer published a lengthy essay in the \"Quarterly Review\" which Austen scholar A. Walton Litz calls the best single introduction to her fiction. Southam describes it as a \"Janeite\" piece without the worship. Farrer denied that Austen's artistry was unconscious (contradicting James) and described her as a writer of intense concentration and a severe critic of her society, \"radiant and remorseless\", \"dispassionate yet pitiless\", with \"the steely quality, the incurable rigor of her judgment\". Farrer was one of the first critics who viewed Austen as a subversive writer.\n\nSeveral important early works—glimmers of brilliant Austen scholarship—paved the way for Austen to become solidly entrenched within the academy. The first was Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley's 1911 essay, \"generally regarded as the starting-point for the serious academic approach to Jane Austen\". Bradley emphasised Austen's ties to 18th-century critic and writer Samuel Johnson, arguing that she was a moralist as well as humourist; in this he was \"totally original\", according to Southam. Bradley divided Austen's works into \"early\" and \"late\" novels, categories still used by scholars. The second path-breaking early-20th-century critic of Austen was R. W. Chapman, whose magisterial edition of Austen's collected works was the first scholarly edition of the works of any English novelist. The Chapman texts have remained the basis for all subsequent editions of Austen's works.\n\nIn the wake of Bradley and Chapman's contributions, the 1920s saw a boom in Austen scholarship, and the novelist E. M. Forster primarily illustrated his concept of the \"round\" character by citing Austen's works. It was with the 1939 publication of Mary Lascelles' \"Jane Austen and Her Art\"—\"the first full-scale historical and scholarly study\" of Austen—that the academic study of her works matured. Lascelles included a short biographical essay; an innovative analysis of the books Austen read and their effect on her writing; and an extended analysis of Austen's style and her \"narrative art\". Lascelles felt that prior critics had all worked on a scale \"so small that the reader does not see how they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them\". She wished to examine all Austen's works together and to subject her style and techniques to methodical analysis. Lascelles praised Austen for her \"shallow modelling\" of her characters, giving them distinctive voices yet making certain it was clear they all belonged to the same class. Subsequent critics agree that she succeeded. Like Bradley earlier, she emphasised Austen's connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction. However, at the time some fans of Austen worried that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric—a debate that continued into the 21st century.\nIn an outpouring of mid-century revisionist views, scholars approached Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, following and expanding upon Farrer, argued in his essay \"Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen\" that Austen's novels did not support the \"status quo\" but rather subverted it. Her irony was not humorous but caustic and intended to undermine the assumptions of the society she portrayed. Through her use of irony, Austen attempted to protect her integrity as an artist and a person in the face of attitudes and practices she rejected. In his 1940 essay, Harding argued that Austen had to be rescued from the Janites, charging \"her books are, as she meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people she disliked...\". Harding argued the Janites regarded Regency England as \"expressing the gentler virtue of a civilised social order\" that was an escape from the waking nightmare of a world at war, but he argued that its own sort of way that the world of Austen's novels was nightmarish, where the government maintained a system of spies to crush any sympathy with the French Revolution, where friends take delight in causing others pain, where the polite language is usually a facade, and where intelligence in single woman is seen as a problem. Harding maintained that the problem with the Janites was that they could not grasp these aspects of Austen's works. Almost simultaneously, influential critic Q. D. Leavis argued in \"Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing\", published in \"Scrutiny\" in the early 1940s, that Austen was a professional, not an amateur, writer. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by another revisionist treatment by Marvin Mudrick in \"Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery\" (1952). Mudrick portrayed Austen as isolated, defensive, and critical of her society, and described in detail the relationship he saw between Austen's attitude toward contemporary literature and her use of irony as a technique to contrast the realities of her society with what she felt they should be. These revisionist views, together with prominent critic F. R. Leavis's pronouncement in \"The Great Tradition\" (1948) that Austen was one of the great writers of English fiction, a view shared by Ian Watt, who helped shape the scholarly debate regarding the genre of the novel, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics. They agreed that she \"combined <nowiki>[</nowiki>Henry Fielding's and Samuel Richardson's<nowiki>]</nowiki> qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".\n\nThe period after the Second World War saw a flowering of scholarship on Austen as well as a diversity of critical approaches. One school that emerged in the United States was the New Criticism, which saw literary texts in only aesthetic terms, an object of beauty to be appreciated in and of itself without no study of the individual that had produced it or the society that she lived in. The New Critics tended to praise Austen for her literacy skills at combining irony and paradox, but other critics argued that the New Criticism by only focusing on the aesthetic qualities of the books ignored the message of the books and Austen herself, who was reduced down to merely being the mere scribe who produced these books that they admired so much. More typical of the post-1945 scholarship Marvin Mudrick's 1952 book \"Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery\", where he argued that Austen used irony as a way of deflating conventions and to gently challenge the reader's beliefs.\n\nIn 1951, Arnold Kettle in his \"Introduction to the English Novel\" praised Austen for her \"fineness of feeling\", but complained about the \"relevance\" of her work to the 20th century, charging that the values of Austen's novels were too much those of Regency England to be acceptable for the 20th century, writing a modern audience could not accept the rigidly hierarchical society of her time where the vast majority of people were denied the right to vote. About the question of the \"relevance\" of Austen to the modern world, the American critic Lionel Trilling in his 1955 essay on \"Mansfield Park\" wrote about the problem of existing in the modern world, of \"the terrible strain it imposes on us...the exhausting effort which the concept of personality requires us to make\", and praised Austen for her refusal to dignify the \"uncertainty and difficulty\" of modern life, praising her irony as the \"engaging manner by which she masks society's crude coercive power\", and uses irony in a \"generosity of spirit\". In his 1957 essay \"\"Emma\" and the Legend of Jane Austen\", Trilling argued that Austen was the first novelist to handle the very modern problem of the \"deep psychological change which accompanied the establishment of democratic society\" which imposed a \"psychological burden\" on a individual which the \"new necessity of conscious self-definition and self-criticism\" as \"there is no reality about which the modern person is more uncertain and more anxious than the reality of himself\". Trilling argued that in modern society, where people existed only as \"atoms\" uncertain about how they really were, Austen offers us a \"rare hope\" of a world where people could define themselves on their own terms.\n\nIan Watt in his 1957 book \"The Rise of the Novel\" argued that 18th century British literature was characterized by a dichotomy between either novels that were told from the first person and novels from the third person; the significance of Austen rested according to Watt in her ability to combine both subjective and objective tendencies in her books though her use of free indirect discourse. Another influential work was Wayne Booth's 1961 book \"The Rhetoric of Fiction\", in which offered a detailed study of \"Emma\", which he argued was told from three points of view; Emma's, Mr. Knightley's and the unnamed narrator. Booth argued Austen adopted this three-fold narration because Emma is in many ways an unlikable character, a spoiled and immature busybody, and Austen had to find a way to make her likable and engaging to the reader. Booth's book was widely praised for the way in which he highlighted how a moral problem (Emma's character) was turned into an aesthetic problem (how to tell the story while keeping its protagonist likable enough to engage the reader's sympathy), and has been the basis of much Austen scholarship since. Critics like Graham Hough have pointed out that the morality of the characters in \"Emma\" is related to their diction of the characters with those closest to the narrator having the best character, and in this reading Mr. Knightley has the best character. A. Walton Ktiz argued the aspect of the novel of \"Knightley as the standard\" prevents the irony of \"Emma\" from becoming a cynical celebration of feminine manipulation that see it, writing that Austen's use of free indirect discourse allowed the reader to understand's Emma mind without becoming limited by it.\n\nAnother major theme of Austen scholarship has concerned the question of the \"Bildungsroman\" (novel of education). D.D Devlin in \"Jane Austen and Education\" (1975) argued that Austen's novels were all in varying ways \"Bildungsroman\", where Austen put into practice Enlightenment theories about how the character of young people can develop and change. The Italian literary critic Franco Moretti in his 1987 book \"The Way of the World\" called \"Pride and Prejudice\" a \"classic\" \"Bildungsroman\", where Elizabeth Bennet's \"prejudice\" against Mr. Darcy is really \"distrust\" and that she \"shes does not err due to a lack-but due to an \"excess of criticism\", as Bennet rejects anything that she is told to trust \"a priori\". Moretti argued that in a typical \"Bildungsroman\" of the early 19th century was concerned with \"everyday life\", which represented \"an unchallenged stability of social relationships\" in a world that was wracked by war and revolution. In this sense, Moretti argued that the education that Bennet needs is to learn to accept the stability represented by the world around her in England, which is preferable to war and revolution to be found elsewhere in Europe, without losing her individualism. In the same way, Clifford Siskin in his 1988 book \"The Historicity of Romantic Discourse\" argued that all of Austen's books were \"Bildungsroman\", where the struggle of the characters to develop was mainly \"internal\" as the challenge to the characters was not really to change their onward lives, but rather their \"self\". Siskin noted in Henry Fielding's popular 1742 novel \"Joseph Andrews\", where a young man working as humble servant, goes though much suffering, and is ultimately rewarded when it is discovered that he is really an aristocrat kidnapped by the Romany (gypsies) when he is a baby. By contrast, Siskin wrote that Elizabeth Bennet's paternity is not in question and there are not improbable stokes of luck which will make her rich; instead her struggle is to develop her character and conquer her \"prejudice\" against Darcy, marking the shift in British literature from an \"external\" to \"internal\" conflict. Alongside studies of Austen as the writer of \"Bildungsroman\" are studies of Austen as a writer of marriage stories. For Susan Fraiman, \"Pride and Prejudice\" is both a \"Bildungsroman\" concerning Elizabeth Bennet's growth and a marriage story that ends in her \"humiliation\" where ends up submitting to Mr. Darcy. Critics are badly divided over the question of whatever the marriages of Austen's heroines is meant to be a reward for their virtuous behavior as seen by Wayne Booth and merely \"Good Girl Being Taught a Lesson\" stories as seen by Claudia Johnson. Stuart Tave wrote that Austen's stories always seem to end unhappily, but then end with the heroine getting married happily, which led him to the conclusion that these happy endings were artificial endings imposed by the expectations of an early 19th century audience.\n\nAbout the question of the \"relevance\" of Austen to the modern world, Julia Prewitt Brown in her 1979 book \"Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form\" challenged the common complaint that she did not deal with social changes, by examining how she presented social changes within the households she chronicled. Brown argued that the social changes Austen examined were the birth of the \"modern\" individualism where people were \"alienated\" from any meaningful social identity, existing only as \"atoms\" in society. The exhibit A of her thesis, so to speak, was \"Persuasion\" where she argued that Anne Eliot cannot find personal happiness by marrying within the gentry and only marriage to the self-made man Captain Wentworth can give her happiness. Brown argued that \"Persuasion\" was in many ways the most darkest of Austen's novels, depicting a society in grip of moral decay, where the old hierarchical certainties had given way to a society of \"disparate parts\", leaving Eliot as a \"disoriented, isolated\" woman. Brown was not a Marxist, but her book owed much to the Hungarian Communist writer Georg Lukács, especially his 1920 book \"The Theory of the Novel\".\nOne of the most fruitful and contentious has been the consideration of Austen as a political writer. As critic Gary Kelly explains, \"Some see her as a political 'conservative' because she seems to defend the established social order. Others see her as sympathetic to 'radical' politics that challenged the established order, especially in the form of critics see Austen's novels as neither conservative nor subversive, but complex, criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting stability and an open class hierarchy.\" In \"Jane Austen and the War of Ideas\" (1975), perhaps the most important of these works, Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was steeped in, not insulated from, the principal moral and political controversies of her time, and espoused a partisan, fundamentally conservative and Christian position in these controversies. In a similar vein, Alistair M. Duckworth in \"The Improvement of the Estate: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels\" (1971) argues that Austen used the concept of the \"estate\" to symbolise all that was important about contemporary English society, which should be conserved, improved, and passed down to future generations. Duckworth argued that Austen followed Edmund Burke, who in his 1790 book \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" had used the metaphor of an estate that represented the work of generations, and which could be only be improved, never altered, for the way that society ought to work. Duckworth noted that in Austen's books, one's ability to keep an estate going, which could only be improved, but never altered if one was to be true to the estate, is usually the measure of one's good character. Butler placed Austen in the context of the reaction against the French Revolution, where excessive emotionalism and the sentimental \"cult of sensibility\" came to be identified with sexual promiscuity, atheism, and political radicalism. Butler argued that a novel like \"Sense and Sensibility\", where Marianne Dashwood is unable to control her emotions, is part of the conservative anti-revolutionary literature that sought to glorify old fashioned values and politics. Irvine pointed out that the identification of the \"cult of sensibility\" with republicanism was one that existed only in the minds of conservatives, and in fact the French Republic also rejected sentimentalism, so Butler's challenge is to prove Austen's call for emotional self-restraint as expressed by a character like Elinor Dashwood is in fact grounded in conservative politics. Butler wrote \"the characteristic recourse of the conservative...is to remind us ultimately of the insignificance of individual rights and even individual concerns when measured against the scale of 'the universe as one vast whole'\". Irvine wrote that novels like \"Sense and Sensibility\" appeared to support Butler's thesis, but a novel like \"Pride and Prejudice\" does not, as Elizabeth Bennet is an individualist and a non-conformist who ridicules everything, and who to a certain extent has to learn the value of sentiment.\n\nRegarding Austen's views of society and economics, Alastair MacIntyre in his 1981 \"After Virtue\" offered a critique of the Enlightenment as leading to moral chaos and decay, and citing Aristotle argued that a \"good life for man\" is only possible if one follows the traditional moral rules of one's society. In this regard, MacIntrye used Austen as an \"Aristotelian\" writer whose books offered up examples of how to be virtuous with the English country estate playing the same role that the \"polis\" did for Aristotle. By contrast, Mary Evans in her 1987 book \"Jane Austen and the State\" depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist concerned with the \"stability of human relationships and communities\" and against \"conspicuous consumption\" and the \"individualisation of feeling\" promoted by the Industrial Revolution. In her 1987 book \"Desire and Domestic Fiction\", Nancy Armstrong in a study much influenced by the theories of Karl Marx and Michel Foucault, argued that all of Austen's books reflected the dominant political-economic ideology of her times, concerning the battle to exercise power over the human body, which determined how and whether a woman was considered sexually desirable or not. The Marxist James Thompson in his 1988 book \"Between Self and the World\" likewise depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist searching for a realm of freedom and feeling in a world dominated by a soulless materialism promoted by capitalism. By contrast, Beth Fowkes Tobin in her 1990 article \"The Moral and Political Economy of Austen's \"Emma\"\" depicted Austen as a Burkean conservative with Mr. Knightly as a responsible land-owner taking care of his family's ancient estate and Emma Woodhouse symbolising wealth cut off from any sort of social role. David Kaufmann in his 1992 essay \"Propriety and the Law\" argued that Austen was a classical liberal in the mold of Adam Smith, who felt that virtue was best exercised in the private sphere of the family life rather in the public sphere of politics. Kaufmann rejected the claim that Austen was influenced by Edmund Burke, arguing that for Austen, virtue was not something passed down from time immemorial from a landed elite as Burke would have it, but rather was something that any individual could acquire, thus making Austen into something of a radical. Lauren Goodlad in a 2000 article rejected Kaufmann's claim of Austen as a classical liberal, arguing that the message of \"Sense and Sensibility\" was the failure of liberalism to reconcile alienated individuals from a society that only valued money. As Rajeswari Rajan notes in her essay on recent Austen scholarship, \"the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged\". The questions scholars now investigate involve: \"the [French] Revolution, war, nationalism, empire, class, 'improvement' [of the estate], the clergy, town versus country, abolition, the professions, female emancipation; whether her politics were Tory, Whig, or radical; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary, or occupied a reformist position between these extremes\".\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Austen studies was influenced by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's seminal \"The Madwoman in the Attic\" (1979), which contrasts the \"decorous surfaces\" with the \"explosive anger\" of 19th-century female English writers. This work, along with other feminist criticism of Austen, has firmly positioned Austen as a \"woman\" writer. Gibler and Gubar suggested that what are usually seen as the unpleasant female characters in the Austen books like Mrs. Norris in \"Mansfield Park\", Lady Catherine de Bourgh in \"Pride and Prejudice\" and Mrs. Churchill in \"Emma\" were in fact expressions of Austen's anger at a patriarchal society, whom are punished in guilt over her own immodesty in writing novels while her heroines who end up happily married are expressions of Austen's desire to compromise with society. The Gilbert-Gubar thesis proved to be influential and inspired scholars to reexamine Austen's through most have a more favorable opinion of her heroines than Gilbert and Gubar did., Other scholars such as Linda Hunt have argued that Austen used realism as a way of attacking patriarchy from the outside as opposed to subverting it from within by irony as Gilbert and Gubar claimed. The interest generated in Austen by these critics led to the discovery and study of other woman writers of the time. Moreover, with the publication of Julia Prewitt Brown's \"Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form\" (1979), Margaret Kirkham's \"Jane Austen: Feminism and Fiction\" (1983), and Claudia L. Johnson's \"Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel\" (1988), scholars were no longer able to easily argue that Austen was \"apolitical, or even unqualifiedly 'conservative'\". Kirkham, for example, described the similarities between Austen's thought and that of Mary Wollstonecraft, labelling them both as \"Enlightenment feminists\". Kirham argued that by showing women were just as capable of being rational as men that Austen was a follower of Wollstonecraft. Johnson similarly places Austen in an 18th-century political tradition, although she outlines the debt Austen owes to the political novels of the 1790s written by women.\n\nThe war with France that began in 1793 was seen as an ideological war between the British monarchy vs. the French republic, which led conservative writers such as Jane West, Hannah More, and Elizabeth Hamilton to depict the feminine private sphere in the family as the embodiment of British values under threat from France, and to write a series of polemical works demanding that young women defend their \"modesty\", as defined by conduct books, to give Britain the moral strength to prevail over the French. Johnson argued that Austen appropriated the sort of plot that More, West and Hamilton used in their books to quietly subvert via irony. In support of her thesis, Johnson noted in \"Sense and Sensibility\" the Dashwood sisters are victimized by their greedy half-brother John, showing the family as an area for competition instead of warmth and comfort; in \"Mansfield Park\" the lifestyle of the eminently respectable Bertram family is supported by a plantation in Antigua worked by slave labour; and \"Northranger Abbey\" where satirizing Gothic stories gives \"a nightmare version of patriarchal oppression\" as General Tilney, if not guilty of the specific crimes that Catherine Moreland imagines he has committed, is indeed a vicious man. Likewise, Johnson noted that Maria Rushworth's adultery in \"Mansfield Park\" is portrayed as merely salacious local gossip that does not presage a great victory for Napoleon while Marianne Dashwood does not die after being seduced by Willoughby, which undercuts the standard plot devices of the conservative writers. Johnston argued because of the drastic wartime censorship and the campaign of vitriolic abuse waged against Wollstonecraft that Austen had to be quiet in their criticism of patriarchy. Irvine in a critique of the work of feminist scholars like Johnson and Kirkham that if Austen was indeed an Enlightenment feminist, there were clearly limits to her radicalism as Austen never criticised either explicitly or implicitly the hierarchical structure of British society with her villains failing to live up to their standards expected of their class, instead of their moral failures being presented as a product of the social system. Writing about the work of Johnson, Irvine wrote for her, Austen was a radical because it is women like Emma Woodhouse, Mrs. Elton and Mrs. Churchill who really run Highbury society, undercutting traditional gender roles, but Irvine questioned whatever this really made Austen into radical, noting it was the wealth and status of the gentry women of Highbury that gave them their power. Irvine argued it was just as possible to see \"Emma\" as a conservative novel that upholds the superiority of the gentry, writing that Johnson was \"...close here to defining 'conservative' in terms of gender politics alone...\". Likewise, Elizabeth may defy Lady Catherine de Bourgh who wants to keep her in place by marrying Mr. Darcy, who comes from old landed family, which Irivne used to argue while \"Pride and Prejudice\" does have a strong heroine, the book does not criticise the structure of English society.\n\nMany scholars have noted in the conduct books that were very popular for settling out the proper rules for a young ladies in Austen's book there was a double meaning to the word modesty. Modesty meant both a woman should refrain from flamboyant behavior and be quiet while modesty also meant a woman had to be ignorant of her sexuality. This double meaning to modesty meant a young woman who was behaving in a modest way was not really modest at all as she attempting to conceal her knowledge of her sexuality, placing young women in an impossible position. Jan Fergus argued that for this reason that Austen's books were subversive by engaging in \"emotional didacticism\" by showing the reader moral lessons meant to teach young women how to be modest in the conventional sense, thus undercutting the demand made by the conduct books for modesty in the sense of ignorance of one's sexuality. In the same way, Kirkham used \"Mansfield Park\" as an example of Austen undercutting the message of the conduct books, noting that Fanny Price is attractive to Henry Crawford because she outwardly conforms to the conduct books while she is attractive to Edmund Bertram because of her intelligence and spirit, rejecting the infantisation of women promoted by the conduct books. Rachel Brownstein argued that Austen's use of irony should be seen in the same way, as a way of writing in a manner expected of a woman writer in her age while also undercutting such expectations at the same time. Devoney Looser in the 1995 book \"Jane Austen and the Discourses of Feminism\" she edited in her introduction argued that there a number of ways in which Austen could be placed not within a feminist tradition, but was herself a feminist.\n\nUsing the theories of Michel Foucault as their guide, Casey Finch and Peter Bowen in their 1990 essay \"'The Tittle-Tattle of Highbury': Gossip and the Free Indirect Style in \"Emma\"\" argued the free indirect discourse in Austen validates Fouucault's thesis that the Enlightenment was a fraud, an insidious form of oppression posing as liberation. Finch and Bowen argued that voice of the omnipresent narrator and together with the free indirect discourse summarizing the thoughts of characters in \"Emma\" were a form of \"surveillance\" that policed the thoughts of the character; seen in this light, Emma Woodhouse's discovery that she loves Mr. Knightley is not an expression of her real feelings, but rather society imposing its values on her mind by persuading her that she had to engage in a heterosexual marriage to produce sons to continue the Establishment and the while fooling her into thinking she was in love. By contrast, Lauren Goodlad in her 2000 essay \"Self-Disciplinary Self-Making\" argued that the self-discipline exercised by Elinor Dashwood in \"Sense and Sensibility\" was not an act of oppression as held by Foucault and those writing from a Foucaultian perspective, but was an \"emancipatory act of political resistance\", arguing that there was a tension between 'psychology' and 'character' as Dashwood must be the observer of her character and used what she has learn to grow.\n\nA very controversial article was \"Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl\" by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick that juxtaposed three treatments of female suffering, namely Marianne Dashwood's emotional frenzy when Willoughby abandons her, a 19th century medical account of the \"cure\" inflicted on a girl who liked to masturbate, and the critic Tony Tanner's \"vengeful\" treatment of Emma Woodhouse as a woman who had to be taught her place. Sedgwick argued the way that the portrayal of Marianne as emotionally overwrought and too inclined to give in to her feelings very closely resembled the account of patient X, the teenage girl seen as too inclined to masturbate and the way a male critic like Tanner attacked Woodhouse for her emotional self-indulgence was no different from the doctor imposing the gruesome and painful treatment on the masturbating girl. Sedwick the way that way Elinor disciplines Marianne, Tanner's \"vengeful\" views and the treatment given to patient X were all attempts to crush female sexuality as she maintained that \"emotional self-indulgence\" was merely a code-word for female masturbation. Sedgwick argued that characters such as Dashwood and Woodhouse, who did not precisely conform to the feminine ideals are symbols of both female and homosexual resistance to the ideal of heterosexuality and patriarchy as the norm for everyone. Sedgwick's provoked an uproar in 1991, becoming a prime exhibit in the American \"Culture war\" between liberals and conservatives.\n\nThe Italian critic Franco Moretti argued that Austen's novels articulated a new form of English nationalism via the marriage plot, noting most of the heroes and heroines came from different parts of England. Some critics such as Roger Gard have seized upon Austen as a symbol of an \"eternal England\", whose \"unpolitical\" works unlike the \"political\" novels of the great French and Russian novelists of the 19th century reflected the central values of \"modern Anglo-Saxon civilisations\". According to Gard, Austen is so English that only the English could really appreciate Austen, writing \"Foreigners, whether reading in translation or in the original, see little or nothing of her true brilliance...the \"feel\" of Jane Austen-so far as we can imagine it dissociated it from her language is still...peculiarly English\". Irvine wrote that Gard's book 1992 book \"Jane Austen's Novels: The Art of Clarity\" is full of historical errors such as his claim Austen was part of the movement towards \"an evolving national democracy\", when in fact the Great Reform Bill, which lowered the franchise requirements for men in a very limited way, was passed in 1832, 15 years after Austen's death, and \"nowhere in her novels or letters is England imagined as 'evolving' towards democracy of any kind\". Irvine wrote that while Austen did see England as different from the rest of Europe, she did not see England as apart from Europe in the way that Gard claimed or as a part of \"Anglo-Saxon civilisations\", which apparently include the United States and English-speaking parts of the Commonwealth, a way of thinking that did not exist in her time. Irvine charged that Gard appeared to be trying to use Austen as a way of furthering his opposition to British membership in the European Union, with his dichotomy between Austen's England with its \"clear\" style and \"unpolitical\" way of life vs. the presumably muddled style and \"political\" way of life of continental Europe with the implication that the two do not belong together.\n\nIn the late-1980s, 1990s and 2000s ideological, postcolonial and Marxist criticism dominated Austen studies. Generating heated debate, Edward Said devoted a chapter of his book \"Culture and Imperialism\" (1993) to \"Mansfield Park\", arguing that the peripheral position of \"Antigua\" and the issue of slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early 19th century. The question of whether \"Mansfield Park\" justifies or condemns slavery has become heated in Austen scholarship, and Said's claims have proved to be highly controversial. The debate about \"Mansfield Park\" and slavery is the one issue that in Austen scholarship that has transcended the limits of academia to attract widespread public attention. Many of Austen's critics come from the field of post-colonial studies, and taken up Said's thesis about \"Mansfield Park\" reflecting the \"spatial\" understanding of the world that he argued was used to justify the British empire. Writing in a post-colonial vein, Carl Plasa in his 2001 essay \"'What Was Done There Is Not To Be Told' \"Mansfield Park\"'s Colonial Unconscious\" argued that the \"barbarism\" of Maria Bertram's sexuality, which leads her into adultery, is a metaphor for the \"barbarism\" of the Haitian revolution, which attracted much media attention in Britain at the time, which was often presented as due to the \"barbarism\" and uncontrolled sexuality of the Haitian slaves. Plasa argued that British society in Austen's time was based upon set of expectations about everyone being in their \"place\", which created order. The Haitian revolution was seen as a symbol of what happened to a society without order, and Plasa argued that it was not accident that when Sir Thomas Bertram leaves Mansfield Park for his plantation in Antigua that his family falls apart, showing the importance of the family and individuals staying in their proper \"place\". Likewise, Maaja Stewart in her 1993 book \"Domestic Realities and Imperial Fictions\" argued that the plantations in the Caribbean were the source of much worry about female sexuality in Austen's time with the main concerns being the need of slave owners to depend upon the fertility of slave women to create more slaves when the slave trade was abolished in 1807, and about the general collapse of traditional English morality in the West Indies as the slave masters routinely kept harems of slave women or alternatively raped female slaves. Stewart linked these concerns to \"Mansfield Park\", writing that Sir Thomas Bertram's failure to manage his own family is put down to his failure to manage the emerging sexuality of his teenage daughters, which is precisely the same charge that was applied to the owners of the plantations in the West Indies at the same time.\n\nOther critics have seen the message of \"Mansfield Park\" as abolitionist. Joseph Lew argued that Fanny's refusal to marry Henry Crawford as \"an act of rebellion, endangering a system based upon the exchange of women between men as surely as a slave's refusal to work\". Susan Fraiman, in a 1995 essay argued strongly against the Said thesis, arguing that the values of Sir Thomas are those which Austen affirms in \"Mansfield Park\" and that if his attempt to restore order to his family in Mansfield Park is seen as analogous with his restoration of order at his Antigua plantation, then he was a failure for the \"moral blight\" at Mansfield Park remains after he returns to England. Fraiman conceded to Said that Austen was one of the writers who \"made colonialism thinkable by constructing the West as center, home and norm\", but argued slavery in \"Mansfield Park\" \"is not a subtext wherein Austen and Sir Thomas converge\", but rather used by Austen \"to argue the essential depravity of Sir Thomas's relations to other people\". Fraiman argued that Austen used the issue of slavery to argue against the patriarchal power of an English gentleman over his family, his estate and \"by implication overseas\". Fraiman argued that British imperialist discourse tended to depict the British empire as masculine and the colonies as feminine, which again to the conclusion that Said had merely inverted this discourse by making Austen a representative of the British empire while lionizing various male anti-colonial writers from Britain's colonies. Brian Southam in a 1995 essay argued that much discussed scene about the \"dead silence\" that follows Fanny Price's questions about the status of slaves in the Caribbean refers to the moral decadence of those members of the British gentry who chosen to be involved in the abolitionist campaigns of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Trevor Lloyd in a 1999 article argued on the basis of the statements in the novel suggested that about 10% of the income from Mansfield Park come from the plantation in Antigua. John Wiltshire in a 2003 article argued that parallel between the condition of women in Britain and the treatment of slaves in the West Indies is to be understood as metaphoric as literal, and that Sir Thomas willingness to make a trip in the middle of a war to his plantation in Antigua, despite the well known perils of yellow fever and malaria in the Caribbean suggested he be understood as a good master. In Wiltshire's account, it is the slave trade, not slavery, that Austen condemns in \"Mansfield Park\".\n\nIrvine argued that though all of Austen's novels are set in provincial England, there is in fact a global component to her stories with the British Empire as a place where men go off in adventures, to get rich and to tell stories which edify the heroines. Irvine used as examples the naval career of Captain Wentworth in \"Persuasion\"; that Sir Thomas Bertram owes a plantation in Antigua while William Price joins the Royal Navy in \"Mansfield Park\"; and Colonel Brandon is a veteran of the campaigns in the West Indies in \"Sense and Sensibility\". Irvine observed that all of these men are in some way improved by the love of women, who domestic otherwise scarred men, noting that for example that Colonel Brandon had fought in the British campaign to conquer Saint-Domingue, where the British lost about 100,000 men between 1793–98, mostly to yellow fever, an experience that scarred him and left him looking for a \"home\". Irvine argued that Elinor Dashwood by arranging for Colonel Brandon to marry her sister Marianne is finding for him the \"home\" that he had lost while fighting for the British empire in a doomed effort to restore slavery to Saint-Domingue. Irvine suggested that for Austen, women had a role in domesticating men scarred by their imperial experiences, and that Said was wrong that Austen could \"not\" write of the British empire; arguing instead in Austen's works the \"stories of empire\" are placed in a \"context of their telling that domesticates them, removes them from the political and moral realm where the horrors they describe might demand a moral and political response\".\n\nAnother theme of recent Austen scholarship concerns her relationship with British/English national identity within the context of the long wars with France. Jon Mee in his 2000 essay \"Austen's Treacherous Ivory: Female Patriotism, Domestic Ideology, and Empire\" examined how Fanny Price defined her sense of Englishness in connection with the English countryside, arguing that Austen was presenting a version of \"England\" defined as country estates in a bucolic countryside that was insulated from a \"larger, more uncertain and un-English world\". Mee suggested that in \"Emma\", the very name of Mr. Knightley, which suggests the Middle Ages, together with the name of his estate, Donwell Abbey, are meant to suggest a continuity between medieval and modern England, in contrast to the newness of the political institutions in the novice republics in the United States and France. Miranda Burgress in her 2000 book \"British Fiction and the Production of Social Order\" argued that Austen defined her England as a nation made up of readers, as the experience of reading the same books had created a common culture across all of England. in this regard, Janet Sorenson in \"The Grammar of Empire\" noted that in Austen's books, none of her characters speak in dialect and all use the same form of polite \"King's English\" that was expected of the upper classes.\n\nIn \"Jane Austen and the Body: 'The Picture of Health\"', (1992) John Wiltshire explored the preoccupation with illness and health of Austen's characters. Wiltshire addressed current theories of \"the body as sexuality\", and more broadly how culture is \"inscribed\" on the representation of the body. There has also been a return to considerations of aesthetics with D. A. Miller's \"Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style\" (2003), which connects artistic concerns with queer theory. Miller in his book began the \"queer\" reading of Austen, as he asked why Austen's work which celebrates heterosexual love is so popular with gay men. Miller answered it is because the narrator of the novels has no sexuality and has a \"dazzling verbal style\", which allows homosexuals to identity with the narrator who stands outside of the world of heterosexuality and whose chief attribute is a sense of style.\n\nCritic Claudia Johnson defines \"Janeitism\" as \"the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her\". Janeites not only read the novels of Austen; they also re-enact them, write plays based on them, and become experts on early 19th-century England and its customs. Austen scholar Deidre Lynch has commented that \"cult\" is an apt term for committed Janeites. She compares the practices of religious pilgrims with those of Janeites, who travel to places associated with Austen's life, her novels and the film adaptations. She speculates that this is \"a kind of time-travel to the past\" which, by catering to Janeites, preserves a \"vanished Englishness or set of 'traditional' values\". The disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen and the academic appreciation of Austen that began with Lascelles has since widened considerably. Johnson compares Janeites to Trekkies, arguing that both \"are derided and marginalized by dominant cultural institutions bent on legitimizing their own objects and protocols of expertise\". However, she notes that Austen's works are now considered to be part of both high culture and popular culture, while \"Star Trek\" can only claim to be a part of popular culture.\n\nSequels, prequels and adaptations based on Austen's work range from attempts to enlarge on the stories in Austen's own style to the soft-core pornographic novel \"Virtues and Vices\" (1981) and fantasy novel \"Resolve and Resistance\" (1996). Beginning in the middle of the 19th century, Austen family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels. By 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations of Austen's works. According to Lynch, \"her works appear to have proven more hospitable to sequelisation than those of almost any other novelist\". Relying on the categories laid out by Betty A. Schellenberg and Paul Budra, Lynch describes two different kinds of Austen sequels: those that continue the story and those that return to \"the world of Jane Austen\". The texts that continue the story are \"generally regarded as dubious enterprises, as reviews attest\" and \"often feel like throwbacks to the Gothic and sentimental novels that Austen loved to burlesque\". Those that emphasise nostalgia are \"defined not only by retrograde longing but also by a kind of postmodern playfulness and predilection for insider joking\", relying on the reader to see the web of Austenian allusions.\nBetween 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, film and stage productions appeared. The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. It has long been said that a Hollywood adaptation was first suggested by the entertainer Harpo Marx, who had seen a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy. Directed by Robert Z. Leonard and written in collaboration with the English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original. Filmed in a studio and in black and white, the story's setting was relocated to the 1830s with opulent costume designs.\n\nIn direct opposition to the Hollywood adaptations of Austen's novels, BBC dramatisations from the 1970s onward aimed to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations, and settings. The 1972 BBC adaptation of \"Emma\", for example, took great care to be historically accurate, but its slow pacing and long takes contrasted unfavourably to the pace of commercial films. The BBC's 1980 adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\" adopted many film techniques—such as the use of long landscape shots—that gave the production a greater visual sophistication. Often seen as the start of the \"heritage drama\" movement, this production was the first to be filmed largely on location. A push for \"fusion\" adaptations, or films that combined Hollywood style and British heritage style, began in the mid-1980s. The BBC's first fusion adaptation was the 1986 production of \"Northanger Abbey\", which combined authentic style and 1980s punk, with characters often veering into the surreal.\n\nA wave of Austen adaptations began to appear around 1995, starting with Emma Thompson's adaptation of \"Sense and Sensibility\" for Columbia Pictures, a fusion production directed by Ang Lee. This star-studded film departed from the novel in many ways, but it became a commercial and critical success, and was nominated for numerous awards, including seven Oscars. The BBC produced two adaptations in 1995: \"Persuasion\" and Andrew Davies's six-episode television drama, \"Pride and Prejudice\". Starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, Davies's production ignited \"Darcymania\" in Britain. Critics praised its smart departures from the novel as well as its sensual costuming, fast-paced editing, and original yet appropriate dialogue. The series sparked an explosion in the publication of printed Austen adaptations; in addition, 200,000 video copies of the serial were sold within a year of its airing, 50,000 within the first week alone. Another adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\" was released in 2005. Starring Keira Knightley, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet, Joe Wright's film marked the first feature adaptation since 1940 that aspired to be faithful to the novel. Three more film adaptations appeared in 2007—\"Mansfield Park\", \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\". \"Love & Friendship\", a film version of Austen's early epistolary novel \"Lady Susan\", was released in 2016. Directed by Whit Stillman and starring Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny, the film's title was taken from one of Austen's juvenile writings.\n\nBooks and scripts that use the general story line of Austen's novels but change or otherwise modernize the story also became popular at the end of the 20th century. \"Clueless\" (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of \"Emma\" that takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series. \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2001), based on the successful 1996 book of the same name by Helen Fielding, was inspired by both \"Pride and Prejudice\" and the 1995 BBC adaptation. The Bollywoodesque production \"Bride and Prejudice\", which sets Austen's story in present-day India while including original musical numbers, premiered in 2004.\n\n\n",
                "Jane Austen\n\nJane Austen (; 16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism and social commentary, have earned her acclaim among critics and scholars.\n\nWith the publications of \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1811), \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813), \"Mansfield Park\" (1814) and \"Emma\" (1816), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled \"Sanditon\", but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript and another unfinished novel, The Watsons. Her six full-length novels have rarely been out of print, although they were published anonymously and brought her moderate success and little fame during her lifetime.\n\nA significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and sold as a set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.\n\nAusten has inspired a large number of critical essays and literary anthologies. Her novels have inspired many films, from 1940's \"Pride and Prejudice\" to more recent productions like \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1995) and \"Love & Friendship\" (2016). \n\nThere is little biographical information about Jane Austen's life except the few letters that survive and the biographical notes her family members wrote. During her lifetime Austen wrote approximately 3,000 letters but only about 160 survive. Many of the letters were written to Austen's older sister Cassandra, who in 1843 burned the greater part of them and cut pieces out of those she kept. Ostensibly Cassandra destroyed or censored her sister's letters to prevent their falling into the hands of relatives and ensuring that \"younger nieces did not read any of Jane Austen's sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbors or family members\". Cassandra believed that in the interest of tact and Jane's penchant for forthrightness, these details should be destroyed. The paucity of record of Austen's life leaves modern biographers little to work with.\n\nThe situation was compounded as successive generations of the family expunged and sanitized the already opaque details of Austen's biography. The heirs of Jane's brother, Admiral Francis Austen, destroyed more letters; details were excised from the \"Biographical Notice\" her brother wrote in 1818; and family details continued to be elided or embellished in her nephew's \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\", published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh's biography \"Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters\", published in 1913. The legend the family and relatives created reflects their biases in favour of \"good quiet Aunt Jane\", portraying a woman whose domestic situation was happy and whose family was the mainstay of her life. Austen scholar Jan Fergus explains that modern biographies tend to include details excised from the letters and family biographical materials, but that the challenge is to avoid the polarising view that Austen experienced periods of deep unhappiness and was \"an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family.\"\nJane Austen was born in Steventon, Hampshire, on 16 December 1775. She was born a month later than her parents expected; her father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother \"certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago\". He added that her arrival was particularly welcome as \"a future companion to her sister\". The winter of 1776 was particularly harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church with the single name Jane.\n\nFor much of Jane's life, her father, George Austen (1731–1805) served as the rector of the Anglican parishes at Steventon, and a nearby Deane. He came from an old, respected, and wealthy family of wool merchants. Over the centuries as each generation of eldest sons received inheritances their wealth was consolidated, and George's branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. His sister Philadelphia went to India to find a husband and George entered St John's College, Oxford on a fellowship, where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739–1827). She came from the prominent Leigh family; her father was rector at All Souls College, Oxford, where she grew up among the gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot, with the only condition that he change his name to Leigh-Perrot. \n\nGeorge and Cassandra exchanged miniatures in 1763 and probably were engaged around that time. George received the living for the Steventon parish from the wealthy husband of his second cousin, Thomas Knight, who owned Steventon and its associated farms, one of which the Austen family rented to live in. Two months after Cassandra's father died they married on 26 April 1764 at St Swithin's Church in Bath, by licence, in a simple ceremony. They left for Hampshire the same day. \n\nTheir income was modest, with George's small \"per annum\" living; Cassandra brought the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother's death to the marriage. The Reverend Austen had an annual income of £200 pounds from his two livings. This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison, a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about £100 pounds annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between £1, 000-£5, 000 pounds. The Austens took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then placed it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.\nIn 1768 the family finally took up residence in Steventon. Henry was the first child to be born there, in 1771. At about this time Cassandra could no longer ignore that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and dumb, and she chose to send him out to be fostered. In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.\n\nAccording to Honan, life in the Austen home was lived in \"an open, amused, easy intellectual atmosphere\" where the ideas of those with whom the Austens might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed. The family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members. Cassandra Austen spent the summer of 1770 in London with George's sister, Philadelphia, and her daughter Eliza, accompanied by his other sister, Mrs Walter and her daughter Philly. Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, \"the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane's youthful horizon and influence her later life and works.\"\n\nCassandra Austen's cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and '80s, inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents on her return, \"… and almost home they were when they met Jane & Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, & have the pleasure of riding home in it.\" Le Faye writes that, \"Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.\"\n\nFrom 1773 until 1796, George Austen supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time, who boarded at his home.\n\nIn 1783, Austen and her sister Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Mrs Ann Cawley who took them with her to Southampton when she moved there later in the year. In the autumn both girls were sent home when they caught typhus and Austen nearly died. Austen was from then home educated, until she attended boarding school in Reading with her sister from early in 1785 at the Reading Abbey Girls' School, ruled by Mrs La Tournelle, who possessed a cork leg and a passion for theatre. The school curriculum probably included some French, spelling, needlework, dancing and music and, perhaps, drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family. After 1786, Austen \"never again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment\".\n\nThe remainder of her education came from reading, guided by her father and brothers James and Henry. Irene Collins believes that Austen \"used some of the same school books as the boys\" her father tutored. Austen apparently had unfettered access both to her father's library and that of a family friend, Warren Hastings. Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library. Her father was also tolerant of Austen's sometimes risqué experiments in writing, and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing.\n\nPrivate theatricals were an essential part of Austen's education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn, including Richard Sheridan's \"The Rivals\" (1775) and David Garrick's \"Bon Ton\". Austen's eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and she probably joined in these activities, first as a spectator and later as a participant. Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests how Austen's satirical gifts were cultivated. At the age of 12, she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years.\n\nBeginning at age 11, perhaps earlier, Austen wrote poems and stories for her own and her family's amusement. In these works the details of daily life are exaggerated, common plot devices are parodied, and the \"stories are full of anarchic fantasies of female power, licence, illicit behaviour, and general high spirits\", according to Janet Todd. Austen later compiled \"fair copies\" of 29 early works into three bound notebooks, now referred to as the \"Juvenilia\", containing work written between 1787 and 1793. She titled the three notebooks – \"Volume the First\", \"Volume the Second\" and \"Volume the Third\" – which preserve 90,000 words she wrote during those years. The \"Juvenilia\" are often, according to scholar Richard Jenkyns, \"boisterous\" and \"anarchic\"; he compares them to the work of 18th-century novelist Laurence Sterne.\n\nAmong these works are a satirical novel in letters titled \"Love and Freindship\" , written at age 14 in 1790, where she mocked popular novels of sensibility, and \"The History of England\", a manuscript of 34 pages accompanied by 13 watercolour miniatures by her sister, Cassandra. Austen's \"History\" parodied popular historical writing, particularly Oliver Goldsmith's \"History of England\" (1764). Honan speculates that not long after writing \"Love and Freindship\" in 1789, Austen decided to \"write for profit, to make stories her central effort\", that is, to become a professional writer. Beginning in about 1793, Austen began to write longer, more sophisticated works.\n\nIn August 1792 she started \"Catharine or the Bower\", which presaged her mature work, especially \"Northanger Abbey\"; it was left unfinished and the story picked up in \"Lady Susan\", which Todd describes as less prefiguring than \"Catharine\". A year later, she began but abandoned a short play, later titled \"Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts\", which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austen's favourite contemporary novel, \"The History of Sir Charles Grandison\" (1753), by Samuel Richardson.\n\nBetween 1793 and 1795 Austen wrote \"Lady Susan\", a short epistolary novel, usually described as her most ambitious and sophisticated early work. It is unlike any of Austen's other works. Austen biographer Claire Tomalin describes the novella's heroine as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate, betray and abuse her lovers, friends and family. Tomalin writes:\n\nTold in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the Restoration dramatists who may have provided some of her inspiration ... It stands alone in Austen's work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters.\nAccording to Janet Todd, the model for the title character may have been Eliza de Feuillide, who inspired Austen with stories of her glamorous life and various adventures. Eliza's French husband was guillotined in 1794; she married Jane's brother Henry Austen in 1797.\n\nAusten sent short pieces of writing to her newborn nieces Fanny Catherine and Jane Anna Elizabeth. There is manuscript evidence that Austen continued to work on these pieces as late as 1809–1811, and that her niece and nephew, Anna and James Edward Austen, made further additions as late as 1814.\n\nShe also attended church regularly, socialized frequently with friends and neighbours, and read novels – often of her own composition – aloud with her family in the evenings. Socialising with the neighbours often meant dancing, either impromptu in someone's home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the assembly rooms in the town hall. Her brother Henry later said that \"Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it\".\n\nWhen Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: \"I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.\"\n\nAusten wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was \"very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man\". She called him her \"friend\" and explained that on this account Cassandra must be anxious to know more about her new \"friend\". Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote she expected an \"offer\" from her \"friend\" and that \"I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat\", going on to write \"I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence\" and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: \"The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea\".\n\nHalperin cautioned that Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, and some of the statements about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.\nAfter finishing \"Lady Susan\", Austen began her first full-length novel \"Elinor and Marianne\". Her sister remembered that it was read to the family \"before 1796\" and was told through a series of letters. Without surviving original manuscripts, there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published anonymously in 1811 as \"Sense and Sensibility\".\n\nAusten began a second novel, \"First Impressions\" (later published as \"Pride and Prejudice\"), in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797, aged 21; as with all of her novels, Austen read the work aloud to her family as she was working on it and it became an \"established favourite\". At this time, her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels. In November 1797, George Austen wrote to Thomas Cadell, an established publisher in London, to ask if he would consider publishing \"First Impressions\". Cadell returned Mr. Austen's letter, marking it \"Declined by Return of Post\". Austen may not have known of her father's efforts. Following the completion of \"First Impressions\", Austen returned to \"Elinor and Marianne\" and from November 1797 until mid-1798, revised it heavily; she eliminated the epistolary format in favour of third-person narration and produced something close to \"Sense and Sensibility\". In 1797, Austen met her cousin (and future sister-in-law), Eliza de Feullide, a French aristocrat whose first husband the Comte de Feullide had been guillotined, causing her to flee to Britain, where she married Henry Austen. The description of the execution of the Comte de Feullide related by his widow left Austen with an intense horror of the French Revolution that lasted for the rest of her life.\n\nDuring the middle of 1798, after finishing revisions of \"Elinor and Marianne\", Austen began writing a third novel with the working title \"Susan\" – later \"Northanger Abbey\" – a satire on the popular Gothic novel. Austen completed her work about a year later. In early 1803, Henry Austen offered \"Susan\" to Benjamin Crosby, a London publisher, who paid £10 for the copyright. Crosby promised early publication and went so far as to advertise the book publicly as being \"in the press\", but did nothing more. The manuscript remained in Crosby's hands, unpublished, until Austen repurchased the copyright from him in 1816.\n\nIn December 1800 George Austen unexpectedly announced his decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She was able to make some revisions to \"Susan\", and she began and then abandoned a new novel, \"The Watsons\", but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.\n\nThe years from 1801 to 1804 are something of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive – he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that \"having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection\". The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had \"had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife ... All of her heroines ... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love\". A possible autobiographical element in \"Sense and Sensibility\" occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates that \"the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life\" with an unsuitable man.\nIn 1804, while living in Bath, Austen started but did not complete her novel, \"The Watsons\". The story centres on an invalid and impoverished clergyman and his four unmarried daughters. Sutherland describes the novel as \"a study in the harsh economic realities of dependent women's lives\". Honan suggests, and Tomalin agrees, that Austen chose to stop work on the novel after her father died on 21 January 1805 and her personal circumstances resembled those of her characters too closely for her comfort.\n\nHer father's relatively sudden death left Jane, Cassandra, and their mother in a precarious financial situation. Edward, James, Henry, and Francis Austen pledged to make annual contributions to support their mother and sisters. For the next four years, the family's living arrangements reflected their financial insecurity. They spent part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon and Godmersham. They moved for the autumn months to the newly fashionable seaside resort of Worthing, on the Sussex coast, where they resided at Stanford Cottage. It was here that Austen is thought to have written her fair copy of \"Lady Susan\" and added its \"Conclusion\". In 1806 the family moved to Southampton, where they shared a house with Frank Austen and his new wife. A large part of this time they spent visiting various branches of the family.\n\nOn 5 April 1809, about three months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, offering him a new manuscript of \"Susan\" if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.\n\nAround early 1809 Austen's brother Edward offered his mother and sisters a more settled life – the use of a large cottage in Chawton village that was part of Edward's nearby estate, Chawton House. Jane, Cassandra and their mother moved into Chawton cottage on 7 July 1809. Life was quieter in Chawton than it had been since the family's move to Bath in 1800. The Austens did not socialise with gentry and entertained only when family visited. Her niece Anna described the family's life in Chawton as \"a very quiet life, according to our ideas, but they were great readers, and besides the housekeeping our aunts occupied themselves in working with the poor and in teaching some girl or boy to read or write.\"\n\nDuring her time at Chawton, Jane Austen published four generally well received novels. Through her brother Henry, the publisher Thomas Egerton agreed to publish \"Sense and Sensibility\", which appeared in October 1811. Reviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers; the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen's earnings from \"Sense and Sensibility\" provided her with some financial and psychological independence. Egerton then published \"Pride and Prejudice\", a revision of \"First Impressions\", in January 1813. He advertised the book widely and it was an immediate success, garnering three favourable reviews and selling well. By October 1813 Egerton was able to begin selling a second edition. \"Mansfield Park\" was published by Egerton in May 1814. While \"Mansfield Park\" was ignored by reviewers, it was very popular with readers. All copies were sold within six months, and Austen's earnings on this novel were larger than for any of her other novels. Unknown to Austen, her novels were translated into French and published in cheaply produced, pirated editions in France. The literary critic Noel King commented that given the prevailing rage in France at the time was for lush romantic fantasies, it is remarkable that her novels with the emphasis on everyday English life had any sort of a market in France. However, King cautioned that Austen's chief translator in France, Madame Isabelle de Montolieu, had only the most rudimentary knowledge of English, and her translations were more of \"imitations\" than translations proper, as Montolieu depended upon assistants to provide a summary, which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austen's plots and characters. The first of the Austen novels to be published that credited her as the author was in France, when \"Persuasion\" was published in 1821 as \"La Famille Elliot ou L'Ancienne Inclination\".\n\nAusten learned that the Prince Regent admired her novels and kept a set at each of his residences. In November 1815, the Prince Regent's librarian James Stanier Clarke invited Austen to visit the Prince's London residence and hinted Austen should dedicate the forthcoming \"Emma\" to the Prince. Though Austen disliked the Prince Regent, she could scarcely refuse the request. Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent on the account of his womanising, gambling, drinking, spendthrift ways and generally disreputable behaviour. She later wrote \"\", a satiric outline of the \"perfect novel\" based on the librarian's many suggestions for a future Austen novel. Austen was greatly annoyed by Clarke's often pompous literary advice, and the \"Plan of A Novel\" parodying Clarke was intended as her revenge for all of the unwanted letters she had received from the royal librarian.\n\nIn mid-1815 Austen moved her work from Egerton to John Murray, a better known London publisher, who published \"Emma\" in December 1815 and a second edition of \"Mansfield Park\" in February 1816. \"Emma\" sold well but the new edition of \"Mansfield Park\" did poorly, and this failure offset most of the income from \"Emma\". These were the last of Austen's novels to be published during her lifetime.\n\nWhile Murray prepared \"Emma\" for publication, Austen began \"The Elliots\", later published as \"Persuasion\". She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition, shortly after the publication of \"Emma\", Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for \"Susan\" from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen's bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him deeply in debt and losing Edward, James, and Frank Austen large sums. Henry and Frank could no longer afford the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters.\n\nAusten was feeling unwell by early 1816, but ignored the warning signs. By the middle of that year, her decline was unmistakable, and she began a slow, irregular deterioration. The majority of biographers rely on Dr. Vincent Cope's 1964 retrospective diagnosis and list her cause of death as Addison's disease, although her final illness has also been described as resulting from Hodgkin's lymphoma. When her uncle died and left his entire fortune to his wife, effectively disinheriting his relatives, she suffered a relapse, writing, \"I am ashamed to say that the shock of my Uncle's Will brought on a relapse ... but a weak Body must excuse weak Nerves\".\n\nShe continued to work in spite of her illness. Dissatisfied with the ending of \"The Elliots\", she rewrote the final two chapters, which she finished on 6 August 1816. In January 1817 Austen began \"The Brothers\" (titled \"Sanditon\" when published in 1925), and completed twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817, probably due to illness. Todd describes \"Sanditon\"'s heroine, Diana Parker, as an \"energetic invalid\". In the novel, Austen mocked hypochondriacs and though she describes the heroine as \"bilious\", five days after abandoning the novel she wrote of herself that she was turning \"every wrong colour\" and living \"chiefly on the sofa\". She put down her pen on 18 March 1817, making a note of it.\n\nAusten made light of her condition, describing it as \"bile\" and rheumatism. As her illness progressed, she experienced difficulty walking and lacked energy; by mid-April she was confined to bed. In May Cassandra and Henry brought her to Winchester for treatment, by which time she suffered agonising pain and welcomed death. Austen died in Winchester on 18 July 1817, at the age of 41. Henry, through his clerical connections, arranged for his sister to be buried in the north aisle of the nave of Winchester Cathedral. The epitaph composed by her brother James praises Austen's personal qualities, expresses hope for her salvation and mentions the \"extraordinary endowments of her mind\", but does not explicitly mention her achievements as a writer.\n\nAfter Austen's death, Cassandra, Henry Austen and Murray arranged for the publication of \"Persuasion\" and \"Northanger Abbey\" as a set. Henry Austen contributed a \"Biographical Note\" which for the first time identified his sister as the author of the novels. Tomalin describes it as \"a loving and polished eulogy\". Sales were good for a year – only 321 copies remained unsold at the end of 1818.\n\nIn 1832 Richard Bentley purchased the remaining copyrights to all of her novels, and over the following winter published five illustrated volumes as part of his \"Standard Novels\" series. In October 1833, Bentley released the first collected edition of her works. Since then, Austen's novels have been continuously in print.\n\nAusten's works critique the sentimental novels of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. The earliest English novelists, Richardson, Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett, were followed by the school of sentimentalists and romantics such as Walter Scott, Horace Walpole, Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, Laurence Sterne and Oliver Goldsmith, whose style and genre Austen rejected, returning the novel on a \"slender thread\" to the tradition of Richardson and Fielding for a \"realistic study of manners\". In the mid-20 century, literary critics F. R. Leavis and Ian Watt placed her in the tradition of Richardson and Fielding; both believe that she used their tradition of \"irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".\n\nWalter Scott noted Austen's \"resistance to the trashy sensationalism of much of modern fiction – 'the ephemeral productions which supply the regular demand of watering places and circulating libraries'\". Yet her rejection of these genres is complex, as evidenced by \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Emma\". Similar to William Wordsworth, who excoriated the modern frantic novel in the \"Preface\" to his \"Lyrical Ballads\" (1800), Austen distances herself from escapist novels; the discipline and innovation she demonstrates is similar to his, and she shows \"that rhetorically less is artistically more.\" She eschewed popular Gothic fiction, stories of terror in which a heroine typically was stranded in a remote location, a castle or abbey (32 novels between 1784 and 1818 contain the word \"abbey\" in their title). Yet in \"Northanger Abbey\" she alludes to the trope, with the heroine, Catherine, anticipating a move to a remote locale. Rather than full-scale rejection or parody, Austen transforms the genre, juxtaposing reality, with descriptions of elegant rooms and modern comforts, against the heroine's \"novel-fueled\" desires. Nor does she completely denigrate Gothic fiction: instead she transforms settings and situations, such that the heroine is still imprisoned, yet her imprisonment is mundane and real – regulated manners and the strict rules of the ballroom. In \"Sense and Sensibility\" Austen presents characters who are more complex than in staple sentimental fiction, according to critic Keymer, who notes that although it is a parody of popular sentimental fiction, \"Marianne in her sentimental histrionics responds to the calculating world ... with a quite justifiable scream of female distress.\"\nRichardson's \"Pamela\", the prototype for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love story with a happy ending, written at a time women were beginning to have the right to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.\n\nAusten had a natural ear for speech and dialogue, according to scholar Mary Lascelles \"Few novelists can be more scrupulous than Jane Austen as to the phrasing and thoughts of their characters.\" Techniques such as fragmentary speech suggest a character's traits and their tone; \"syntax and phrasing rather than vocabulary\" is utilised to indicate social variants. Dialogue reveals a character's mood – frustration, anger, happiness – each treated differently and often through varying patterns of sentence structures. When Elizabeth Bennett rejects Darcy, her stilted speech and the convoluted sentence structure reveals that he has wounded her:\nFrom the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\nAusten's plots highlight women's traditional dependence on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. As an art form, the 18th-century novel lacked the seriousness of its equivalents from the 19th century, when novels were treated as \"the natural vehicle for discussion and ventilation of what mattered in life\". Rather than delving too deeply into the psyche of her characters, Austen enjoys them and imbues them with humour, according to critic John Bayley. He believes that the well-spring of her wit and irony is her own attitude that comedy \"is the saving grace of life\". Part of Austen's fame rests on the historical and literary significance that she was the first woman to write great comic novels. Samuel Johnson's influence is evident, in that she follows his advice to write \"a representation of life as may excite mirth\".\n\nHer humour comes from her modesty and lack of superiority, allowing her most successful characters, such as Elizabeth Bennet, to transcend the trivialities of life, which the more foolish characters are overly absorbed in. Austen used comedy to explore the individualism of women's lives and gender relations, and she appears to have used it to find the goodness in life, often fusing it with \"ethical sensibility\", creating artistic tension. Critic Robert Polhemus writes, \"To appreciate the drama and achievement of Austen, we need to realize how deep was her passion for both reverence and ridicule ... and her comic imagination reveals both the harmonies and the telling contradictions of her mind and vision as she tries to reconcile her satirical bias with her sense of the good.\"\n\nAs Austen's works were published anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels. Sir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, contributed one anonymously. Using the review as a platform to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel, he praised Austen's realism. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately set the tone for almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.\n\nBecause Austen's novels did not conform to Romantic and Victorian expectations that \"powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing\", 19th-century critics and audiences preferred the works of Charles Dickens and George Eliot. In a rare sympathetic review, in this case of \"Emma\" in 1815, Sir Walter Scott wrote that book displayed \"the art of copying from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the reader, instead of the splendid scenes from an imaginary world, a correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\". Though Scott was positive, Austen's work did not match the prevailing aesthetic values of the Romantic \"zeitgeist\". Her novels were republished in Britain from the 1830s and sold at a steady rate, but they were not bestsellers. The first French critic who paid notice to Austen was Philarète Chasles who completely dismissed her as a writer, giving her two sentences in an 1842 essay on the influence of Sir Walter Scott, calling her a boring, imitative writer who wrote nothing of substance. Apart from Chasles, Austen was almost completely ignored in France until 1878.\n\nAusten had many admiring readers in the 19th century who considered themselves part of a literary elite. Philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes expressed this viewpoint in a series of enthusiastic articles published in the 1840s and 1850s. This theme continued later in the century with novelist Henry James, who referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as among \"the fine painters of life\".\n\nThe publication of James Edward Austen-Leigh's \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" in 1869 introduced Austen to a wider public as \"dear aunt Jane\", the respectable maiden aunt. Publication of the \"Memoir\" spurred the reissue of Austen's novels – the first popular editions were released in 1883 and fancy illustrated editions and collectors' sets quickly followed. Author and critic Leslie Stephen described the popular mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\". In 1878, the French critic Léon Boucher published the essay \"Le Roman Classique en Angleterre\", where he called Austen a \"genius\", which was the first time that epithet had been used in France to describe Austen. The first proper translation of Austen into French that was completely faithful to the original occurred in 1899 when Félix Fénéon translated \"Northanger Abbey\" into French as \"Catherine Moreland\". Around the start of the 20th century, members of the literary elite reacted against the popularisation of Austen. They referred to themselves as \"Janeites\" in order to distinguish themselves from the masses who did not properly understand her works. For example, Henry James responded negatively to what he described as \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's \"intrinsic merit and interest\". The American literary critic A. Walton Litz noted that the \"anti-Janites\" in the 19th and 20th centuries comprise a formidable literary squad of Mark Twain, Henry James, Charlotte Bronte, D.H. Lawrence and Kingsley Amis, but in \"every case the adverse judgement merely reveals the special limitations or eccentricities of the critic, leaving Jane Austen relativity untouched\".\n\nSeveral of Austen's works have been subject to academic study. The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883, by George Pellew, a student at Harvard University. The first examination came from a 1911 essay by Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley. In his essay, Bradley groups Austen's novels into \"early\" and \"late\" works, a distinction still used by scholars today. The first academic books devoted to Austen in France was \"Jane Austen\" by Paul and Kate Rague published in 1914, where the Ragues set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously. The same year, Léonie Villard published \"Jane Austen, Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres\", which was originally her PhD thesis, marking the first time that Austen had subjected to a serious academic study in France. The second examination in English was R. W. Chapman's 1923 edition of Austen's collected works. Not only was it the first scholarly edition of Austen's works, it was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works.\n\nWith the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles's \"Jane Austen and Her Art\", the academic study of Austen took hold. Lascelles's innovative work included an analysis of the books Austen read and the effect of her reading on her work, an extended analysis of Austen's style, and her \"narrative art\". Concern arose that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric, a debate that has continued since.\n\nThe period since World War II has seen more scholarship on Austen using a diversity of critical approaches, including feminist theory, and perhaps most controversially, postcolonial theory. The continuing disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern Janeites, and the academic appreciation of Austen has widened considerably. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Austen was in disfavor with the authorities who only wanted Western authors to be published in translation whose work could be presented as representing the West in a negative light, and Austen was regarded as too \"frivolous\" for this purpose. As hostile as the treatment of Austen was in the 1950s, it paled besides the treatment of her books during the \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\" in China between 1966–69, when Austen was banned as a \"British bourgeois imperialist\" author. In the late 1970s, Austen was allowed to be published in China, where her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people sometimes want to read books for enjoyment instead of dialectical purposes. A sign of the way that Austen can still spark debate can be seen when the American English professor Gene Koppel mentioned in a lecture that Austen and her family were \"Tories of the deepest dye\" [the Tories were the conservative party while the Whigs were the liberal party], a statement which greatly upset many of Koppel's liberal students, who much to his amusement, complained to him how was it possible that Austen was a conservative?. The conservative Koppel noted several feminist authors such as Claudia Johnson and Mollie Sandock were claiming Austen for their own cause. Citing the work of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Koppel argued that different people can and do react to the same work of literature in different ways as art is always a subjective discipline as various people have their standards for evaluating literature. As such, Koppel argued that competing interpretations of Austen's work, provided that they are grounded in readings of her work are all equally valid, and so it is equally possible to see Austen as a feminist critiquing Regency society and as a conservative upholding the values of Regency society.\n\nAusten's novels have resulted in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's \"Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance\", and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, \"The Bennets\" (1901). The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.\n\nFrom 1995 a large number of Austen adaptations began to appear, with Ang Lee's film of \"Sense and Sensibility\", for which screenwriter and star Emma Thompson won an Academy Award, and the BBC's immensely popular TV mini-series \"Pride and Prejudice\", starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. A 2005 British production of \"Pride and Prejudice\", directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, was followed in 2007 by ITV's \"Mansfield Park\", \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", and in 2016 by \"Love & Friendship\", a film version of \"Lady Susan\" that borrowed the title of Austen's \"Love and \" [sic].\n\nNovels\n\nUnfinished fiction\n\nOther works\n\nJuvenilia – Volume the First (1787–1793)\n\nJuvenilia – Volume the Second (1787–1793)\n\nJuvenilia – Volume the Third (1787–1793)\n\n\n",
                "Jane Austen in popular culture\n\nThe author Jane Austen, as well as her works, have been represented in popular culture in a variety of forms.\n\nJane Austen (16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist whose social commentary and masterly use of both free indirect speech and irony eventually made her one of the most influential and honoured novelists in English literature. In popular culture, Austen's novels and her personal life have been adapted into book illustration (starting in 1833), dramatizations (starting in 1895), Hollywood film (starting in 1940), television (starting in 1938), and professional theatre (starting in 1901), with adaptations varying greatly in their faithfulness to the original.\n\nBooks and scripts that use the general storyline of Austen's novels but change or otherwise modernise the story also became popular at the end of the 20th century. For example, \"Clueless\" (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of \"Emma\", which takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series, and furthermore near the beginning of the 21st century, nearly two centuries after her death, her works still inform popular culture and cosplay.\nRobert Irvine, a British scholar, wrote that the works of Austen remain a popular source for film makers, who eschew Austen's narrator, rendering a true adaptation impossible. Again, Austen's use of free indirect discourse, where the thoughts of the characters are summarized by the narrator, is generally not followed in the films. It is for this reason that many Austen scholars dislike the 1995 version of \"Sense and Sensibility\" because the absence of a narrator 'glorifies the romantic conventions that Austen deflates'. Likewise, for this reason, many Austen scholars approve of \"Clueless\", an adaptation of \"Emma\" set in a high school in Beverly Hills circa 1995, as the character of Cher Horowitz (the film's version of Emma Woodhouse) narrates several scenes. This is seen as the closest approximation of Austen's style in cinema yet done.\n\nIrvine commented that because cinema and books are different mediums that the best way of resolving this problem was and is for filmmakers to concentrate on the main strength of cinema, namely its visuality, as cinema can depict what the books can only ask the reader to imagine. A recurring image in Austen films is that of women gazing through a window to the outside world, or walking in the countryside. The critic Julianne Pidduck in her essay “Of Windows and Country Walks” argues the former image symbolizes repression and a woman’s lot in Regency England, being trapped in a patriarchal society while the latter image symbolises freedom. The critic Mary Favret in her 2000 essay “Being True to Jane Austen” argued that because film is literally just moving pictures it resists the tendency of photography to have a fixed image, suggesting a world where change is always possible. In this connection Favret praised the 1995 version of \"Persuasion\" as the film used a wandering camera to capture in a kaleidoscopic way Anne Eliot’s unexpressed romantic-sexual feelings even when Anne (Amanda Root) remains still and silent. Irvine noted film adaptations of Austen’s work often used the physicality of the actors to show the sexual desires of the characters that Austen herself only hinted at, with Irving calling a “particularly notorious” example of this being the scene from the 1995 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\", where Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) dives into a pond and emerges with wet clothes clinging to his body before a clearly interested Miss Bennet (Jennifer Ehle).\n\nThe emphasis on the physicality of the actors to express emotions together with abandonment of the narrator has divided critics. Rebecca Dickson has complained that “strong and self-sufficient Elinor” of \"Sense and Sensibility\" became “a girl woman with unexpressed emotions who must learn to demonstrate them” in the Ang Lee film. By contrast, Penny Gay praised the 1995 version of \"Sense and Sensibility\" for portraying “the characters’ experiences as \"bodies\"'” as offering up a filmic version of the experiences of women Irvine argued that the emphasis on physicality of the actors is necessary once the voice of the narrator is eliminated as films used movements, looks and gestures to express emotions, requiring “…that all characters become physically and transparently expressive in a way that only problem cases such as Marianne Dashwood indulge in the novels”. Cheryl Nixon defended Mr. Darcy’s precipitous plunge into the pond as necessary to show the viewer that he was capable of depths of emotional and physical passion that the novel only implied to help explain why Miss Bennet falls in love with him.\n\nAnother issue concerning adaptations of Austen is that of gender, especially the portrayal of women. Some critics, such as Devoney Looser, have argued that by portraying strong women who are intelligent and socially adept and by emphasising the theme of sisterhood both literally between sisters and metaphorically between female friends the Austen films become feminist films. Other critics such as Kristen Samuelian and Shannon Wooden have argued that Austen films are in fact “post-feminist” films where women first encounter patriarchy before going on to live happier ever after with the men of their dreams in the patriarchal society of Regency England. Wooden also argued the 1996 version of \"Emma\", \"Clueless\", \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Persuasion\" all use the food imagery of the Austen books, where a fasting is a form of female protest, but in contrast to the books “…juxtapose food with representations or discussions of physical beauty, making a very late twentieth-century connection between not eating and feminine social and sexual success”. Other critics like Martine Vioret have noted Austen films tended “to cater to female desires and to the female gaze” by their focus on the bodies of actors, dressed in close-fitting breeches in a way that fetishises the male body at a time when the male body was still the \"locus of the beautiful\". It is often noted that Austen films tended to portray the male body in a way that is normally associated with the filmic depiction of the female body as a source of pleasure to the male viewer. Irvine described the Austen films as a fantasy for women, with, for example, the character of Mr. Darcy displaying an \"absolute and unconditioned male need for a woman\".\n\nAnother issue around the Austen films is their relation to the question of English and British national identity. In Britain, the Austen films are seen as a part of the “heritage industry”-an overlapping collection of government ministries, pressure groups and charities that seeks to preserve the “national heritage” by protecting landscapes and old buildings. Irvine observed that the buildings selected for preservation tended to be estates, castles and manor houses associated with the elite, which sends the message that the story of Britain is the story of its elites. The Austen films which are focused on the visual splendor of Regency England are seen as “heritage films” that are an extension of the “heritage industry”. Prior to 1995, television adaptations of Austen tended to be done on the cheap, but the 1995 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" was an expensive production that was filmed on location in the English countryside with Lyme Park playing Pemberly that was a great ratings success, settling the benchmark for subsequent productions. Afterwards, it became \"de rigueur\" for Austen films to be visually sumptuous, no-expenses spared productions while the National Trust billed Lyme Park as the centerpiece of the “Pemberley Trail” for Janeites to go on a pilgrimage. Because the Austen adaptations are seen as celebrating a certain ideal of an “eternal England”, there is a tendency to see both the film and television productions as implicitly conservative productions glorifying the ordered society of Regency England.\n\nHowever, Irvine has cautioned against seeing all of the Austen films as carrying a conservative message Citing the Marxist historian Raphael Samuel, Irvine argued that Britain’s heritage belongs to everyone and the memory of the past is used by disadvantaged groups just as much by advantaged groups to construct an “useable” version of British history. For instance, many of the Austen films are seen as offering a feminist critique of patriarchy of the Regency period. The leftist historian Edward Neill praised the 1996 television version of \"Emma\" released on ITV as superior to the film version of \"Emma\" released by Miramax that same year. Neill pointed out that in the Hollywood version of \"Emma\" there are no servants while there are vast armies of servants in the background in the ITV version, many of them performing patently absurd tasks. Likewise, Neill noted that the poor are nowhere to be seen in the Hollywood version of \"Emma\" while in the ITV version there are all sorts of starving people in the background Another critic Roger Sales noted that \"frequent women in windows imaginary\" suggested that the country estates of the gentry and aristocracy were in fact “genteel prisons” for women, which Irvine argued was inconsistent with the claim that the Austen films were a conservative fantasy of a lost idyll of an ordered society. The 1999 version of \"Mansfield Park\" by the Canadian director Patricia Rozema gave Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor) dialogue from some of Austen’s especially acerbic letters, attacked Sir Thomas Bertram as a tyrant for owning slaves on his estate in Antigua and added in a quasi-lesbian scene not in the book where Mary Crawford waxes eloquent to Price about how only women can really understand the pleasures that their bodies can produce, which seems to be Crawford's way of trying to seduce Price. Irvine praised Rozema's version of \"Mansfield Park\" as a way that adaptions of Austen can be used to offer a critical picture of the society of Regency England where power was concentrated into the hands of upper-class men who belonged to the Church of England and some of whom owned slaves on plantations in the Caribbean.\n\nA particular issue for Austen adaptations is the way Austen has become a form of “cultural capital” for one to assert one’s social superiority. In this regard, Austen has become a “brand”, which is especially potent as the “Austen brand” has both high cultural connotations and mass appeal. Irvine commented that as painful as this may be to English professors like himself, at least part of the mass appeal of the Austen films today is due to a “perceived continuity” between Austen’s novels and the modern “bodice rippers”; historical pulp novels published by such companies as Silhouette, Harlequin and Mills and Boon. A recurring complaint made by critics concerns the “harlequinization” of Austen on the silver screen, which is seen as cheapening and dumbing down Austen for a mass audience. However, Irvine noted that in Austen’s own lifetime, her work was popular, but seen as low culture, being lumped in at British libraries together with “popular fiction” books that were the ancestors of the Harlequin romances. The idea that Austen was a high culture writer only started later, and certainly the appeal of the Austen films to many today seems to be that they are seen as a high culture version of Harlequin romances. Andrew Davies, the producer who has made a career of adopting Austen for film, has confessed as much to the charge of “harlequinization”, saying he liked \"a bit of bodice-rippling\" when he turned Austen's books into films. The American critic Dianne F. Sadoff wrote disapproving of Davies's efforts to add in the scenes that he asserts that \"Austen couldn't write\" but claims that she wanted to write. Sadoff took issue with the 2007 version of \"Northanger Abbey\" in which Davies added scenes of Catherine Moreland imagining being kidnapped and subjected to semi-consensual sado-masochistic sex, and the 2008 version of \"Sense and Sensibility\" which begins with a seduction scene mentioned as only happening a long time ago in the novel.\n\nA testament to the appeal of the Austen films is that the most lucrative market for these films today is the United States, not the United Kingdom. On 3 August 2007, the debut of \"Becoming Jane\" took in almost $1 million US in its first weekend, low compared to \"Superbad\" which took $31 million US in its opening weekend the following week, but a highly respectable showing for a heritage film set in Regency England and starring a mostly British cast unfamiliar to American audiences. \"Becoming Jane\" ran for ten weeks in the United States and ultimately took in a profit of $19 million US. The American scholar Dianne Sadoff wrote that Hollywood likes Austen film adaptions because Hollywood producers love films with an audience that exists in advance, and as millions of people have read Austen's novels all over the world, making Austen films into the most desirable of films, the \"premier pre-sold product\". Furthermore, Sadoff noted that Austen films are popular with a female audience that ranges in age from teenage girls to middle-aged women, instead of appealing to a narrow demographic. Sadoff wrote the most recent adaptions of Austen were done in a way that was calculated to appeal to young women. Sadoff used as examples the 2005 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Keira Knightley, which brought \"swashbuckler girlfriend sex appeal and postfeminist agency\" to Austen, and \"Becoming Jane\" starring Anne Hathaway, which presented Austen as a modern career woman who just happened to be living in Georgian England. Sadoff wrote that both films have heroines with \"...bared chests and swelling cleavage above Regency gown decolletage\", perfectly \"coiled hair\" and looks of \"wide-eyed intensity\" that were meant both to arouse teenage boys and excite envy in teenage girls.\n\nAt least part of appeal of Austen films in the modern United States is that they deal directly with the subject of class, which American filmmakers generally prefer to avoid. Americans like to see their nation as a meritocracy where everyone regardless of their skin color, sex, and income level is completely equal with exactly the same opportunities in life regardless of who they are, and the suggestion that some Americans might be disadvantaged because of their race, sex and/or income level is a painful one, implying their nation is not living up to its ideals. American filmmakers often avoid confronting the subject of class especially; by contrast the Austen films set in Regency England are far away enough both in time and in geography to raise the subject of class without imposing discomfort on an American audience. Likewise, in Georgian Britain, the only roles possible for a woman in polite society were those of a wife and mother, which means that Austen films can deal starkly with sexism in ways that films set in contemporary times often do not. Irvine noted in \"Clueless\", the characters are only concerned with being “cool”, as there is almost no suggestion in the film of any class, racial and sexual barriers in southern California, circa 1995, as the only social line that matters is the one between \"cool\" and \"uncool\". Only with the minor character of the put-upon El Salvadoran maid who works for the Horowitz family, whom Cher keeps calling a \"Mexican\", does \"Clueless\" imply that there might be some inequality in modern America. However, Irvine noted that American audiences cannot entirely embrace the social hierarchy of Georgian England, based as it was on land and birth, and instead the 1996 version of \"Emma\" offered up a hierarchy based on consumption and luxury conferred by access to cash, in short a society very much like the modern United States. \n\nOne of the few American Austen films to confront class directly in a modern settling was the 1990 film \"Metropolitan\" by the American director Whit Stillman, where a group of wealthy “old money” New Yorkers talk openly about how Austen is part of their “cultural capital” that sets them apart from vulgar “new money”. \"Metropolitan\" is a very loose adaption of \"Mansfield Park\", reset in New York, circa 1989. A particular point \"Metropolitan\" made was how Austen by the 1980s had become part of the “cultural capital” of the “old money” Anglophile East Coast elite that they used to distinguish themselves from people like Donald Trump, with one character approvingly quoting Lionel Trilling's remark that \"not to like Jane Austen is to put oneself under suspicion...of a want of breeding\". Irvine argued that Austen offers a particular appeal to American conservatives in that the sort of ordered society that they used to openly admire and were nostalgic for, namely that of the South up to 1865, is now racially unacceptable to admire given that the antebellum Southern economy was based on slavery. Irvine noted that both the 1935 book and the 1939 film of \"Gone With The Wind\" were extremely popular at the time, but today are rather controversial given the way that both versions of \"Gone With The Wind\" glorify a society based on slavery and white supremacy. \"Gone With The Wind\" was inspired at least in concept by D. W. Griffith's 1915 film \"The Birth of a Nation\", which in its turn was based on the violently racist 1905 novel \"\" by Thomas Dixon Jr.. Margaret Mitchell, the author of \"Gone With The Wind\" was greatly influenced by Dixon's novels, which misrepresented the Reconstruction era as a nightmarish time where blacks, not longer slaves, ran amok raping and murdering white women with impunity, and openly admitted that \"Gone With The Wind\" would not had been possible without Dixon's books, all of which she had read. Irvine noted that the 1940 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" released by MGM moved the story from Regency England to Victorian times to make it seem similar to \"Gone With The Wind\", and the film was marketed at the time as an epic 19th century love story analogous to \"Gone With The Wind\". There were no slaves in late Georgian Britain (Lord Justice Mansfield declared slavery illegal in the United Kingdom in 1772)-through slavery was the basis of the economies of the British West Indian colonies until 1833-making Regency England a more acceptable ordered society to be nostalgic for in modern America. Irvine however cautioned that one “should not be too quick to attribute the success of the Austen adaptations in the US to an implicitly racist Anglophila”. Irvine argued that the success of Austen in America was due to the way she could be presented as offering “cultural capital” to those who were and are willing to take the time to read her novels, and to a nostalgia for the perceived better and simpler times of Regency England.\n\nAusten is generally very popular across Asia, not just in South Asia. \n\nThe global appeal of Austen today can be seen in that Bollywood regularly produces versions of Austen's books reset in modern India and adjusted to the style of Indian films, which forbid kissing and always include a number of musical numbers regardless of whether they have any connection to the plot. Austen's books often feature match-making parents, which gives her stories a particular resonance in India, where the majority of marriages are still arranged today. The British colony of India, which was ruled by the East India Company until 1858, and as a Crown colony from 1858 to 1947, came to include all of modern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. English as an academic discipline began in 19th century India as British officials of the Raj set out to teach English to their Indian subjects, and as a result, any middle-class Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi from the time of the Raj until the present is familiar with Austen's books, giving her books the sort of \"cultural capital\" appeal in modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh similar to the United States. Austen's stories which feature \"love marriages\" as the heroine marries a man with whom she falls in love with, and gains the approval of her parents in the process, are very popular with women from middle-class Indian families, the vast majority of whom are in or are destined for arranged marriages set up by their parents to men that they generally don't know. In India, \"Sense and Sensibility\" has turned into the 2000 Tamil language film \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" and the 2014 Hindi language soap opera \"Kumkum Bhagya\"; \"Emma\" has adopted as the 2010 film \"Aisha\"; and \"Pride and Prejudice\" into the 2004 film \"Bride and Prejudice\". In \"Bride and Prejudice\", Elizabeth Bennet becomes Lalita Bakshi (Aishwarya Rai), the daughter of a Sikh grandee living in a decaying mansion left over by the Raj in Amritsar; Mr. Darcy is an American billionaire visiting the Punjab to attend a wedding; Mr. Bingley becomes Mr. Balraj, a second generation Indo-British lawyer who has come to the Punjab in search of a traditional Sikh woman to marry; Lieutenant Wickham becomes Johnny Wickham, a British backpacker looking for the \"real India\"; and Mr. Collins becomes Mr. Kholi, a sanctimonious Sikh who has made a fortune in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe largest market for Austen's books are in India and Pakistan, where the themes of \"marrying off\" young women to rid families of the burdens of supporting them, the importance of the family as a social unit, dowries as a factor in marriage negotiations and inheritance laws that favor males all address issues that are relevant in both India and Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan have large Austen societies with the Pakistani Austen Society hosting events for \"Jovial Janeites” that feature “Austentatious tea parties” and “chai and chatter”. Laaleen Khan, the founder of the Jane Austen Society of Pakistan, told \"The Economist\" that Austen is relevant in the Indian subcontinent because society in South Asia is full of “disapproving Lady Catherine de Bourgh-esque society aunties, rakish Wickhams and Willoughbys, pretentious Mrs Eltons and holier-than thou Mr Collins types”. \n\nAusten was unknown in Japan until the Meiji Restoration of 1867 opened Japan up to Western influence, and even then Austen was largely ignored. Japanese translators preferred adventure stories from the West, which fitted in better with the stories of samurai, which were the most popular novels in Meiji Japan. The Greek/Irish scholar Lafcadio Hearn, who became the first Western scholar to teach in Japan, warned his Japanese students in his lectures that they would not like Austen, as the sort of violence which was normal in samurai stories was completely absent in Austen's novels. The first Japanese critic to draw attention to Austen was the influential writer Natsume Sōseki who in his 1907 book \"A Theory of Literature\" wrote that: “Anyone who is unable to appreciate Austen will be unable to understand the beauty of realism.” Sōseki, who was fluent in English, lived in London from 1900 to 1903, where he first discovered Austen, who he regarded as having achieved his ideal of \"sokuten kyoshi\" (literally “follow Heaven, forsake the self”-a writer should follow his/her instincts and write stories that have no traces of their own personality in them). At the time of his death in 1916, Sōseki was writing a novel \"Meian\" (\"Light and Darkness\"), which reset \"Pride and Prejudice\" in Taishō era Japan. Unlike \"Pride and Prejudice\", the couple Tsuda and O-Nobu are already married at the beginning of the novel, and Sōseki traced how pride and prejudice was pushing their marriage apart rather than be an obstacle to be overcome as Mr. Darcy courted Elizabeth Bennet in Austen's story. Sōseki followed Austen in using everyday life and apparently banal conversations to trace how the mutual pride of Tsuda and O-Nobu push them apart despite the fact that they both love each other.\n\nAusten was first translated into Japanese in 1926 when Nogami Toyoichirō and his wife Nogami Yaeko translated \"Pride and Prejudice\". Nogami Yaeko liked Austen so much that she published a novel in 1928, \"Machiko\", set in Taishō era Japan, that featured the heroine Machiko who was inspired by Elizabeth Bennet. \"Machiko\" also features a radical named Seki who resembles Wickham who castigates the social order imposed by the \"kokutai\" and whom Machiko almost marries until she learns that he impregnated her friend Yoneko whom he was seeing at the same time that he was courting her. The hero of the book is Kawai, an archeologist and the wealthy heir to the Kawai Financial Group, who makes a determined pursuit of Machiko despite her repeated rejections of him on both social and political grounds, and finally proves himself worthy of her by giving up his fortune to help out the impoverished and striking workers at a factory his family owes. Unlike \"Pride and Prejudice\" where the war with France only exists in the background, \"Machiko\" deals directly with turmoil of Taishō era Japan where strikes were frequent, much of the younger \"intelligentsia\" were questioning the \"kokutai\" and admired the Russian Revolution, and the police waged a vigorous campaign against those accused of \"thought crimes\". In 1925, the Imperial Diet passed the Peace Preservation Law, which made the very act of thinking about \"altering the \"kokutai\"\" a crime; the specific thoughts that were made illegal were republicanism, pacifism, and advocating the end of private property. Those found by the police to be thinking these forbidden thoughts served lengthy prison sentences and were subjected to \"Tenkō\" (\"changing direction\"), a process of brain-washing where left-wing activists were brain-washed to worship the Emperor as a living god. In \"Machiko\", which was published at a time when censorship was much less stricter in Japan is set in the midst of these struggles as Machiko and her fellow activists are constantly having to avoid the police. At same time, Nogami attacked the double standard of male radicals who preached justice for the masses, but refused to treat women as equals, seeing the duty of female radicals just to be their obliging bedmates, and nothing more. In \"Pride and Prejudice\", Wickham marries Lydia Bennet, which makes him part of the family so Elizabeth Bennet has to be civil to him, while in \"Machiko\", Machiko repudiates Seki outright, saying his dishonesty and his contempt for women makes him unworthy of her.\n\nAusten went out of favor in Japan during the militarist period in the early Showa era (1931-1945) when a xenophobic, ultra-nationalist mood prevailed, and the government discouraged people from reading foreign books. But during the period of the American occupation (1945-52), almost every Austen book was translated into Japanese except \"Mansfield Park\" (which was not translated until 1978), and Austen started to be widely taught in Japanese high schools. The translation of \"Sense and Sensibility\" in 1947, followed by a translation of \"Pride and Prejudice\" in 1950 were published by the prestigious publishing house Iwanami Shoten, and both books sold very well. The success of the Iwanami versions of \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\" was the moment that Austen became respectable in Japan. In 1963, the critic Yamamoto Kenkichi, in his essay “The Smile of \"Pride and Prejudice\"” that proved to be influential, criticized Japanese literature for being overtly solemn and praised Austen for her “natural ease”, which led him to conclude: “Collins, Wickham, Mrs. Bennet, Lady Catherine, how she turns her laughter on these minor characters. They are observed with some malice, certainly, but in a pleasant, mischievous, irreverent manner which ultimately accords salvation to even these fools”. Austen has been regarded as a major writer in Japan since the 1950s, and in 2007, the Jane Austen Society of Japan was founded to provide a space for Japanese Janeites. In 2015-2016, \"manga\" versions of \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"Emma\", and \"Sense and Sensibility\" were published in Japan.\n\nA Japanese writer very much influenced by Austen was Yumiko Kurahashi. In her 1971 novel \"Yume no ukihashi\" (\"The Bridge of Dreams\"), the heroine Keiko is a graduate student working on a thesis concerning Austen's books, an interest that paralleled the author's as \"Yume no ukihashi\" is in many ways a resetting of an Austen novel in modern Japan. However, the climax of the novel where Keiko learns that parents of her boyfriend Kōichi and her parents have been engaged in a four-sided sexual relationship for many years, and Kōichi might very well be her brother, is unlike of the denouements of any of Austen's books. The Japanese scholar Ebine Hiroshi described \"Yume no ukihashi\" as a fusion between an Austen novel and the fascination with breaking sexual taboos like incest which often characterizes Japanese literature. Even after learning that Kōichi is quite possibly her brother, Keiko cannot give him up as their souls have crossed the \"bridge of dreams\" to “the other side of the world” where they have been fused together, which leads her despite being married to another man to engage a \"ménage à quatre\" with Kōichi and his wife; the novel ends with Keiko meeting Kōichi in Kyoto while her husband calls her to say he is spending the night with Kōichi's wife. Hiroshi wrote in \"Yume no ukihashi\" Kurahashi created a heroine, Keiko, who is a many ways an Austen heroine with her quiet nature and calm dignity that hides a passionate, romantic side while at the same time the book was concerned with the mystical \"other side\", a supernatural world of power, mystery and dread that can only be glimpsed which co-exists alongside our world, a uniquely Japanese concern that would have been alien to Austen.\n\nIn Turkey Austen was first introduced at the so-called \"foreign schools\" for foreigners domiciled in the Ottoman Empire, in which Turks were also allowed to enroll in the late 19th century. Initially, Turks only read Austen in the English original, and the first novel to be translated into Turkish was \"Sense and Sensibility\" as \"Sağduyu ve Duyarlık\" in two volumes in 1946 and 1948. Austen first came to widespread notice in Turkey in the late 1960s when Nihal Yeğinobalı started translating Austen with her first translation being \"Pride and Prejudice\" as \"Aşk ve Gurur\" (\"Love and Pride\"). Yeğinobalı's translations of Austen removed much of the irony in the original, replaced the free indirect discourse with speeches by the characters and made changes to the plot and characters to make Austen fit into the style of popular Turkish romances. Yeğinobalı's translations are the ones by which Austen is best known in Turkey. The Turkish scholar Rana Tekcan wrote that Yeğinobalı was not particularly faithful to Austen, but it is very difficult to translate English novels into Turkish as in the Turkish language the predicate always comes at the end of a sentence, which is not the case in English. It was not 2006 that Austen was first translated properly into Turkish when \"Pride and Prejudice\" was translated as \"Gurur ve Önyargı\" by Hamdi Koç, who at present is engaged in translating the rest of Austen's novels into Turkish. \"Gurur ve Önyargı\" sold out in its first year, and a second edition was issued in 2007, which Tekcan used to argue that many Turks wanted a proper version of Austen in their own language. Austen's status in modern Turkey can be seen in the Wikipedia-like website \"Ekşi Sözlük\" (\"The Sourtimes Dictionary\"), when anonymous contributors write articles on various subjects; typing Jane Austen on the \"Ekşisözlük\" produces comments such as “Jane Austen is for those who are ashamed to read romance novels”and “The characters that Jane Austen created still live in the likes of a neighbor who is dying to get her daughters married to rich men.”.\n\nSuch is the appeal of Austen in Asia that during the period when Korea was a Japanese colony (1905-1945) Austen was first translated into Korean as the Japanese colonial administration- which always justified itself on the grounds that Korea was hopelessly backward and in need of Japanese rule to progress- sought to use Austen's books as an example of the sort of cultural progress the country was experiencing under Japanese rule. It should be noted that in Asia during this period, books by Western authors were always seen as embodying modernity and progress, and thus Austen in colonial Korea was presented as a symbol of modernity, at least during the so-called \"Cultural Rule\" period (1920-37) when Japanese rule was more moderate as compared to prior and succeeding periods. The South Korean writer Park Wansuh wrote two novels influenced by \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"A Faltering Afternoon\" (1977) and \"Pride and Fantasy\" (1980) both set in Yusin era South Korea. In \"A Faltering Afternoon\", three sisters from a lower middle-class background who resemble Elizabeth, Jane and Lydia Bennet respectively find that their only hope of social-economic success comes with marrying the right men. Unlike \"Pride and Prejudice\", two of the Ho sisters' relationships end unhappily and only Ho Malhi, the sister who resembles Elizabeth Bennet, ends up well with her choice of a man. Hŏ Sŏng, the once successful small businessman who was now struggling as the \"chaebol\" came to dominate the South Korean economy in the 1970s, resembled Mr. Bennet as he watches his daughters' \"quest\" to find the ideal husband, through unlike him, Hŏ ends up committing suicide on the day of his daughter's wedding. In \"Pride and Fantasy\", Park took on one of the most painful subjects in South Korea at the time, namely the fact that the \"Chinilpa\" elite who had served Japan in the colonial period was the same elite that ruled South Korea in the 1970s. General Park Chung-hee, the military dictator of South Korea from 1961 until his assassination in 1979, had started his career as an officer in the Manchukuo Army and served with the Kwantung Army in its campaigns to \"pacify\" Manchukuo. During Park's rule, he applied the same methods he learned in Japanese service to his own people, and in the 1960s-70s, South Korea was one of the world's worst human rights abusers. \"Pride and Fantasy\" concerns the relationship between two men, one of whom is a male version of Elizabeth Bennet, and the other whom resembles Mr. Darcy. The Bennet-like Namsang came from a family that resisted Japanese rule and were ruined as a result while the Darcy-like Hyǒn comes from a \"chinilpa\" family that became fabulously rich by collaborating with the Japanese. \n\nThe character of Elizabeth Bennet with her stubborn individualism and nonconformity with social norms was popular in South Korea during the stifling rule of General Park, at least in part as a reaction to his attempts to crush individualism and promote conformity. However, the South Korean scholar Park You-me noted that for a certain generation of Korean Janeites like her mother, who lived through the years 1937-45, when the Japanese state tried to stamp out the Korean language and culture, mobilized society for total war, and forced thousands of Korean young women into the \"comfort women corps\", turning women's bodies literally into commodities to be exploited, leading to a situation where :\"My mother's suspicion of Austen's moral authority is representative of Korean female readers' reception of Austen's novels following the Japanese occupation of Korea and the Korean War\". Park wrote that as much as her mother loved Austen that she always regarded Austen's novels as fantasy works, depicting a world that had never existed and could never exist ever, as it was the fate of women to be exploited and abused. In 2014, the highest rated TV series in South Korea was \"Omangwa Pyungyeon\" (\"Lawless World\"), a resettling of \"Pride and Prejudice\" in modern South Korea in a prosecutor's office. \"Omangwa Pyungyeon\" which aired between October 2014-January 2015 concerned a relationship between a passionate novice prosecutor and her more experienced and snooty colleague. Beyond the specific adaptions, many critics have noted that the heroes of Korean soap operas owe much to Mr. Darcy.\n\nThe Iranian writer Azar Nafisi recalled teaching Austen secretly in Iran in the 1990s (in the Islamic Republic of Iran Austen is banned as a \"degenerate\" Western writer) to a group of teenage girls who loved Austen's stories which feature women who fall in love with men who are worthy of their affections, which was so different from their own lives. Nafisi noted in the Islamic Republic of Iran where wife-beating is legal, \"love is forbidden, banished from the public sphere\" and sex is \"violently suppressed\", her students fell in love with an author whose books feature female \"rebels\" who defiantly say \"no\" to \"silly mothers\", \"incompetent fathers\" and a \"rigidly orthodox society\", and moreover get away with it. An American academic who went on \"Radio Times\" web broadcast to talk about Austen recalled being besieged with callers of an Asian background. One Iranian woman, living in the United States, called in to say she had first read Austen after her teenage daughter brought home \"Sense and Sensibility\", which made her cry as she had experienced nothing like this in her own culture, where dating is forbidden and marriages are arranged. Another caller was a Chinese woman whose first Austen book was \"Pride and Prejudice\", which she read in translation after the ban in China on Austen had been lifted after the end of the Cultural Revolution, saying she nothing read anything so moving and romantic before. The Chinese woman added after seeing all of the violence and horror of the Cultural Revolution when the streets of China were soaked with human blood, so many lives were ruined, and so many had behaved so badly that reading \"Pride and Prejudice\" she gave her hope in humanity again.\n\nThe novels of Jane Austen were unknown in China until 1917 when Wei Yi mentioned Austen in her book \"Brief Profiles of Famous Western Novelists\" where she was described as \"one of the celebrated English novelists\". Only a few western novels were translated in China during the 19th century, and it was not until 1898 when Lin Shu translated \"Camille\" by Alexandre Dumas, which unexpectedly become a bestseller, that Chinese publishers became interested in western books. Austen was first translated into Chinese in 1935, when two editions of \"Pride and Prejudice\" were published in Beijing and Shanghai. After 1949 Austen was out of favor in the People's Republic of China as a \"bourgeois\" author whose work was considered frivolous. In the 1950s most of the foreign books published in the People's Republic were translations of Soviet books, and Western authors were only translated into Chinese if they were \"revolutionary\" writers like Lord Byron or if their books portrayed Western societies in an unflattering light like Charles Dickens; Austen did not serve either purpose very well. In 1956, Austen was first translated in the People's Republic when \"Pride and Prejudice\" was published in Beijing, with an introduction by the translator explaining how the translation was justified on Marxist grounds as the novel showed the decline of feudalism and rise of capitalism in England. In 1965 Dong Hengxun, an academic, condemned Austen in an article titled \"The Description of Love in \"Pride and Prejudice\"\" in the \"Guangming Daily\" as \"artistically insignificant\". Austen was banned along with other Western authors in China during the Cultural Revolution and during the 1980s, translations of Austen were grudgingly allowed, though officially Austen remained out of favor. The first Chinese academic in the People's Republic to write favorably of Austen was Zhu Hong, who complained in his 1986 essay \"The Pride and Prejudice against Jane Austen\" that ordinary people liked Austen well enough, but academics had to condemn her because of the Party line, which led him to ask for books to be judged on artistic grounds only. In the 1990s Communist Party condemnations of Austen ceased, and a number of Chinese students produced dissertations on Austen, with Austen being very popular with female students. In 2011 one Chinese academic, Zhang Helong, wrote about Austen's \"huge popularity\" in modern China. In 2017, \"The Economist\" noted that in China: \"... Austen is seen as having a particular affinity with Chinese culture, where “manners matter” as they did in Georgian England.\" \"Pride and Prejudice\" has been translated into Chinese at least 50 times while \"Sense and Sensibility\" has been translated 10 times in the last decades. Austen's ideal hero as a property-owning gentleman has resonance in China, where a well-off man with good education and manners who owes land is the considered the ideal man. In 2010, Sadoff wrote that the growing appeal of Austen in Asia ensures that market for Austen films continues to grow, and it is possible Asia would soon replace the United States as the largest market for Austen films, if it has not already done so.\n\nIn the United States, Austen was described in 2013 as the object of \"wildly devotional fan-worship\" with conventions, parties and fan fiction. One American Janeite, Myretta Robens, was quoted to a BBC reporter as saying: \"There's a longing for the elegance of the time. It's an escape.\" When asked why so many American Janeites write fan fiction, Robens stated: \"Quite frankly, I think a lot of people want more sex, particularly with Elizabeth and Darcy.\" Another American Janeite, Laurel Ann Nattress explained the appeal of Austen fan fiction in the U.S. as: \"People just love her characters and they don't want to give them up.\" Nattress argued that the popularity of Austen in America was due mostly to a strong Anglophile streak in America, saying: \"I think that we look back to the motherland in many respects. Look at the incredible impact \"Downton Abbey\" has had over here. It's a perfect example of how America is fascinated by British culture.\" Robbens explained to a BBC reporter the mostly female readership of Austen in America; \"It's women, in general, who fall in love with them. It's a truth universally acknowledged that women want to read about relationships.\"\n\nMore recently, Austen has been appropriated by the Alt-right with the American scholar Nicole Wright writing that the alt-right is obsessed with Austen variously as: \"... 1) symbol of sexual purity; 2) standard-bearer of a vanished white traditional culture; and 3) exception that proves the rule of female inferiority.\" Wright wrote many of the alt-right leaders who paraphrased Austen like Milo Yiannopoulos do not know much about her, noting that Yiannupoulos called Austen a \"Victorian\" writer. In a speech, Yiannupoulos had said: \"As a Victorian novelist might have put it, it is a truth universally acknowledged that an ugly woman is far more likely to be a feminist than a hot one.\" Wright wrote that the alt-right used Austen as a way of trying to make themselves seem more wholesome, writing:\"By comparing their movement not to the nightmare Germany of Hitler and Goebbels, but instead to the cozy England of Austen — a much-beloved author with a centuries-long fandom and an unebbing academic following — the alt-right normalizes itself in the eyes of ordinary people. It also subtly panders to the nostalgia of the Brexiters, with their vision of a better, bygone Britain. Such references nudge readers who happen upon alt-right sites to think that perhaps white supremacists aren’t so different from mainstream folks.<br>But these men are distorting Austen’s work; her novels are hardly blueprints for an \"ethnostate.\" Instead, they serve as antidotes against the strategies used by the alt-right movement. After all, Austen’s heroines come to distrust men who beguile others through charismatic bluster and expedient lying (Exhibit A: Willoughby). Indeed, Austen inoculates her readers against trusting the autocrats cheered by the alt-right: her female characters come to regret taking up with coarse men (such as Rushworth in \"Mansfield Park\") who are propped up by inherited wealth that initially dazzles those around them, but which cannot compensate for astonishing ignorance, flouting of decorum, and lack of empathy. Marianne and Maria learn those life lessons the hard way, but they do learn in the end, and they eventually abandon the duplicitous grifters and foolish scions. May it be so with us, and may we never see a day with alt-right \"post-truths\" universally acknowledged.\" One American scholar, Elaine Bander, expressed considerable annoyance about the appropriation of Austen by the alt-right, writing: \"No one who reads Jane Austen’s words with any attention and reflection can possibly be alt-right. All the Janeites I know are rational, compassionate, liberal-minded people.\" The American journalist Jennifer Schuessler reported this appropriation of Austen is very common, citing the remarks of a graduate student Tracey Hutchings-Goetz, who was surprised to see the Wikipedia article about \"Pride and Prejudice\" describe the novel as celebrating traditional marriage supported by citations to an on-line article from the conservative Catholic magazine \"Crisis\", saying to Schuessler: \"It was a version of the novel that didn’t make any sense to us as scholars, supported by a completely unscholarly source\".\n\nThe American author Amy Elizabeth Smart visited several Latin American countries in 2011 to see where Austen stood in that part of the world. Smart was at first concerned that a British author like Austen would not be popular in Guatemala, where most of the people are Maya Indians. But she found Austen fitted in well with the Maya, intensely family-oriented people who criticized her for not taking her own family with her to Guatemala, saying how could she possibly leave her parents behind in America. Smart discovered that Austen's picture of close-knit families in the English countryside was to the Maya comparable to their own existence in the Guatemalan countryside. When Smart asked her Guatemalan students if the story of \"Pride and Prejudice\" could take place in modern Guatemala, the unanimous answer was yes. Smart found her Guatemalan students related to \"Pride and Prejudice\" better than her American students as the general expectation in Guatemala is that a woman should be married by her early twenties, just as was the case in Regency England, whereas her American students have trouble understanding why Elizabeth Bennet was risking social disgrace by turning down two marriage proposals. Moreover, Smart's Guatemalan students found the subject of class prejudices in Regency England more compelling than her American students, with many also saying racial prejudices against the Maya by Guatemala's \"Criollo\" elite made them relate to Elizabeth Bennet's struggle for acceptance from the Hertfordshire elite. Smart reported class discussions in the United States about \"Pride and Prejudice\" did not automatically lead to the subject of racism while in Guatemala, her students always brought up the racism against the Maya when discussing Miss Bennet's struggle against the gentry and aristocracy of Hertfordshire. By contrast, in Paraguay, where the majority of the population are Guaraní Indians, Smart discovered that hardly anyone knew who Austen was, and much of her class was indifferent to the books. Smart suggested that the War of the Triple Alliance, which wiped out most of the Paraguayan population between 1864-70 with Paraguay going from 1 million to 200, 000 people, had left a grim, death-obsessed mentality in Paraguay where the macabre was celebrated and where Austen simply could not fit into.\n\nIn Mexico, where Smart asked a group of local women in Puerto Vallarta if the plot of \"Sense and Sensibility\" had any relevance in modern Mexico, she was told by one woman: \"No, the book's really relevant...Things then, in her country, are just the same way here and now. Look at Willoughby, taking advantage of women. Men here do that all the time. And Marianne, marrying more for the sake of being married than for being in love. Women are here are afraid to be single. It is very hard\". In Ecuador, Smart discovered that Ecuadoran men all detested the character of Mr. Darcy with one man telling her Darcy deserved \"\"Es de matarlo a palos\"\" (\"to be beaten to death with a stick\") while Ecuadoran women were much more fond of the character, saying he did not deserved to be beaten to death with a stick as their menfolk were insisting upon. The Ecuadorans tended to regard Austen as more of a fantasy writer, describing life in Regency England that was simply inconceivable in modern Ecuador, with one reader of \"Pride and Prejudice\" telling Smart that none of the characters from that book would last a day in Guayaquil.\n\nIn 2007, Anne Hathaway starred as Austen in \"Becoming Jane.\" Based on the biography \"Becoming Jane Austen\" by Jon Hunter Spence, the film centred on Jane Austen's early life, her development as an author, and the posited romantic relationship with Thomas Langlois Lefroy (James McAvoy).\n\n\"Miss Austen Regrets\", a television film starring Olivia Williams as Jane Austen, was released in the same year. Based on Austen's surviving letters, the semi-biographical television movie focused on the last few years of Jane Austen's life as she looked back on her life and loves and helped her favourite niece, Fanny Knight (Imogen Poots), find a husband.\n\n\"JANE, the musical\" debuted in June 2006 in the West Midlands, England. It is a West-End style musical theatre production based on the life of Jane Austen. The musical, directed by Geetika Lizardi, focuses on Austen as a modern heroine, a woman who chose art and integrity over the security of a loveless marriage.\n\nJane Austen features as an amateur sleuth in Stephanie Barron's Jane Austen series of historical mystery novels.\n\nKate Beaton, cartoonist of webcomic \"Hark! A Vagrant\", devoted one of her comic strips to Jane Austen.\n\nJane Austen (voiced by Eden Riegel) is revealed as the narrator of 2013's \"Saints Row IV\" in a bonus cutscene, and the game's antagonist Zinyak reads the first chapter of \"Pride and Prejudice\" on an in-game radio station. Both the protagonist (the leader of the 3rd Street Saints) and the game alien antagonist Zinyak are depicted as fans of Austen's work. She appears as a figure in \"How the Saints Save Christmas\" DLC and Saints Row IV standalone expansion, \"\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"None\"\n\n\nIn 1994, American literary critic Harold Bloom placed Austen among the greatest . In a 2002 poll to determine whom the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Austen was ranked number 70 in the list of the \"100 Greatest Britons\". In 2003, Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\" came second in the BBC's The Big Read, a national poll to find the \"Nation's best-loved book.\"\n\nIn 2007, the article \"Rejecting Jane\" by British author David Lassman, which examined how Austen would fare in the modern day publishing industry, achieved worldwide attention when Austen's work—submitted under a pseudonym—was rejected by numerous publishers.\n\nAusten's writing was the inspiration for the 2013 video game \"Regency Love\", a visual novel in which the player interacts with townspeople, friends, family, and potential suitors, looking for a suitable match. The game includes storylines inspired by Austen's writing style, as well as trivia questions about Austen's work.\n\n\n"

                "Im Tirtzu\n\nIm Tirtzu (Hebrew: אם תרצו, lit. 'If you will it') is a Zionist non-governmental organization based in Israel. Its name is derived from an epigraph appended to the frontespiece of Theodor Herzl's novel Altneuland, 'if you wish it, it is no fairy-tale,' rendered into modern Hebrew in Nahum Sokolow's translation in 1903, as \"Im tirtzu ein zo agadah.\" (\"If you will it, it is no dream.\")\n\nOn its establishment in 2006, the organization stated that its mission was to renew \"Zionist discourse, Zionist thinking and Zionist ideology to ensure the future of the Jewish nation and the State of Israel.\" Claiming to \"strengthen and advance the values of Zionism in Israel\", it sees itself as dedicated to combating a \"campaign of de-legitimization against the State of Israel and to [provide] responses to Post-Zionist and Anti-Zionist phenomena\". Im Tirtzu is mostly known for its campaigns against the New Israel Fund, foreign government-funded NGOs, and alleged bias in the curricula of Israeli universities.\nAccording to critics, Im Tirtzu's strategies focus on delegitimizing Israeli left and human-rights groups and driving a wedge between them and their funding sources.\n\nIm Tirtzu operates fifteen branches at universities and colleges throughout the country and runs the largest Zionist academic extra-curricular program in Israel. \nSome have maintained that Im Tirtzu bears similarities to fascist groups, and others have labelled it an important Zionist movement. Im Tirtzu has received wide support from the Israeli government.\n\nIn 2008, Im Tirtzu published a report about the syllabuses used in various academic departments in Israel. According to the report, authors who reject the notion of nationality, or support anti-Zionist views, get much more exposure in reading lists. In 2010, Im Tirtzu sent Rivka Karmi, the head of the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev a letter, demanding that the university stop the anti-Zionist bias in its Department of Politics and Government. The letter alleged that 9 out of 11 professors in the department were involved in extreme left-wing activities (among others, attempting to persuade other countries to join the academic boycott of Israel). Im Tirtzu threatened to notify the donors of the university if the problem was not rectified.\n\nIn a joint statement about the above campaign, the heads of Israel's seven leading universities urged condemnation of what they called Im Tirtzu's \"dangerous attempt to create a thought police\". Im Tirtzu responded, \"All Im Tirtzu asked from BGU is that a solution be found to the extreme bias found in the Political Science department, where only post-Zionist opinions are presented.\"\n\nFollowing Im Tirtzu's report, the Israeli Council for Higher Education appointed an international committee to investigate the allegations. The committee came to the conclusion that the curriculum in the Political Science department was imbalanced. The committee said it was \"concerned that the study of politics as a scientific discipline may be impeded by such strong emphasis on political activism\", and recommended closing the department unless changes were made. The report was widely criticized by academics, who said that it was politically motivated, noting that well-known scholars had been rejected from the committee because of their political views and that the original committee chair had resigned. Minister of Education, Gideon Sa'ar, said \"I believe the report is important since it encourages public discussion\" but rejected any attempts to block or apply conditions for donations to Israeli universities.\n\nIn 2016 Im Tirtzu alleged that Ben-Gurion University was sponsoring a conference featuring the CEO and public relations coordinator of Breaking the Silence in violation of a ruling by Israel's Council for Higher Education against politicizing academia. The University denied claims of politicization and responded that it is a \"pluralistic academic institution, which promotes and enables an open and diverse dialogue and does not seek to espouse a particular political viewpoint\".\n\nIn response to the conference, a prominent donor and longstanding member of the university's board of governors announced that he was withholding a donation of $1 million due to the conference. The university responded that they were unaware of such a pledge.\n\nIn 2013 Im Tirtzu released a report alleging \"severe politicization\" of the legal clinics at the University of Haifa. According to the report, 80% of the cases treated by the clinics dealt with security prisoners, among those convicted of terrorism and espionage.\n\nThe report charged that certain clinics of the University are part of the \"Arab nationalist struggle against Zionism\" and \"cooperate with organizations that oppose the existence of the State of Israel as a democratic state\".\n\nFollowing the report, then Minister of Education Shai Piron together with the Council for Higher Education in Israel commissioned an international committee of experts to investigate the clinics. In 2016, the committee published its recommendations that matched \"virtually all of the conclusions from the Im Tirtzu report\".\n\nFollowing numerous media reports citing Im Tirtzu's criticism of a Minerva Center program that offers students four academic credits and a scholarship in exchange for interning eight hours per week at a human rights organization, a group of bereaved families penned a letter to Education Minister Naftali Bennett calling on him to investigate the program.\n\nAccording to the bereaved families, they were \"horrified\" to learn that the program allows for internship at organizations including B'Tselem, HaMoked and Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, which they called \"anti-Israel\" organizations.\n\nAt a Knesset Education Committee that was convened to discuss the program, Hebrew University's legal advisor Pepi Yakirevich stated: \"The program asks of students to volunteer 8 weekly hours in human rights organizations that the Law Faculty sees of holding high importance... Do you expect for the Hebrew University to act as a content filter? At the moment there is no red line.\"\n\nIn 2016 Im Tirtzu released a report alleging the involvement of Israeli academics in the proposed resolution of the American Anthropological Association (AAA) to impose an academic boycott on Israel. The report cited a letter allegedly sent by 20 Israeli academics that the group said encouraged the members to vote in favor of the resolution. In light of the report, Yisrael Beiteinu Member of Knesset Oded Forer called an emergency session of the Knesset Education Committee that was attended by MKs from both sides of the political aisle.\n\nIn 2016 Im Tirtzu released a report stating that a number of Israeli citizens and organizations were among the participants in the annual Israeli Apartheid Week. The report named Zochrot and individuals including Ilan Pappe, Uri Davis and Jeff Halper.\n\nGuy Davidi, producer of 5 Broken Cameras who was also named in the report, responded by saying: \"I strongly reject the attempt to present boycott actions taken by Israelis as an act of treason. In my view, boycotting and divesting are legitimate political actions that represent a positive way to protest -- a positive alternative to violent action, which I strongly condemn. It is the right of every person to choose to boycott certain products if they don't accept the origin or the way the product is manufactured.\"\n\nIn May 2011, with the approach of Nakba Day, Im Tirtzu launched a campaign accompanied by a 70-page booklet titled \"Nakba Harta\" in Hebrew (נכבה חרטא), translated by \"The Jerusalem Post\" as \"Nakba BS\", and titled \"Nakba Nonsense\" in English. The booklet describes the 1948 Palestinian exodus, called \"Nakba\" by Palestinians, as \"a lie that threatens to drown us like a tsunami\" and attempts to discredit what Im Tirtzu regards as \"a narrative of myths and lies dealing with the teaching of the founding of the State of Israel\". On 15 May 2011, dozens of Im Tirtzu activists gathered outside the offices of UNRWA in Jerusalem holding signs and chanting, \"They expelled, they attacked, they lost.\"\n\nIn 2016, Im Tirtzu set up a 15-foot-tall inflatable Pinocchio doll across from the Nakba ceremony at Tel Aviv University in order to \"emphasize the lie of the Nakba.\"\n\nIm Tirtzu has acted in a number of ways to support IDF soldiers:\n\n\nIm Tirtzu has advocated for minorities in Israel to join the Israeli military. The Forum for Drafting the Christian Community and its founder Father Gabriel Naddaf have worked closely with Im Tirtzu to encourage and promote the safety of Christian Israelis who wish to perform IDF service. Father Naddaf is a frequent guest speaker at Im Tirtzu events and sits on their Public Council. Other Israeli Arabs who promote the integration of minorities in Israeli society have received awards from the movement.\n\nIm Tirtzu has also organized social activities with Israeli minorities, including distributing clothing and toys in Bedouin kindergartens and organizing meetings and tours in Druze villages. Following an act of vandalism against Jerusalem's Dormition Abbey, in which vandals spray-painted anti-Christian slogans, Im Tirtzu activists arrived for a solidarity visit. Im Tirtzu CEO Matan Peleg stated: \"[We] see this as an act that is at its very core both anti-Zionist as well as anti-Israeli, an act which dangerously threatens all of the Israeli society.\"\n\nIn 2015, a new parliamentary caucus to encourage minorities to join the army was created based on the idea of Im Tirtzu. The opening ceremony of the caucus was attended by MKs from the right, center, and left.\n\nIn 2016, Im Tirtzu's fourth annual Zionist Conference for Human Rights centered around the integration of minorities, featuring speeches from Deputy Minister Ayoob Kara, Father Gabriel Naddaf and other Israeli Arabs.\n\nIn 2012, Im Tirtzu inaugurated its first Program for Zionist Thought, a serious of lectures given by prominent Israeli figures and personalities. The program is featured at Hebrew University, Tel Aviv University, Ben-Gurion University, University of Haifa, Bar-Ilan University, and Ariel University.\n\nSome of the speakers include Nobel Prize laureate Robert Aumann, Caroline Glick, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, Father Gabriel Naddaf, Ben-Dror Yemini, Mordechai Kedar, Major General Yaakov Amidror, former MK Einat Wilf, Rabbi David Stav, Yoram Ettinger, and Ran Baratz.\n\nThe program is the largest Zionist academic extra-curricular program in Israel.\n\nIn 2016 Im Tirtzu began to organize student tours of Hebron together with the Committee of the Jewish Community of Hebron.\n\nAccording to Im Tirtzu CEO Matan Peleg, the tours are aimed to provide an answer to the tours of Hebron given by left-wing NGO Breaking the Silence, which he dubs \"de-legitimization and lies\".\n\nIn September 2017 Im Tirtzu held a conference celebrating ten years of activity. Hundreds of activists and supporters participated in the event, which featured a keynote speech from Speaker of the Knesset Yuli-Yoel Edelstein and video-recorded congratulatory messages from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman, Education Minister Naftali Bennett, Justice Minister Ayelet Shaked, Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, and a number of other ministers, members of Knesset, and cultural figures.\n\nIn 2012, Im Tirtzu organized a campaign against Israeli-Arab actor Mohammed Bakri who was slated to appear in Federico Garcia Lorca's \"The House of Bernarda Alba\" at Tel Aviv's Tzavta Theater. Im Tirtzu objected to Bakri because of his involvement in the film \"Jenin, Jenin\". In a \"Haaretz\" opinion piece, Im Tirtzu chairman Ronen Shoval called \"Jenin, Jenin\" an antisemitic blood libel \"unprecedented in its fierceness\" and referred to Bakri as a \"sophisticated enemy\". Shoval accused the Tzavta Club of offering a platform to \"an inciter and a liar\".\n\nIn 2010, Im Tirtzu published a document and launched a campaign in the Israeli media that said there were connections between organizations supported by the New Israel Fund and the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (also known as the Goldstone Report). Im Tirtzu said that 92 percent of all Israeli testimonials in the report came from NIF funded organizations. The campaign included \"vilifying\" NIF chairwoman Naomi Chazan as an agent of Hamas and Iran and the diffusion of posters caricaturing her with a horn strapped by a string on her forehead (in Hebrew, the word for \"horn\" also means \"fund\"), and a caption reading \"Naomi-Goldstone-Chazan.\" According to Ron Kampeas (Jewish Telegraphic Agency) Im Tirtzu's report said 16 NIF affilated groups comprised 14 percent of all sources for the Goldstone report, while stating in a separate section that these constitute 92 percent of Israel-based negative reporting in the Goldstone report; some reporting had incorrectly confused the two separate figures and accused Im Tirzu as being inaccurate.\n\nAs a result of the report there were calls in the Knesset to investigate the NIF and its operational arms in Israel. Benny Begin, a cabinet minister at the time, characterized the allegations Im Tirtzu published as \"lies\" in a radio interview. Abe Foxman said it was \"absurd to blame Goldstone on the NIF\".\n\nChazan claimed that, in her eyes, the campaign was directed against democracy itself. The executive director of the Association for Civil Rights in Israel, Hagai El-Ad, denied Im Tirtzu's allegations. Gideon Levy, writing in \"Haaretz\", likened Im Tirtzu's campaign against NIF to fascist tactics. Gershon Baskin, a columnist in \"The Jerusalem Post\", spoke out about the newspaper's decision to cancel Naomi Chazan's column and accused Im Tirtzu of using an \"anti-Semitic motif\" as part of a \"witch-hunt\" that \"is reminiscent of the darkest days of McCarthyism\". That poster was called \"style \"Der Stürmer\"\" by the Facebook group \"Im Tirzu - fascists\" and was charged for libel by \"Im Tirtzu\". Judge Refael Yaakobi accepted the characterization of Im Tirtzu's poster as being similar in style to that of the Nazi party's newspaper, writing in the court's decision, \"examining that publication and the source for comparison reveals that indeed there is truth in the matter.\"\n\nDuring Operation Pillar of Defense, Im Tirtzu published an open letter in American Jewish newspapers addressed to the New Israel Fund chair. The letter gave examples of NIF funded organizations that Im Tirtzu said accused Israel of war crimes, and asked if the NIF agrees with their accusations. The NIF rebutted Im Tirtzu's charges, stating, \"Not one of the human rights organizations Im Tirtzu attacks accused Israel of war crimes in the recent Gaza action.\" NIF also quoted Avichai Mandelblit, the IDF's Chief Military Advocate General during Operation Cast Lead: \"The organizations are a conduit for getting information on very important matters so that IDF activity is normative... I'm trying to get at the truth and they really help us do that. Our cooperation with B'tselem [A NIF-supported group] stands out. They help us to speak with witnesses, to investigate complaints ... with all of the criticism from these organizations on us, their goal is to get to the truth.\"\n\nIn December 2015, Im Tirtzu launched a campaign calling Israeli left-wing and human rights organizations that receive funding from foreign entities as \"foreign agents\". It released a video depicting the heads of these organizations as foreign agents encouraging terrorist attacks; the Anti-Defamation League criticized the video as \"hate speech;\" a lawsuit against Im Tirtzu for incitement to violence was dismissed after the Attorney General determined that the video was urging the Israeli public to support MK Yoav Kisch's \"foreign agent bill\". They also made a Facebook post calling a number of Israeli artists \"cultural foreign agents\". Following criticism, Im Tirtzu apologized and CEO Matan Peleg decided to suspend himself over the decision to upload the post.\n\nIn 2016 Im Tirtzu released a report claiming that the Israeli NGO HaMoked received over 15 million NIS from European governments and has submitted nearly 60 petitions to the Supreme Court from mid-2014 to 2016 on behalf of 48 families of Palestinian terrorists responsible for the murder of 50 people.\n\nHaMoked declined to comment on the report.\n\nIn response to the report, MK Oded Forer submitted a bill that would require organizations that receive the majority of their funding from foreign governments to declare their funding sources on every document submitted to the court.\n\nIm Tirtzu released a report ahead of 2017's International Holocaust Remembrance Day detailing Germany's funding of the NGO Zochrot, which works to \"promote Israeli Jewish society's acknowledgement of and accountability for the ongoing injustices of the Nakba and the reconceptualization of Return as the imperative redress of the Nakba\".\n\nAccording to the report, the Government of Germany had provided over 1,100,000 shekels ($290,000) to Zochrot from 2012 to 2016, which is used by Zochrot to engage in \"anti-Israeli\" activities including screening its \"Film Festival on Nakba and the Right of Return\" on college campuses during \"Israeli Apartheid Week\", promoting an \"iNakba\" smartphone application, and accusing Israel of \"ethnic cleansing\".\n\nIm Tirtzu contacted the German Ambassador to Israel over the funding, yet received no response.\n\nIn May 2011 the organization called on Attorney-General Yehuda Weinstein to launch a criminal investigation into the operations of Machsom Watch (an NIF funded organization) for allegedly violating an IDF order prohibiting Israelis from entering the Palestinian village of Awarta. About a week before the Shin Bet (Israel Security Agency) revealed the identities of the murder suspects for the Itamar attack, senior Machsom Watch activist, Raya Yaron, was photographed hugging the mother of one of the men. Yaron said many other human rights organizations had also visited the village.\n\nIn May 2012 Peace Now filed a police complaint that said Im Tirtzu activists had impersonated Peace Now activists and waved Palestinian flags during Jerusalem Day celebrations in what was reported as a presumed attempt to portray them as Palestinian sympathizers. They described Im Tirtzu as an \"extremist movement\" that, together with \"extreme Islamic movements on the Arab side\", they claimed would \"drag us to a religious war steeped in blood\". Im Tirtzu accused Peace Now of \"impersonating an Israeli organization while operating with backing from foreign countries in order to give the Temple Mount to Palestinian Authority\" and said freedom of speech gave them the right to ridicule Peace Now's positions.\n\nIn 2016 Im Tirtzu issued a report stating that at least seven foreign government funded organizations that it deemed \"anti-Israel\" are eligible to receive Sherut Leumi (National Service) positions.\n\nIn response to the report, MK Amir Ohana introduced a bill in cooperation with Im Tirtzu that was supported by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which aimed to cancel national service positions in groups that receive the majority of their funding from foreign governments.\n\nThe bill was later passed into law by the Knesset in a vote of 40–12.\n\nIn 2015 Im Tirtzu released a report titled \"Activity of Israeli Organizations with Advisor Status to the United Nations, Against Israeli Policy\", which claims that three Israeli NGOs use their U.N. advisor to promote anti-Israel sentiments in the United Nations.\n\nAccording to the report, Adalah, Ittijah, and the Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions encourage the U.N. to accuse Israel of international law violations. These three organizations declined to comment on the report.\n\nFollowing the release of the findings by the \"United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict\", Im Tirtzu released a report detailing the use by the UN of research by Israeli NGOs in the report.\n\nAccording to the report, the UN report contained 72 references to reports by B'tselem, 8 references to Adalah, 8 references to Breaking the Silence, 12 references to HaMoked: Center for the Defence of the Individual, and 5 references to Yesh Din.\n\nAhead of 2016's Jerusalem Day, Im Tirtzu released a report claiming that the Palestinian organization Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Secretariat transfers millions of dollars to Israeli NGOs in order to delegitimize Israel and \"obscure Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem\". According to the report, the Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Secretariat acts as an independent organizations that manages donations from Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and Holland and then transfers them to pro-BDS Palestinian and Israeli NGOs.\n\nSarit Michaeli, the spokesperson for B'Tselem – one of the NGOs named in the report as receiving funds – said \"this is a recycled lie by Im Tirtzu. This money actually comes from Switzerland, Holland, Denmark and Sweden. This organization transfers the funds from the donating countries and deals with the bureaucracy of the transfer. The organization itself does not determine who receives the funds.\"\n\nIn 2010, Im Tirtzu received funding from the following sources:\n\nUnder John Hagee's management, Christians United for Israel was a funder of Im Tirtzu but discontinued the funding on the grounds that Im Tirtzu \"misrepresented its focus\" by claiming that their work focused on \"Zionist education\" rather than \"political\" activity according to a spokesperson for the Evangelical organization.\n\nDuring the 2015 election, Shining City, a U.S. front group, contributed 3.7 million shekels (about 1 million U.S. dollars) to Im Tirtzu. Rabbi Aryeh Lightstone, the alleged leader of Shining City, now serves as senior adviser to U.S. ambassador to Israel David M. Friedman. According to Im Tirzu, most of its donors are Israelis, but the group is \"pleased to find private donors from around the world as well (individuals and private foundations)\" except those that \"promote delegitimization of Israeli society\".\n\nThe group was founded in 2006 by Ronen Shoval, who also served as its chairman until his retirement in 2013, and Erez Tadmor, who was a group spokesperson until his retirement in 2011.\n\nFollowing Ronen's retirement, Matan Peleg was elected as Im Tirtzu's chairman. Peleg was the founder of the Im Tirtzu branch in Haifa and the head of the northern branch of the movement. After Erez's retired, Matan replaced him in the role of missions coordinator. Alon Schwartzer was elected as head of the policy department alongside Matan.\n\nMatan Peleg suspended himself in January 2016 in the wake of an Im Tirtzu campaign against Israeli artists who supported human rights groups. Several months later in May 2016 Peleg returned to his role.\n\nA NIS 2.6-million lawsuit was filed by Im Tirtzu against Israelis who had opened a Facebook page that suggested that Im Tirtzu was a Fascist group. A court in Jerusalem rejected some of the charges but found one person guilty of slander. In the verdict the Judge Refael Ya'akobi found that there were commonalities between the group and \"certain principles of Fascism\". He also stated that it is clear that the defendants are \"bitter adversaries\" of Im Tirtzu. He additionally wrote that the defendants do not imply a full identification Fascism with Im Tirtzu, but only some common lines. Finally the judge ruled that as Im Tirtzu emphasizes national aspects, the defendants can rely on the protections set in the law in order to be acquitted. and wrote also that there is truth in comparing the poster of \"Im Tirtzu\" against the New Israel Fund to the style of the Nazi newspaper \"Der Stürmer\". The judge wrote: \"One should view these publications (against Im Tirtzu) as saying and warning that past experience teaches that support of similar principles to those that Im Tirtzu supports ... brought harsh and bad results.\" In September 2013, the judge rejected the majority of Im Tirtzu's arguments, and cleared four of the five defendants. One defendant, Roy Yellin, was found to have libeled Im Tirtzu by implying that the group shared the \"Nazi race theory\". However, the judge criticised Im Tirtzu for bringing the action in the first place, and postponed awarding any damages for the one successful claim. In February 2014, the court rejected Im Tirtzu's claim for damages, though it also rejected the defendants' claim for legal costs. Both Im Tirtzu and the defendants appealed to the high court. In the appeal, the high court declared the previous ruling as void and null and decided that the libel suit should have not been heard in court, since the main discussion is ideological, not juridical.\n\nIn court proceedings, Professor Zeev Sternhell, one of the world's leading experts on Fascism, testified that Im Tirtzu was \"not worse than Fascism, it is that, more or less\". He also testified that Fascist principles \"provide a basis for Im Tirtzu's operations\". Sternhell analyzed the writings published by Im Tirtzu and observed expressions of fascist thinking in the writings of the group's founder. These include seeing the nation as an organic body, viewing the West as being weakened, and describing the situation in the country as an emergency situation that requires unusual action against \"traitors\".\n\nOther court testimony documented that Im Tirtzu's founder admitted to drawing inspiration from German philosophers considered to have been precursors to Fascist ideology.\n\nIn 2016, Knesset Member Benny Begin also used the term \"Fascist\" to describe a campaign by the organization.\n\nIn 2009, Im Tirtzu's largest donor was the John Hagee Ministries (JHM) via the Christian-Zionist organization Christians United for Israel (CUFI). Im Tirtzu received US$100,000 from JHM and $34,000 from other sources. In 2010, \"The Jerusalem Post\" reported that JHM \"expressed deep displeasure\" with Im Tirtzu after its campaigns against the New Israel Fund and Ben-Gurion University and announced the cessation of its funding. A JHM spokesman said that Im Tirtzu \"misrepresented its focus when they told us their mission was strictly Zionist education\".\n\nThe group's former spokesperson, Erez Tadmor, was found guilty of embezzling munitions from the Israeli military.\n\nThe organization was accused of acting in an Anti-Semitic fashion, including emulating Nazi propaganda, in its criticisms of U.S. Ambassador Martin Indyk and of the New Israel Fund.\n\nHaaretz newspaper alleged that \"Im Tirtzu has taken over political discourse in Israel, and injected into it the crazy idea of the internal enemy,\" and accused The Jewish Home party as \"operating as the political arm of Im Tirtzu.\"\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has publicly endorsed Im Tirtzu.\n\nIm Tirtzu has been active on college campuses throughout Israel, and has received support from members of the Israeli Parliament and prominent Israeli writers and personalities.\n\nArutz Sheva has described Im Tirtzu as the largest Zionist movement in Israel.\n\nIn a 2012 Ministry of Culture and Education competition, Im Tirtzu won first prize for their video titled, \"Zionism Without Jerusalem?\" In a competition featuring almost 150 entries, Im Tirtzu's video won the most popular video, and was awarded a prize of 25,000 shekels.\n\n\n",

She won the fifth season of \"The X Factor Australia\" and subsequently received a recording contract with Sony Music Australia.\n\nAfter winning \"The X Factor\", Im released her debut and winner's single \"Alive\", which debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart. This was followed by the release of her self-titled second studio album, which debuted at number one the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association. Im became the first \"X Factor Australia\" contestant to follow up a number one single with a number one album on the ARIA Charts. Im's third studio album, \"Heart Beats\", was released in 2014 and became her second top-ten album. It produced the top-twenty hits \"Super Love\" and \"Gladiator\".\n\nIm represented Australia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2016 held in Stockholm, Sweden, with the song \"Sound of Silence\", where she won the jury vote and placed fourth in the televote, coming second overall with a total of 511 points.\n\nDami Im was born in Seoul on 17 October 1988 to Lee Hae-yun, a trained opera singer, and Im Dong-eal. She is the elder of two children. Im began learning the piano at the age of five, and she taught herself to sing by recording herself copying her favourite artists. Aged nine, Im emigrated to Australia with her mother and younger brother Kenny because their parents thought they would have more opportunity growing up in Australia. They stayed with their uncle in Brisbane, while her father stayed in South Korea to earn money to support them. Im's parents now live together, spending part of the year in Australia and part in South Korea.\n\nAged 11, Im began studying at the Young Conservatorium of Music program at Griffith University. She was a national finalist in the Yamaha Youth Piano Competition, and won the Nora Baird Scholarship and the Queensland Piano Competition several times. Im attended John Paul College in Daisy Hill, Queensland and graduated in 2005. She never sang while at school and would only accompany the choir on piano, and play violin for the school's Silver Strings group. In 2009, Im graduated from the University of Queensland with first class honours in a Bachelor of Music. She subsequently completed a Masters of Arts degree in contemporary voice at Griffith University. At Griffith University, Im was trained by Dr. Irene Bartlett, lecturer and voice coach who also trained a number of other well-known Australian vocalists such as Katie Noonan, Megan Washington, Kristin Berardi, and Elly Hoyt. Prior to entering \"The X Factor\", Im was a music and piano teacher.\n\nIm had a short career as a gospel singer in Korea, performing at Christian youth camps. In 2010, she released her debut studio album, \"Dream\", which consisted of nine tracks and was recorded to raise money for church endeavours. In July 2011, Im re-released the album with two extra tracks, which were both sung in English. On 5 December 2011, Im released a Christmas extended play called \"Snow & Carol\", which consisted of seven tracks. On 9 July 2012, Im released her second extended play, \"Intimacy\", which consisted of five tracks.\n\nIn 2013, Im successfully auditioned for the fifth season of \"The X Factor Australia\", singing \"Hero\" by Mariah Carey. She progressed to the super bootcamp round of the competition and was placed in the Under 25 Girls category. On the first day of bootcamp, Im sang \"I'm with You\" by Avril Lavigne in front of her entire category and judges Redfoo, Ronan Keating and Dannii Minogue. On the second day of bootcamp, she was put into an ensemble of 10 and they sang \"Next to Me\" by Emeli Sandé in front of the judges. Im made it to the third day of bootcamp, where she sang \"Jolene\" by Dolly Parton to the judges and a live audience of one thousand. After the judges made changes to the Boys, Girls and Overs categories, Im became part of the newly formed Over 24s category and was eliminated. However, Im was called back for the home visits round in New York City to replace Matt Gresham who decided he could not commit to the competition. During home visits, she sang \"If I Were a Boy\" by Beyoncé in front of her mentor Minogue and guest mentor Kylie Minogue. Minogue later selected Im, along with Barry Southgate and Cat Vas, for the live finals—a series of ten weekly live shows in which contestants are progressively eliminated by public vote.\n\nFor the Judges' Choice-themed first live show, Im sang \"One\" by U2 and received a standing ovation from the judges, with Natalie Bassingthwaighte saying she had \"the best vocal of the night\". Im's performance of \"One\" peaked at number 42 on the ARIA Singles Chart. For the Legends-themed second live show, she sang \"Purple Rain\" by Prince and received another standing ovation. Keating told Im that the competition \"at the moment, is yours\". Her performance of \"Purple Rain\" debuted at number 29 on the ARIA Singles Chart. For the Top 10 Hits-themed third live show, Im sang Thelma Houston's version of \"Don't Leave Me This Way\", and her performance of the song debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at number 67. Following the eliminations of Vas in week two and Southgate in week three, Im became the last remaining contestant in Minogue's category. After her performance of Katy Perry's \"Roar\" in the Latest and Greatest-themed fourth live show, Im received her fourth consecutive standing ovation from the judges. Im's performance of \"Roar\" debuted at number 44 on the ARIA Singles Chart. For the Rock-themed fifth live show, she sang \"Best of You\" by the Foo Fighters and received her fifth standing ovation. Im's performance of \"Best of You\" debuted at number 78 on the ARIA Singles Chart.\n\nFollowing Im's performance of Simon & Garfunkel's \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" during the Family Heroes-themed sixth live show, her mentor Minogue notably teared up as she dedicated Im's song choice to her parents and grandfather, following the death of her grandmother. Im's performance of \"Bridge over Troubled Water\" debuted at number 15 on the ARIA Singles Chart. For the Judges' Challenge-themed seventh live show, Im sang Zedd's \"Clarity\", which was chosen by Keating, and her performance debuted at number 77 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Im received a mixed feedback from the judges following her performance of John Farnham's \"You're the Voice\" during the Aussie Week-themed eighth live show. Keating said \"it was pitchy and a weak performance\" and Bassingthwaighte agreed. For the Power and Passion-themed ninth live show, Im sang \"Saving All My Love for You\" by Whitney Houston and \"Wrecking Ball\" by Miley Cyrus. Her performances of \"Wrecking Ball\" and \"Saving All My Love for You\" debuted on the ARIA Singles Chart at numbers 61 and 85, respectively.\n\nDuring the grand final performance show on 27 October, Im was required to perform three songs – her audition song (\"Hero\"), winner's single (\"Alive\") and last shot song (\"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\"). Her performance of \"And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going\", which debuted at number 29 on the ARIA Singles Chart, got all four judges standing on the judges table. Redfoo said Im's performance was \"the best thing I've ever seen in my life\", while Minogue added that she is \"world class\". Im's performance of \"Hero\" debuted at number 62. During the grand final decider show the following day, Im was announced as the winner.\n\nAfter winning \"The X Factor\", Im's debut and winner's single \"Alive\" was released on the iTunes Store. She also received a recording contract with Sony Music Australia and a management deal. Four days after release, \"Alive\" debuted at number one on the ARIA Singles Chart. It was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association for selling over 70,000 copies. Im's self-titled second studio album was released on 15 November 2013 and featured studio recordings of songs she performed on \"The X Factor\". The album debuted at number one on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified platinum for shipments of more than 70,000 units. Im became the first \"X Factor Australia\" contestant to follow up a number one single with a number one album on the ARIA Charts. On 23 November 2013, Im toured alongside Third Degree, Taylor Henderson, Jiordan Tolli and Jai Waetford for The X Factor Live Tour, which ended on 2 December 2013. In late December 2013, she signed on as an ambassador for the children's charity Compassion Australia.\n\nIt was reported on 19 January 2014 that fashion label Alannah Hill had signed Im to be the face of their autumn and winter 2014 collection. On 24 January 2014, Im released a cover of \"I Am Australian\" with Henderson, Jessica Mauboy, Justice Crew, Nathaniel Willemse and Samantha Jade, to coincide with the Australia Day celebrations. The song peaked at number 51 on the ARIA Singles Chart. Im's next single, an acoustic cover of Dolly Parton's \"Jolene\", was released on 7 March 2014, but failed to chart. In May 2014, she became an ambassador for Priceline Pharmacy's You Beauty campaign, which celebrates the diversity of Australian women. The following month, Im became the ambassador of Nintendo's video game, \"Tomodachi Life\". On 3 September 2014, Im performed at The Marquee in Sydney as part of Nova FM's Red Room Global Tour.\n\nIm's third studio album, \"Heart Beats\", was released on 17 October 2014 and debuted at number seven on the ARIA Albums Chart, becoming Im's second top-ten album. The album was preceded by the release of its first two singles, \"Super Love\" and \"Gladiator\", both of which peaked at number 11 on the ARIA Singles Chart. The former also reached the top-twenty on the South Korea Gaon Charts and was certified platinum, while the latter was certified gold for selling over 35,000 copies. In December 2014, Im was the supporting act for John Legend's Australian leg of his All of Me Tour. Im's sixth lead single \"Smile\" was released on 29 May 2015, and debuted at number 48. In June 2015, it was confirmed that Im was working on her upcoming fourth studio album.\n\nIm was invited to participate in the international cast BTV Global Spring Festival Gala presentation by the Chinese BTV television station which was broadcast on the second day of Spring Festival 10 February. Im performed an acoustic rendition of \"Close to You\" in English and then teamed up with Chinese Kazakh singer, Tasiken (塔斯肯), to perform the popular \"365 Mile Road\" (三百六十五里路) as a duet, in Chinese. The pairing of Im with Tasiken in the duet performance is also notable in that they both share remarkably similar journeys in their music competition experiences. In the second series of \"The Voice of China\" competition in 2013, Tasiken was initially eliminated in the Blind Auditions round, but was later selected by coach A-mei in a second chance round. Tasiken performed well and won the Battles and Knock Out rounds, only to ultimately lose to the eventual winner of the series Li Qi (李琦) in the Playoff round. This almost mirrors Im's own experience of being eliminated in the super bootcamp round of 2013 The X-Factor Australia competition, only to be recalled to the home visits round. Im of course went on to perform very well in the subsequent Live Finals and eventually win the competition. The very popular Global Spring Festival event was reportedly one of the world's most watched TV program, broadcast to a global audience of over 200 million.\nOn 3 March, it was announced Im would represent Australia at the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. Her song was \"Sound of Silence\". On 4 March, it also announced Im would release a new album in April called \"Classic Carpenters\". The album is a collection of cover versions of some of The Carpenters' biggest songs. It was released on 22 April 2016. Three music videos of her performing the songs \"(They Long to Be) Close to You\", \"There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)\" and \"Yesterday Once More\" were released on 14, 17 and 19 April, respectively. Classic carpenters charted with massive success on the ARIA charts gaining the chart position of Number Three, Im's third studio also gained success on the South Korean charts achieving a position of 23 within the Top 25.\n\nAt an interview, Paul Clarke, Australia's head of delegation to the Eurovision Song Contest, was asked about the potential of Im's performance at the contest. Clarke remarked that Im's journey as a migrant to Australia at the age of nine and learning English from songs of Kylie Minogue was conducive to the multiculturalism and diversity of the European competition. Clarke adds that \"Im is also a lightning rod of emotion when she performs\", which is something he believes will resonate with the Eurovision audience. He further notes that \"She can just feel an audience and be able to be the conductor of it, better than just about any performer I've ever seen, she just does it intuitively.\"\n\nIn the Eurovision Song Contest 2016, Im was announced to perform in second semi-final. Im performed tenth in the running order and successfully progressed to the final with the highest score and top ranking of her semi-final. As this was the first time Australia competed in the semi-final stage, Im became the first ever Australian representative to progress from the semi-final to the final. In the final, Im performed 13th in the running order and achieved the top score of 320 points from the national jury. Ultimately, she received 191 points from televoting and was announced to have gained 511 points in total, placing 2nd in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. Im's second place score is the highest score ever achieved by an Australian representative. Following the contest, Im's single \"Sound of Silence\" charted at number 3 on the ARIA charts and gained huge success across Europe with Im's single selling over fifty five thousand copies worldwide, and has also achieved two Gold certificated for her single from the ARIA Charts and the Swedish Recording Industry Association charts respectively. Also \"Sound of Silence\" charted within the top fifteen in Finland and Belgium – a first for Im in her singing career, the single also charted for the first time in Im's career on the UK Charts, the Spanish, German and Austrian charts. This single is Im's most successful in her career to date. In October 2016, Im released her first post-Eurovision single, \"Fighting for Love\". In 2017, it was announced through various social media that THE.mgmt has signed Im to a special arrangement modeling contract with the agency. \n\nOn 7 April 2017, Im released a new recording of \"Hold Me In Your Arms\" with original Southern Sons singer, Jack Jones. On 9 April 2017, it was reported that Sony Music Australia CEO Denis Handlin was moved by Im's earlier live performance of the song on Australia Day with Guy Sebastian that he \"spared no expense securing the original voice of the song Jack Jones (Irwin Thomas) to re-create is 1990 hit with Dami Im.\" On 28 April, 2017, Im posted on her social media photos of herself with Sony Australia CEO Denis Handlin receiving Gold certification for \"Classic Carpenters\" and her platinum certification for \"Sound of Silence\".\n\nIm credits her home influences, with her mother being an opera singer, and her own classical music training, as providing her the grounding and instilling in her the love for music and performance. Im has also cited K-pop music as an inspiration in regard to her love and passion for singing. Her musical influences are Beyoncé, Mariah Carey, Norah Jones, Corinne Bailey Rae, Chris Tomlin and BoA. She also cites BoA along with Lee Juck and Kim Dong-ryool as her favourite singers. Aside from singing, Im also plays piano and violin and has co-written some of her material. She co-wrote eight songs on her third studio album, \"Heart Beats\".\n\nDuring a radio interview in 2016, Im credited Guy Sebastian as providing her with the initial impetus to dream that perhaps one day she could follow in his footsteps in competing and winning a reality music show. Im described how watching Sebastian take first place in Australian Idol in 2003 as the beginning of her own dream for her own career as a professional singer. She also described how at the time, while still a teenager, that she would spend hours practicing in her bedroom, recording her own voice. She described singing to such songs as Stacie Orrico's \"Stuck\" as pivotal to her initial preparation as a singer. She explained that practicing doing the runs that Orrico and other singers execute in their songs helped her improve her own singing ability. Im eventually went on to master her craft by completing her voice training at post-graduate level at the Young Conservatorium of Music, Griffith University, under the tutelage of Dr Irene Bartlett.\n\nApart from Im's career as a musical performance artist, she is also recognized as a fashion trendsetter. During the X Factor competition, she is known for the extravagant outfits that she wore for her performances. After winning The X Factor, Im was sought after by different designers and fashion houses to showcase their creations, including such names as Alannah Hill and Carla Zampatti. At Eurovision, Im's iconic dress was custom designed by well known Australian couture designer, Steven Khalil.\n\nOn November 7, 2016, it was announced by Harvest Train, the Australian musical theatre company, that Im is going to be appearing in the Brisbane production of \"Grease: The Arena Experience\". The show is scheduled to play for three performances at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre from 7–8 April 2017. Im has been cast in the role of Teen Angel and will be performing a rendition of \"Beauty School Dropout\". This is the first time Im has taken part in a major musical production and also the first time that a female has been cast in the normally male role.\n\nThe musical is directed and choreographed by Callum Mansfield.

Connolly also directed the movie. The co-producers were Liz Kearney and Maggie Miles. The movie opened in cinemas on 15 January 2015. A version of \"Beauty in the World\" was also recorded for Im's \"Heart Beats\" album.\n\nOn 15 November 2016 multiple media sources announced that Im would be making her film debut in the Australian release of DreamWorks Animation's feature \"Trolls\". She is cast as the voice to the role of Grandma Rosiepuff. Im would share the role with Susanna Reid, who will be the voice of the character for the UK version and GloZell Green who will be the voice for the US version. Media also reported that Im joined Justin Timberlake at the Australian premiere of the film on 20 November at Hoyts Entertainment Quarter in Moore Park, Sydney.\n\nSoon after winning The X Factor in 2013, Im was invited to her first appearance at Carols in the Domain. An annual event that is broadcast live in Australia, the event consistently draws large crowds of in excess of 80,000. The event is often hosted by media personalities with a diverse cast that is made up of musicians, performers, characters from popular media, choral groups and choirs.

                "History of IBM\n\nInternational Business Machines, or IBM, nicknamed \"Big Blue\", is a multinational computer technology and IT consulting corporation headquartered in Armonk, New York, United States. IBM originated from the bringing together of several companies that worked to automate routine business transactions. In 1911 the company that leased Unit record equipment, especially Hollerith punched cards and card readers to government bureaus and insurance agencies, became the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). Thomas J. Watson (1874-1956) took over in 1924, using the name \"International Business Machines.\" IBM expanded into electric typewriters and other office machines. Watson was a salesman and concentrated on building a highly motivated, very well paid sales force that could craft solutions for clients unfamiliar with the latest technology. His motto was \"THINK\"; customers were advised to not \"fold, spindle or mutilate\" the delicate cardboard cards. IBM's first experiments with computers in the 1940s and 1950s were modest advances on the card-based system. Its great breakthrough came in the 1960s with its Model 360 mainframe. IBM offered a full range of hardware, software and service agreements, so that users as their needs grew would stay with \"Big Blue.\" Since most software was custom-written by in-house programmers, and would run on only one brand of computers, it was too expensive to switch brands. Brushing off clone makers, and facing down a federal anti-trust suit, the giant sold reputation and security as well as hardware, and was the most admired American corporation of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s were cruel to IBM—losses in 1993 exceeded $8 billion—as the mainframe giant failed to adjust quickly enough to the personal computer revolution. Desktop machines had the power needed, and were vastly easier for both users and managers than multimillion-dollar mainframes. IBM did introduce a popular line of microcomputers—but it was too popular. Clone makers undersold IBM, while the profits went to chip makers like Intel or software houses like Microsoft. After a series of reorganizations IBM has become one of the world's largest computer companies and systems integrators. With over 400,000 employees worldwide as of 2014, IBM holds more patents than any other U.S. based technology company and has twelve research laboratories worldwide. The company has scientists, engineers, consultants, and sales professionals in over 175 countries. IBM employees have earned five Nobel Prizes, four Turing Awards, five National Medals of Technology, and five National Medals of Science.\n\n \nThe roots of IBM date back to the 1880s. Since the 1960s or earlier, IBM has described its formation as a merger of three companies: The Tabulating Machine Company (with origins in Washington, D.C. founded in 1896), the International Time Recording Company (founded 1900 in Endicott), and the Computing Scale Company (founded 1901 in Dayton, Ohio, USA). However the 1911 stock prospectus states that four companies were consolidated; the three described by IBM and the Bundy Manufacturing Company (founded in 1889). Further, there was no merger, no consolidation. The new company, named the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company(CTR), was incorporated on June 16, 1911 in the state of New York, U.S.A. CTR was a holding company; the now five companies were an amalgamation. The individual companies continued to operate using their established names until the holding company was eliminated in 1933. The amalgamation was engineered by noted financier Charles Flint. Flint remained a member of the board of CTR until his retirement in 1930.\n\nThe companies that were amalgamated to form CTR manufactured a wide range of products, including employee time-keeping systems, weighing scales, automatic meat slicers, coffee grinders, and punched card equipment. The product lines were very different; Flint stated that the \"allied\" consolidation\n\nThe five amalgamated companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Ontario.\n\nOf the companies amalgamated to form CTR, the most technologically significant was The Tabulating Machine Company, founded by Herman Hollerith, and specialized in the development of punched card data processing equipment. Hollerith's series of patents on tabulating machine technology, first applied for in 1884, drew on his work at the U.S. Census Bureau from 1879–82. Hollerith was initially trying to reduce the time and complexity needed to tabulate the 1890 Census. His development of punched cards in 1886 set the industry standard for the next 80 years of tabulating and computing data input.\n\nIn 1896, The Tabulating Machine Company leased some machines to a railway company but quickly focused on the challenges of the largest statistical endeavor of its day – the 1900 US Census. After winning the government contract, and completing the project, Hollerith was faced with the challenge of sustaining the company in non-Census years. He returned to targeting private businesses in the United States and abroad, attempting to identify industry applications for his automatic punching, tabulating and sorting machines. In 1911, Hollerith, now 51 and in failing health sold the business to Flint for $2.3 million (of which Hollerith got $1.2 million), who then founded CTR.\nWhen the diversified businesses of CTR proved difficult to manage, Flint turned for help to the former No. 2 executive at the National Cash Register Company (NCR), Thomas J. Watson, Sr.. Watson became General Manager of CTR in 1914 and President in 1915. By drawing upon his managerial experience at NCR, Watson quickly implemented a series of effective business tactics: generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen, and an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker. As the sales force grew into a highly professional and knowledgeable arm of the company, Watson focused their attention on providing large-scale tabulating solutions for businesses, leaving the market for small office products to others. He also stressed the importance of the customer, a lasting IBM tenet. The strategy proved successful, as during Watson's first four years, revenues doubled to $2 million, and company operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia.\n\nAt the helm during this period, Watson played a central role in establishing what would become the IBM organization and culture. He launched a number of initiatives that demonstrated an unwavering faith in his workers. He hired the company's first disabled worker in 1914, he formed the company's first employee education department in 1916 and in 1915 he introduced his favorite slogan, \"THINK,\" which quickly became the corporate mantra. Watson boosted company spirit by encouraging any employee with a complaint to approach him or any other company executive – his famed Open Door policy. He also sponsored employee sports teams, family outings and a company band, believing that employees were most productive when they were supported by healthy and supportive families and communities. These initiatives – each deeply rooted in Watson's personal values system – became core aspects of IBM culture for the remainder of the century.\n\n\"Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR\" and chose to replace it with the more expansive title \"International Business Machines\". First as a name for a 1917 Canadian subsidiary, then as a line in advertisements. For example, the McClures magazine, v53, May 1921, has a full page ad with, at the bottom:\n\nFinally, in February 14, 1924, the name was used for CTR itself.\n\nThe newly minted IBM continued to develop its core cultural attributes during the 1920s. It launched an employee newspaper, Business Machines, which unified coverage of all of IBM's businesses under one publication. It introduced the Quarter Century Club, to honor employees with 25 years of service to the company, and launched the Hundred Percent Club, to reward sales personnel who met their annual quotas. In 1928, the Suggestion Plan program – which granted cash rewards to employees who contributed viable ideas on how to improve IBM products and procedures – made its debut.\nIBM and its predecessor companies made clocks and other time recording products for 70 years, culminating in the 1958 sale of the IBM Time Equipment Division to Simplex Time Recorder Company, IBM manufactured and sold such equipment as dial recorders, job recorders, recording door locks, time stamps and traffic recorders.\n\nThe company also expanded its product line through innovative engineering. Behind a core group of inventors – James W. Bryce, Clair Lake, Fred Carroll, and Royden Pierce – IBM produced a series of significant product innovations. In the optimistic years following World War I, CTR's engineering and research staff developed new and improved mechanisms to meet the broadening needs of its customers. In 1920, the company introduced the first complete school time control system, and launched its first printing tabulator. Three years later the company introduced the first electric keypunch, and 1924's Carroll Rotary Press produced punched cards at previously unheard of speeds. In 1928, the company held its first customer engineering education class, demonstrating an early recognition of the importance of tailoring solutions to fit customer needs. It also introduced the 80-column punched card in 1928, which doubled its information capacity. This new format, soon dubbed the \"IBM Card\", became and remained an industry standard until the 1970s.\n\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s presented an unprecedented economic challenge, and Watson met the challenge head on, continuing to invest in people, manufacturing, and technological innovation despite the difficult economic times. Rather than reduce staff, he hired additional employees in support of President Franklin Roosevelt's National Recovery Administration plan – not just salesmen, which he joked that he had a lifelong weakness for, but engineers too. Watson not only kept his workforce employed, he increased their benefits. IBM was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934), survivor benefits (1935) and paid vacations (1936). He upped his ante on his workforce by opening the IBM Schoolhouse in Endicott to provide education and training for IBM employees. And he greatly increased IBM's research capabilities by building a modern research laboratory on the Endicott manufacturing site.\n\nWith all this internal investment, Watson was, in essence, gambling on the future. It was IBM's first ‘Bet the Company’ gamble, but the risk paid off handsomely. Watson's factories, running full tilt for six years with no market to sell to, created a huge inventory of unused tabulating equipment, straining IBM's resources. To reduce the cash drain, the struggling Dayton Scale Division (the food services equipment business) was sold in 1933 to Hobart Manufacturing for stock. When the Social Security Act of 1935 – labeled as \"the biggest accounting operation of all time\" – came up for bid, IBM was the only bidder that could quickly provide the necessary equipment. Watson's gamble brought the company a landmark government contract to maintain employment records for 26 million people. IBM's successful performance on the contract soon led to other government orders, and by the end of the decade IBM had not only safely negotiated the Depression, but risen to the forefront of the industry. Watson's Depression-era decision to invest heavily in technical development and sales capabilities, education to expand the breadth of those capabilities, and his commitment to the data processing product line laid the foundation for 50 years of IBM growth and successes.\n\nHis avowed focus on international expansion proved an equally key component of the company's 20th century growth and success. Watson, having witnessed the havoc the First World War wrought on society and business, envisioned commerce as an obstacle to war. He saw business interests and peace as being mutually compatible. In fact, he felt so strongly about the connection between the two that he had his slogan \"World Peace Through World Trade\" carved into the exterior of IBM's new World Headquarters (1938) in New York City. The slogan became an IBM business mantra, and Watson campaigned tirelessly for the concept with global business and government leaders. He served as an informal, unofficial government host for world leaders when they visited New York, and received numerous awards from foreign governments for his efforts to improve international relations through the formation of business ties.\n\nIn the decades leading up to the onset of WW2 IBM had operations in many countries that would be involved in the war, on both the side of the Allies and the Axis. IBM had a lucrative subsidiary in Germany, which it was majority owner of, as well as operations in Poland, Switzerland and other countries in Europe. As with most other enemy-owned businesses in Axis countries, these subsidiaries were taken over by the Nazis and other Axis governments early on in the war. The headquarters in New York meanwhile worked to help the American war effort.\n\nIBM's product line shifted from tabulating equipment and time recording devices to Sperry and Norden bombsights, Browning Automatic Rifle and the M1 Carbine, and engine parts – in all, more than three dozen major ordnance items and 70 products overall. Watson set a nominal one percent profit on those products and used the profits to establish a fund for widows and orphans of IBM war casualties.\n\nAllied military forces widely utilized IBM's tabulating equipment for mobile records units, ballistics, accounting and logistics, and other war-related purposes. There was extensive use of IBM punched card machines for calculations made at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project for developing the first atomic bombs. During the War, IBM also built the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, also known as the Harvard Mark I for the U.S. Navy – the first large-scale electro-mechanical calculator in the U.S..\n\nIn 1933 IBM had acquired the rights to Radiotype, an IBM Electric typewriter attached to a radio transmitter. \"In 1935 Admiral Richard E. Byrd successfully sent a test Radiotype message 11,000 miles from Antarctica to an IBM receiving station in Ridgewood, New Jersey\" Selected by the Signal Corps for use during the war, Radiotype installations handled up to 50,000,000 words a day.\n\nTo meet wartime product demands, IBM greatly expanded its manufacturing capacity. IBM added new buildings at its Endicott, New York plant (1941), and opened new facilities in Poughkeepsie, New York (1941), Washington, D.C. (1942), and San Jose, California (1943). IBM's decision to establish a presence on the West Coast took advantage of the growing base of electronics research and other high technology innovation in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area that came to be known many decades later as Silicon Valley.\n\nThe Nazis made extensive use of Hollerith equipment and IBM's majority owned German subsidiary, Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen GmbH (Dehomag), supplied this equipment from the early 1930s. This equipment was critical to Nazi efforts to categorize citizens of both Germany and other nations that fell under Nazi control through ongoing censuses. This census data was used to facilitate the round-up of Jews and other targeted groups, and to catalog their movements through the machinery of the Holocaust, including internment in the concentration camps.\n\nAs with hundreds of foreign-owned companies that did business in Germany at that time, Dehomag came under the control of Nazi authorities prior to and during World War II. A Nazi, Hermann Fellinger, was appointed by the Germans as an enemy-property custodian and placed at the head of the Dehomag subsidiary.\n\nHistorian and author Edwin Black, in his best selling book on the topic, maintains that the seizure of the German subsidiary was a ruse. He writes: \"The company was not looted, its leased machines were not seized, and [IBM] continued to receive money funneled through its subsidiary in Geneva.\" In his book he argues that IBM was an active and enthusiastic supplier to the Nazi regime long after they should have stopped dealing with them. Even after the invasion of Poland, IBM continued to service and expand services to the Third Reich in Poland and Germany. The seizure of IBM came after Pearl Harbor and the US Declaration of War, in 1941.\n\nIBM has said that it did nothing wrong.\n\nIBM had expanded so much by the end of the War that the company faced a potentially difficult situation – what would happen if military spending dropped sharply? One way IBM addressed that concern was to accelerate its international growth in the years after the war, culminating with the formation of the World Trade Corporation in 1949 to manage and grow its foreign operations. Under the leadership of Watson's youngest son, Arthur K. ‘Dick’ Watson, the WTC would eventually produce half of IBM's bottom line by the 1970s.\n\nA new IBM emerged in the 1950s. With the death of Founding Father Thomas J. Watson, Sr. on June 19, 1956 at age 82, IBM experienced its first leadership change in more than four decades. The mantle of chief executive fell to his eldest son, Thomas J. Watson, Jr., IBM's president since 1952.\n\nThe new chief executive faced a daunting task. The company was in the midst of a period of rapid technological change, with nascent computer technologies – electronic computers, magnetic tape storage, disk drives, programming – creating new competitors and market uncertainties. Internally, the company was growing by leaps and bounds, creating organizational pressures and significant management challenges. Lacking the force of personality that Watson Sr. had long used to bind IBM together, Watson Jr. and his senior executives privately wondered if the new generation of leadership was up to challenge of managing a company through this tumultuous period. \"We are,\" wrote one longtime IBM executive in 1956, \"in grave danger of losing our \"eternal\" values that are as valid in electronic days as in mechanical counter days.\"\n\nWatson Jr. responded by drastically restructuring the organization mere months after his father died, creating a modern management structure that enabled him to more effectively oversee the fast moving company. He codified well known but unwritten IBM practices and philosophy into formal corporate policies and programs – such as IBM's Three Basic Beliefs, and Open Door and Speak Up! Perhaps the most significant of which was his shepherding of the company's first equal opportunity policy letter into existence in 1953, one year before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \"Brown vs. Board of Education\" and 11 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nHe continued to expand the company's physical capabilities – in 1952 IBM San Jose launched a storage development laboratory which pioneered disk drives. Major facilities would later follow in Rochester, Minnesota; Greencastle, Indiana; Kingston, New York; and Lexington, Kentucky. Concerned that IBM was too slow in adapting transistor technology Watson requested a corporate policy regarding their use, resulting in this unambiguous 1957 product development policy statement: \"It shall be the policy of IBM to use solid-state circuitry in all machine developments. Furthermore, no new commercial machines or devices shall be announced which make primary use of tube circuitry.\"\n\nWatson Jr. also continued to partner with the United States government to drive computational innovation. The emergence of the Cold War accelerated the government's growing awareness of the significance of digital computing, and drove major Department of Defense supported computer development projects in the 1950s. Of these, none was more important than the SAGE interceptor early detection air defense system.\nIn 1952, IBM began working with MIT's Lincoln Laboratories to finalize the design of an air defense computer. The merger of academic and business engineering cultures proved troublesome, but the two organizations finally hammered out a design by the summer of 1953, and IBM was awarded the contract to build two prototypes in September. In 1954, IBM was named as the primary computer hardware contractor for developing SAGE for the United States Air Force. Working on this massive computing and communications system, IBM gained access to pioneering research being done at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the first real-time, digital computer. This included working on many other computer technology advancements such as magnetic core memory, a large real-time operating system, an integrated video display, light guns, the first effective algebraic computer language, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion techniques, digital data transmission over telephone lines, duplexing, multiprocessing, and geographically distributed networks). IBM built fifty-six SAGE computers at the price of US$30 million each, and at the peak of the project devoted more than 7,000 employees (20% of its then workforce) to the project. SAGE had the largest computer footprint ever, and continued in service until 1984.\n\nMore valuable to IBM in the long run than the profits from governmental projects, however, was the access to cutting-edge research into digital computers being done under military auspices. IBM neglected, however, to gain an even more dominant role in the nascent industry by allowing the RAND Corporation to take over the job of programming the new computers, because, according to one project participant, Robert P. Crago, \"we couldn't imagine where we could absorb two thousand programmers at IBM when this job would be over some day, which shows how well we were understanding the future at that time.\" IBM would use its experience designing massive, integrated real-time networks with SAGE to design its SABRE airline reservation system, which met with much success.\n\nThese government partnerships, combined with pioneering computer technology research and a series of commercially successful products (IBM's 700 series of computer systems, the IBM 650, the IBM 305 RAMAC (with disk drive memory), and the IBM 1401) enabled IBM to emerge from the 1950s as the world's leading technology firm. Watson Jr. had answered his self-doubt. In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than 4000 were IBM machines.\n\nOn April 7, 1964, IBM introduced the revolutionary System/360, the first large \"family\" of computers to use interchangeable software and peripheral equipment, a departure from IBM's existing product line of incompatible machines, each of which was designed to solve specific customer requirements. The idea of a general-purpose machine was considered a gamble at the time. Within two years, the System/360 became the dominant mainframe computer in the marketplace and its architecture became a de facto industry standard. During this time, IBM transformed from a medium-sized maker of tabulating equipment and typewriters into the world's largest computer company.\n\nThe company began four decades of Olympic sponsorship with the 1960 Winter Games in Squaw Valley, California. It became a recognized leader in corporate social responsibility, joining federal equal opportunity programs in 1962, opening an inner city manufacturing plant in 1968, and creating a minority supplier program. It led efforts to improve data security and protect privacy. It set environmental air/water emissions standards that exceeded those dictated by law, and brought all its facilities into compliance with those standards. It opened one of the world's most advanced research centers in Yorktown, New York. Its international operations grew rapidly, producing more than half of IBM's revenues by the early 1970s and through technology transfer shaping the way governments and businesses operated around the world. Its personnel and technology played an integral role in the space program and landing the first men on the moon in 1969. In that same year it changed the way it marketed its technology to customers, unbundling hardware from software and services, effectively launching today's multibillion-dollar software and services industry. See , below. It was massively profitable, with a nearly fivefold increase in revenues and earnings during the 1960s.\n\nIBM's dominant market share in the mid-1960s led to antitrust inquiries by the U.S. Department of Justice, which filed a complaint for the case \"U.S. v. IBM\" in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on January 17, 1969. The suit alleged that IBM violated the Section 2 of the Sherman Act by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the general purpose electronic digital computer system market, specifically computers designed primarily for business. The case dragged out for 13 years, turning into a resource-sapping war of attrition. In 1982, the Justice Department finally concluded that the case was \"without merit\" and dropped it, but having to operate under the pall of antitrust litigation significantly impacted IBM's business decisions and operations during all of the 1970s and a good portion of the 1980s.\n\nIn 1969 IBM \"unbundled\" software and services from hardware sales. Until this time customers did not pay for software or services separately from the very high price for leasing the hardware. Software was provided at no additional charge, generally in source code form. Services (systems engineering, education and training, system installation) were provided free of charge at the discretion of the IBM Branch office. This practice existed throughout the industry. Quoting from the abstract to a widely read IEEE paper on the topic:\n\nAt the time, the unbundling of services was perhaps the most contentious point, involving antitrust issues that had recently been widely debated in the press and the courts. However, IBM's unbundling of software had long-term impact. After the unbundling, IBM software was divided into two main categories: System Control Programming (SCP), which remained free to customers, and Program Products (PP), which were charged for. This transformed the customer's value proposition for computer solutions, giving a significant monetary value to something that had hitherto essentially been free. This helped enable the creation of a software industry.\n\nSimilarly, IBM services were divided into two categories: general information, which remained free and provided at the discretion of IBM, and on-the-job assistance and training of customer personnel, which were subject to a separate charge and were open to non-IBM customers. This decision vastly expanded the market for independent computing services companies.\n\nThe Golden Decade of the 1960s was a hard act to follow, and the 1970s got off to a troubling start when CEO Thomas J. Watson Jr. suffered a heart attack and retired in 1971. For the first time since 1914 – nearly six decades – IBM would not have a Watson at the helm. Moreover, after just one leadership change over those nearly 60 years, IBM would endure two in two years. T. Vincent Learson, an IBM executive, succeeded Watson as CEO, then quickly retired upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60 in 1973. Following Learson in the CEO office was Frank T. Cary, a 25-year IBMer who had earned his stripes running the fabulously successful data processing division in the 1960s.\n\nDuring Cary's tenure as CEO, the company continued to dominate in hardware. The IBM System/370 was introduced in 1970 as IBM's new mainframe. The S/370 did not prove as technologically revolutionary as its predecessor, the System/360. From a revenue perspective, it more than sustained the cash cow status of the 360. A less successful effort to replicate the 360 mainframe revolution was the Future Systems project. Between 1971 and 1975, IBM investigated the feasibility of a new revolutionary line of products designed to make obsolete all existing products in order to re-establish its technical supremacy. This effort was terminated by IBM's top management in 1975. But by then it had consumed most of the high-level technical planning and design resources, thus jeopardizing progress of the existing product lines (although some elements of FS were later incorporated into actual products). Other IBM innovations during the early 1970s included the IBM 3340 disk unit – introduced in 1973 and known as \"Winchester\" after IBM's internal project name — was an advanced storage technology which more than doubled the information density on disk surfaces. Winchester technology was adopted by the industry and used for the next two decades.\n\nSome 1970s-era IBM technologies emerged to become familiar facets of everyday life. IBM developed magnetic stripe technology in the 1960s, and it became a credit card industry standard in 1971. The IBM-invented floppy disk, also introduced in 1971, became the standard for storing personal computer data during the first decades of the PC era. IBM Research scientist Edgar 'Ted' Codd wrote a seminal paper describing the relational database – an invention that \"Forbes\" magazine described as one of the most important innovations of the 20th century. The IBM Portable Computer, 50 lbs. and $9000 of personal mobility, was introduced in 1975 and presaged – at least in function if not size or price or units sold – the Personal Computer of the 1980s. IBM's 3660 supermarket checkout station, introduced in 1973, used holographic technology to scan product prices from the now-ubiquitous UPC bar code, which itself was based a 1952 IBM patent that became a grocery industry standard. Also in 1973, bank customers began making withdrawals, transfers and other account inquiries via the IBM 3614 Consumer Transaction Facility, an early form of today's Automatic Teller Machines.\n\nIBM had an innovator's role in pervasive technologies that were less visible as well. In 1974, IBM announced Systems Network Architecture (SNA), a networking protocol for computing systems. SNA is a uniform set of rules and procedures for computer communications to free computer users from the technical complexities of communicating through local, national, and international computer networks. SNA became the most widely used system for data processing until more open architecture standards were approved in the 1990s. In 1975, IBM researcher Benoit Mandelbrot conceived fractal geometry—a new geometrical concept that made it possible to describe mathematically the kinds of irregularities existing in nature. Fractals had a great impact on engineering, economics, metallurgy, art and health sciences, and are integral to the field of computer graphics and animation.\n\nA less successful business endeavor for IBM was its entry into the office copier market in 1970. The company was immediately sued by Xerox Corporation for patent infringement. Although Xerox held the patents for the use of selenium as a photoconductor, IBM researchers perfected the use of organic photoconductors which avoided the Xerox patents. The litigation lasted until the late 1970s and was ultimately settled. Despite this victory, IBM never gained traction in the copier market, and withdrew from the marketplace in the 1980s. Organic photoconductors are now widely used in copiers.\n\nThroughout this period, IBM was litigating the massive anti-trust suit filed by the Justice Department in 1969. But in a related bit of case law, the landmark Honeywell v. Sperry Rand U.S. federal court case was concluded in April 1973. The 1964 patent for the ENIAC, the world's first general-purpose electronic digital computer, was found both invalid and unenforceable for a variety of reasons thus putting the invention of the electronic digital computer into the public domain. Further, IBM was ruled to have created a monopoly via its 1956 patent-sharing agreement with Sperry-Rand.\n\nPresident of IBM John R. Opel became CEO in 1981. His company was one of the world's largest and had a 62% share of the mainframe computer market that year. Its share of the overall computer market, however, had declined from 60% in 1970 to 32% in 1980. Perhaps distracted by the long-running antitrust lawsuit, the \"Colossus of Armonk\" completely missed the fast-growing minicomputer market during the 1970s, and was behind rivals such as Wang, Hewlett-Packard (HP), and Control Data in other areas.\n\nIn 1979 \"BusinessWeek\" asked, \"Is IBM just another stodgy, mature company?\" By 1981 its stock price had declined by 22%. IBM's earnings for the first half the year grew by 5.3%—one third of the inflation rate—while those of minicomputer maker Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) grew by more than 35%. The company began selling minicomputers, but in January 1982 the Justice Department ended the antitrust suit because, \"The New York Times\" reported, the government \"recognized what computer experts and securities analysts had long since concluded: I.B.M. no longer dominates the computer business\".\n\nIBM wished to avoid the same outcome with the new personal computer industry. A team led by Don Estridge at the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton built the IBM PC, launched on August 12, 1981. IBM immediately became more of a presence in the consumer marketplace, thanks to the memorable Little Tramp advertising campaign. Though not a spectacular machine by technological standards of the day, the IBM PC brought together all of the most desirable features of a computer into one small machine. It had 128 kilobytes of memory (expandable to 256 kilobytes), one or two floppy disks and an optional color monitor. And it had the prestige of the IBM brand. It was not cheap, but with a base price of US$1,565 it was affordable for businesses – and many businesses purchased PCs. Reassured by the IBM name, they began buying microcomputers on their own budgets aimed at numerous applications that corporate computer departments did not, and in many cases could not, accommodate. Typically, these purchases were not by corporate computer departments, as the PC was not seen as a \"proper\" computer. Purchases were often instigated by middle managers and senior staff who saw the potential – once the revolutionary VisiCalc spreadsheet, the killer app, had been surpassed by a far more powerful and stable product, Lotus 1-2-3.\n\nBy 1985 IBM was so dominant that competitors and analysts speculated that it would again be sued for antitrust. \"Datamation\" and others said that IBM's continued growth might hurt the United States, by suppressing competitors with new technology. Gartner Group estimated that of the 100 largest data-processing companies, IBM had 41% of all revenue and 69% of profit. Its computer revenue was about nine times that of second-place DEC, and larger than that of IBM's six largest Japanese competitors combined. IBM's profit margin of 22% was three times the 6.7% average for the other 99 companies. Some companies complained to Congress, ADAPSO discussed the company with the Justice Department, and European governments worried about IBM's influence but feared affecting its more than 100,000 employees there at 19 facilities.\n\nHowever, the company soon lost its lead in both PC hardware and software, thanks in part to its unprecedented (for IBM) decision to contract PC components to outside companies like Microsoft and Intel. Up to this point in its history, IBM relied on a vertically integrated strategy, building most key components of its systems itself, including processors, operating systems, peripherals, databases and the like. In an attempt to accelerate the time-to-market for the PC, IBM chose not to build a proprietary operating system and microprocessor. Instead, it sourced these vital components from Microsoft and Intel respectively. Ironically, in a decade which marked the end of IBM's monopoly, it was this fateful decision by IBM that passed the sources of its monopolistic power (operating system and processor architecture) to Microsoft and Intel, paving the way for rise of PC compatibles and the creation of hundreds of billions of dollars of market value outside of IBM.\n\nJohn Akers became IBM's CEO in 1985. During the 1980s, IBM's significant investment in building a world class research organization produced four Nobel Prize winners in physics, achieved breakthroughs in mathematics, memory storage and telecommunications, and made great strides in expanding computing capabilities. In 1980, IBM Research legend John Cocke introduced Reduced Instruction Set Technology (RISC). Cocke received both the National Medal of Technology and the National Medal of Science for his innovation, but IBM itself failed to recognize the importance of RISC, and lost the lead in RISC technology to Sun. In 1984 the company partnered with Sears to develop a pioneering online home banking and shopping service for home PCs that launched in 1988 as Prodigy. Despite a strong reputation and anticipating many of the features, functions, and technology that characterize the online experience of today, the venture was plagued by extremely conservative management decisions, and was eventually sold in the mid-1990s. The IBM token-ring local area network, introduced in 1985, permitted personal computer users to exchange information and share printers and files within a building or complex. In 1988, IBM partnered with the University of Michigan and MCI Communications to create the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet), an important step in the creation of the Internet. But within five years the company backed away from this early lead in Internet protocols and router technologies in order to support its existing SNA cash cow, thereby missing a boom market of the 1990s. Still, IBM investments and advances in microprocessors, disk drives, network technologies, software applications, and online commerce in the 1980s set the stage for the emergence of the connected world in the 1990s.\n\nBut by the end of the decade, IBM was clearly in trouble. It was a bloated organization of some 400,000 employees that was heavily invested in low margin, transactional, commodity businesses. Technologies IBM invented and or commercialized – DRAM, hard disk drives, the PC, electric typewriters – were starting to erode. The company had a massive international organization characterized by redundant processes and functions – its cost structure couldn’t compete with smaller, less diversified competitors. And then the back-to-back revolutions – the PC and the client server – did the unthinkable. They combined to dramatically undermine IBM's core mainframe business. The PC revolution placed computers directly in the hands of millions of people. It was followed by the client/server revolution, which sought to link all of those PCs (the \"clients\") with larger computers that labored in the background (the \"servers\" that served data and applications to client machines). Both revolutions transformed the way customers viewed, used and bought technology. And both fundamentally rocked IBM. Businesses' purchasing decisions were put in the hands of individuals and departments – not the places where IBM had long-standing customer relationships. Piece-part technologies took precedence over integrated solutions. The focus was on the desktop and personal productivity, not on business applications across the enterprise. As a result, earnings – which had been at or above US$5 billion since the early 1980s, dropped by more than a third to US$3 billion in 1989. A brief spike in earnings in 1990 proved illusory as corporate spending continued to shift from high profit margin mainframes to lower margin microprocessor-based systems. In addition, corporate downsizing was in full swing.\n\nAkers tried to stop the bleeding – desperate moves and radical changes were considered and implemented. As IBM assessed the situation, it was clear that competition and innovation in the computer industry was now taking place along segmented, versus vertically integrated lines, where leaders emerged in their respective domains. Examples included Intel in microprocessors, Microsoft in desktop software, Novell in networking, HP in printers, Seagate in disk drives and Oracle Corporation in database software. IBM's dominance in personal computers was challenged by the likes of Compaq and later Dell. Recognizing this trend, management, with the support of the Board of Directors, began to implement a plan to split IBM into increasingly autonomous business units (e.g. processors, storage, software, services, printers, etc.) to compete more effectively with competitors that were more focused and nimble and had lower cost structures.\n\nIBM also began shedding businesses that it felt were no longer core. It sold its typewriter, keyboard, and printer business – the organization that created the popular \"Selectric\" typewriter with its floating \"golf ball\" type element in the 1960s – to the investment firm of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Inc. and became an independent company, Lexmark Inc..\n\nThese efforts failed to halt the slide. A decade of steady acceptance and widening corporate growth of local area networking technology, a trend headed by Novell Inc. and other vendors, and its logical counterpart, the ensuing decline of mainframe sales, brought about a wake-up call for IBM. After two consecutive years of reporting losses in excess of $1 billion, on January 19, 1993, IBM announced a US$8.10 billion loss for the 1992 financial year, which was then the largest single-year corporate loss in U.S. history. All told, between 1991 and 1993, the company posted net losses of nearly $16 billion. IBM's three-decade long Golden Age, triggered by Watson Jr. in the 1950s, was over. The computer industry now viewed IBM as no longer relevant, an organizational dinosaur. And hundreds of thousands of IBMers lost their jobs, including CEO John Akers.\n\nIn April 1993, IBM hired Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. as its new CEO. For the first time since 1914 IBM had recruited a leader from outside its ranks. Gerstner had been chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco for four years, and had previously spent 11 years as a top executive at American Express. Gerstner brought with him a customer-oriented sensibility and the strategic-thinking expertise that he had honed through years as a management consultant at McKinsey & Co.. Recognizing that his first priority was to stabilize the company, he adopted a triage mindset and took quick, dramatic action. His early decisions included recommitting to the mainframe, selling the Federal Systems Division to Loral in order to replenish the company's cash coffers, continuing to shrink the workforce (reaching a low of 220,000 employees in 1994), and driving significant cost reductions within the company. Most importantly, Gerstner decided to reverse the move to spin off IBM business units into separate companies. He recognized that one of IBM's enduring strengths was its ability to provide integrated solutions for customers – someone who could represent more than piece parts or components. Splitting the company would have destroyed that unique IBM advantage.\n\nThese initial steps worked. IBM was in the black by 1994, turning a profit of $3 billion. Stabilization was not Gerstner's endgame – the restoration of IBM's once great reputation was. To do that, he needed to devise a winning business strategy. Over the next decade, Gerstner crafted a business model that shed commodity businesses and focused on high-margin opportunities. IBM divested itself of low margin industries (DRAM, IBM Network, personal printers, and hard drives). The company regained the business initiative by building upon the decision to keep the company whole – it unleashed a global services business that rapidly rose to become a leading technology integrator. Crucial to this success was the decision to become brand agnostic – IBM integrated whatever technologies the client required, even if they were from an IBM competitor. IBM augmented this services business with the 2002 acquisition of the consultancy division of PricewaterhouseCoopers for $3.5 billion US.\n\nAnother high margin opportunity IBM invested heavily in was software, a strategic move that proved equally visionary. Starting in 1995 with its acquisition of Lotus Development Corp., IBM built up its software portfolio from one brand, DB2, to five: DB2, Lotus, WebSphere, Tivoli, and Rational. Content to leave the consumer applications business to other firms, IBM's software strategy focused on middleware – the vital software that connects operating systems to applications. The middleware business played to IBM's strengths, and its higher margins improved the company's bottom line significantly as the century came to an end.\n\nNot all software that IBM developed was successful. While OS/2 was arguably technically superior to Microsoft Windows 95, OS/2 sales were largely concentrated in networked computing used by corporate professionals. OS/2 failed to develop much penetration in the consumer and stand-alone desktop PC segments. There were reports that it could not be installed properly on IBM's own Aptiva series of home PCs. Microsoft made an offer in 1994 where if IBM ended development of OS/2 completely, then it would receive the same terms as Compaq for a license of Windows 95. IBM refused and instead went with an \"IBM First\" strategy of promoting OS/2 Warp and disparaging Windows, as IBM aimed to drive sales of its own software and hardware. By 1995, Windows 95 negotiations between IBM and Microsoft, which were difficult, stalled when IBM purchased Lotus Development whose Lotus SmartSuite would have directly competed with Microsoft Office. As a result, IBM received their license later than their competitors which hurt sales of IBM PCs. IBM officials later conceded that OS/2 would not have been a viable operating system to keep them in the PC business.\n\nWhile IBM hardware and technologies were relatively de-emphasized in Gerstner's three-legged business model, they were not relegated to secondary status. The company brought its world-class research organization to bear more closely on its existing product lines and development processes. While Internet applications and deep computing overtook client servers as key business technology priorities, mainframes returned to relevance. IBM reinvigorated their mainframe line with CMOS technologies, which made them among the most powerful and cost efficient in the marketplace. Investments in microelectronics research and manufacturing made IBM a world leader in specialized, high margin chip production – it developed 200 mm wafer processes in 1992, and 300 mm wafers within the decade. IBM-designed chips are currently used in PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii game consoles. IBM also regained the lead in supercomputing with high-end machines based upon scalable parallel processor technology.\n\nEqually significant in IBM's revival was its successful reentry into the popular mindset. Part of this revival was based on IBM technology. On October 5, 1992, at the COMDEX computer expo, IBM announced the first ThinkPad laptop computer, the 700c. The ThinkPad, a premium machine which then cost US$4350, included a 25 MHz Intel 80486SL processor, a 10.4-inch active matrix display, removable 120 MB hard drive, 4 MB RAM (expandable to 16 MB) and a TrackPoint II pointing device. The striking black design by noted designer Richard Sapper made the ThinkPad an immediate hit with the digerati, and the cool factor of the ThinkPad brought back some of the cachet to the IBM brand that was lost in the PC wars of the 1980s. Instrumental to this popular resurgence was the 1997 chess match between IBM's chess-playing computer system Deep Blue and reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov. Deep Blue's victory was a historic first for a computer over a reigning world champion. Also helping the company reclaim its position as a technology leader was its annual domination of supercomputer rankings and patent leadership statistics. Ironically, a serendipitous contributor in reviving the company's reputation was the Dot-com bubble collapse in 2000, where many of the edgy technology high flyers of the 1990s failed to survive the downturn. These collapses discredited some of the more fashionable Internet-driven business models that stodgy IBM was previously compared against.\n\nAnother part of the successful reentry into the popular mindset was the company's revival of the IBM brand. The company's marketing during the economic downturn was chaotic, presenting many different, sometimes discordant voices in the marketplace. This brand chaos was attributable in part to the company having 70 different advertising agencies in its employ. In 1994, IBM eliminated this chaos by consolidating its advertising in one agency. The result was a coherent, consistent message to the marketplace.\n\nAs IBM recovered its financial footing and its industry leadership position, the company remained aggressive in preaching to the industry that it was not the Old IBM, that it had learned from its near death experiences, and that it had been fundamentally changed by them. It sought to redefine the Internet age in ways that played to traditional IBM strengths, couching the discussion in business-centric manners with initiatives like ecommerce and On Demand. And it supported open source initiatives, forming collaborative ventures with partners and competitors alike.\n\nChange was manifested in IBM in other ways as well. The company revamped its varied philanthropic practices to bring a sharp focus on improving K-12 education. It ended its 40-year technology partnership with the International Olympic Committee after a successful engagement at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. On the human resources front, IBM's adoption and integration of diversity principles and practices was cutting edge. It added sexual orientation to its non-discrimination practices in 1984, in 1995 created executive diversity task forces, and in 1996 offered domestic partner benefits to its employees. The company is routinely listed as among the best places for employees, employees of color, and women to work. And in 1996, the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame inducted three IBMers as part of its inaugural class of 10 women: Ruth Leach Amonette, the first woman to hold an executive position at IBM; Barbara Grant, PhD, first woman to be named an IBM site general manager; and Linda Sanford, the highest – placed technical woman in IBM. Fran Allen – an early software pioneer and another IBM hero for her innovative work in compilers over the decades – was inducted in 1997.\n\nGerstner retired at the end of 2002, and was replaced by long-time IBMer Samuel J. Palmisano.\n\nThe story of IBM's hardware is intertwined with the story of the computer industry – from vacuum tubes, to transistors, to integrated circuits, to microprocessors and beyond. The following systems and series represent key steps:\n\n\nIBM operating systems have paralleled hardware development. On early systems, operating systems represented a relatively modest level of investment, and were essentially viewed as an adjunct to the hardware. By the time of the System/360, however, operating systems had assumed a much larger role, in terms of cost, complexity, importance, and risk.\n\nMainframe operating systems include:\n\n\nOther platforms with important operating systems include:\n\n\nEarly IBM computer systems, like those from many other vendors, were programmed using assembly language. Computer science efforts through the 1950s and early 1960s led to the development of many new high-level languages (HLL) for programming. IBM played a complicated role in this process. Hardware vendors were naturally concerned about the implications of portable languages that would allow customers to pick and choose among vendors without compatibility problems. IBM, in particular, helped create barriers that tended to lock customers into a single platform.\n\nIBM had a significant role in the following major computer languages:\n\nIBM developed a schizophrenic relationship with the UNIX and Linux worlds. The importance of IBM's large computer business placed strange pressures on all of IBM's attempts to develop other lines of business. All IBM projects faced the risk of being seen as competing against company priorities. This was because, if a customer decided to build an application on an RS/6000 platform, this also meant that a decision had been made \"against\" a mainframe platform. So despite having some excellent technology, IBM often placed itself in a compromised position.\n\nA case in point is IBM's GFIS products for infrastructure management and GIS applications. Despite long having a dominant position in such industries as electric, gas, and water utilities, IBM stumbled badly in the 1990s trying to build workstation-based solutions to replace its old mainframe-based products. Customers were forced to move on to new technologies from other vendors; many felt betrayed by IBM.\n\nIBM embraced open source technologies in the 1990s. It later became embroiled in a complex litigation with SCO group over intellectual property rights related to the UNIX and Linux platforms.\n\n1983 saw the announcement of the System/36, the replacement for the System/34. And in 1988, IBM announced the AS/400, intended to represent a point of convergence for both System/36 customers and System/38 customers. The 1970s had seen IBM develop a range of Billing, Inventory Control, Accounts Receivable, & Sales Analysis (BICARSA ) applications for specific industries: construction (CMAS), distribution (DMAS) and manufacturing (MMAS), all written in the RPG II language. By the end of the 1980s, IBM had almost completely withdrawn from the BICARSA applications marketplace. Because of developments in the antitrust cases against IBM brought by the US government and European Union, IBM sales representatives were now able to work openly with application software houses as partners. (For a period in the early 1980s, a 'rule of three' operated, which obliged IBM sales representatives, if they were to propose a third-party application to a customer, to also list at least two other third-party vendors in the IBM proposal. This caused some amusement to the customer, who would typically have engaged in intense negotiations with one of the third parties and probably not have heard of the other two vendors.)\n\nIBM has largely been known for its overtaking UNIVAC's early 1950s public fame, then leading in the computer industry for much of the latter part of the century. However it has also had roles, some significant, in other industries, including:\n\n\nFor IBM's corporate biographies of former CEOs and many others see: IBM Archives Biographies Builders reference room\n\n See also History of IBM research in Israel\n\nA significant part of IBM's operations were FSD's contracts with the U.S. Federal Government for a wide range of projects ranging from the Department of Defense to the National Security Agency. These projects spanned mundane administrative processing to top secret supercomputing. In NASA's Apollo Program, the \"brains\" of each Saturn rocket was the Instrument Unit built by the IBM Space Systems Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Founded in 1957, FSD was sold to Loral in 1994.\n\nIBM had subsidiaries and operations in 70 countries in its early years. They included Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, Sweden, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, and others.\n\nIBM's early dominance of the computer industry was in part due to its strong professional services activities. IBM's advantage in building software for its own computers eventually was seen as monopolistic, leading to antitrust proceedings. As a result, a complex, artificial \"arms-length\" relationship was created separating IBM's computer business from its service organizations. This situation persisted for decades. An example was IBM Global Services, a huge services firm that competed with the likes of Electronic Data Systems or Computer Sciences Corporation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Thomas J. Watson\n\nThomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 – June 19, 1956) was an American businessman. He served as the chairman and CEO of International Business Machines (IBM) He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson developed IBM's management style and corporate culture from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR. He turned the company into a highly-effective selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating machines. A leading self-made industrialist, he was one of the richest men of his time and was called the world's greatest salesman when he died in 1956.\n\nThomas J. Watson was born in Campbell, New York, the fifth child and only son of Thomas and Jane Fulton White Watson. His four older siblings were all girls —Jennie, Effie, Loua, and Emma. His father farmed and owned a modest lumber business located near Painted Post, a few miles west of Elmira, in the Southern Tier region of New York. Thomas worked on the family farm in East Campbell, New York and attended the District School Number Five in the late 1870s. As Watson entered his teen years he attended Addison Academy In Addison, New York.\n\nHaving given up his first job—teaching—after just one day, Watson took a year's course in accounting and business at the Miller School of Commerce in Elmira. He left the school in 1891, taking a job at $6 a week as bookkeeper for Clarence Risley's Market in Painted Post. One year later he joined a traveling salesman, George Cornwell, peddling organs and pianos around the farms for William Bronson's local hardware store, Watson's first sales job. When Cornwell left, Watson continued alone, earning $10 per week. After two years of this life, he realized he would be earning $70 per week if he were on a commission. His indignation on making this discovery was such that he quit and moved from his familiar surroundings to the relative metropolis of Buffalo.\n\nWatson then spent a very brief period selling sewing machines for Wheeler and Wilcox. According to Tom Watson, Jr., in his autobiography: One day my dad went into a roadside saloon to celebrate a sale and had too much to drink. When the bar closed, he found that his entire rig—horse, buggy, and samples—had been stolen. Wheeler and Wilcox fired him and dunned him for the lost property. Word got around, of course, and it took Dad more than a year to find another steady job. Watson would later enforce strict rules at IBM against alcohol consumption, even off the job. According to Tom Jr.: This anecdote never made it into IBM lore, which is too bad, because it would have helped explain Father to the tens of thousands of people who had to follow his rules.\n\nWatson's next job was peddling shares of the Buffalo Building and Loan Company for a huckster named C. B. Barron, a showman renowned for his disreputable conduct, which Watson, as a lifelong Methodist, deplored. Barron absconded with the commission and the loan funds. Next Watson opened a butcher shop in Buffalo, which soon failed, leaving Watson with no money, no investment, and no job.\n\nWatson had a newly acquired NCR cash register in his butcher shop, for which he had to arrange transfer of the installment payments to the new owner of the butcher shop. On visiting NCR, he met John J. Range and asked him for a job. Determined to join the company, he repeatedly called on Range until, after a number of abortive attempts, he finally was hired in November, 1896, as sales apprentice to Range.\n\nLed by John Patterson, NCR was then one of the leading selling organizations, and John J. Range, its Buffalo branch manager, became almost a father figure for Watson and was a model for his sales and management style. Certainly in later years, in a 1952 interview, he claimed he learned more from Range than anyone else. But at first, he was a poor salesman, until Range took him personally in hand. Then he became the most successful salesman in the East, earning $100 per week.\n\nFour years later, NCR assigned Watson to run the struggling NCR agency in Rochester, New York. As an agent, he got 35% commission and reported directly to Hugh Chalmers, the second-in-command at NCR. In four years Watson made Rochester effectively an NCR monopoly by using the technique of knocking the main competitor, Hallwood, out of business, sometimes resorting to sabotage of the competitor's machines. As a reward he was called to the NCR head office in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nIn 1912, the company was found guilty of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Patterson, Watson, and 26 other NCR executives and managers were convicted for illegal anti-competitive sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Their convictions were unpopular with the public because of the efforts of Patterson and Watson to help those affected by the Dayton, Ohio floods of 1913, but efforts to have them pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson were unsuccessful. However, their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1915 on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted.\n\nCharles Ranlett Flint who had engineered the amalgamation (via stock acquisition) forming the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) found it difficult to manage the five companies. He hired Watson as general manager on May 1, 1914 when the five companies had about 1,300 employees. Eleven months later he was made president when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved. Within four years revenues had been doubled to $9 million. In 1924, he renamed CTR to International Business Machines. Watson built IBM into such a dominant company that the federal government filed a civil antitrust suit against it in 1952. IBM owned and leased to its customers more than 90 percent of all tabulating machines in the United States at the time. When Watson died in 1956, IBM's revenues were $897 million, and the company had 72,500 employees.\n\nThroughout his life, Watson maintained a deep interest in international relations, from both a diplomatic and a business perspective. He was known as President Roosevelt's unofficial ambassador in New York and often entertained foreign statesmen.In 2001, a book called IBM and the Holocaust described how Mr. Watson\nprovided the tabulating equipment Hitler used to round up the Jews. His\nHollerith punch-card machines are in the Holocaust Museum today.\nThe book describes IBMʼs punch cards as “a card with standardized holes,”\neach representing a different trait of the individual. The card was fed into a\nʻreaderʼ and sorted. Punch cards identified Jews by name. Each one served\nas “a nineteenth-century bar code for human beings.” In 1937, he was elected president of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and at that year's biennial congress in Berlin stated the conference keynote to be \"World Peace Through World Trade\". That phrase became the slogan of both the ICC and IBM.\nWatson's merger of diplomacy and business was not always lauded. During the 1930s, IBM's German subsidiary was its most profitable foreign operation, and a 2001 book by Edwin Black, \"IBM and the Holocaust\", argues that Watson's pursuit of profit led him to personally approve and spearhead IBM's strategic technological relationship with Nazi Germany. In particular, critics point to the coveted Order of the German Eagle medal that Watson received at the Berlin ICC meeting in 1937, as evidence that he was being honored for the help that IBM's German subsidiary Dehomag (Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft mbH) and its punch card machines provided the Nazi regime, particularly in the tabulation of census data (i.e. location of Jews). Another study argues that Watson believed, perhaps naively, that the medal was in recognition of his years of labor on behalf of global commerce and international peace. Within a year of the Berlin congress though, where Watson's hopes had run high, he found himself strongly protesting the German policy toward the Jews. Because of his strong feelings about the issue, Watson wanted to return his German citation shortly after receiving it. When Secretary of State Hull advised him against that course of action, he gave up the idea until the spring of 1940. Then Hull refused advice, and Watson sent the medal back in June 1940. Dehomag's management disapproved of Watson's action and considered separating from IBM. This occurred when Germany declared war on the United States in December 1941, and the German shareholders took custody of the Dehomag operation. But during World War II, IBM subsidiaries in occupied Europe never stopped delivery of punch cards to Dehomag, and documents uncovered show that senior executives at IBM world headquarters in New York took great pains to maintain legal authority over Dehomag's operations and assets through the personal intervention of IBM managers in neutral Switzerland, directed via personal communications and private letters.\n\nDuring this same period, IBM became more deeply involved in the war effort for the U.S., focusing on producing large quantities of data processing equipment for the military and experimenting with analog computers. Watson, Sr. also developed the \"1% doctrine\" for war profits which mandated that IBM receive no more than 1% profit from the sales of military equipment to U.S. Government. Watson was one of the few CEOs to develop such a policy.\n\nIn 1941, Watson received the third highest salary and compensation package in the U.S., $517,221, on which he paid 69% in tax.\n\nWatson had a personal interest in the progress of the war. His eldest son, Thomas J. Watson Jr., joined the United States Army Air Corps where he became a bomber pilot. He was soon hand-picked to become the assistant and personal pilot for General Follet Bradley, who was in charge of all Lend-Lease equipment supplied to the Soviet Union from the United States. Watson, Sr.'s youngest son, Arthur K. Watson, also joined the military during the conflict.\n\nWatson worked with local leaders to create a college in the Binghamton area, where IBM was founded and had major plants. In 1946, IBM provided land and funding for Triple Cities College, an extension of Syracuse University. Later it became known as Harpur College, and eventually evolved into Binghamton University. Its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named the Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The IBM plant in the neighboring city of Endicott has since downsized drastically, however.\n\nAfter World War II, Watson began work to further the extent of IBM's influence abroad and in 1949, he created the IBM World Trade Corporation in order to oversee IBM's foreign business.\n\nOn May 8, 1956 Watson retired and his oldest son, Thomas J. Watson, Jr assumed the position of CEO. He died on June 19, 1956 in Manhattan, New York City. He was interred in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.\n\nWatson married Jeanette Kittredge, from a prominent Dayton, Ohio railroad family, on April 17, 1913. They had two sons and two daughters.\n\n\nAs a Democrat (after his criminal indictment by the Taft Administration), Watson was an ardent supporter of Roosevelt. He was one of the most prominent businessmen in the Democratic Party. He was considered Roosevelt's strongest supporter in the business community.\n\nIn 1936 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision that IBM, together with Remington Rand, should cease its practice of requiring its customers to buy their punch cards from it alone. The ruling made little difference because IBM was the only effective supplier to the market, and profits continued undiminished.\n\nWatson served as a powerful trustee of Columbia University from June 6, 1933 until his death. He engineered the selection of Dwight D. Eisenhower as its president and played the central role in convincing Eisenhower to become president of the university. Additionally, he served as a trustee of Lafayette College and is the namesake of Watson Hall, a campus residence hall.\n\nIn 1939, he received an honorary degree in Doctor of Commercial Science from Oglethorpe University.\n\nIn the 1940s, Watson was on the national executive board of the Boy Scouts of America and served for a time as international Scout commissioner. E. Urner Goodman recounts that the elderly Watson attended an international Scout commissioners' meeting in Switzerland, where the IBM founder asked not to be put on a pedestal. Before the conference was over, Goodman relates, Watson \"... sat by that campfire, in Scout uniform, 'chewing the fat' like the rest of the boys\". He received the Silver Buffalo Award in 1944. His son, Thomas Jr., later served as National president of the Boy Scouts of America from 1964 to 1968.\n\nWatson was chairman of the Elmira College centennial committee in 1955 and donated Watson Hall, primarily a music and mathematics academic building.\n\nHe was posthumously inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nAlthough Watson is well known for his alleged 1943 statement, \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers,\" there is scant evidence he said it. Author Kevin Maney tried to find the origin of the quote, but has been unable to locate any speeches or documents of Watson's that contain this, nor are the words present in any contemporary articles about IBM. One of the very first attributions may be found in \"The Experts Speak\", a book written by Christopher Cerf and Victor S. Navasky in 1984, however Cerf and Navasky just quote from a book written by Morgan and Langford, \"Facts and Fallacies\". Another early article source (May 15, 1985) is a column by Neil Morgan, a San Diego Evening Tribune writer who wrote: \"Forrest Shumway, chairman of The Signal Cos., doesn't make predictions. His role model is Tom Watson, then IBM chairman, who said in 1958: 'I think there is a world market for about five computers. The earliest known citation on the Internet is from 1986 on Usenet in the signature of a poster from Convex Computer Corporation as I think there is a world market for about five computers' —Remark attributed to Thomas J. Watson (Chairman of the Board of International Business Machines), 1943\". All these early quotes are questioned by Eric Weiss, an editor of the \"Annals of the History of Computing\" in ACS letters in 1985.\n\nThere are documented versions of similar quotes by other people in the early history of the computer. In 1946 Sir Charles Darwin (grandson of the famous naturalist), head of Britain's NPL (National Physical Laboratory), where research into computers was taking place, wrote: it is very possible that ... one machine would suffice to solve all the problems that are demanded of it from the whole country.\n\nIn 1985 the story was discussed on Usenet (in net.misc), without Watson's name being attached. The original discussion has not survived, but an explanation has; it attributes a very similar quote to the Cambridge mathematician Professor Douglas Hartree, around 1951:\nI went to see Professor Douglas Hartree, who had built the first differential analyzers in England and had more experience in using these very specialized computers than anyone else. He told me that, in his opinion, all the calculations that would ever be needed in this country could be done on the three digital computers which were then being built—one in Cambridge, one in Teddington, and one in Manchester. No one else, he said, would ever need machines of their own, or would be able to afford to buy them.\n\nHoward H. Aiken made a similar statement in 1952:\nOriginally one thought that if there were a half dozen large computers in this country, hidden away in research laboratories, this would take care of all requirements we had throughout the country.\n\nThe story already had been described as a myth in 1973; the \"Economist\" quoted a Mr. Maney as \"revealing that Watson never made his oft-quoted prediction that there was 'a world market for maybe five computers. \n\nSince the attribution typically is used to demonstrate the fallacy of predictions, if Watson had made such a prediction in 1943, then, as Gordon Bell pointed out in his ACM 50 years celebration keynote, it would have held true for some ten years.\n\nThe IBM archives of Frequently Asked Questions notes an inquiry about whether he said in the 1950s that he foresaw a market potential for only five electronic computers. The document says no, but quotes his son and then IBM President Thomas J. Watson, Jr., at the annual IBM stockholders meeting, April 28, 1953, as speaking about the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, which it identifies as \"the company's first production computer designed for scientific calculations\". He said that \"IBM had developed a paper plan for such a machine and took this paper plan across the country to some 20 concerns that we thought could use such a machine. I would like to tell you that the machine rents for between $12,000 and $18,000 a month, so it was not the type of thing that could be sold from place to place. But, as a result of our trip, on which we expected to get orders for five machines, we came home with orders for 18.\" Watson, Jr., later gave a slightly different version of the story in his autobiography, where he said the initial market sampling indicated 11 firm takers and 10 more prospective orders.\n\n\"THINK\" - Watson began using \"THINK\" to motivate, or inspire, staff while at NCR and continued to use it at CTR. International Business Machines's first U.S. trademark was for the name \"THINK\" filed as a U.S. trademark on June 6, 1935, with the description \"periodical publications\". This trademark was filed fourteen years before the company filed for a U.S. trademark on the name IBM. A biographical article in 1940 noted that \"This word is on the most conspicuous wall of every room in every IBM building. Each employee carries a THINK notebook in which to record inspirations. The company stationery, matches, scratch pads all bear the inscription, THINK. A monthly magazine called 'Think' is distributed to the employees.\" THINK remains a part of IBM's corporate culture; it was the inspiration behind naming IBM's successful line of notebook computers, IBM ThinkPad. In 2007, IBM Mid America Employees Federal Credit Union changed its name to Think Mutual Bank.\n\n\n\n",
                "IBM\n\nIBM (International Business Machines Corporation) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, United States, with operations in over 170 countries. The company originated in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed \"International Business Machines\" in 1924.\n\nIBM manufactures and markets computer hardware, middleware and software, and provides hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM is also a major research organization, holding the record for most patents generated by a business (as of 2018) for 25 consecutive years. Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM), the PC, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIBM has continually shifted its business mix by commoditizing markets focusing on higher-value, more profitable markets. This includes spinning off printer manufacturer Lexmark in 1991 and selling off its personal computer (ThinkPad/ThinkCentre) and x86-based server businesses to Lenovo (2005 and 2014, respectively), and acquiring companies such as PwC Consulting (2002), SPSS (2009), and The Weather Company (2016). Also in 2014, IBM announced that it would go \"fabless\", continuing to design semiconductors, but offloading manufacturing to GlobalFoundries.\n\nNicknamed Big Blue, IBM is one of 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and one of the world's largest employers, with (as of 2016) nearly 380,000 employees. Known as \"IBMers\", IBM employees have been awarded five Nobel Prizes, six Turing Awards, ten National Medals of Technology and five National Medals of Science.\n\nIn the 1880s, technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of International Business Machines (IBM). Alp Qasimov patented the computing scale in 1885; Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888); Herman Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine; and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record a worker's arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889. On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York. The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto. They manufactured machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards. Thomas J. Watson, Sr., fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson, called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered CTR. Watson joined CTR as \"General Manager\" then, 11 months later, was made \"President\" when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved. Having learned Patterson's pioneering business practices, Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR's companies. He implemented sales conventions, \"generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker\". His favorite slogan, \"THINK\", became a mantra for each company's employees. During Watson's first four years, revenues reached $9 million and the company's operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. \"Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR\" and in 1924 chose to replace it with the more expansive title \"International Business Machines\". By 1933 most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company, IBM.\nIn 1937, IBM's tabulating equipment enabled organizations to process unprecedented amounts of data, its clients including the U.S. Government, during its first effort to maintain the employment records for 26 million people pursuant to the Social Security Act, and Hitler's Third Reich, largely through the German subsidiary Dehomag. During the Second World War the company produced small arms for the American war effort (M1 Carbine, and Browning Automatic Rifle).\n\nIn 1949, Thomas Watson, Sr., created IBM World Trade Corporation, a subsidiary of IBM focused on foreign operations. In 1952, he stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm, and his son Thomas Watson, Jr. was named president. In 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of artificial intelligence when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an IBM 704 not merely to play checkers but \"learn\" from its own experience. In 1957, the FORTRAN scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, IBM developed the SABRE reservation system for American Airlines and introduced the highly successful Selectric typewriter. In 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flight of the Mercury astronauts. A year later, it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to Armonk, New York. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights and 1969 lunar mission.\n\nOn April 7, 1964, IBM announced the first computer system family, the IBM System/360. It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the IBM System/370 in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They, and the operating systems that ran on them such as OS/VS1 and MVS, and the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor, had a near-monopoly-level hold on the computer industry and became almost synonymous with IBM products due to their marketshare.\n\nIn 1974, IBM engineer George J. Laurer developed the Universal Product Code. IBM and the World Bank first introduced financial swaps to the public in 1981 when they entered into a swap agreement. The IBM PC, originally designated IBM 5150, was introduced in 1981, and it soon became an industry standard. In 1991, IBM sold printer manufacturer Lexmark.\n\nIn 1993, IBM posted a US$8 billion loss - at the time the biggest in American corporate history. Lou Gerstner was hired as CEO from RJR Nabisco to turn the company around. In 2002, IBM acquired PwC consulting, and in 2003 it initiated a project to redefine company values, hosting a three-day online discussion of key business issues with 50,000 employees. The result was three values: \"Dedication to every client's success\", \"Innovation that matters—for our company and for the world\", and \"Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships\".\n\nIn 2005, the company sold its personal computer business to Chinese technology company Lenovo and, in 2009, it acquired software company SPSS Inc. Later in 2009, IBM's Blue Gene supercomputing program was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence program Watson, which was exhibited on \"Jeopardy!\" where it won against game-show champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. The company also celebrated its 100th anniversary on the same year on June 16. In 2012, IBM announced it has agreed to buy Kenexa, and a year later it also acquired SoftLayer Technologies, a web hosting service, in a deal worth around $2 billion.\n\nIn 2014, IBM announced it would sell its x86 server division to Lenovo for a fee of $2.1 billion. Also that year, IBM began announcing several major partnerships with other companies, including Apple Inc., Twitter, Facebook, Tencent, Cisco, UnderArmour, Box, Microsoft, VMware, CSC, Macy's, Sesame Workshop, the parent company of Sesame Street, and Salesforce.com.\n\nIn 2015, IBM announced two major acquisitions: Merge Healthcare for $1 billion and all digital assets from The Weather Company, including Weather.com and the Weather Channel mobile app. Also that year, IBMers created the film \"A Boy and His Atom\", which was the first molecule movie to tell a story. In 2016, IBM acquired video conferencing service Ustream and formed a new cloud video unit. In April 2016, it posted a 14-year low in quarterly sales. The following month, Groupon sued IBM accusing it of patent infringement, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit.\n\nIBM is headquartered in Armonk, New York, a community north of Midtown Manhattan. Its principal building, referred to as CHQ, is a glass and stone edifice on a parcel amid a 432-acre former apple orchard the company purchased in the mid-1950s. There are two other IBM buildings within walking distance of CHQ: the North Castle office, which previously served as IBM's headquarters; and the IBM Learning Center (ILC), a resort hotel and training center, which has 182 guest rooms, 31 meeting rooms, and various amenities.\n\nIBM operates in 174 countries as of 2016, with mobility centers in smaller markets areas and major campuses in the larger ones. In New York City, IBM has several offices besides CHQ, including the IBM Watson headquarters at Astor Place in Manhattan. Outside of New York, major campuses in the United States include Austin, Texas; Research Triangle Park (Raleigh-Durham), North Carolina; Rochester, Minnesota; and Silicon Valley, California.\n\nIBM's real estate holdings are varied and globally diverse. Towers occupied by IBM include 1250 René-Lévesque (Montreal, Canada), Tour Descartes (Paris, France), and One Atlantic Center (Atlanta, Georgia, USA). In Beijing, China, IBM occupies Pangu Plaza, which is the city's seventh tallest building and overlooks Beijing National Stadium (\"Bird's Nest\"), which was home to the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\nOther notable buildings include the IBM Rome Software Lab (Rome, Italy), the Hursley House (Winchester, UK), 330 North Wabash (Chicago, Illinois, United States), the Cambridge Scientific Center (Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States), the IBM Toronto Software Lab (Toronto, Canada), the IBM Building, Johannesburg (Johannesburg, South Africa), the IBM Building (Seattle) (Seattle, Washington, United States), the IBM Hakozaki Facility (Tokyo, Japan), the IBM Yamato Facility (Yamato, Japan), and the IBM Canada Head Office Building (Ontario, Canada). Defunct IBM campuses include the IBM Somers Office Complex (Somers, New York). The company's contributions to industrial architecture and design include works by Eero Saarinen, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and I.M. Pei. Van der Rohe's building in Chicago, the original center of the company's research division post-World War II, was recognized with the 1990 Honor Award from the National Building Museum. IBM was recognized as one of the Top 20 Best Workplaces for Commuters by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2005, which recognized Fortune 500 companies that provided employees with excellent commuter benefits to help reduce traffic and air pollution. In 2004, concerns were raised related to IBM's contribution in its early days to pollution in its original location in Endicott, New York.\n\nIBM has a large and diverse portfolio of products and services. As of 2016, these offerings fall into the categories of cloud computing, cognitive computing, commerce, data and analytics, Internet of Things, IT infrastructure, mobile, and security.\n\nIBM Cloud includes infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) offered through public, private and hybrid cloud delivery models. For instance, the IBM Bluemix PaaS enables developers to quickly create complex websites on a pay-as-you-go model. IBM SoftLayer is a dedicated server, managed hosting and cloud computing provider, which in 2011 reported hosting more than 81,000 servers for more than 26,000 customers. IBM also provides Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES), using cryptographic splitting to secure customer data.\n\nIBM also hosts the industry-wide cloud computing and mobile technologies conference InterConnect each year.\n\nHardware designed by IBM for these categories include IBM's POWER microprocessors, which are employed inside many console gaming systems, including Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo's Wii U. IBM Secure Blue is encryption hardware that can be built into microprocessors, and in 2014, the company revealed it was investing $3 billion over the following five years to design a neural chip that mimics the human brain, with 10 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses, but that uses just 1 kilowatt of power. In 2016, the company launched all-flash arrays designed for small and midsized companies, which includes software for data compression, provisioning, and snapshots across various systems.\n\nIT outsourcing also represents a major service provided by IBM, with more than 40 data centers worldwide. alphaWorks is IBM's source for emerging software technologies, and SPSS is a software package used for statistical analysis. IBM's Kenexa suite provides employment and retention solutions, and includes the BrassRing, an applicant tracking system used by thousands of companies for recruiting. IBM also owns The Weather Company, which provides weather forecasting and includes weather.com and Weather Underground.\n\nSmarter Planet is an initiative that seeks to achieve economic growth, near-term efficiency, sustainable development, and societal progress, targeting opportunities such as smart grids, water management systems, solutions to traffic congestion, and greener buildings.\n\nServices provisions include Redbooks, which are publicly available online books about best practices with IBM products, and developerWorks, a website for software developers and IT professionals with how-to articles and tutorials, as well as software downloads, code samples, discussion forums, podcasts, blogs, wikis, and other resources for developers and technical professionals.\n\nIBM Watson is a technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data. Watson was debuted in 2011 on the American game-show \"Jeopardy!\", where it competed against champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in a three-game tournament and won. Watson has since been applied to business, healthcare, developers, and universities. For example, IBM has partnered with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to assist with considering treatment options for oncology patients and for doing melanoma screenings. Also, several companies have begun using Watson for call centers, either replacing or assisting customer service agents. \n\nResearch has been a part of IBM since its founding, and its organized efforts trace their roots back to 1945, when the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory was founded at Columbia University in New York City, converting a renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side into IBM's first laboratory. Now, IBM Research constitutes the largest industrial research organization in the world, with 12 labs on 6 continents. IBM Research is headquartered at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York, and facilities include the Almaden lab in California, Austin lab in Texas, Australia lab in Melbourne, Brazil lab in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, China lab in Beijing and Shanghai, Ireland lab in Dublin, Haifa lab in Israel, India lab in Delhi and Bangalore, Tokyo lab, Zurich lab and Africa lab in Nairobi.\n\nIn terms of investment, IBM's R&D spend totals several billion dollars each year. In 2012, that expenditure was approximately $6.9 billion USD. Recent allocations have included $1 billion to create a business unit for Watson in 2014, and $3 billion to create a next-gen semiconductor along with $4 billion towards growing the company's \"strategic imperatives\" (cloud, analytics, mobile, security, social) in 2015.\n\nIBM has been a leading proponent of the Open Source Initiative, and began supporting Linux in 1998. The company invests billions of dollars in services and software based on Linux through the IBM Linux Technology Center, which includes over 300 Linux kernel developers. IBM has also released code under different open source licenses, such as the platform-independent software framework Eclipse (worth approximately US$40 million at the time of the donation), the three-sentence International Components for Unicode (ICU) license, and the Java-based relational database management system (RDBMS) Apache Derby. IBM's open source involvement has not been trouble-free, however (see \"SCO v. IBM\").\n\nFamous inventions and developments by IBM include: the Automated teller machine (ATM), Dynamic random access memory (DRAM), the electronic keypunch, the financial swap, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, RISC, the SABRE airline reservation system, SQL, the Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code, and the virtual machine. Additionally, in 1990 company scientists used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms to spell out the company acronym, marking the first structure assembled one atom at a time. A major part of IBM research is the generation of patents. Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device, IBM has been one of the world's most prolific patent sources. In 2018, the company holds the record for most patents generated by a business, marking 25 consecutive years for the achievement.\n\nFive IBMers have received the Nobel Prize: Leo Esaki, of the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., in 1973, for work in semiconductors; Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, of the Zurich Research Center, in 1986, for the scanning tunneling microscope; and Georg Bednorz and Alex Müller, also of Zurich, in 1987, for research in superconductivity. Several IBMers have also won the Turing Award, including the first female recipient Frances E. Allen.\n\nCurrent research includes a collaboration with the University of Michigan to see computers act as an academic adviser for undergraduate computer science and engineering students at the university, and a partnership with AT&T, combining their cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms to make them interoperable and to provide developers with easier tools.\n\nIBM is nicknamed \"Big Blue\" in part due to its blue logo and color scheme, and also partially since IBM once had a de facto dress code of white shirts with blue suits. The company logo has undergone several changes over the years, with its current \"8-bar\" logo designed in 1972 by graphic designer Paul Rand. It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo, since period photocopiers did not render large areas well.\n\nIBM has a valuable brand as a result of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996, IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for the Masters Tournament, one of the four major championships in professional golf, with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), the first course cam (1998), the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009), and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed in the United States for a major sporting event (2016). As a result, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty became the third female member of the Master's governing body, the Augusta National Golf Club. IBM is also a major sponsor in professional tennis, with engagements at the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the Australian Open, and the French Open. The company also sponsored the Olympic Games from 1960–2000, and the National Football League from 2003–2012.\n\nIn 2012, IBM's brand was valued at $75.5 billion and ranked by \"Interbrand\" as the №2 best brand worldwide. That same year, it was also ranked the №1 company for leaders (\"Fortune\"), the №2 green company in the U.S. (\"Newsweek\"), the №2 most respected company (\"Barron's\"), the №5 most admired company (\"Fortune\"), the №18 most innovative company (\"Fast Company\"), and the №1 in technology consulting and №2 in outsourcing (Vault). In 2015, Forbes ranked IBM the №5 most valuable brand.\n\nIBM has one of the largest workforces in the world, and employees at Big Blue are referred to as \"IBMers\". The company was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934), survivor benefits (1935), training for women (1935), paid vacations (1937), and training for disabled people (1942). IBM hired its first black salesperson in 1946, and in 1952, CEO Thomas J. Watson, Jr. published the company's first written equal opportunity policy letter, one year before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education and 11 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Human Rights Campaign has rated IBM 100% on its index of gay-friendliness every year since 2003, with IBM providing same-sex partners of its employees with health benefits and an anti-discrimination clause. Additionally, in 2005, IBM became the first major company in the world to commit formally to not use genetic information in employment decisions; and in 2015, IBM was named to \"Working Mother\"s 100 Best Companies List for the 30th consecutive year.\n\nIBM has several leadership development and recognition programs to recognize employee potential and achievements. For early-career high potential employees, IBM sponsors leadership development programs by discipline (e.g., general management (GMLDP), human resources (HRLDP), finance (FLDP)). Each year, the company also selects 500 IBMers for the IBM Corporate Service Corps (CSC), which has been described as the corporate equivalent of the Peace Corps and gives top employees a month to do humanitarian work abroad. For certain interns, IBM also has a program called Extreme Blue that partners top business and technical students to develop high-value technology and compete to present their business case to the company's CEO at internship's end.\n\nThe company also has various designations for exceptional individual contributors such as Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM), Research Staff Member (RSM), Distinguished Engineer (DE), and Distinguished Designer (DD). Prolific inventors can also achieve patent plateaus and earn the designation of Master Inventor. The company's most prestigious designation is that of IBM Fellow. Since 1963, the company names a handful of Fellows each year based on technical achievement. Other programs recognize years of service such as the Quarter Century Club established in 1924, and sellers are eligible to join the Hundred Percent Club, composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas, convened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Each year, the company also selects 1,000 IBMers annually to award the Best of IBM Award, which includes an all-expenses paid trip to the awards ceremony in an exotic location.\n\nIBM's culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a \"sincere\" tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees. During IBM's management transformation in the 1990s, CEO Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. relaxed these codes, normalizing the dress and behavior of IBM employees. The company's culture has also given to different plays on the company acronym (IBM), with some saying is stands for \"I've Been Moved\" due to relocations and layoffs, others saying it stands for \"I'm By Myself\" pursuant to a prevalent work-from-anywhere norm, and others saying it stands for \"I'm Being Mentored\" due to the company's open door policy and encouragement for mentoring at all levels. In terms of labor relations, the company has traditionally resisted labor union organizing, although unions represent some IBM workers outside the United States. In Japan, IBM employees also have an American football team complete with pro stadium, cheerleaders and televised games, competing in the Japanese X-League as the \"Big Blue\".\n\nIn 2015, IBM started giving employees the option of choosing either a PC or a Mac as their primary work device, resulting in IBM becoming the world's largest Mac shop. In 2016, IBM eliminated forced rankings and changed its annual performance review system to focus more on frequent feedback, coaching, and skills development.\n\nMany IBMers have also achieved notability outside of work and after leaving IBM. In business, former IBM employees include Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, former EDS CEO and politician Ross Perot, Microsoft chairman John W. Thompson, SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su, Citizens Financial Group CEO Ellen Alemany, former Yahoo! chairman Alfred Amoroso, former AT&T CEO C. Michael Armstrong, former Xerox Corporation CEOs David T. Kearns and G. Richard Thoman, former Fair Isaac Corporation CEO Mark N. Greene, Citrix Systems co-founder Ed Iacobucci, ASOS.com chairman Brian McBride, and former Lenovo CEO Steve Ward.\n\nIn government, alumna Patricia Roberts Harris served as United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Cabinet. Samuel K. Skinner served as U.S. Secretary of Transportation and as the White House Chief of Staff. Alumni also include U.S. Senators Mack Mattingly and Thom Tillis; Wisconsin governor Scott Walker; former U.S. Ambassadors Vincent Obsitnik (Slovakia), Arthur K. Watson (France), and Thomas Watson Jr. (Soviet Union); and former U.S. Representatives Todd Akin, Glenn Andrews, Robert Garcia, Katherine Harris, Amo Houghton, Jim Ross Lightfoot, Thomas J. Manton, Donald W. Riegle Jr., and Ed Zschau.\n\nOthers are NASA astronaut Michael J. Massimino, Canadian astronaut Julie Payette, Harvey Mudd College president Maria Klawe, Western Governors University president emeritus Robert Mendenhall, former University of Kentucky president Lee T. Todd Jr., NFL referee Bill Carollo, former Rangers F.C. chairman John McClelland, and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature J. M. Coetzee. Thomas Watson Jr. also served as the 11th national president of the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nThe company's 14 member Board of Directors are responsible for overall corporate management and includes the CEOs of American Express, Ford Motor Company, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Johnson and Johnson, and Cemex.\n\nIn 2011, IBM became the first technology company Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway invested in. As of 2016, he owns 8.51 percent of IBM's shares.\n\n\n"

                "History of IBM\n\nInternational Business Machines, or IBM, nicknamed \"Big Blue\", is a multinational computer technology and IT consulting corporation headquartered in Armonk, New York, United States. IBM originated from the bringing together of several companies that worked to automate routine business transactions. In 1911 the company that leased Unit record equipment, especially Hollerith punched cards and card readers to government bureaus and insurance agencies, became the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR). Thomas J. Watson (1874-1956) took over in 1924, using the name \"International Business Machines.\" IBM expanded into electric typewriters and other office machines. Watson was a salesman and concentrated on building a highly motivated, very well paid sales force that could craft solutions for clients unfamiliar with the latest technology. His motto was \"THINK\"; customers were advised to not \"fold, spindle or mutilate\" the delicate cardboard cards. IBM's first experiments with computers in the 1940s and 1950s were modest advances on the card-based system. Its great breakthrough came in the 1960s with its Model 360 mainframe. IBM offered a full range of hardware, software and service agreements, so that users as their needs grew would stay with \"Big Blue.\" Since most software was custom-written by in-house programmers, and would run on only one brand of computers, it was too expensive to switch brands. Brushing off clone makers, and facing down a federal anti-trust suit, the giant sold reputation and security as well as hardware, and was the most admired American corporation of the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s were cruel to IBM—losses in 1993 exceeded $8 billion—as the mainframe giant failed to adjust quickly enough to the personal computer revolution. Desktop machines had the power needed, and were vastly easier for both users and managers than multimillion-dollar mainframes. IBM did introduce a popular line of microcomputers—but it was too popular. Clone makers undersold IBM, while the profits went to chip makers like Intel or software houses like Microsoft. After a series of reorganizations IBM has become one of the world's largest computer companies and systems integrators. With over 400,000 employees worldwide as of 2014, IBM holds more patents than any other U.S. based technology company and has twelve research laboratories worldwide. The company has scientists, engineers, consultants, and sales professionals in over 175 countries. IBM employees have earned five Nobel Prizes, four Turing Awards, five National Medals of Technology, and five National Medals of Science.\n\n \nThe roots of IBM date back to the 1880s. Since the 1960s or earlier, IBM has described its formation as a merger of three companies: The Tabulating Machine Company (with origins in Washington, D.C. founded in 1896), the International Time Recording Company (founded 1900 in Endicott), and the Computing Scale Company (founded 1901 in Dayton, Ohio, USA). However the 1911 stock prospectus states that four companies were consolidated; the three described by IBM and the Bundy Manufacturing Company (founded in 1889). Further, there was no merger, no consolidation. The new company, named the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company(CTR), was incorporated on June 16, 1911 in the state of New York, U.S.A. CTR was a holding company; the now five companies were an amalgamation. The individual companies continued to operate using their established names until the holding company was eliminated in 1933. The amalgamation was engineered by noted financier Charles Flint. Flint remained a member of the board of CTR until his retirement in 1930.\n\nThe companies that were amalgamated to form CTR manufactured a wide range of products, including employee time-keeping systems, weighing scales, automatic meat slicers, coffee grinders, and punched card equipment. The product lines were very different; Flint stated that the \"allied\" consolidation\n\nThe five amalgamated companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto, Ontario.\n\nOf the companies amalgamated to form CTR, the most technologically significant was The Tabulating Machine Company, founded by Herman Hollerith, and specialized in the development of punched card data processing equipment. Hollerith's series of patents on tabulating machine technology, first applied for in 1884, drew on his work at the U.S. Census Bureau from 1879–82. Hollerith was initially trying to reduce the time and complexity needed to tabulate the 1890 Census. His development of punched cards in 1886 set the industry standard for the next 80 years of tabulating and computing data input.\n\nIn 1896, The Tabulating Machine Company leased some machines to a railway company but quickly focused on the challenges of the largest statistical endeavor of its day – the 1900 US Census. After winning the government contract, and completing the project, Hollerith was faced with the challenge of sustaining the company in non-Census years. He returned to targeting private businesses in the United States and abroad, attempting to identify industry applications for his automatic punching, tabulating and sorting machines. In 1911, Hollerith, now 51 and in failing health sold the business to Flint for $2.3 million (of which Hollerith got $1.2 million), who then founded CTR.\nWhen the diversified businesses of CTR proved difficult to manage, Flint turned for help to the former No. 2 executive at the National Cash Register Company (NCR), Thomas J. Watson, Sr.. Watson became General Manager of CTR in 1914 and President in 1915. By drawing upon his managerial experience at NCR, Watson quickly implemented a series of effective business tactics: generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen, and an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker. As the sales force grew into a highly professional and knowledgeable arm of the company, Watson focused their attention on providing large-scale tabulating solutions for businesses, leaving the market for small office products to others. He also stressed the importance of the customer, a lasting IBM tenet. The strategy proved successful, as during Watson's first four years, revenues doubled to $2 million, and company operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia.\n\nAt the helm during this period, Watson played a central role in establishing what would become the IBM organization and culture. He launched a number of initiatives that demonstrated an unwavering faith in his workers. He hired the company's first disabled worker in 1914, he formed the company's first employee education department in 1916 and in 1915 he introduced his favorite slogan, \"THINK,\" which quickly became the corporate mantra. Watson boosted company spirit by encouraging any employee with a complaint to approach him or any other company executive – his famed Open Door policy. He also sponsored employee sports teams, family outings and a company band, believing that employees were most productive when they were supported by healthy and supportive families and communities. These initiatives – each deeply rooted in Watson's personal values system – became core aspects of IBM culture for the remainder of the century.\n\n\"Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR\" and chose to replace it with the more expansive title \"International Business Machines\". First as a name for a 1917 Canadian subsidiary, then as a line in advertisements. For example, the McClures magazine, v53, May 1921, has a full page ad with, at the bottom:\n\nFinally, in February 14, 1924, the name was used for CTR itself.\n\nThe newly minted IBM continued to develop its core cultural attributes during the 1920s. It launched an employee newspaper, Business Machines, which unified coverage of all of IBM's businesses under one publication. It introduced the Quarter Century Club, to honor employees with 25 years of service to the company, and launched the Hundred Percent Club, to reward sales personnel who met their annual quotas. In 1928, the Suggestion Plan program – which granted cash rewards to employees who contributed viable ideas on how to improve IBM products and procedures – made its debut.\nIBM and its predecessor companies made clocks and other time recording products for 70 years, culminating in the 1958 sale of the IBM Time Equipment Division to Simplex Time Recorder Company, IBM manufactured and sold such equipment as dial recorders, job recorders, recording door locks, time stamps and traffic recorders.\n\nThe company also expanded its product line through innovative engineering. Behind a core group of inventors – James W. Bryce, Clair Lake, Fred Carroll, and Royden Pierce – IBM produced a series of significant product innovations. In the optimistic years following World War I, CTR's engineering and research staff developed new and improved mechanisms to meet the broadening needs of its customers. In 1920, the company introduced the first complete school time control system, and launched its first printing tabulator. Three years later the company introduced the first electric keypunch, and 1924's Carroll Rotary Press produced punched cards at previously unheard of speeds. In 1928, the company held its first customer engineering education class, demonstrating an early recognition of the importance of tailoring solutions to fit customer needs. It also introduced the 80-column punched card in 1928, which doubled its information capacity. This new format, soon dubbed the \"IBM Card\", became and remained an industry standard until the 1970s.\n\nThe Great Depression of the 1930s presented an unprecedented economic challenge, and Watson met the challenge head on, continuing to invest in people, manufacturing, and technological innovation despite the difficult economic times. Rather than reduce staff, he hired additional employees in support of President Franklin Roosevelt's National Recovery Administration plan – not just salesmen, which he joked that he had a lifelong weakness for, but engineers too. Watson not only kept his workforce employed, he increased their benefits. IBM was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934), survivor benefits (1935) and paid vacations (1936). He upped his ante on his workforce by opening the IBM Schoolhouse in Endicott to provide education and training for IBM employees. And he greatly increased IBM's research capabilities by building a modern research laboratory on the Endicott manufacturing site.\n\nWith all this internal investment, Watson was, in essence, gambling on the future. It was IBM's first ‘Bet the Company’ gamble, but the risk paid off handsomely. Watson's factories, running full tilt for six years with no market to sell to, created a huge inventory of unused tabulating equipment, straining IBM's resources. To reduce the cash drain, the struggling Dayton Scale Division (the food services equipment business) was sold in 1933 to Hobart Manufacturing for stock. When the Social Security Act of 1935 – labeled as \"the biggest accounting operation of all time\" – came up for bid, IBM was the only bidder that could quickly provide the necessary equipment. Watson's gamble brought the company a landmark government contract to maintain employment records for 26 million people. IBM's successful performance on the contract soon led to other government orders, and by the end of the decade IBM had not only safely negotiated the Depression, but risen to the forefront of the industry. Watson's Depression-era decision to invest heavily in technical development and sales capabilities, education to expand the breadth of those capabilities, and his commitment to the data processing product line laid the foundation for 50 years of IBM growth and successes.\n\nHis avowed focus on international expansion proved an equally key component of the company's 20th century growth and success. Watson, having witnessed the havoc the First World War wrought on society and business, envisioned commerce as an obstacle to war. He saw business interests and peace as being mutually compatible. In fact, he felt so strongly about the connection between the two that he had his slogan \"World Peace Through World Trade\" carved into the exterior of IBM's new World Headquarters (1938) in New York City. The slogan became an IBM business mantra, and Watson campaigned tirelessly for the concept with global business and government leaders. He served as an informal, unofficial government host for world leaders when they visited New York, and received numerous awards from foreign governments for his efforts to improve international relations through the formation of business ties.\n\nIn the decades leading up to the onset of WW2 IBM had operations in many countries that would be involved in the war, on both the side of the Allies and the Axis. IBM had a lucrative subsidiary in Germany, which it was majority owner of, as well as operations in Poland, Switzerland and other countries in Europe. As with most other enemy-owned businesses in Axis countries, these subsidiaries were taken over by the Nazis and other Axis governments early on in the war. The headquarters in New York meanwhile worked to help the American war effort.\n\nIBM's product line shifted from tabulating equipment and time recording devices to Sperry and Norden bombsights, Browning Automatic Rifle and the M1 Carbine, and engine parts – in all, more than three dozen major ordnance items and 70 products overall. Watson set a nominal one percent profit on those products and used the profits to establish a fund for widows and orphans of IBM war casualties.\n\nAllied military forces widely utilized IBM's tabulating equipment for mobile records units, ballistics, accounting and logistics, and other war-related purposes. There was extensive use of IBM punched card machines for calculations made at Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project for developing the first atomic bombs. During the War, IBM also built the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator, also known as the Harvard Mark I for the U.S. Navy – the first large-scale electro-mechanical calculator in the U.S..\n\nIn 1933 IBM had acquired the rights to Radiotype, an IBM Electric typewriter attached to a radio transmitter. \"In 1935 Admiral Richard E. Byrd successfully sent a test Radiotype message 11,000 miles from Antarctica to an IBM receiving station in Ridgewood, New Jersey\" Selected by the Signal Corps for use during the war, Radiotype installations handled up to 50,000,000 words a day.\n\nTo meet wartime product demands, IBM greatly expanded its manufacturing capacity. IBM added new buildings at its Endicott, New York plant (1941), and opened new facilities in Poughkeepsie, New York (1941), Washington, D.C. (1942), and San Jose, California (1943). IBM's decision to establish a presence on the West Coast took advantage of the growing base of electronics research and other high technology innovation in the southern part of the San Francisco Bay Area, an area that came to be known many decades later as Silicon Valley.\n\nThe Nazis made extensive use of Hollerith equipment and IBM's majority owned German subsidiary, Deutsche Hollerith Maschinen GmbH (Dehomag), supplied this equipment from the early 1930s. This equipment was critical to Nazi efforts to categorize citizens of both Germany and other nations that fell under Nazi control through ongoing censuses. This census data was used to facilitate the round-up of Jews and other targeted groups, and to catalog their movements through the machinery of the Holocaust, including internment in the concentration camps.\n\nAs with hundreds of foreign-owned companies that did business in Germany at that time, Dehomag came under the control of Nazi authorities prior to and during World War II. A Nazi, Hermann Fellinger, was appointed by the Germans as an enemy-property custodian and placed at the head of the Dehomag subsidiary.\n\nHistorian and author Edwin Black, in his best selling book on the topic, maintains that the seizure of the German subsidiary was a ruse. He writes: \"The company was not looted, its leased machines were not seized, and [IBM] continued to receive money funneled through its subsidiary in Geneva.\" In his book he argues that IBM was an active and enthusiastic supplier to the Nazi regime long after they should have stopped dealing with them. Even after the invasion of Poland, IBM continued to service and expand services to the Third Reich in Poland and Germany. The seizure of IBM came after Pearl Harbor and the US Declaration of War, in 1941.\n\nIBM has said that it did nothing wrong.\n\nIBM had expanded so much by the end of the War that the company faced a potentially difficult situation – what would happen if military spending dropped sharply? One way IBM addressed that concern was to accelerate its international growth in the years after the war, culminating with the formation of the World Trade Corporation in 1949 to manage and grow its foreign operations. Under the leadership of Watson's youngest son, Arthur K. ‘Dick’ Watson, the WTC would eventually produce half of IBM's bottom line by the 1970s.\n\nA new IBM emerged in the 1950s. With the death of Founding Father Thomas J. Watson, Sr. on June 19, 1956 at age 82, IBM experienced its first leadership change in more than four decades. The mantle of chief executive fell to his eldest son, Thomas J. Watson, Jr., IBM's president since 1952.\n\nThe new chief executive faced a daunting task. The company was in the midst of a period of rapid technological change, with nascent computer technologies – electronic computers, magnetic tape storage, disk drives, programming – creating new competitors and market uncertainties. Internally, the company was growing by leaps and bounds, creating organizational pressures and significant management challenges. Lacking the force of personality that Watson Sr. had long used to bind IBM together, Watson Jr. and his senior executives privately wondered if the new generation of leadership was up to challenge of managing a company through this tumultuous period. \"We are,\" wrote one longtime IBM executive in 1956, \"in grave danger of losing our \"eternal\" values that are as valid in electronic days as in mechanical counter days.\"\n\nWatson Jr. responded by drastically restructuring the organization mere months after his father died, creating a modern management structure that enabled him to more effectively oversee the fast moving company. He codified well known but unwritten IBM practices and philosophy into formal corporate policies and programs – such as IBM's Three Basic Beliefs, and Open Door and Speak Up! Perhaps the most significant of which was his shepherding of the company's first equal opportunity policy letter into existence in 1953, one year before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \"Brown vs. Board of Education\" and 11 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nHe continued to expand the company's physical capabilities – in 1952 IBM San Jose launched a storage development laboratory which pioneered disk drives. Major facilities would later follow in Rochester, Minnesota; Greencastle, Indiana; Kingston, New York; and Lexington, Kentucky. Concerned that IBM was too slow in adapting transistor technology Watson requested a corporate policy regarding their use, resulting in this unambiguous 1957 product development policy statement: \"It shall be the policy of IBM to use solid-state circuitry in all machine developments. Furthermore, no new commercial machines or devices shall be announced which make primary use of tube circuitry.\"\n\nWatson Jr. also continued to partner with the United States government to drive computational innovation. The emergence of the Cold War accelerated the government's growing awareness of the significance of digital computing, and drove major Department of Defense supported computer development projects in the 1950s. Of these, none was more important than the SAGE interceptor early detection air defense system.\nIn 1952, IBM began working with MIT's Lincoln Laboratories to finalize the design of an air defense computer. The merger of academic and business engineering cultures proved troublesome, but the two organizations finally hammered out a design by the summer of 1953, and IBM was awarded the contract to build two prototypes in September. In 1954, IBM was named as the primary computer hardware contractor for developing SAGE for the United States Air Force. Working on this massive computing and communications system, IBM gained access to pioneering research being done at Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the first real-time, digital computer. This included working on many other computer technology advancements such as magnetic core memory, a large real-time operating system, an integrated video display, light guns, the first effective algebraic computer language, analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversion techniques, digital data transmission over telephone lines, duplexing, multiprocessing, and geographically distributed networks). IBM built fifty-six SAGE computers at the price of US$30 million each, and at the peak of the project devoted more than 7,000 employees (20% of its then workforce) to the project. SAGE had the largest computer footprint ever, and continued in service until 1984.\n\nMore valuable to IBM in the long run than the profits from governmental projects, however, was the access to cutting-edge research into digital computers being done under military auspices. IBM neglected, however, to gain an even more dominant role in the nascent industry by allowing the RAND Corporation to take over the job of programming the new computers, because, according to one project participant, Robert P. Crago, \"we couldn't imagine where we could absorb two thousand programmers at IBM when this job would be over some day, which shows how well we were understanding the future at that time.\" IBM would use its experience designing massive, integrated real-time networks with SAGE to design its SABRE airline reservation system, which met with much success.\n\nThese government partnerships, combined with pioneering computer technology research and a series of commercially successful products (IBM's 700 series of computer systems, the IBM 650, the IBM 305 RAMAC (with disk drive memory), and the IBM 1401) enabled IBM to emerge from the 1950s as the world's leading technology firm. Watson Jr. had answered his self-doubt. In the five years since the passing of Watson Sr., IBM was two and a half times bigger, its stock had quintupled, and of the 6000 computers in operation in the United States, more than 4000 were IBM machines.\n\nOn April 7, 1964, IBM introduced the revolutionary System/360, the first large \"family\" of computers to use interchangeable software and peripheral equipment, a departure from IBM's existing product line of incompatible machines, each of which was designed to solve specific customer requirements. The idea of a general-purpose machine was considered a gamble at the time. Within two years, the System/360 became the dominant mainframe computer in the marketplace and its architecture became a de facto industry standard. During this time, IBM transformed from a medium-sized maker of tabulating equipment and typewriters into the world's largest computer company.\n\nThe company began four decades of Olympic sponsorship with the 1960 Winter Games in Squaw Valley, California. It became a recognized leader in corporate social responsibility, joining federal equal opportunity programs in 1962, opening an inner city manufacturing plant in 1968, and creating a minority supplier program. It led efforts to improve data security and protect privacy. It set environmental air/water emissions standards that exceeded those dictated by law, and brought all its facilities into compliance with those standards. It opened one of the world's most advanced research centers in Yorktown, New York. Its international operations grew rapidly, producing more than half of IBM's revenues by the early 1970s and through technology transfer shaping the way governments and businesses operated around the world. Its personnel and technology played an integral role in the space program and landing the first men on the moon in 1969. In that same year it changed the way it marketed its technology to customers, unbundling hardware from software and services, effectively launching today's multibillion-dollar software and services industry. See , below. It was massively profitable, with a nearly fivefold increase in revenues and earnings during the 1960s.\n\nIBM's dominant market share in the mid-1960s led to antitrust inquiries by the U.S. Department of Justice, which filed a complaint for the case \"U.S. v. IBM\" in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, on January 17, 1969. The suit alleged that IBM violated the Section 2 of the Sherman Act by monopolizing or attempting to monopolize the general purpose electronic digital computer system market, specifically computers designed primarily for business. The case dragged out for 13 years, turning into a resource-sapping war of attrition. In 1982, the Justice Department finally concluded that the case was \"without merit\" and dropped it, but having to operate under the pall of antitrust litigation significantly impacted IBM's business decisions and operations during all of the 1970s and a good portion of the 1980s.\n\nIn 1969 IBM \"unbundled\" software and services from hardware sales. Until this time customers did not pay for software or services separately from the very high price for leasing the hardware. Software was provided at no additional charge, generally in source code form. Services (systems engineering, education and training, system installation) were provided free of charge at the discretion of the IBM Branch office. This practice existed throughout the industry. Quoting from the abstract to a widely read IEEE paper on the topic:\n\nAt the time, the unbundling of services was perhaps the most contentious point, involving antitrust issues that had recently been widely debated in the press and the courts. However, IBM's unbundling of software had long-term impact. After the unbundling, IBM software was divided into two main categories: System Control Programming (SCP), which remained free to customers, and Program Products (PP), which were charged for. This transformed the customer's value proposition for computer solutions, giving a significant monetary value to something that had hitherto essentially been free. This helped enable the creation of a software industry.\n\nSimilarly, IBM services were divided into two categories: general information, which remained free and provided at the discretion of IBM, and on-the-job assistance and training of customer personnel, which were subject to a separate charge and were open to non-IBM customers. This decision vastly expanded the market for independent computing services companies.\n\nThe Golden Decade of the 1960s was a hard act to follow, and the 1970s got off to a troubling start when CEO Thomas J. Watson Jr. suffered a heart attack and retired in 1971. For the first time since 1914 – nearly six decades – IBM would not have a Watson at the helm. Moreover, after just one leadership change over those nearly 60 years, IBM would endure two in two years. T. Vincent Learson, an IBM executive, succeeded Watson as CEO, then quickly retired upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 60 in 1973. Following Learson in the CEO office was Frank T. Cary, a 25-year IBMer who had earned his stripes running the fabulously successful data processing division in the 1960s.\n\nDuring Cary's tenure as CEO, the company continued to dominate in hardware. The IBM System/370 was introduced in 1970 as IBM's new mainframe. The S/370 did not prove as technologically revolutionary as its predecessor, the System/360. From a revenue perspective, it more than sustained the cash cow status of the 360. A less successful effort to replicate the 360 mainframe revolution was the Future Systems project. Between 1971 and 1975, IBM investigated the feasibility of a new revolutionary line of products designed to make obsolete all existing products in order to re-establish its technical supremacy. This effort was terminated by IBM's top management in 1975. But by then it had consumed most of the high-level technical planning and design resources, thus jeopardizing progress of the existing product lines (although some elements of FS were later incorporated into actual products). Other IBM innovations during the early 1970s included the IBM 3340 disk unit – introduced in 1973 and known as \"Winchester\" after IBM's internal project name — was an advanced storage technology which more than doubled the information density on disk surfaces. Winchester technology was adopted by the industry and used for the next two decades.\n\nSome 1970s-era IBM technologies emerged to become familiar facets of everyday life. IBM developed magnetic stripe technology in the 1960s, and it became a credit card industry standard in 1971. The IBM-invented floppy disk, also introduced in 1971, became the standard for storing personal computer data during the first decades of the PC era. IBM Research scientist Edgar 'Ted' Codd wrote a seminal paper describing the relational database – an invention that \"Forbes\" magazine described as one of the most important innovations of the 20th century. The IBM Portable Computer, 50 lbs. and $9000 of personal mobility, was introduced in 1975 and presaged – at least in function if not size or price or units sold – the Personal Computer of the 1980s. IBM's 3660 supermarket checkout station, introduced in 1973, used holographic technology to scan product prices from the now-ubiquitous UPC bar code, which itself was based a 1952 IBM patent that became a grocery industry standard. Also in 1973, bank customers began making withdrawals, transfers and other account inquiries via the IBM 3614 Consumer Transaction Facility, an early form of today's Automatic Teller Machines.\n\nIBM had an innovator's role in pervasive technologies that were less visible as well. In 1974, IBM announced Systems Network Architecture (SNA), a networking protocol for computing systems. SNA is a uniform set of rules and procedures for computer communications to free computer users from the technical complexities of communicating through local, national, and international computer networks. SNA became the most widely used system for data processing until more open architecture standards were approved in the 1990s. In 1975, IBM researcher Benoit Mandelbrot conceived fractal geometry—a new geometrical concept that made it possible to describe mathematically the kinds of irregularities existing in nature. Fractals had a great impact on engineering, economics, metallurgy, art and health sciences, and are integral to the field of computer graphics and animation.\n\nA less successful business endeavor for IBM was its entry into the office copier market in 1970. The company was immediately sued by Xerox Corporation for patent infringement. Although Xerox held the patents for the use of selenium as a photoconductor, IBM researchers perfected the use of organic photoconductors which avoided the Xerox patents. The litigation lasted until the late 1970s and was ultimately settled. Despite this victory, IBM never gained traction in the copier market, and withdrew from the marketplace in the 1980s. Organic photoconductors are now widely used in copiers.\n\nThroughout this period, IBM was litigating the massive anti-trust suit filed by the Justice Department in 1969. But in a related bit of case law, the landmark Honeywell v. Sperry Rand U.S. federal court case was concluded in April 1973. The 1964 patent for the ENIAC, the world's first general-purpose electronic digital computer, was found both invalid and unenforceable for a variety of reasons thus putting the invention of the electronic digital computer into the public domain. Further, IBM was ruled to have created a monopoly via its 1956 patent-sharing agreement with Sperry-Rand.\n\nPresident of IBM John R. Opel became CEO in 1981. His company was one of the world's largest and had a 62% share of the mainframe computer market that year. Its share of the overall computer market, however, had declined from 60% in 1970 to 32% in 1980. Perhaps distracted by the long-running antitrust lawsuit, the \"Colossus of Armonk\" completely missed the fast-growing minicomputer market during the 1970s, and was behind rivals such as Wang, Hewlett-Packard (HP), and Control Data in other areas.\n\nIn 1979 \"BusinessWeek\" asked, \"Is IBM just another stodgy, mature company?\" By 1981 its stock price had declined by 22%. IBM's earnings for the first half the year grew by 5.3%—one third of the inflation rate—while those of minicomputer maker Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) grew by more than 35%. The company began selling minicomputers, but in January 1982 the Justice Department ended the antitrust suit because, \"The New York Times\" reported, the government \"recognized what computer experts and securities analysts had long since concluded: I.B.M. no longer dominates the computer business\".\n\nIBM wished to avoid the same outcome with the new personal computer industry. A team led by Don Estridge at the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton built the IBM PC, launched on August 12, 1981. IBM immediately became more of a presence in the consumer marketplace, thanks to the memorable Little Tramp advertising campaign. Though not a spectacular machine by technological standards of the day, the IBM PC brought together all of the most desirable features of a computer into one small machine. It had 128 kilobytes of memory (expandable to 256 kilobytes), one or two floppy disks and an optional color monitor. And it had the prestige of the IBM brand. It was not cheap, but with a base price of US$1,565 it was affordable for businesses – and many businesses purchased PCs. Reassured by the IBM name, they began buying microcomputers on their own budgets aimed at numerous applications that corporate computer departments did not, and in many cases could not, accommodate. Typically, these purchases were not by corporate computer departments, as the PC was not seen as a \"proper\" computer. Purchases were often instigated by middle managers and senior staff who saw the potential – once the revolutionary VisiCalc spreadsheet, the killer app, had been surpassed by a far more powerful and stable product, Lotus 1-2-3.\n\nBy 1985 IBM was so dominant that competitors and analysts speculated that it would again be sued for antitrust. \"Datamation\" and others said that IBM's continued growth might hurt the United States, by suppressing competitors with new technology. Gartner Group estimated that of the 100 largest data-processing companies, IBM had 41% of all revenue and 69% of profit. Its computer revenue was about nine times that of second-place DEC, and larger than that of IBM's six largest Japanese competitors combined. IBM's profit margin of 22% was three times the 6.7% average for the other 99 companies. Some companies complained to Congress, ADAPSO discussed the company with the Justice Department, and European governments worried about IBM's influence but feared affecting its more than 100,000 employees there at 19 facilities.\n\nHowever, the company soon lost its lead in both PC hardware and software, thanks in part to its unprecedented (for IBM) decision to contract PC components to outside companies like Microsoft and Intel. Up to this point in its history, IBM relied on a vertically integrated strategy, building most key components of its systems itself, including processors, operating systems, peripherals, databases and the like. In an attempt to accelerate the time-to-market for the PC, IBM chose not to build a proprietary operating system and microprocessor. Instead, it sourced these vital components from Microsoft and Intel respectively. Ironically, in a decade which marked the end of IBM's monopoly, it was this fateful decision by IBM that passed the sources of its monopolistic power (operating system and processor architecture) to Microsoft and Intel, paving the way for rise of PC compatibles and the creation of hundreds of billions of dollars of market value outside of IBM.\n\nJohn Akers became IBM's CEO in 1985. During the 1980s, IBM's significant investment in building a world class research organization produced four Nobel Prize winners in physics, achieved breakthroughs in mathematics, memory storage and telecommunications, and made great strides in expanding computing capabilities. In 1980, IBM Research legend John Cocke introduced Reduced Instruction Set Technology (RISC). Cocke received both the National Medal of Technology and the National Medal of Science for his innovation, but IBM itself failed to recognize the importance of RISC, and lost the lead in RISC technology to Sun. In 1984 the company partnered with Sears to develop a pioneering online home banking and shopping service for home PCs that launched in 1988 as Prodigy. Despite a strong reputation and anticipating many of the features, functions, and technology that characterize the online experience of today, the venture was plagued by extremely conservative management decisions, and was eventually sold in the mid-1990s. The IBM token-ring local area network, introduced in 1985, permitted personal computer users to exchange information and share printers and files within a building or complex. In 1988, IBM partnered with the University of Michigan and MCI Communications to create the National Science Foundation Network (NSFNet), an important step in the creation of the Internet. But within five years the company backed away from this early lead in Internet protocols and router technologies in order to support its existing SNA cash cow, thereby missing a boom market of the 1990s. Still, IBM investments and advances in microprocessors, disk drives, network technologies, software applications, and online commerce in the 1980s set the stage for the emergence of the connected world in the 1990s.\n\nBut by the end of the decade, IBM was clearly in trouble. It was a bloated organization of some 400,000 employees that was heavily invested in low margin, transactional, commodity businesses. Technologies IBM invented and or commercialized – DRAM, hard disk drives, the PC, electric typewriters – were starting to erode. The company had a massive international organization characterized by redundant processes and functions – its cost structure couldn’t compete with smaller, less diversified competitors. And then the back-to-back revolutions – the PC and the client server – did the unthinkable. They combined to dramatically undermine IBM's core mainframe business. The PC revolution placed computers directly in the hands of millions of people. It was followed by the client/server revolution, which sought to link all of those PCs (the \"clients\") with larger computers that labored in the background (the \"servers\" that served data and applications to client machines). Both revolutions transformed the way customers viewed, used and bought technology. And both fundamentally rocked IBM. Businesses' purchasing decisions were put in the hands of individuals and departments – not the places where IBM had long-standing customer relationships. Piece-part technologies took precedence over integrated solutions. The focus was on the desktop and personal productivity, not on business applications across the enterprise. As a result, earnings – which had been at or above US$5 billion since the early 1980s, dropped by more than a third to US$3 billion in 1989. A brief spike in earnings in 1990 proved illusory as corporate spending continued to shift from high profit margin mainframes to lower margin microprocessor-based systems. In addition, corporate downsizing was in full swing.\n\nAkers tried to stop the bleeding – desperate moves and radical changes were considered and implemented. As IBM assessed the situation, it was clear that competition and innovation in the computer industry was now taking place along segmented, versus vertically integrated lines, where leaders emerged in their respective domains. Examples included Intel in microprocessors, Microsoft in desktop software, Novell in networking, HP in printers, Seagate in disk drives and Oracle Corporation in database software. IBM's dominance in personal computers was challenged by the likes of Compaq and later Dell. Recognizing this trend, management, with the support of the Board of Directors, began to implement a plan to split IBM into increasingly autonomous business units (e.g. processors, storage, software, services, printers, etc.) to compete more effectively with competitors that were more focused and nimble and had lower cost structures.\n\nIBM also began shedding businesses that it felt were no longer core. It sold its typewriter, keyboard, and printer business – the organization that created the popular \"Selectric\" typewriter with its floating \"golf ball\" type element in the 1960s – to the investment firm of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Inc. and became an independent company, Lexmark Inc..\n\nThese efforts failed to halt the slide. A decade of steady acceptance and widening corporate growth of local area networking technology, a trend headed by Novell Inc. and other vendors, and its logical counterpart, the ensuing decline of mainframe sales, brought about a wake-up call for IBM. After two consecutive years of reporting losses in excess of $1 billion, on January 19, 1993, IBM announced a US$8.10 billion loss for the 1992 financial year, which was then the largest single-year corporate loss in U.S. history. All told, between 1991 and 1993, the company posted net losses of nearly $16 billion. IBM's three-decade long Golden Age, triggered by Watson Jr. in the 1950s, was over. The computer industry now viewed IBM as no longer relevant, an organizational dinosaur. And hundreds of thousands of IBMers lost their jobs, including CEO John Akers.\n\nIn April 1993, IBM hired Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. as its new CEO. For the first time since 1914 IBM had recruited a leader from outside its ranks. Gerstner had been chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco for four years, and had previously spent 11 years as a top executive at American Express. Gerstner brought with him a customer-oriented sensibility and the strategic-thinking expertise that he had honed through years as a management consultant at McKinsey & Co.. Recognizing that his first priority was to stabilize the company, he adopted a triage mindset and took quick, dramatic action. His early decisions included recommitting to the mainframe, selling the Federal Systems Division to Loral in order to replenish the company's cash coffers, continuing to shrink the workforce (reaching a low of 220,000 employees in 1994), and driving significant cost reductions within the company. Most importantly, Gerstner decided to reverse the move to spin off IBM business units into separate companies. He recognized that one of IBM's enduring strengths was its ability to provide integrated solutions for customers – someone who could represent more than piece parts or components. Splitting the company would have destroyed that unique IBM advantage.\n\nThese initial steps worked. IBM was in the black by 1994, turning a profit of $3 billion. Stabilization was not Gerstner's endgame – the restoration of IBM's once great reputation was. To do that, he needed to devise a winning business strategy. Over the next decade, Gerstner crafted a business model that shed commodity businesses and focused on high-margin opportunities. IBM divested itself of low margin industries (DRAM, IBM Network, personal printers, and hard drives). The company regained the business initiative by building upon the decision to keep the company whole – it unleashed a global services business that rapidly rose to become a leading technology integrator. Crucial to this success was the decision to become brand agnostic – IBM integrated whatever technologies the client required, even if they were from an IBM competitor. IBM augmented this services business with the 2002 acquisition of the consultancy division of PricewaterhouseCoopers for $3.5 billion US.\n\nAnother high margin opportunity IBM invested heavily in was software, a strategic move that proved equally visionary. Starting in 1995 with its acquisition of Lotus Development Corp., IBM built up its software portfolio from one brand, DB2, to five: DB2, Lotus, WebSphere, Tivoli, and Rational. Content to leave the consumer applications business to other firms, IBM's software strategy focused on middleware – the vital software that connects operating systems to applications. The middleware business played to IBM's strengths, and its higher margins improved the company's bottom line significantly as the century came to an end.\n\nNot all software that IBM developed was successful. While OS/2 was arguably technically superior to Microsoft Windows 95, OS/2 sales were largely concentrated in networked computing used by corporate professionals. OS/2 failed to develop much penetration in the consumer and stand-alone desktop PC segments. There were reports that it could not be installed properly on IBM's own Aptiva series of home PCs. Microsoft made an offer in 1994 where if IBM ended development of OS/2 completely, then it would receive the same terms as Compaq for a license of Windows 95. IBM refused and instead went with an \"IBM First\" strategy of promoting OS/2 Warp and disparaging Windows, as IBM aimed to drive sales of its own software and hardware. By 1995, Windows 95 negotiations between IBM and Microsoft, which were difficult, stalled when IBM purchased Lotus Development whose Lotus SmartSuite would have directly competed with Microsoft Office. As a result, IBM received their license later than their competitors which hurt sales of IBM PCs. IBM officials later conceded that OS/2 would not have been a viable operating system to keep them in the PC business.\n\nWhile IBM hardware and technologies were relatively de-emphasized in Gerstner's three-legged business model, they were not relegated to secondary status. The company brought its world-class research organization to bear more closely on its existing product lines and development processes. While Internet applications and deep computing overtook client servers as key business technology priorities, mainframes returned to relevance. IBM reinvigorated their mainframe line with CMOS technologies, which made them among the most powerful and cost efficient in the marketplace. Investments in microelectronics research and manufacturing made IBM a world leader in specialized, high margin chip production – it developed 200 mm wafer processes in 1992, and 300 mm wafers within the decade. IBM-designed chips are currently used in PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii game consoles. IBM also regained the lead in supercomputing with high-end machines based upon scalable parallel processor technology.\n\nEqually significant in IBM's revival was its successful reentry into the popular mindset. Part of this revival was based on IBM technology. On October 5, 1992, at the COMDEX computer expo, IBM announced the first ThinkPad laptop computer, the 700c. The ThinkPad, a premium machine which then cost US$4350, included a 25 MHz Intel 80486SL processor, a 10.4-inch active matrix display, removable 120 MB hard drive, 4 MB RAM (expandable to 16 MB) and a TrackPoint II pointing device. The striking black design by noted designer Richard Sapper made the ThinkPad an immediate hit with the digerati, and the cool factor of the ThinkPad brought back some of the cachet to the IBM brand that was lost in the PC wars of the 1980s. Instrumental to this popular resurgence was the 1997 chess match between IBM's chess-playing computer system Deep Blue and reigning world chess champion Garry Kasparov. Deep Blue's victory was a historic first for a computer over a reigning world champion. Also helping the company reclaim its position as a technology leader was its annual domination of supercomputer rankings and patent leadership statistics. Ironically, a serendipitous contributor in reviving the company's reputation was the Dot-com bubble collapse in 2000, where many of the edgy technology high flyers of the 1990s failed to survive the downturn. These collapses discredited some of the more fashionable Internet-driven business models that stodgy IBM was previously compared against.\n\nAnother part of the successful reentry into the popular mindset was the company's revival of the IBM brand. The company's marketing during the economic downturn was chaotic, presenting many different, sometimes discordant voices in the marketplace. This brand chaos was attributable in part to the company having 70 different advertising agencies in its employ. In 1994, IBM eliminated this chaos by consolidating its advertising in one agency. The result was a coherent, consistent message to the marketplace.\n\nAs IBM recovered its financial footing and its industry leadership position, the company remained aggressive in preaching to the industry that it was not the Old IBM, that it had learned from its near death experiences, and that it had been fundamentally changed by them. It sought to redefine the Internet age in ways that played to traditional IBM strengths, couching the discussion in business-centric manners with initiatives like ecommerce and On Demand. And it supported open source initiatives, forming collaborative ventures with partners and competitors alike.\n\nChange was manifested in IBM in other ways as well. The company revamped its varied philanthropic practices to bring a sharp focus on improving K-12 education. It ended its 40-year technology partnership with the International Olympic Committee after a successful engagement at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. On the human resources front, IBM's adoption and integration of diversity principles and practices was cutting edge. It added sexual orientation to its non-discrimination practices in 1984, in 1995 created executive diversity task forces, and in 1996 offered domestic partner benefits to its employees. The company is routinely listed as among the best places for employees, employees of color, and women to work. And in 1996, the Women in Technology International Hall of Fame inducted three IBMers as part of its inaugural class of 10 women: Ruth Leach Amonette, the first woman to hold an executive position at IBM; Barbara Grant, PhD, first woman to be named an IBM site general manager; and Linda Sanford, the highest – placed technical woman in IBM. Fran Allen – an early software pioneer and another IBM hero for her innovative work in compilers over the decades – was inducted in 1997.\n\nGerstner retired at the end of 2002, and was replaced by long-time IBMer Samuel J. Palmisano.\n\nThe story of IBM's hardware is intertwined with the story of the computer industry – from vacuum tubes, to transistors, to integrated circuits, to microprocessors and beyond. The following systems and series represent key steps:\n\n\nIBM operating systems have paralleled hardware development. On early systems, operating systems represented a relatively modest level of investment, and were essentially viewed as an adjunct to the hardware. By the time of the System/360, however, operating systems had assumed a much larger role, in terms of cost, complexity, importance, and risk.\n\nMainframe operating systems include:\n\n\nOther platforms with important operating systems include:\n\n\nEarly IBM computer systems, like those from many other vendors, were programmed using assembly language. Computer science efforts through the 1950s and early 1960s led to the development of many new high-level languages (HLL) for programming. IBM played a complicated role in this process. Hardware vendors were naturally concerned about the implications of portable languages that would allow customers to pick and choose among vendors without compatibility problems. IBM, in particular, helped create barriers that tended to lock customers into a single platform.\n\nIBM had a significant role in the following major computer languages:\n\nIBM developed a schizophrenic relationship with the UNIX and Linux worlds. The importance of IBM's large computer business placed strange pressures on all of IBM's attempts to develop other lines of business. All IBM projects faced the risk of being seen as competing against company priorities. This was because, if a customer decided to build an application on an RS/6000 platform, this also meant that a decision had been made \"against\" a mainframe platform. So despite having some excellent technology, IBM often placed itself in a compromised position.\n\nA case in point is IBM's GFIS products for infrastructure management and GIS applications. Despite long having a dominant position in such industries as electric, gas, and water utilities, IBM stumbled badly in the 1990s trying to build workstation-based solutions to replace its old mainframe-based products. Customers were forced to move on to new technologies from other vendors; many felt betrayed by IBM.\n\nIBM embraced open source technologies in the 1990s. It later became embroiled in a complex litigation with SCO group over intellectual property rights related to the UNIX and Linux platforms.\n\n1983 saw the announcement of the System/36, the replacement for the System/34. And in 1988, IBM announced the AS/400, intended to represent a point of convergence for both System/36 customers and System/38 customers. The 1970s had seen IBM develop a range of Billing, Inventory Control, Accounts Receivable, & Sales Analysis (BICARSA ) applications for specific industries: construction (CMAS), distribution (DMAS) and manufacturing (MMAS), all written in the RPG II language. By the end of the 1980s, IBM had almost completely withdrawn from the BICARSA applications marketplace. Because of developments in the antitrust cases against IBM brought by the US government and European Union, IBM sales representatives were now able to work openly with application software houses as partners. (For a period in the early 1980s, a 'rule of three' operated, which obliged IBM sales representatives, if they were to propose a third-party application to a customer, to also list at least two other third-party vendors in the IBM proposal. This caused some amusement to the customer, who would typically have engaged in intense negotiations with one of the third parties and probably not have heard of the other two vendors.)\n\nIBM has largely been known for its overtaking UNIVAC's early 1950s public fame, then leading in the computer industry for much of the latter part of the century. However it has also had roles, some significant, in other industries, including:\n\n\nFor IBM's corporate biographies of former CEOs and many others see: IBM Archives Biographies Builders reference room\n\n See also History of IBM research in Israel\n\nA significant part of IBM's operations were FSD's contracts with the U.S. Federal Government for a wide range of projects ranging from the Department of Defense to the National Security Agency. These projects spanned mundane administrative processing to top secret supercomputing. In NASA's Apollo Program, the \"brains\" of each Saturn rocket was the Instrument Unit built by the IBM Space Systems Center in Huntsville, Alabama. Founded in 1957, FSD was sold to Loral in 1994.\n\nIBM had subsidiaries and operations in 70 countries in its early years. They included Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, Sweden, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, and others.\n\nIBM's early dominance of the computer industry was in part due to its strong professional services activities. IBM's advantage in building software for its own computers eventually was seen as monopolistic, leading to antitrust proceedings. As a result, a complex, artificial \"arms-length\" relationship was created separating IBM's computer business from its service organizations. This situation persisted for decades. An example was IBM Global Services, a huge services firm that competed with the likes of Electronic Data Systems or Computer Sciences Corporation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Thomas J. Watson\n\nThomas John Watson Sr. (February 17, 1874 – June 19, 1956) was an American businessman. He served as the chairman and CEO of International Business Machines (IBM) He oversaw the company's growth into an international force from 1914 to 1956. Watson developed IBM's management style and corporate culture from John Henry Patterson's training at NCR. He turned the company into a highly-effective selling organization, based largely on punched card tabulating machines. A leading self-made industrialist, he was one of the richest men of his time and was called the world's greatest salesman when he died in 1956.\n\nThomas J. Watson was born in Campbell, New York, the fifth child and only son of Thomas and Jane Fulton White Watson. His four older siblings were all girls —Jennie, Effie, Loua, and Emma. His father farmed and owned a modest lumber business located near Painted Post, a few miles west of Elmira, in the Southern Tier region of New York. Thomas worked on the family farm in East Campbell, New York and attended the District School Number Five in the late 1870s. As Watson entered his teen years he attended Addison Academy In Addison, New York.\n\nHaving given up his first job—teaching—after just one day, Watson took a year's course in accounting and business at the Miller School of Commerce in Elmira. He left the school in 1891, taking a job at $6 a week as bookkeeper for Clarence Risley's Market in Painted Post. One year later he joined a traveling salesman, George Cornwell, peddling organs and pianos around the farms for William Bronson's local hardware store, Watson's first sales job. When Cornwell left, Watson continued alone, earning $10 per week. After two years of this life, he realized he would be earning $70 per week if he were on a commission. His indignation on making this discovery was such that he quit and moved from his familiar surroundings to the relative metropolis of Buffalo.\n\nWatson then spent a very brief period selling sewing machines for Wheeler and Wilcox. According to Tom Watson, Jr., in his autobiography: One day my dad went into a roadside saloon to celebrate a sale and had too much to drink. When the bar closed, he found that his entire rig—horse, buggy, and samples—had been stolen. Wheeler and Wilcox fired him and dunned him for the lost property. Word got around, of course, and it took Dad more than a year to find another steady job. Watson would later enforce strict rules at IBM against alcohol consumption, even off the job. According to Tom Jr.: This anecdote never made it into IBM lore, which is too bad, because it would have helped explain Father to the tens of thousands of people who had to follow his rules.\n\nWatson's next job was peddling shares of the Buffalo Building and Loan Company for a huckster named C. B. Barron, a showman renowned for his disreputable conduct, which Watson, as a lifelong Methodist, deplored. Barron absconded with the commission and the loan funds. Next Watson opened a butcher shop in Buffalo, which soon failed, leaving Watson with no money, no investment, and no job.\n\nWatson had a newly acquired NCR cash register in his butcher shop, for which he had to arrange transfer of the installment payments to the new owner of the butcher shop. On visiting NCR, he met John J. Range and asked him for a job. Determined to join the company, he repeatedly called on Range until, after a number of abortive attempts, he finally was hired in November, 1896, as sales apprentice to Range.\n\nLed by John Patterson, NCR was then one of the leading selling organizations, and John J. Range, its Buffalo branch manager, became almost a father figure for Watson and was a model for his sales and management style. Certainly in later years, in a 1952 interview, he claimed he learned more from Range than anyone else. But at first, he was a poor salesman, until Range took him personally in hand. Then he became the most successful salesman in the East, earning $100 per week.\n\nFour years later, NCR assigned Watson to run the struggling NCR agency in Rochester, New York. As an agent, he got 35% commission and reported directly to Hugh Chalmers, the second-in-command at NCR. In four years Watson made Rochester effectively an NCR monopoly by using the technique of knocking the main competitor, Hallwood, out of business, sometimes resorting to sabotage of the competitor's machines. As a reward he was called to the NCR head office in Dayton, Ohio.\n\nIn 1912, the company was found guilty of violating the Sherman Antitrust Act. Patterson, Watson, and 26 other NCR executives and managers were convicted for illegal anti-competitive sales practices and were sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Their convictions were unpopular with the public because of the efforts of Patterson and Watson to help those affected by the Dayton, Ohio floods of 1913, but efforts to have them pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson were unsuccessful. However, their convictions were overturned on appeal in 1915 on the grounds that important defense evidence should have been admitted.\n\nCharles Ranlett Flint who had engineered the amalgamation (via stock acquisition) forming the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) found it difficult to manage the five companies. He hired Watson as general manager on May 1, 1914 when the five companies had about 1,300 employees. Eleven months later he was made president when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved. Within four years revenues had been doubled to $9 million. In 1924, he renamed CTR to International Business Machines. Watson built IBM into such a dominant company that the federal government filed a civil antitrust suit against it in 1952. IBM owned and leased to its customers more than 90 percent of all tabulating machines in the United States at the time. When Watson died in 1956, IBM's revenues were $897 million, and the company had 72,500 employees.\n\nThroughout his life, Watson maintained a deep interest in international relations, from both a diplomatic and a business perspective. He was known as President Roosevelt's unofficial ambassador in New York and often entertained foreign statesmen.In 2001, a book called IBM and the Holocaust described how Mr. Watson\nprovided the tabulating equipment Hitler used to round up the Jews. His\nHollerith punch-card machines are in the Holocaust Museum today.\nThe book describes IBMʼs punch cards as “a card with standardized holes,”\neach representing a different trait of the individual. The card was fed into a\nʻreaderʼ and sorted. Punch cards identified Jews by name. Each one served\nas “a nineteenth-century bar code for human beings.” In 1937, he was elected president of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and at that year's biennial congress in Berlin stated the conference keynote to be \"World Peace Through World Trade\". That phrase became the slogan of both the ICC and IBM.\nWatson's merger of diplomacy and business was not always lauded. During the 1930s, IBM's German subsidiary was its most profitable foreign operation, and a 2001 book by Edwin Black, \"IBM and the Holocaust\", argues that Watson's pursuit of profit led him to personally approve and spearhead IBM's strategic technological relationship with Nazi Germany. In particular, critics point to the coveted Order of the German Eagle medal that Watson received at the Berlin ICC meeting in 1937, as evidence that he was being honored for the help that IBM's German subsidiary Dehomag (Deutsche Hollerith-Maschinen Gesellschaft mbH) and its punch card machines provided the Nazi regime, particularly in the tabulation of census data (i.e. location of Jews). Another study argues that Watson believed, perhaps naively, that the medal was in recognition of his years of labor on behalf of global commerce and international peace. Within a year of the Berlin congress though, where Watson's hopes had run high, he found himself strongly protesting the German policy toward the Jews. Because of his strong feelings about the issue, Watson wanted to return his German citation shortly after receiving it. When Secretary of State Hull advised him against that course of action, he gave up the idea until the spring of 1940. Then Hull refused advice, and Watson sent the medal back in June 1940. Dehomag's management disapproved of Watson's action and considered separating from IBM. This occurred when Germany declared war on the United States in December 1941, and the German shareholders took custody of the Dehomag operation. But during World War II, IBM subsidiaries in occupied Europe never stopped delivery of punch cards to Dehomag, and documents uncovered show that senior executives at IBM world headquarters in New York took great pains to maintain legal authority over Dehomag's operations and assets through the personal intervention of IBM managers in neutral Switzerland, directed via personal communications and private letters.\n\nDuring this same period, IBM became more deeply involved in the war effort for the U.S., focusing on producing large quantities of data processing equipment for the military and experimenting with analog computers. Watson, Sr. also developed the \"1% doctrine\" for war profits which mandated that IBM receive no more than 1% profit from the sales of military equipment to U.S. Government. Watson was one of the few CEOs to develop such a policy.\n\nIn 1941, Watson received the third highest salary and compensation package in the U.S., $517,221, on which he paid 69% in tax.\n\nWatson had a personal interest in the progress of the war. His eldest son, Thomas J. Watson Jr., joined the United States Army Air Corps where he became a bomber pilot. He was soon hand-picked to become the assistant and personal pilot for General Follet Bradley, who was in charge of all Lend-Lease equipment supplied to the Soviet Union from the United States. Watson, Sr.'s youngest son, Arthur K. Watson, also joined the military during the conflict.\n\nWatson worked with local leaders to create a college in the Binghamton area, where IBM was founded and had major plants. In 1946, IBM provided land and funding for Triple Cities College, an extension of Syracuse University. Later it became known as Harpur College, and eventually evolved into Binghamton University. Its School of Engineering and Applied Sciences is named the Thomas J. Watson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. The IBM plant in the neighboring city of Endicott has since downsized drastically, however.\n\nAfter World War II, Watson began work to further the extent of IBM's influence abroad and in 1949, he created the IBM World Trade Corporation in order to oversee IBM's foreign business.\n\nOn May 8, 1956 Watson retired and his oldest son, Thomas J. Watson, Jr assumed the position of CEO. He died on June 19, 1956 in Manhattan, New York City. He was interred in Sleepy Hollow Cemetery in Sleepy Hollow, New York.\n\nWatson married Jeanette Kittredge, from a prominent Dayton, Ohio railroad family, on April 17, 1913. They had two sons and two daughters.\n\n\nAs a Democrat (after his criminal indictment by the Taft Administration), Watson was an ardent supporter of Roosevelt. He was one of the most prominent businessmen in the Democratic Party. He was considered Roosevelt's strongest supporter in the business community.\n\nIn 1936 the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision that IBM, together with Remington Rand, should cease its practice of requiring its customers to buy their punch cards from it alone. The ruling made little difference because IBM was the only effective supplier to the market, and profits continued undiminished.\n\nWatson served as a powerful trustee of Columbia University from June 6, 1933 until his death. He engineered the selection of Dwight D. Eisenhower as its president and played the central role in convincing Eisenhower to become president of the university. Additionally, he served as a trustee of Lafayette College and is the namesake of Watson Hall, a campus residence hall.\n\nIn 1939, he received an honorary degree in Doctor of Commercial Science from Oglethorpe University.\n\nIn the 1940s, Watson was on the national executive board of the Boy Scouts of America and served for a time as international Scout commissioner. E. Urner Goodman recounts that the elderly Watson attended an international Scout commissioners' meeting in Switzerland, where the IBM founder asked not to be put on a pedestal. Before the conference was over, Goodman relates, Watson \"... sat by that campfire, in Scout uniform, 'chewing the fat' like the rest of the boys\". He received the Silver Buffalo Award in 1944. His son, Thomas Jr., later served as National president of the Boy Scouts of America from 1964 to 1968.\n\nWatson was chairman of the Elmira College centennial committee in 1955 and donated Watson Hall, primarily a music and mathematics academic building.\n\nHe was posthumously inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1990.\n\nAlthough Watson is well known for his alleged 1943 statement, \"I think there is a world market for maybe five computers,\" there is scant evidence he said it. Author Kevin Maney tried to find the origin of the quote, but has been unable to locate any speeches or documents of Watson's that contain this, nor are the words present in any contemporary articles about IBM. One of the very first attributions may be found in \"The Experts Speak\", a book written by Christopher Cerf and Victor S. Navasky in 1984, however Cerf and Navasky just quote from a book written by Morgan and Langford, \"Facts and Fallacies\". Another early article source (May 15, 1985) is a column by Neil Morgan, a San Diego Evening Tribune writer who wrote: \"Forrest Shumway, chairman of The Signal Cos., doesn't make predictions. His role model is Tom Watson, then IBM chairman, who said in 1958: 'I think there is a world market for about five computers. The earliest known citation on the Internet is from 1986 on Usenet in the signature of a poster from Convex Computer Corporation as I think there is a world market for about five computers' —Remark attributed to Thomas J. Watson (Chairman of the Board of International Business Machines), 1943\". All these early quotes are questioned by Eric Weiss, an editor of the \"Annals of the History of Computing\" in ACS letters in 1985.\n\nThere are documented versions of similar quotes by other people in the early history of the computer. In 1946 Sir Charles Darwin (grandson of the famous naturalist), head of Britain's NPL (National Physical Laboratory), where research into computers was taking place, wrote: it is very possible that ... one machine would suffice to solve all the problems that are demanded of it from the whole country.\n\nIn 1985 the story was discussed on Usenet (in net.misc), without Watson's name being attached. The original discussion has not survived, but an explanation has; it attributes a very similar quote to the Cambridge mathematician Professor Douglas Hartree, around 1951:\nI went to see Professor Douglas Hartree, who had built the first differential analyzers in England and had more experience in using these very specialized computers than anyone else. He told me that, in his opinion, all the calculations that would ever be needed in this country could be done on the three digital computers which were then being built—one in Cambridge, one in Teddington, and one in Manchester. No one else, he said, would ever need machines of their own, or would be able to afford to buy them.\n\nHoward H. Aiken made a similar statement in 1952:\nOriginally one thought that if there were a half dozen large computers in this country, hidden away in research laboratories, this would take care of all requirements we had throughout the country.\n\nThe story already had been described as a myth in 1973; the \"Economist\" quoted a Mr. Maney as \"revealing that Watson never made his oft-quoted prediction that there was 'a world market for maybe five computers. \n\nSince the attribution typically is used to demonstrate the fallacy of predictions, if Watson had made such a prediction in 1943, then, as Gordon Bell pointed out in his ACM 50 years celebration keynote, it would have held true for some ten years.\n\nThe IBM archives of Frequently Asked Questions notes an inquiry about whether he said in the 1950s that he foresaw a market potential for only five electronic computers. The document says no, but quotes his son and then IBM President Thomas J. Watson, Jr., at the annual IBM stockholders meeting, April 28, 1953, as speaking about the IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine, which it identifies as \"the company's first production computer designed for scientific calculations\". He said that \"IBM had developed a paper plan for such a machine and took this paper plan across the country to some 20 concerns that we thought could use such a machine. I would like to tell you that the machine rents for between $12,000 and $18,000 a month, so it was not the type of thing that could be sold from place to place. But, as a result of our trip, on which we expected to get orders for five machines, we came home with orders for 18.\" Watson, Jr., later gave a slightly different version of the story in his autobiography, where he said the initial market sampling indicated 11 firm takers and 10 more prospective orders.\n\n\"THINK\" - Watson began using \"THINK\" to motivate, or inspire, staff while at NCR and continued to use it at CTR. International Business Machines's first U.S. trademark was for the name \"THINK\" filed as a U.S. trademark on June 6, 1935, with the description \"periodical publications\". This trademark was filed fourteen years before the company filed for a U.S. trademark on the name IBM. A biographical article in 1940 noted that \"This word is on the most conspicuous wall of every room in every IBM building. Each employee carries a THINK notebook in which to record inspirations. The company stationery, matches, scratch pads all bear the inscription, THINK. A monthly magazine called 'Think' is distributed to the employees.\" THINK remains a part of IBM's corporate culture; it was the inspiration behind naming IBM's successful line of notebook computers, IBM ThinkPad. In 2007, IBM Mid America Employees Federal Credit Union changed its name to Think Mutual Bank.\n\n\n\n",
                "IBM\n\nIBM (International Business Machines Corporation) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Armonk, New York, United States, with operations in over 170 countries. The company originated in 1911 as the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) and was renamed \"International Business Machines\" in 1924.\n\nIBM manufactures and markets computer hardware, middleware and software, and provides hosting and consulting services in areas ranging from mainframe computers to nanotechnology. IBM is also a major research organization, holding the record for most patents generated by a business (as of 2018) for 25 consecutive years. Inventions by IBM include the automated teller machine (ATM), the PC, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, the SQL programming language, the UPC barcode, and dynamic random-access memory (DRAM). The IBM mainframe, exemplified by the System/360, was the dominant computing platform during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nIBM has continually shifted its business mix by commoditizing markets focusing on higher-value, more profitable markets. This includes spinning off printer manufacturer Lexmark in 1991 and selling off its personal computer (ThinkPad/ThinkCentre) and x86-based server businesses to Lenovo (2005 and 2014, respectively), and acquiring companies such as PwC Consulting (2002), SPSS (2009), and The Weather Company (2016). Also in 2014, IBM announced that it would go \"fabless\", continuing to design semiconductors, but offloading manufacturing to GlobalFoundries.\n\nNicknamed Big Blue, IBM is one of 30 companies included in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and one of the world's largest employers, with (as of 2016) nearly 380,000 employees. Known as \"IBMers\", IBM employees have been awarded five Nobel Prizes, six Turing Awards, ten National Medals of Technology and five National Medals of Science.\n\nIn the 1880s, technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of International Business Machines (IBM). Alp Qasimov patented the computing scale in 1885; Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888); Herman Hollerith patented the Electric Tabulating Machine; and Willard Bundy invented a time clock to record a worker's arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889. On June 16, 1911, their four companies were amalgamated in New York State by Charles Ranlett Flint forming a fifth company, the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company (CTR) based in Endicott, New York. The five companies had 1,300 employees and offices and plants in Endicott and Binghamton, New York; Dayton, Ohio; Detroit, Michigan; Washington, D.C.; and Toronto. They manufactured machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards. Thomas J. Watson, Sr., fired from the National Cash Register Company by John Henry Patterson, called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered CTR. Watson joined CTR as \"General Manager\" then, 11 months later, was made \"President\" when court cases relating to his time at NCR were resolved. Having learned Patterson's pioneering business practices, Watson proceeded to put the stamp of NCR onto CTR's companies. He implemented sales conventions, \"generous sales incentives, a focus on customer service, an insistence on well-groomed, dark-suited salesmen and had an evangelical fervor for instilling company pride and loyalty in every worker\". His favorite slogan, \"THINK\", became a mantra for each company's employees. During Watson's first four years, revenues reached $9 million and the company's operations expanded to Europe, South America, Asia and Australia. \"Watson had never liked the clumsy hyphenated title of the CTR\" and in 1924 chose to replace it with the more expansive title \"International Business Machines\". By 1933 most of the subsidiaries had been merged into one company, IBM.\nIn 1937, IBM's tabulating equipment enabled organizations to process unprecedented amounts of data, its clients including the U.S. Government, during its first effort to maintain the employment records for 26 million people pursuant to the Social Security Act, and Hitler's Third Reich, largely through the German subsidiary Dehomag. During the Second World War the company produced small arms for the American war effort (M1 Carbine, and Browning Automatic Rifle).\n\nIn 1949, Thomas Watson, Sr., created IBM World Trade Corporation, a subsidiary of IBM focused on foreign operations. In 1952, he stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm, and his son Thomas Watson, Jr. was named president. In 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of artificial intelligence when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an IBM 704 not merely to play checkers but \"learn\" from its own experience. In 1957, the FORTRAN scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, IBM developed the SABRE reservation system for American Airlines and introduced the highly successful Selectric typewriter. In 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flight of the Mercury astronauts. A year later, it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to Armonk, New York. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights and 1969 lunar mission.\n\nOn April 7, 1964, IBM announced the first computer system family, the IBM System/360. It spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their applications. It was followed by the IBM System/370 in 1970. Together the 360 and 370 made the IBM mainframe the dominant mainframe computer and the dominant computing platform in the industry throughout this period and into the early 1980s. They, and the operating systems that ran on them such as OS/VS1 and MVS, and the middleware built on top of those such as the CICS transaction processing monitor, had a near-monopoly-level hold on the computer industry and became almost synonymous with IBM products due to their marketshare.\n\nIn 1974, IBM engineer George J. Laurer developed the Universal Product Code. IBM and the World Bank first introduced financial swaps to the public in 1981 when they entered into a swap agreement. The IBM PC, originally designated IBM 5150, was introduced in 1981, and it soon became an industry standard. In 1991, IBM sold printer manufacturer Lexmark.\n\nIn 1993, IBM posted a US$8 billion loss - at the time the biggest in American corporate history. Lou Gerstner was hired as CEO from RJR Nabisco to turn the company around. In 2002, IBM acquired PwC consulting, and in 2003 it initiated a project to redefine company values, hosting a three-day online discussion of key business issues with 50,000 employees. The result was three values: \"Dedication to every client's success\", \"Innovation that matters—for our company and for the world\", and \"Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships\".\n\nIn 2005, the company sold its personal computer business to Chinese technology company Lenovo and, in 2009, it acquired software company SPSS Inc. Later in 2009, IBM's Blue Gene supercomputing program was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by U.S. President Barack Obama. In 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its artificial intelligence program Watson, which was exhibited on \"Jeopardy!\" where it won against game-show champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter. The company also celebrated its 100th anniversary on the same year on June 16. In 2012, IBM announced it has agreed to buy Kenexa, and a year later it also acquired SoftLayer Technologies, a web hosting service, in a deal worth around $2 billion.\n\nIn 2014, IBM announced it would sell its x86 server division to Lenovo for a fee of $2.1 billion. Also that year, IBM began announcing several major partnerships with other companies, including Apple Inc., Twitter, Facebook, Tencent, Cisco, UnderArmour, Box, Microsoft, VMware, CSC, Macy's, Sesame Workshop, the parent company of Sesame Street, and Salesforce.com.\n\nIn 2015, IBM announced two major acquisitions: Merge Healthcare for $1 billion and all digital assets from The Weather Company, including Weather.com and the Weather Channel mobile app. Also that year, IBMers created the film \"A Boy and His Atom\", which was the first molecule movie to tell a story. In 2016, IBM acquired video conferencing service Ustream and formed a new cloud video unit. In April 2016, it posted a 14-year low in quarterly sales. The following month, Groupon sued IBM accusing it of patent infringement, two months after IBM accused Groupon of patent infringement in a separate lawsuit.\n\nIBM is headquartered in Armonk, New York, a community north of Midtown Manhattan. Its principal building, referred to as CHQ, is a glass and stone edifice on a parcel amid a 432-acre former apple orchard the company purchased in the mid-1950s. There are two other IBM buildings within walking distance of CHQ: the North Castle office, which previously served as IBM's headquarters; and the IBM Learning Center (ILC), a resort hotel and training center, which has 182 guest rooms, 31 meeting rooms, and various amenities.\n\nIBM operates in 174 countries as of 2016, with mobility centers in smaller markets areas and major campuses in the larger ones. In New York City, IBM has several offices besides CHQ, including the IBM Watson headquarters at Astor Place in Manhattan. Outside of New York, major campuses in the United States include Austin, Texas; Research Triangle Park (Raleigh-Durham), North Carolina; Rochester, Minnesota; and Silicon Valley, California.\n\nIBM's real estate holdings are varied and globally diverse. Towers occupied by IBM include 1250 René-Lévesque (Montreal, Canada), Tour Descartes (Paris, France), and One Atlantic Center (Atlanta, Georgia, USA). In Beijing, China, IBM occupies Pangu Plaza, which is the city's seventh tallest building and overlooks Beijing National Stadium (\"Bird's Nest\"), which was home to the 2008 Summer Olympics.\n\nOther notable buildings include the IBM Rome Software Lab (Rome, Italy), the Hursley House (Winchester, UK), 330 North Wabash (Chicago, Illinois, United States), the Cambridge Scientific Center (Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States), the IBM Toronto Software Lab (Toronto, Canada), the IBM Building, Johannesburg (Johannesburg, South Africa), the IBM Building (Seattle) (Seattle, Washington, United States), the IBM Hakozaki Facility (Tokyo, Japan), the IBM Yamato Facility (Yamato, Japan), and the IBM Canada Head Office Building (Ontario, Canada). Defunct IBM campuses include the IBM Somers Office Complex (Somers, New York). The company's contributions to industrial architecture and design include works by Eero Saarinen, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and I.M. Pei. Van der Rohe's building in Chicago, the original center of the company's research division post-World War II, was recognized with the 1990 Honor Award from the National Building Museum. IBM was recognized as one of the Top 20 Best Workplaces for Commuters by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2005, which recognized Fortune 500 companies that provided employees with excellent commuter benefits to help reduce traffic and air pollution. In 2004, concerns were raised related to IBM's contribution in its early days to pollution in its original location in Endicott, New York.\n\nIBM has a large and diverse portfolio of products and services. As of 2016, these offerings fall into the categories of cloud computing, cognitive computing, commerce, data and analytics, Internet of Things, IT infrastructure, mobile, and security.\n\nIBM Cloud includes infrastructure as a service (IaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS) offered through public, private and hybrid cloud delivery models. For instance, the IBM Bluemix PaaS enables developers to quickly create complex websites on a pay-as-you-go model. IBM SoftLayer is a dedicated server, managed hosting and cloud computing provider, which in 2011 reported hosting more than 81,000 servers for more than 26,000 customers. IBM also provides Cloud Data Encryption Services (ICDES), using cryptographic splitting to secure customer data.\n\nIBM also hosts the industry-wide cloud computing and mobile technologies conference InterConnect each year.\n\nHardware designed by IBM for these categories include IBM's POWER microprocessors, which are employed inside many console gaming systems, including Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Nintendo's Wii U. IBM Secure Blue is encryption hardware that can be built into microprocessors, and in 2014, the company revealed it was investing $3 billion over the following five years to design a neural chip that mimics the human brain, with 10 billion neurons and 100 trillion synapses, but that uses just 1 kilowatt of power. In 2016, the company launched all-flash arrays designed for small and midsized companies, which includes software for data compression, provisioning, and snapshots across various systems.\n\nIT outsourcing also represents a major service provided by IBM, with more than 40 data centers worldwide. alphaWorks is IBM's source for emerging software technologies, and SPSS is a software package used for statistical analysis. IBM's Kenexa suite provides employment and retention solutions, and includes the BrassRing, an applicant tracking system used by thousands of companies for recruiting. IBM also owns The Weather Company, which provides weather forecasting and includes weather.com and Weather Underground.\n\nSmarter Planet is an initiative that seeks to achieve economic growth, near-term efficiency, sustainable development, and societal progress, targeting opportunities such as smart grids, water management systems, solutions to traffic congestion, and greener buildings.\n\nServices provisions include Redbooks, which are publicly available online books about best practices with IBM products, and developerWorks, a website for software developers and IT professionals with how-to articles and tutorials, as well as software downloads, code samples, discussion forums, podcasts, blogs, wikis, and other resources for developers and technical professionals.\n\nIBM Watson is a technology platform that uses natural language processing and machine learning to reveal insights from large amounts of unstructured data. Watson was debuted in 2011 on the American game-show \"Jeopardy!\", where it competed against champions Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter in a three-game tournament and won. Watson has since been applied to business, healthcare, developers, and universities. For example, IBM has partnered with Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to assist with considering treatment options for oncology patients and for doing melanoma screenings. Also, several companies have begun using Watson for call centers, either replacing or assisting customer service agents. \n\nResearch has been a part of IBM since its founding, and its organized efforts trace their roots back to 1945, when the Watson Scientific Computing Laboratory was founded at Columbia University in New York City, converting a renovated fraternity house on Manhattan's West Side into IBM's first laboratory. Now, IBM Research constitutes the largest industrial research organization in the world, with 12 labs on 6 continents. IBM Research is headquartered at the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in New York, and facilities include the Almaden lab in California, Austin lab in Texas, Australia lab in Melbourne, Brazil lab in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, China lab in Beijing and Shanghai, Ireland lab in Dublin, Haifa lab in Israel, India lab in Delhi and Bangalore, Tokyo lab, Zurich lab and Africa lab in Nairobi.\n\nIn terms of investment, IBM's R&D spend totals several billion dollars each year. In 2012, that expenditure was approximately $6.9 billion USD. Recent allocations have included $1 billion to create a business unit for Watson in 2014, and $3 billion to create a next-gen semiconductor along with $4 billion towards growing the company's \"strategic imperatives\" (cloud, analytics, mobile, security, social) in 2015.\n\nIBM has been a leading proponent of the Open Source Initiative, and began supporting Linux in 1998. The company invests billions of dollars in services and software based on Linux through the IBM Linux Technology Center, which includes over 300 Linux kernel developers. IBM has also released code under different open source licenses, such as the platform-independent software framework Eclipse (worth approximately US$40 million at the time of the donation), the three-sentence International Components for Unicode (ICU) license, and the Java-based relational database management system (RDBMS) Apache Derby. IBM's open source involvement has not been trouble-free, however (see \"SCO v. IBM\").\n\nFamous inventions and developments by IBM include: the Automated teller machine (ATM), Dynamic random access memory (DRAM), the electronic keypunch, the financial swap, the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, the magnetic stripe card, the relational database, RISC, the SABRE airline reservation system, SQL, the Universal Product Code (UPC) bar code, and the virtual machine. Additionally, in 1990 company scientists used a scanning tunneling microscope to arrange 35 individual xenon atoms to spell out the company acronym, marking the first structure assembled one atom at a time. A major part of IBM research is the generation of patents. Since its first patent for a traffic signaling device, IBM has been one of the world's most prolific patent sources. In 2018, the company holds the record for most patents generated by a business, marking 25 consecutive years for the achievement.\n\nFive IBMers have received the Nobel Prize: Leo Esaki, of the Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., in 1973, for work in semiconductors; Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer, of the Zurich Research Center, in 1986, for the scanning tunneling microscope; and Georg Bednorz and Alex Müller, also of Zurich, in 1987, for research in superconductivity. Several IBMers have also won the Turing Award, including the first female recipient Frances E. Allen.\n\nCurrent research includes a collaboration with the University of Michigan to see computers act as an academic adviser for undergraduate computer science and engineering students at the university, and a partnership with AT&T, combining their cloud and Internet of Things (IoT) platforms to make them interoperable and to provide developers with easier tools.\n\nIBM is nicknamed \"Big Blue\" in part due to its blue logo and color scheme, and also partially since IBM once had a de facto dress code of white shirts with blue suits. The company logo has undergone several changes over the years, with its current \"8-bar\" logo designed in 1972 by graphic designer Paul Rand. It was a general replacement for a 13-bar logo, since period photocopiers did not render large areas well.\n\nIBM has a valuable brand as a result of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996, IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for the Masters Tournament, one of the four major championships in professional golf, with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), the first course cam (1998), the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009), and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed in the United States for a major sporting event (2016). As a result, IBM CEO Ginni Rometty became the third female member of the Master's governing body, the Augusta National Golf Club. IBM is also a major sponsor in professional tennis, with engagements at the U.S. Open, Wimbledon, the Australian Open, and the French Open. The company also sponsored the Olympic Games from 1960–2000, and the National Football League from 2003–2012.\n\nIn 2012, IBM's brand was valued at $75.5 billion and ranked by \"Interbrand\" as the №2 best brand worldwide. That same year, it was also ranked the №1 company for leaders (\"Fortune\"), the №2 green company in the U.S. (\"Newsweek\"), the №2 most respected company (\"Barron's\"), the №5 most admired company (\"Fortune\"), the №18 most innovative company (\"Fast Company\"), and the №1 in technology consulting and №2 in outsourcing (Vault). In 2015, Forbes ranked IBM the №5 most valuable brand.\n\nIBM has one of the largest workforces in the world, and employees at Big Blue are referred to as \"IBMers\". The company was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934), survivor benefits (1935), training for women (1935), paid vacations (1937), and training for disabled people (1942). IBM hired its first black salesperson in 1946, and in 1952, CEO Thomas J. Watson, Jr. published the company's first written equal opportunity policy letter, one year before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Brown vs. Board of Education and 11 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Human Rights Campaign has rated IBM 100% on its index of gay-friendliness every year since 2003, with IBM providing same-sex partners of its employees with health benefits and an anti-discrimination clause. Additionally, in 2005, IBM became the first major company in the world to commit formally to not use genetic information in employment decisions; and in 2015, IBM was named to \"Working Mother\"s 100 Best Companies List for the 30th consecutive year.\n\nIBM has several leadership development and recognition programs to recognize employee potential and achievements. For early-career high potential employees, IBM sponsors leadership development programs by discipline (e.g., general management (GMLDP), human resources (HRLDP), finance (FLDP)). Each year, the company also selects 500 IBMers for the IBM Corporate Service Corps (CSC), which has been described as the corporate equivalent of the Peace Corps and gives top employees a month to do humanitarian work abroad. For certain interns, IBM also has a program called Extreme Blue that partners top business and technical students to develop high-value technology and compete to present their business case to the company's CEO at internship's end.\n\nThe company also has various designations for exceptional individual contributors such as Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM), Research Staff Member (RSM), Distinguished Engineer (DE), and Distinguished Designer (DD). Prolific inventors can also achieve patent plateaus and earn the designation of Master Inventor. The company's most prestigious designation is that of IBM Fellow. Since 1963, the company names a handful of Fellows each year based on technical achievement. Other programs recognize years of service such as the Quarter Century Club established in 1924, and sellers are eligible to join the Hundred Percent Club, composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas, convened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Each year, the company also selects 1,000 IBMers annually to award the Best of IBM Award, which includes an all-expenses paid trip to the awards ceremony in an exotic location.\n\nIBM's culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a \"sincere\" tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees. During IBM's management transformation in the 1990s, CEO Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. relaxed these codes, normalizing the dress and behavior of IBM employees. The company's culture has also given to different plays on the company acronym (IBM), with some saying is stands for \"I've Been Moved\" due to relocations and layoffs, others saying it stands for \"I'm By Myself\" pursuant to a prevalent work-from-anywhere norm, and others saying it stands for \"I'm Being Mentored\" due to the company's open door policy and encouragement for mentoring at all levels. In terms of labor relations, the company has traditionally resisted labor union organizing, although unions represent some IBM workers outside the United States. In Japan, IBM employees also have an American football team complete with pro stadium, cheerleaders and televised games, competing in the Japanese X-League as the \"Big Blue\".\n\nIn 2015, IBM started giving employees the option of choosing either a PC or a Mac as their primary work device, resulting in IBM becoming the world's largest Mac shop. In 2016, IBM eliminated forced rankings and changed its annual performance review system to focus more on frequent feedback, coaching, and skills development.\n\nMany IBMers have also achieved notability outside of work and after leaving IBM. In business, former IBM employees include Apple Inc. CEO Tim Cook, former EDS CEO and politician Ross Perot, Microsoft chairman John W. Thompson, SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) CEO Lisa Su, Citizens Financial Group CEO Ellen Alemany, former Yahoo! chairman Alfred Amoroso, former AT&T CEO C. Michael Armstrong, former Xerox Corporation CEOs David T. Kearns and G. Richard Thoman, former Fair Isaac Corporation CEO Mark N. Greene, Citrix Systems co-founder Ed Iacobucci, ASOS.com chairman Brian McBride, and former Lenovo CEO Steve Ward.\n\nIn government, alumna Patricia Roberts Harris served as United States Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the first African American woman to serve in the United States Cabinet. Samuel K. Skinner served as U.S. Secretary of Transportation and as the White House Chief of Staff. Alumni also include U.S. Senators Mack Mattingly and Thom Tillis; Wisconsin governor Scott Walker; former U.S. Ambassadors Vincent Obsitnik (Slovakia), Arthur K. Watson (France), and Thomas Watson Jr. (Soviet Union); and former U.S. Representatives Todd Akin, Glenn Andrews, Robert Garcia, Katherine Harris, Amo Houghton, Jim Ross Lightfoot, Thomas J. Manton, Donald W. Riegle Jr., and Ed Zschau.\n\nOthers are NASA astronaut Michael J. Massimino, Canadian astronaut Julie Payette, Harvey Mudd College president Maria Klawe, Western Governors University president emeritus Robert Mendenhall, former University of Kentucky president Lee T. Todd Jr., NFL referee Bill Carollo, former Rangers F.C. chairman John McClelland, and recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature J. M. Coetzee. Thomas Watson Jr. also served as the 11th national president of the Boy Scouts of America.\n\nThe company's 14 member Board of Directors are responsible for overall corporate management and includes the CEOs of American Express, Ford Motor Company, Boeing, Dow Chemical, Johnson and Johnson, and Cemex.\n\nIn 2011, IBM became the first technology company Warren Buffett's holding company Berkshire Hathaway invested in. As of 2016, he owns 8.51 percent of IBM's shares.\n\n\n"

                "Shaun White\n\nShaun Roger White (born September 3, 1986) is an American professional snowboarder and skateboarder. He is a two-time Olympic gold medalist. He holds the record for the most X-Games gold medals and has won 10 ESPY Awards.\n\nWhite was born in San Diego, California. His ancestry includes Irish and Italian. He was born with a Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect for which he endured two open-heart operations before the age of one. He stands 5'8\" (1.73 m) tall. White spent his formative years riding Okemo Mountain and Bear Mountain, small ski resorts found in Ludlow, Vermont, and the San Bernardino Mountains of Southern California.\n\nWhite quickly drew the eyes of many in the skateboarder scene, including professional skateboarder Tony Hawk. Hawk befriended the nine-year-old White at a local skatepark and mentored him, helping him turn pro in skateboarding at the age of 17. White has won many titles on his skateboard, including the overall title of Action Sports Tour Champion, and was the first person to compete in and win both the Summer and Winter X Games in two different sports.\n\nFollowing in his older brother's footsteps, White switched from skiing to snowboarding at age six, and by age seven he received his first sponsorship. White has participated in three Winter Olympics in his career. At both the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics, White won gold in the snowboard halfpipe event. White has also participated in the Winter X Games, where he has won a medal every year since 2002. Including all winter X Games competitions through 2013, his medal count stands at 18 (13 gold, 3 silver, 2 bronze), among which is the first quadruple win streak by a male athlete in one discipline, the snowboard slopestyle. White's streak was snapped in 2007 when he lost to Andreas Wiig and Teddy Flandreau, with White taking the bronze. He won the Air & Style Contest in 2003 and 2004.\n\nAt the 2006 Winter Olympics, White won gold in the half-pipe. After his first run in qualifications, White was almost out of competition, scoring only 37.7. On his second run, he recorded a score of 45.3. In the finals, White recorded a score of 46.8 (50 is the highest possible score) to win. Fellow American Danny Kass won the silver with a points total of 44.0.\n\nExecuting a near-flawless second run, White captured his third consecutive snowboard halfpipe title at the 2008 U.S. Open Snowboarding Championships to go along with his third US Open slopestyle competition. This followed White's win at the 25th (2007) Burton US Open, where he placed third in slopestlyle and first in the halfpipe. At the 2007 Open, White was also crowned the first \"Burton Global Open Champion\". His take for the event was $100,000 (Global Open Champ), $20,000 (1st Place Halfpipe), $90,000 (3rd Place Slopestyle), and a new Corvette.\n\nOn November 16, 2008, White released his first videogame \"Shaun White Snowboarding\" in North America (November 14, 2008, in Europe). \"Shaun White:Snowboarding\" was the 20th best-selling game of December 2008 in the United States.\n\nThere was a lot of controversy over who won the 2009 SuperPipe at Winter X Games XIII. Kevin Pearce had 5 hits in the pipe, and all were the same tricks White did in his final run. White, on the other hand, had 6 hits and he started off his run with a big backside rodeo 540 where Pearce started his run off with a big grab. Although Pearce went bigger, he had only 5 hits, and his first hit wasn't as technical as White's first hit. Judges came to the conclusion that White deserved the better score because he started off with a more technical trick and he had 1 more hit than Pearce. With the win, White became the second competitor, after Tanner Hall, to win a gold medal in the superpipe in consecutive years at the Winter X Games. He also won a gold medal in Slopestyle, finally winning gold after 2 straight years of bronze.\n\nOn February 14, 2009, White won the FIS World Cup Men's Halfpipe event at Vancouver's Cypress Mountain. Out of the gate in his first qualifying run, he qualified immediately with the day's best score of 45.5. With a thumb sprained on an over-rotated backside 1080 in the second qualifying run, he clinched the event with the first of his two runs in the finals. His first finals run was awarded the highest score ever in FIS halfpipe, a 47.3.\n\nAt the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, White again won gold in the halfpipe. In the finals, White recorded a score of 46.8 on his first run, which proved a high enough score to secure the gold medal without a second run. He performed his second run anyway, as a victory lap, ending his run with a well-anticipated Double McTwist 1260 which he named The Tomahawk. This second run resulted in a record score of 48.4 (50 is the highest possible score) enlarging his margin of victory. His nearest competitor won the silver with a points total of 45.0, 3.4 behind White.\n\nAfter a sub-par performance in the Slopestyle, failing to reach the finals, White \"redeemed\" himself in the Superpipe. With an 89, he sat in second place going into his 2nd of three runs. He completed the run, landing his infamous Double McTwist 1260 and finishing with a score of 97.33 to take the lead and claim the historical 4th straight Gold in the Winter X Games, held in Aspen Colorado. The score tied an X Games record which was set by White one year before. His 3rd run was a simple victory run featuring mostly straight air.\n\nAt Winter X, White became the first person to score a perfect 100 in the men's Snowboard Superpipe in the history of Winter X Games.\n\nWhite won his 6th consecutive SuperPipe victory, placing him as the second participant to ever achieve this, with SnoCross racer Tucker Hibbert achieving his 6th consecutive victory earlier in the same day.\n\nIn December 2013, he won the third place in the Pipe & Slope contest at the FIS Snowboard World Cup in Copper Mountain, Colorado.\n\nWhite finished fourth at the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Halfpipe event.\n\nDuring the winter games, he was the most talked-about Olympic athlete on Facebook.\n\nWhile in New Zealand, training for the 2018 Winter Olympics, Shaun White crashed into the edge of a superpipe. The resulting injuries to his face required 62 stitches. Despite the incident, Shaun White qualified for the 2018 US Olympic Team.\n\n\n\nWhite has had a sponsor since he was seven years old. White signed CAA Sports for representation after working with IMG for eight years. Corporate endorsement deals include or have included Burton Snowboards, Oakley, Inc., Birdhouse Skateboards, Park City Mountain Resort, Target Corporation, Red Bull, Ubisoft, Adio and Hewlett-Packard. White also has his own character on the game \"Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder\" as well as the video games \"Shaun White Snowboarding\" and \"Shaun White Skateboarding\". In 2009, \"Forbes\" magazine estimated that he had earned $9 million from his endorsements in 2008.\n\nWhite has made cameo appearance as himself in the 2011 film \"Friends with Benefits\", the 2013 episode \"Da Flippity Flop\" of the animated TV series \"American Dad!\", and the 2014 Disney Channel Original Movie \"Cloud 9\".\n\nIn a 2007 interview with \"Outside\" magazine, White stated that he had turned down numerous film roles in which \"the first lines [for his character] are always \"What up, brah?'\".\n\nWhite plays guitar in the electronic rock band Bad Things, which also features former Augustana bassist Jared Palomar. The band played in one of the four Saturday headlining slots at the 2013 Lollapalooza festival, as a last minute replacement for Death Grips. Their self-titled debut album was released in January 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Bad Things drummer Lena Zawaideh brought a lawsuit against White, claiming sexual harassment and breach of contract. White and Zawaideh reached an out-of-court settlement in May 2017; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.\n\nIn October 2013, White appeared in the music video for \"City of Angels\" by Thirty Seconds to Mars.\n\n\nWhite has had the longstanding nickname \"The Flying Tomato\", due to his shock of red hair. In 2006, \"Rolling Stone\" wrote about the nickname, \"he used to embrace it, even wearing headbands with a flying-tomato logo, but he has grown tired of it.\" He has also been nicknamed \"animal\", a reference to a character from \"The Muppet Show\".\n\nIn February 2009, Red Bull built White a halfpipe completely out of natural snow in the back country of Colorado on the backside of Silverton Mountain, coordinates (37.838801,-107.710299).\n\nOn September 17, 2012, White was arrested near a hotel in Nashville for public intoxication and vandalism after attending the wedding party of the drummer of The Black Keys, Patrick Carney.\n\n\n",
                "Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder)\n\nPaul Martin Rodriguez Jr. (born December 31, 1984), also known by his nickname P-Rod, is an American professional street skateboarder and actor. Rodriguez has won a total of eight medals at the X Games, four of them gold, with the most recent first-place victory occurring in Los Angeles, United States (U.S.) in July 2012.\n\nRodriguez was born in Tarzana, California, U.S. His father is actor/comedian Paul Rodriguez, and his mother is Laura Martinez. He also has a sister Nikole, and a brother Lucas. \n\nAs a child, Rodriguez occasionally got to meet celebrities through his father. In a later interview, he recounted one such memory:\n\nI'll tell you a good story about Mr. T. I believe it was 1988, every year there was a Christmas Day parade in Pasadena [California, US]; I was probably about three-and-a-half, four years-old—I loved Mr. T. He had the cartoon out at the time and all that. We're, were there at the banquet before the parade started 'cause my dad brought me to take me in the car to wave at the crowd, or whatever. And, ah, I had to go to the bathroom, my dad was getting interviewed, and, like, I tried to tell him; Mr. T was just standing there, chilling, 'cause they were just talking, and Mr. T goes, \"I'll take you\". And he throws me up on his shoulders, and I'm sitting up on top of all his gold chains. I remember it perfectly and he put me on top of his shoulders and walked me to the bathroom; like, just waited outside for me, and it was sick. Mr. T chauffeured me to [the bathroom].\n\nRodriguez's nickname \"P-Rod\" was given to him by his classmates when he was around eleven years old.\n\nWhen he was twelve, Rodriguez received his first skateboard as a Christmas gift from his parents. Rodriguez had seen a group of skateboarders at his new school and was immediately fascinated by \"how they kept their board to their feet and how they could flip it.\" Rodriguez said in June 2014: \"I got money, got myself a board, and it was game over.\"\n\nRodriguez stated in a July 2013 interview that he slept with new skateboard products as a child due to his passion for skateboarding, and admitted that he slept with his first Street League Skateboarding (SLS) trophy.\n\nRodriguez attended Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, CA.\n\nRodriguez was initially recruited to the team of a local skateboard shop named \"One Eighteen\", managed by an Andy Netkin, who was 19 years old at the time, while Rodriguez had just become 14 years old. As he was too shy at the time, Rodriguez asked a friend to submit his \"Sponsor me\" video tape to Netkin, who was immediately impressed and asked the friend to bring Rodriguez into the store. Netkin then offered Rodriguez a place on the store team the following day at their first meeting—Netkin explained in 2014 that, at the time, he had a strong sense of Rodriguez's future as a \"superstar.\" DNA Skateboards was Rodriguez's first company sponsor and he appeared in the 1999 video \"Microanalysis\". Former professional skateboarder Anthony Pappalardo stated in a June 24, 2014 online radio show—hosted by professional skateboarder Alex Olsen—that he encouraged Joe Castrucci, cofounder of the Habitat skateboard brand, to recruit Rodriguez before he was officially sponsored, but Castrucci declined.\n\nAt age sixteen, Rodriguez then rode for City Stars, a company founded by professional skateboarder Kareem Campbell in Los Angeles, U.S. Despite being an amateur at the time, Rodriguez earned the last part in the video \"Street Cinema\", which is an honor typically bestowed to an esteemed professional of the team. Rodriguez explained in 2014 that he was initially opposed to Campbell's use of the Jackson 5 song \"I Want You Back\" for the first half of his part, as it had been used for Guy Mariano's part in the Blind Skateboards video \"Video Days\", but conceded that at the time he \"was oblivious to the statement he [Campbell] was trying to make by choosing that song.\"\n\nAlongside Mikey Taylor, Justin Case, Devine Calloway and Kevin \"Spanky\" Long, Rodriguez was an amateur team member, while the professional team included Lee Smith, Joey Suriel, Ryan Denman and Eric Pupecki. Rodriguez developed his interest in jewelry during this period, as Campbell was a collector and purchased Rodriguez a diamond bracelet. The period also influenced Rodriguez's musical taste, as he commenced listening to artists like Jay-Z and Nas due to the time spent with Campbell.\n\nCity Stars had planned to release a signature skateboard deck design, featuring Rodriguez's name on the grill of a Mercedes Benz (Rodriguez's first car), but Rodriguez's departure from the company resulted in the product's cancellation. Rodriguez explained in February 2013: \"I specifically remember that I knew I wanted to quit and I felt like I could at least show enough respect and tell them before they spent all that money to print up my boards. I didn’t want to leave them with an inventory of boards they couldn’t sell so I made sure to quit well before they went into production.\" In 2014 Rodriguez described his time at the brand as \"the most magical,\" with a team that possessed \"enthusiasm and passion\" that was \"contagious.\"\n\nRodriguez was featured in Transworld Skateboarding's 2002 video, \"In Bloom\". This video showcased a segment of sponsored, talented skaters who were at the start of their respective careers. Following the video's release, Rodriguez commenced riding for Girl Skateboards and achieved professional status in September 2002. Rodriguez explained in a 2013 interview that he was asked to join the Girl team by Eric Koston, whom he called his all-time favorite skateboarder. Rodriguez said that it was the most significant event in his skateboarding career, as it was, \"the moment that my dream happened.\" \nRodriguez was sponsored by Girl from the age of seventeen to nineteen, and appears in the Girl Skateboards film \"Yeah Right\". During this period, he shared a house with professional skateboarder and rap artist Jereme Rogers.\n\nIn February 2013, Rodriguez identified his debut professional signature skateboard with Girl as his favorite deck graphic of all-time. The deck, released in 2002, featured the original Girl logo, Rodriguez's name (written in English), and the Spanish word \"Muchachita\", meaning \"girl\", instead of the usual \"Girl\" brand name. Rodriguez stated that \"That was my first pro board and to have it on a company like Girl was awesome.\" In April 2013 Rodriguez explained that he \"loved\" his time with the Girl company and, prior to receiving contact from Danny Way—who asked him to join the relaunched Plan B company—he considered Girl a lifelong sponsor.\n\nFollowing Girl, Rodriguez joined the relaunched Plan B skateboard deck brand that was under the ownership and guidance of original riders Danny Way and Colin McKay, who continue to own the brand as of March 2014.\n\nRodriguez released a solo Plan B video part, entitled \"Me, Myself, and I\", in 2010. The inaugural Plan B full-length video has been a topic of discussion among the global skateboarding community for a prolonged duration of time, as promotional footage has been released and the company has been in existence for a significant period of time, with a renowned team established during this time period. A late November episode of the internet-based, weekly program, \"Skateline\", broadcast on the RIDE Channel, showed footage of company co-owner and team rider, Danny Way, stating that the video would be made according to a schedule determined by the company regardless of external pressure.\n\nSeven out of Rodriguez's top ten skateboard graphics of all time are Plan B Rodriguez signature designs, according to an interview that was published in February 2013. A collaboration between Plan B and Nike SB is Rodriguez's second favorite graphic, while a Bruce Lee \"Fury\" deck (\"Needless to say, Bruce Lee is my number one influence other than Jesus Christ ... it also shows the three scrapes he had on his face from \"Enter The Dragon\". I love this one.\") and a Muhammad Ali deck were also included in the list.\n\nIn a July 2013 radio interview with Big Boi on Los Angeles' Power 106, Rodriguez confirmed his departure, which had already been widely speculated. During his winning performance at Stop 5 of the 2013 Street League Skateboarding contest in Portland, Oregon, U.S., Rodriguez rode a skateboard deck with the Plan B logo painted over and the company's logo was removed from his personal website as of July 16, 2013. Rodriguez explained in the interview that he is seeking to \"own a little bit more of myself.\"\n\nIn June 2014, following the launch of his own skateboard deck company, Primitive Skateboarding, and his eighth signature shoe with Nike, Rodriguez explained his perspective on the future:\nIt got to a point where I wanted to get my name on a board and did that, wanted my name on a shoe and did that, wanted other endorsements, awards, and to win certain competitions, and did those, too ... Now it’s back to just wanting to get better. I want to keep improving my abilities.\n\nThe design for his Nike signature shoe was first leaked onto the Internet at the beginning of the year, leading to an intense degree of discussion among consumers, described by the Ripped Laces website as \"hate/skepticism.\" The corresponding advertisement featured Nike SB team member, Theotis Beasley, and was produced by the Wieden + Kennedy agency.\n\nIn a promotional day-in-the-life photo diary for the Hypebeast website, published on December 16, 2014, Rodriguez revealed that his personal skateboarding park is scheduled for a remodeling process. He also stated that his daily caffeine fix brings \"happiness,\" and that the only time his mind is clear is while he is skateboarding.\n\nAt the beginning of 2015, Rodriguez joined the Glassy Sunhaters sunglasses brand, co-owned by fellow professional skateboarder Mike Mo Capaldi. His signature sunglasses model was release in February 2015.\n\nRodriguez launched his own skateboard brand, Primitive Skateboarding, in April 2014, with the initial team consisting of himself, Nick Tucker and Carlos Ribeiro.\n\nAs of January 19, 2016, Rodriguez is sponsored by Primitive Skateboarding, Nike Skateboarding, Target, Nixon Watches, Incase Designs, Primitive Skateshop, Glassy Sunhaters, Markisa, Venture, Andalé Bearings As of June 2014, Rodriguez is managed by Circe Wallace.\n\nRodriguez is a senior team rider for the Nike skateboarding division, having released his eighth skate shoe model in May 2014, and was responsible for welcoming Luan Oliviera to Nike in September 2012. Rodriguez released his first signature Nike shoe in 2005 following his departure from skate shoe brand, eS. Rodriguez explained in a 2012 interview for the \"Footnotes\" segment on the Berrics website:\nThe transition from eS to Nike was—after I got through making the phone call—I had to call Koston; I had to call, you know, Tony at eS; had to call a few people 'cause we were close; we were good family over there. So, after I got through that hard part, and I could just, and I was free of that burden, then when I got on Nike, it was just, like, the world was opened up—it was insane.\n\nRodriguez was one of the early riders to be approached by Nike following its second attempt to succeed in the skateboarding market and sub-culture. Rodriguez has explained:\nUm, my thoughts on Nike when they first approached me were cool. I mean, like, I did get some criticisms, selling out, this and that ... and I never really been too worried 'bout that criticism. So my thoughts were just like, I look at it like this, like: My first pair of shoes were the baby Jordans [basketball player, Michael Jordan], you know what I mean, so, like, I had Nikes all my life growing up, and even at the time that I was on eS, any time that I was not skating, I wearing some white-on-white Air Force Ones, or Cortezs—I had a whole flock of Nike anyway ... the way I looked at it, was like, I've been a Nike supporter since birth. So me, I was just stoked, I was just hyped to get on Nike.\n\nRodriguez released his seventh signature model shoe, entitled the \"Paul Rodriguez 7,\" with Nike in mid-2013. It was designed with Shawn Carboy, who Rodriguez first started working with during the design of his fifth signature model. Rodriguez prioritized the functionality of the shoe, and impact protection is its primary feature.\n\nThe \"P-ROD 8\", Rodriguez's eighth signature shoe was released in May 2014. On May 25, 2014, Rodriguez, alongside fellow Nike team member and skateboarding veteran, Lance Mountain, promoted the model in a video interview, whereby the history of the Nike shoe in skateboarding culture forms the foundation of the segment—Mountain explained that prior to the official launch of the Nike brand onto the skateboarding market, skateboarders said, \"This [Nike] is our shoe\". Rodriguez described himself as a \"Jordan baby\", growing up during the peak of Michael Jordan's career, and explained that his eighth Nike shoe model is an \"homage to all those things I grew up loving—even before I met skateboarding. And now it's intertwined.\" The P-ROD 8 features three of Nike's shoe technology developments: \"Lunarlon\", \"Flywire\" and \"Hyperscreen\". (Rodriguez explained in the video with Mountain that the Flywire grips around the foot in the event of a significant fall during the act of skateboarding.)\n\nFollowing the release of the P-ROD 8, Rodriguez was informed by a Nike executive that he is one of only four Nike athletes to have produced eight signature shoe models—the other being Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. In 2014, having been sponsored by Nike for ten years, Rodriguez stated: \"it feels like I've also grown with them. I’ve become intertwined with Nike. Our stories are together — at least with Nike SB. The process of making a shoe, at this point, is like a well-oiled machine.\"\n\nOn August 13, 2010, the Target corporation announced in a press release that Rodriguez had joined its sponsorship ranks. He became the second professional skateboarder to have a sponsorship deal with Target, the first being Shaun White, though White is better known for snowboarding. A Target representative stated in the press release, \"Paul is an amazing competitor and is the perfect personality to add to our program. With so many accomplishments and a promising future ahead of him, Paul is a natural fit for Target and we’re proud to have our brand represented on his skateboard.\" Rodriguez was also quoted in the press release: \"I grew up right across the street from a Target and have many memories of skating over to the store as a kid. I’ve always loved their brand and am excited about the relationship and potential of what we can do together.\"\n\nIn 2012 Rodriguez participated in a competition with AT&T that allowed the winner to participate in the filming of a promotional video featuring Rodriguez. The final video also featured professional skateboarder, Manny Santiago, and was directed by Nigel Alexander, a long-time friend of Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez owns a private skateboard park in the Canoga Park area of California, U.S. that features design elements from his sponsors, Mountain Dew, Nike SB, and Target. Rodriguez designed the park with skateboard park builder Mike Roebke, who used a computer program to blend his own ideas with drawings from Rodriguez. Rodriguez has stated, \"I enjoy skating there and I'm blessed to have that type of place at my fingertips.\"\n\nIn collaboration with the Network A media company, Rodriguez is featured in a six-part internet-based series about himself entitled \"LIFE\". The series, produced and directed by professional skateboarder Steve Berra, was released on a weekly basis on the company's YouTube channel..\n\nThe first episode \"Family First\" follows Rodriguez as he revisits his grandmother's home following her cancer diagnosis (Rodriguez foregoes competing at the notable Tampa Pro contest to undertake the visit). Rodriguez explained in 2013 that Berra was the only other person to accompany him during his visit to his grandmother's home, as Rodriguez trusted Berra to be present. In the second episode, entitled \"mASTA of disASTA\", Rodriguez prepares to compete against Tom Asta in the Battle of the Berrics competition.\n\nIn the third episode, \"Street League Matters\", Rodriguez is filmed in Kansas City, U.S., as he prepares for the qualifying round of one of the stops of the Street League competition. The episode shows Rodriguez as he finishes in fourth place. The fourth episode of \"LIFE\" follows Rodriguez, together with close friends Heath Brinkley (photographer and filmer), Justine Schulte, and Carlos Zarazua, as he visits New Orleans, U.S. for the opening of hip hop artist Lil' Wayne's skate park in the wake of Hurricane Katrina—the skate park is called the \"Truckstop\" and is located in the Lower Ninth Ward area.\n\nIn \"The Other Half\", the fifth episode of \"LIFE\", the camera follows Rodriguez as he competes in the Dew Tour contest and discusses the role of contests in relation to the more fundamental aspects of a professional street skateboarder's life—video footage and street skateboarding.\n\n\"Transworld SKATEboarding\" selected Rodriguez for the thirtieth position of its \"30 Most Influential Skaters of All Time\" list, released in December 2011. In response to the selection, Rodriguez revealed that Koston and Andrew Reynolds are two professional skateboarders who he considers as influential in a career sense, due to their \"longevity\", \"the impacts they’ve had\", and the degree of respect they have garnered. In an April 2013 interview, Rodriguez added Tom Penny to his \"most influential\" list and stated, \"Him [Penny], Koston and Reynolds. That's my combo right there.\". \nIn regard to Rodriguez, professional skateboarder Nyjah Huston explained in December 2013:\nHe is such a good dude, on and off the [skate]board. He's such a professional person. He's an amazing street skater, and just as good of a contest skater. So, he's a pretty ideal professional skateboarder, that's for sure.\n\nAs of June 2014, Rodriguez is the owner of, or an investor in, the skateboard brands Primitive (retail outlet, apparel and skateboard deck company), Markisa (wallets and accessories) and Andale (skateboard bearings), the latter in partnership with fellow professional skateboarder Joey Brezinski. In relation to Andale, Brezinski explained:\nOriginally I was working on the idea and I went through all the legal stuff. I quit my bearing sponsor at the time and I started talking to Paul about it because he had recently quit Silver at that point. I didn't know if he had plans with FKD or not, but I presented Andale to him as something we could do together. He was down and I proceeded to move forward. It took about two years to get to this point, doing a lot of work and a lot of planning.\n\nThe Primitive company consists of a retail store that is located in Los Angeles, U.S. (specializes in footwear), an apparel line and a skateboard deck brand. Rodriguez established the business in around 2005/2006 with three partners, including two friends whom he has known since childhood. In April 2014, Rodriguez was identified as the president of the company, while Netkin is the CEO and founder, and Jubal Jones is the creative director—Netkin and Jones were the original store employees and handled US$300 in sales on the opening day. Netkin describes the Primitive store, which officially opened on July 27, 2008, as a \"cross-genre\" retail outlet that also sells products, which skateboarders can relate to, outside of the skateboarding subculture.\n\nFollowing the eventual success of the retail outlet, the company commenced its apparel brand, which was a part of the founders' original plan. The popularity of the apparel brand grew rapidly and in April 2014, Jones stated that he solely focuses on the brand, while new employees are constantly hired. In 2014 Primitive Apparel is available in 11 countries and the company consists of 25 people.\n\nThe Primitive brand was expanded into a skateboard deck company called \"Primitive Skateboarding\" in April 2014.\n\nTogether with action sports filmmaker Josh Landon and professional US skateboarder Mikey Taylor, Rodriguez cofounded the Saint Archer Brewing Co., a microbrewery that is co-owned by people who are also the brand's \"Ambassadors.\" The team of Ambassadors includes professional skateboarders Eric Koston, Brian \"Slash\" Hansen, and Bryan Herman; professional and non-professional surfers Josh Kerr, Taylor Knox, Dusty Payne, Laura Enever, and Jeff Johnson; former professional snowboarder Todd Richards; photographer Atiba Jefferson; and surfboard shaper Chris Christenson. Together with Saint Archer's other Ambassadors, Rodriguez has participated in \"Tasting Room\" nights that are held at the brewery, in which the Ambassadors pour and serve beers.\n\nIn a June 2014 interview, Rodriguez asserted that he is a \"young, beginning entrepreneur who’s learning the ropes of the game,\" before revealing the philosophy that has benefited him over the course of his career: \"find people that are just as passionate at what they do as you are about what you do.\"\n\nAs of November 2013, Rodriguez resides in Northridge, California. As of August 2010, his partner was Rainbow Alexander and the pair are the parents of daughter Heaven Love. In July 2013, photographs of Rodriguez dating a woman named Rachel Metz were published on the Internet. In an April 2013 interview, Rodriguez described himself as a \"certified workaholic\", and stated that skateboarding and fatherhood are his primary concerns in life. In regard to his Mexican American heritage, Rodriguez has explained:\nIt's my roots. It's where I come from; it's my genetics, my DNA, my body, my build. All from my heritage. My ancestors all before me contributed to the blessings I’m living now. It's where you come from. You can never be ignorant to where you come from because they're responsible for what you are now.\n\nRodriguez has stated in an interview with the NetworkA media channel that holds aspirations for a serious acting career following his time with professional skateboarding—he revealed that he admires the work of Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, and Edward Norton. In addition to Bruce Lee, Alexander the Great, and Jesus Christ, Rodriguez is also influenced by rapper Tupac Shakur, and revealed in February 2013 that a skateboard deck graphic featuring Shakur would be a worthwhile design: \"I’d like to get that photo of Tupac standing on the wall with his shirt off and he’s got the Thug Life tattoo and the glock in his waist band and a blunt in his hand. That would be sick.\"\n\nRodriguez received the 2002 \"Rookie of the Year\" award from the \"Transworld SKATEboarding\" publication.\n\nWe are Blood 2015\n\nBronze: 2003 Los Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Shaun Palmer\n\nShaun Palmer (born November 14, 1968) is an American professional snowboarder, skier, mountain biker, and motocross rider. \"Palm Daddy\" is known as one of the forefathers of extreme sports.\n\nShaun Palmer (\"Napalm\") was born in South Lake Tahoe on November 14, 1968.\n\nFrom a young age, Shaun maintained a strong interest in all things fast. His mother told People Magazine in 1999 \"Whether it was on wheels or on a board, it had to be superfast—he had no fear. I remember once when he was 13, I had grounded him. Well, he jumped out of his second-floor bedroom window, got on his bike and took off. He was like that—always pushing the limits.\" \n\nWhile Palmer showed potential in both skiing and baseball, Shaun grew enamored with the still-infant sport of snowboarding. At the age of 12, Shaun built his own snowboard.\n\nPalmer taught himself to snowboard, as he was never formally schooled in the sport. In an interview with People Magazine, Palmer stated: \"I didn't watch tapes or study other guys—I just figured out what felt right.\" Just three years after building his own board, Palmer dropped out of high school to become a professional snowboarder.\n\nThroughout his snowboarding career, Palmer received various accolades, including USA Today's World's Greatest Athlete, Details Magazine's Athlete of the Year in 1998, and the NEA Extreme Athlete of the Year in 2000. Also in 2000, Palmer was named as the inaugural Laureus World Alternative Sportsperson of the Year. In February 2001, Shaun Palmer was awarded the ESPY Awards' Action Sports Athlete of the Year.\n\nIn 2006, Palmer earned himself a spot on the 2006 U.S. Olympic Snowboarding Team. Palmer was a long shot, qualifying for the team after an 11th-hour World Cup podium finish in Bad Gastein, Austria, just one month before the 2006 Winter Olympics. Unfortunately, Palmer tore his Achilles tendon just two weeks later, rendering him unable to represent the United States.\n\nIn 2010, Shaun Palmer was left off the 2010 U.S. Olympic Snowboarding Team. Palmer had sought to fill the last spot on the 18-member squad, but was bumped in favor of Nick Baumgartner. Shaun would have been the oldest man to qualify for the Winter Olympics in history.\n\nPalmer began Palmer Snowboards in 1995, as an offshoot of one of the most popular names in extreme sports.\n\nAs per his Facebook page, Palmer Snowboards closed its U.S.-based office doors in 2008 and the brand is only available for purchase within Europe. Rumor is that a Swiss owner bought the brand with inheritance; as Palmer Snowboard's online shop is all in German language and an account to shop with can only be created with an address in Europe.\n\nIn 1995, Palmer took up the sport of mountain biking, spending time around some of the sport's foremost authorities. Just one year later, Shaun began competing in the professional mountain biking circuit. Palmer shocked the mountain biking world by proving to be a more than worthy competitor. Shaun placed seventh in downhill at the second 1996 World Cup event of the year, before finishing second in downhill at the 1996 UCI World Championships, missing the top spot by just .15 seconds. Shaun threw his goggles down in frustration after finishing as he rolled through the finish area, showing his determination to obtain nothing but first The event drained Palmer, however he was quick to warn the 1996 champion Nicolas Vouilloz of France in a post race interview that after he gained some more fitness Shaun would soon be beating Vouilloz in the races. In the same interview Shaun was quick and humble to complement Nicolas as the best rider in the world based on his record of wins.\n\nBy the end of the biking season, Palmer was number five in the World Cup rankings and seventh in the NORBA National Championship Series. Palmer's debut year landed him a $300,000 annual contract with Mountain Dew Specialized Bicycles team, making Palmer the highest-paid mountain biker in the world.\n\nIn the 1999 Mountain biking season, Palmer won the NORBA downhill championship in the dual slalom category.\n\nPalmer is a professional motocross racer. Palmer claims that motocross is his favorite sport, dubbing it \"the best sport in the world.\" \n\nIn 2003, Shaun began his professional motocross career racing on the Supercross Tour. Palmer qualified for the tour on his first 125cc Supercross main event, an almost unheard of feat.\n\nBetween the snowboarding and mountain biking seasons, Palmer took up two new sports, reaching similar levels of success.\n\nIn 1998, Palmer won the Toyota Celebrity Grand Prix auto race. His interest in auto racing continued, winning the Pike's Peak Hill Climb auto race in 2000 as well as the Jeep King of the Mountain championship in 2008.\n\nIn 2001, Palmer went head to head with the world's best professional skiers, winning the Skier cross event at the 2001 Winter X Games, as well as the Skier cross gold at the Gravity Games of the same year.\n\nThroughout the 1990s, Palmer was the lead singer of a punk band called Fungus.\n\nPalmer teamed up with Activision, publishers of \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater\", to create \"Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder\" for the PlayStation 2 in 2001.\n\nPalmer has suffered from admitted problems with both alcohol and drug addiction.\n\n"

                "Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder)\n\nPaul Martin Rodriguez Jr. (born December 31, 1984), also known by his nickname P-Rod, is an American professional street skateboarder and actor. Rodriguez has won a total of eight medals at the X Games, four of them gold, with the most recent first-place victory occurring in Los Angeles, United States (U.S.) in July 2012.\n\nRodriguez was born in Tarzana, California, U.S. His father is actor/comedian Paul Rodriguez, and his mother is Laura Martinez. He also has a sister Nikole, and a brother Lucas. \n\nAs a child, Rodriguez occasionally got to meet celebrities through his father. In a later interview, he recounted one such memory:\n\nI'll tell you a good story about Mr. T. I believe it was 1988, every year there was a Christmas Day parade in Pasadena [California, US]; I was probably about three-and-a-half, four years-old—I loved Mr. T. He had the cartoon out at the time and all that. We're, were there at the banquet before the parade started 'cause my dad brought me to take me in the car to wave at the crowd, or whatever. And, ah, I had to go to the bathroom, my dad was getting interviewed, and, like, I tried to tell him; Mr. T was just standing there, chilling, 'cause they were just talking, and Mr. T goes, \"I'll take you\". And he throws me up on his shoulders, and I'm sitting up on top of all his gold chains. I remember it perfectly and he put me on top of his shoulders and walked me to the bathroom; like, just waited outside for me, and it was sick. Mr. T chauffeured me to [the bathroom].\n\nRodriguez's nickname \"P-Rod\" was given to him by his classmates when he was around eleven years old.\n\nWhen he was twelve, Rodriguez received his first skateboard as a Christmas gift from his parents. Rodriguez had seen a group of skateboarders at his new school and was immediately fascinated by \"how they kept their board to their feet and how they could flip it.\" Rodriguez said in June 2014: \"I got money, got myself a board, and it was game over.\"\n\nRodriguez stated in a July 2013 interview that he slept with new skateboard products as a child due to his passion for skateboarding, and admitted that he slept with his first Street League Skateboarding (SLS) trophy.\n\nRodriguez attended Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, CA.\n\nRodriguez was initially recruited to the team of a local skateboard shop named \"One Eighteen\", managed by an Andy Netkin, who was 19 years old at the time, while Rodriguez had just become 14 years old. As he was too shy at the time, Rodriguez asked a friend to submit his \"Sponsor me\" video tape to Netkin, who was immediately impressed and asked the friend to bring Rodriguez into the store. Netkin then offered Rodriguez a place on the store team the following day at their first meeting—Netkin explained in 2014 that, at the time, he had a strong sense of Rodriguez's future as a \"superstar.\" DNA Skateboards was Rodriguez's first company sponsor and he appeared in the 1999 video \"Microanalysis\". Former professional skateboarder Anthony Pappalardo stated in a June 24, 2014 online radio show—hosted by professional skateboarder Alex Olsen—that he encouraged Joe Castrucci, cofounder of the Habitat skateboard brand, to recruit Rodriguez before he was officially sponsored, but Castrucci declined.\n\nAt age sixteen, Rodriguez then rode for City Stars, a company founded by professional skateboarder Kareem Campbell in Los Angeles, U.S. Despite being an amateur at the time, Rodriguez earned the last part in the video \"Street Cinema\", which is an honor typically bestowed to an esteemed professional of the team. Rodriguez explained in 2014 that he was initially opposed to Campbell's use of the Jackson 5 song \"I Want You Back\" for the first half of his part, as it had been used for Guy Mariano's part in the Blind Skateboards video \"Video Days\", but conceded that at the time he \"was oblivious to the statement he [Campbell] was trying to make by choosing that song.\"\n\nAlongside Mikey Taylor, Justin Case, Devine Calloway and Kevin \"Spanky\" Long, Rodriguez was an amateur team member, while the professional team included Lee Smith, Joey Suriel, Ryan Denman and Eric Pupecki. Rodriguez developed his interest in jewelry during this period, as Campbell was a collector and purchased Rodriguez a diamond bracelet. The period also influenced Rodriguez's musical taste, as he commenced listening to artists like Jay-Z and Nas due to the time spent with Campbell.\n\nCity Stars had planned to release a signature skateboard deck design, featuring Rodriguez's name on the grill of a Mercedes Benz (Rodriguez's first car), but Rodriguez's departure from the company resulted in the product's cancellation. Rodriguez explained in February 2013: \"I specifically remember that I knew I wanted to quit and I felt like I could at least show enough respect and tell them before they spent all that money to print up my boards. I didn’t want to leave them with an inventory of boards they couldn’t sell so I made sure to quit well before they went into production.\" In 2014 Rodriguez described his time at the brand as \"the most magical,\" with a team that possessed \"enthusiasm and passion\" that was \"contagious.\"\n\nRodriguez was featured in Transworld Skateboarding's 2002 video, \"In Bloom\". This video showcased a segment of sponsored, talented skaters who were at the start of their respective careers. Following the video's release, Rodriguez commenced riding for Girl Skateboards and achieved professional status in September 2002. Rodriguez explained in a 2013 interview that he was asked to join the Girl team by Eric Koston, whom he called his all-time favorite skateboarder. Rodriguez said that it was the most significant event in his skateboarding career, as it was, \"the moment that my dream happened.\" \nRodriguez was sponsored by Girl from the age of seventeen to nineteen, and appears in the Girl Skateboards film \"Yeah Right\". During this period, he shared a house with professional skateboarder and rap artist Jereme Rogers.\n\nIn February 2013, Rodriguez identified his debut professional signature skateboard with Girl as his favorite deck graphic of all-time. The deck, released in 2002, featured the original Girl logo, Rodriguez's name (written in English), and the Spanish word \"Muchachita\", meaning \"girl\", instead of the usual \"Girl\" brand name. Rodriguez stated that \"That was my first pro board and to have it on a company like Girl was awesome.\" In April 2013 Rodriguez explained that he \"loved\" his time with the Girl company and, prior to receiving contact from Danny Way—who asked him to join the relaunched Plan B company—he considered Girl a lifelong sponsor.\n\nFollowing Girl, Rodriguez joined the relaunched Plan B skateboard deck brand that was under the ownership and guidance of original riders Danny Way and Colin McKay, who continue to own the brand as of March 2014.\n\nRodriguez released a solo Plan B video part, entitled \"Me, Myself, and I\", in 2010. The inaugural Plan B full-length video has been a topic of discussion among the global skateboarding community for a prolonged duration of time, as promotional footage has been released and the company has been in existence for a significant period of time, with a renowned team established during this time period. A late November episode of the internet-based, weekly program, \"Skateline\", broadcast on the RIDE Channel, showed footage of company co-owner and team rider, Danny Way, stating that the video would be made according to a schedule determined by the company regardless of external pressure.\n\nSeven out of Rodriguez's top ten skateboard graphics of all time are Plan B Rodriguez signature designs, according to an interview that was published in February 2013. A collaboration between Plan B and Nike SB is Rodriguez's second favorite graphic, while a Bruce Lee \"Fury\" deck (\"Needless to say, Bruce Lee is my number one influence other than Jesus Christ ... it also shows the three scrapes he had on his face from \"Enter The Dragon\". I love this one.\") and a Muhammad Ali deck were also included in the list.\n\nIn a July 2013 radio interview with Big Boi on Los Angeles' Power 106, Rodriguez confirmed his departure, which had already been widely speculated. During his winning performance at Stop 5 of the 2013 Street League Skateboarding contest in Portland, Oregon, U.S., Rodriguez rode a skateboard deck with the Plan B logo painted over and the company's logo was removed from his personal website as of July 16, 2013. Rodriguez explained in the interview that he is seeking to \"own a little bit more of myself.\"\n\nIn June 2014, following the launch of his own skateboard deck company, Primitive Skateboarding, and his eighth signature shoe with Nike, Rodriguez explained his perspective on the future:\nIt got to a point where I wanted to get my name on a board and did that, wanted my name on a shoe and did that, wanted other endorsements, awards, and to win certain competitions, and did those, too ... Now it’s back to just wanting to get better. I want to keep improving my abilities.\n\nThe design for his Nike signature shoe was first leaked onto the Internet at the beginning of the year, leading to an intense degree of discussion among consumers, described by the Ripped Laces website as \"hate/skepticism.\" The corresponding advertisement featured Nike SB team member, Theotis Beasley, and was produced by the Wieden + Kennedy agency.\n\nIn a promotional day-in-the-life photo diary for the Hypebeast website, published on December 16, 2014, Rodriguez revealed that his personal skateboarding park is scheduled for a remodeling process. He also stated that his daily caffeine fix brings \"happiness,\" and that the only time his mind is clear is while he is skateboarding.\n\nAt the beginning of 2015, Rodriguez joined the Glassy Sunhaters sunglasses brand, co-owned by fellow professional skateboarder Mike Mo Capaldi. His signature sunglasses model was release in February 2015.\n\nRodriguez launched his own skateboard brand, Primitive Skateboarding, in April 2014, with the initial team consisting of himself, Nick Tucker and Carlos Ribeiro.\n\nAs of January 19, 2016, Rodriguez is sponsored by Primitive Skateboarding, Nike Skateboarding, Target, Nixon Watches, Incase Designs, Primitive Skateshop, Glassy Sunhaters, Markisa, Venture, Andalé Bearings As of June 2014, Rodriguez is managed by Circe Wallace.\n\nRodriguez is a senior team rider for the Nike skateboarding division, having released his eighth skate shoe model in May 2014, and was responsible for welcoming Luan Oliviera to Nike in September 2012. Rodriguez released his first signature Nike shoe in 2005 following his departure from skate shoe brand, eS. Rodriguez explained in a 2012 interview for the \"Footnotes\" segment on the Berrics website:\nThe transition from eS to Nike was—after I got through making the phone call—I had to call Koston; I had to call, you know, Tony at eS; had to call a few people 'cause we were close; we were good family over there. So, after I got through that hard part, and I could just, and I was free of that burden, then when I got on Nike, it was just, like, the world was opened up—it was insane.\n\nRodriguez was one of the early riders to be approached by Nike following its second attempt to succeed in the skateboarding market and sub-culture. Rodriguez has explained:\nUm, my thoughts on Nike when they first approached me were cool. I mean, like, I did get some criticisms, selling out, this and that ... and I never really been too worried 'bout that criticism. So my thoughts were just like, I look at it like this, like: My first pair of shoes were the baby Jordans [basketball player, Michael Jordan], you know what I mean, so, like, I had Nikes all my life growing up, and even at the time that I was on eS, any time that I was not skating, I wearing some white-on-white Air Force Ones, or Cortezs—I had a whole flock of Nike anyway ... the way I looked at it, was like, I've been a Nike supporter since birth. So me, I was just stoked, I was just hyped to get on Nike.\n\nRodriguez released his seventh signature model shoe, entitled the \"Paul Rodriguez 7,\" with Nike in mid-2013. It was designed with Shawn Carboy, who Rodriguez first started working with during the design of his fifth signature model. Rodriguez prioritized the functionality of the shoe, and impact protection is its primary feature.\n\nThe \"P-ROD 8\", Rodriguez's eighth signature shoe was released in May 2014. On May 25, 2014, Rodriguez, alongside fellow Nike team member and skateboarding veteran, Lance Mountain, promoted the model in a video interview, whereby the history of the Nike shoe in skateboarding culture forms the foundation of the segment—Mountain explained that prior to the official launch of the Nike brand onto the skateboarding market, skateboarders said, \"This [Nike] is our shoe\". Rodriguez described himself as a \"Jordan baby\", growing up during the peak of Michael Jordan's career, and explained that his eighth Nike shoe model is an \"homage to all those things I grew up loving—even before I met skateboarding. And now it's intertwined.\" The P-ROD 8 features three of Nike's shoe technology developments: \"Lunarlon\", \"Flywire\" and \"Hyperscreen\". (Rodriguez explained in the video with Mountain that the Flywire grips around the foot in the event of a significant fall during the act of skateboarding.)\n\nFollowing the release of the P-ROD 8, Rodriguez was informed by a Nike executive that he is one of only four Nike athletes to have produced eight signature shoe models—the other being Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. In 2014, having been sponsored by Nike for ten years, Rodriguez stated: \"it feels like I've also grown with them. I’ve become intertwined with Nike. Our stories are together — at least with Nike SB. The process of making a shoe, at this point, is like a well-oiled machine.\"\n\nOn August 13, 2010, the Target corporation announced in a press release that Rodriguez had joined its sponsorship ranks. He became the second professional skateboarder to have a sponsorship deal with Target, the first being Shaun White, though White is better known for snowboarding. A Target representative stated in the press release, \"Paul is an amazing competitor and is the perfect personality to add to our program. With so many accomplishments and a promising future ahead of him, Paul is a natural fit for Target and we’re proud to have our brand represented on his skateboard.\" Rodriguez was also quoted in the press release: \"I grew up right across the street from a Target and have many memories of skating over to the store as a kid. I’ve always loved their brand and am excited about the relationship and potential of what we can do together.\"\n\nIn 2012 Rodriguez participated in a competition with AT&T that allowed the winner to participate in the filming of a promotional video featuring Rodriguez. The final video also featured professional skateboarder, Manny Santiago, and was directed by Nigel Alexander, a long-time friend of Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez owns a private skateboard park in the Canoga Park area of California, U.S. that features design elements from his sponsors, Mountain Dew, Nike SB, and Target. Rodriguez designed the park with skateboard park builder Mike Roebke, who used a computer program to blend his own ideas with drawings from Rodriguez. Rodriguez has stated, \"I enjoy skating there and I'm blessed to have that type of place at my fingertips.\"\n\nIn collaboration with the Network A media company, Rodriguez is featured in a six-part internet-based series about himself entitled \"LIFE\". The series, produced and directed by professional skateboarder Steve Berra, was released on a weekly basis on the company's YouTube channel..\n\nThe first episode \"Family First\" follows Rodriguez as he revisits his grandmother's home following her cancer diagnosis (Rodriguez foregoes competing at the notable Tampa Pro contest to undertake the visit). Rodriguez explained in 2013 that Berra was the only other person to accompany him during his visit to his grandmother's home, as Rodriguez trusted Berra to be present. In the second episode, entitled \"mASTA of disASTA\", Rodriguez prepares to compete against Tom Asta in the Battle of the Berrics competition.\n\nIn the third episode, \"Street League Matters\", Rodriguez is filmed in Kansas City, U.S., as he prepares for the qualifying round of one of the stops of the Street League competition. The episode shows Rodriguez as he finishes in fourth place. The fourth episode of \"LIFE\" follows Rodriguez, together with close friends Heath Brinkley (photographer and filmer), Justine Schulte, and Carlos Zarazua, as he visits New Orleans, U.S. for the opening of hip hop artist Lil' Wayne's skate park in the wake of Hurricane Katrina—the skate park is called the \"Truckstop\" and is located in the Lower Ninth Ward area.\n\nIn \"The Other Half\", the fifth episode of \"LIFE\", the camera follows Rodriguez as he competes in the Dew Tour contest and discusses the role of contests in relation to the more fundamental aspects of a professional street skateboarder's life—video footage and street skateboarding.\n\n\"Transworld SKATEboarding\" selected Rodriguez for the thirtieth position of its \"30 Most Influential Skaters of All Time\" list, released in December 2011. In response to the selection, Rodriguez revealed that Koston and Andrew Reynolds are two professional skateboarders who he considers as influential in a career sense, due to their \"longevity\", \"the impacts they’ve had\", and the degree of respect they have garnered. In an April 2013 interview, Rodriguez added Tom Penny to his \"most influential\" list and stated, \"Him [Penny], Koston and Reynolds. That's my combo right there.\". \nIn regard to Rodriguez, professional skateboarder Nyjah Huston explained in December 2013:\nHe is such a good dude, on and off the [skate]board. He's such a professional person. He's an amazing street skater, and just as good of a contest skater. So, he's a pretty ideal professional skateboarder, that's for sure.\n\nAs of June 2014, Rodriguez is the owner of, or an investor in, the skateboard brands Primitive (retail outlet, apparel and skateboard deck company), Markisa (wallets and accessories) and Andale (skateboard bearings), the latter in partnership with fellow professional skateboarder Joey Brezinski. In relation to Andale, Brezinski explained:\nOriginally I was working on the idea and I went through all the legal stuff. I quit my bearing sponsor at the time and I started talking to Paul about it because he had recently quit Silver at that point. I didn't know if he had plans with FKD or not, but I presented Andale to him as something we could do together. He was down and I proceeded to move forward. It took about two years to get to this point, doing a lot of work and a lot of planning.\n\nThe Primitive company consists of a retail store that is located in Los Angeles, U.S. (specializes in footwear), an apparel line and a skateboard deck brand. Rodriguez established the business in around 2005/2006 with three partners, including two friends whom he has known since childhood. In April 2014, Rodriguez was identified as the president of the company, while Netkin is the CEO and founder, and Jubal Jones is the creative director—Netkin and Jones were the original store employees and handled US$300 in sales on the opening day. Netkin describes the Primitive store, which officially opened on July 27, 2008, as a \"cross-genre\" retail outlet that also sells products, which skateboarders can relate to, outside of the skateboarding subculture.\n\nFollowing the eventual success of the retail outlet, the company commenced its apparel brand, which was a part of the founders' original plan. The popularity of the apparel brand grew rapidly and in April 2014, Jones stated that he solely focuses on the brand, while new employees are constantly hired. In 2014 Primitive Apparel is available in 11 countries and the company consists of 25 people.\n\nThe Primitive brand was expanded into a skateboard deck company called \"Primitive Skateboarding\" in April 2014.\n\nTogether with action sports filmmaker Josh Landon and professional US skateboarder Mikey Taylor, Rodriguez cofounded the Saint Archer Brewing Co., a microbrewery that is co-owned by people who are also the brand's \"Ambassadors.\" The team of Ambassadors includes professional skateboarders Eric Koston, Brian \"Slash\" Hansen, and Bryan Herman; professional and non-professional surfers Josh Kerr, Taylor Knox, Dusty Payne, Laura Enever, and Jeff Johnson; former professional snowboarder Todd Richards; photographer Atiba Jefferson; and surfboard shaper Chris Christenson. Together with Saint Archer's other Ambassadors, Rodriguez has participated in \"Tasting Room\" nights that are held at the brewery, in which the Ambassadors pour and serve beers.\n\nIn a June 2014 interview, Rodriguez asserted that he is a \"young, beginning entrepreneur who’s learning the ropes of the game,\" before revealing the philosophy that has benefited him over the course of his career: \"find people that are just as passionate at what they do as you are about what you do.\"\n\nAs of November 2013, Rodriguez resides in Northridge, California. As of August 2010, his partner was Rainbow Alexander and the pair are the parents of daughter Heaven Love. In July 2013, photographs of Rodriguez dating a woman named Rachel Metz were published on the Internet. In an April 2013 interview, Rodriguez described himself as a \"certified workaholic\", and stated that skateboarding and fatherhood are his primary concerns in life. In regard to his Mexican American heritage, Rodriguez has explained:\nIt's my roots. It's where I come from; it's my genetics, my DNA, my body, my build. All from my heritage. My ancestors all before me contributed to the blessings I’m living now. It's where you come from. You can never be ignorant to where you come from because they're responsible for what you are now.\n\nRodriguez has stated in an interview with the NetworkA media channel that holds aspirations for a serious acting career following his time with professional skateboarding—he revealed that he admires the work of Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, and Edward Norton. In addition to Bruce Lee, Alexander the Great, and Jesus Christ, Rodriguez is also influenced by rapper Tupac Shakur, and revealed in February 2013 that a skateboard deck graphic featuring Shakur would be a worthwhile design: \"I’d like to get that photo of Tupac standing on the wall with his shirt off and he’s got the Thug Life tattoo and the glock in his waist band and a blunt in his hand. That would be sick.\"\n\nRodriguez received the 2002 \"Rookie of the Year\" award from the \"Transworld SKATEboarding\" publication.\n\nWe are Blood 2015\n\nBronze: 2003 Los Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Eric Koston\n\nEric Koston (born April 29, 1975) is an American professional skateboarder and company owner. He has been featured in the \"Tony Hawk's\" video game series, and the Electronic Arts (EA) video games \"Skate 2\" and \"Skate 3\". Koston co-owns both Fourstar Clothing (with Guy Mariano) and the skatepark/website \"The Berrics\" (with professional skateboarder Steve Berra).\n\nEric Koston was born in Thailand, in the same hospital as fellow professional skateboarder Alphonzo Rawls (a shoe designer as of 2011). Koston was raised in San Bernardino, California, United States (U.S.) and began skating in 1986.\n\nOne of Koston's first board sponsors was the H-Street company that was co-founded by Tony Magnusson and Mike Ternasky. During Koston's time with the company the team included Danny Way and Matt Hensley, but Koston sought a larger entity and later parted ways with the company. Following H-Street, Koston joined the Girl team and appeared in the videos \"Goldfish\", \"Mouse\", \"Yeah Right\", and \"Pretty Sweet\".\n\nKoston was a leading team rider for the éS brand and an \"Eric Koston éS Game of Skate\" was held annually over numerous years. Koston also appeared in the éS video \"Menikmati\" in which he returns to his birthplace of Bangkok.\n\nFollowing his departure from éS, Koston joined the Lakai roster and a video was published onto YouTube to announce the move. After joining the company in 2006, Koston filmed a part for the 2007 Lakai video \"Fully Flared\". Koston's eventual departure for a place on the Nike SB team was accompanied by a YouTube video that parodied the George W. Bush shoe-throwing incident.\n\nNike SB immediately promoted Koston's recruitment to the brand's team with a signature shoe—the \"Eric Koston 1\" model—and a contest for consumers, entitled \"Mr. Control It All\".\n\nA promotional campaign, identified by the hashtag \"#thelegendgrows\", was launched by Nike to coincide with release of Koston's second signature shoe model the \"Eric Koston 2\". An advertisement that included other Nike athletes, such as Tiger Woods, and Koston's Nike SB teammates was filmed and a behind-the-scenes video was also published on the brand's YouTube channel. Koston used the Eric Koston 2 design as a basis for a limited edition golf shoe, named the \"Koston 2 IT\", and a corresponding launch was held in London, UK at the 1948 Stadium store in Shoreditch. During the promotional campaign for the Eric Koston 2, Koston explained his overall experience working with Nike in comparison to the core skateboarding companies he has been sponsored by in the past:\nOh it’s…it’s crazy. It’s completely different, I hate to say it, but it’s so much better because of what…not only in the design aspect and the resources…cos I’ve copied so many Nike shoes, you know, I tried to mimic them as close as possible and using the best those companies, éS and Lakai could do. But we couldn’t totally execute it…it was getting as good as I could get it, but it wasn’t quite there. But with Nike, I get to use all those bits and pieces that I’ve always wanted to use, and I have access to a lot of great technology and a lot of, basically cutting-edge shit, that like, it’s cool, you know. And I can really, truly, feel like I can innovate. So there’s that, but not only that, they actually function; I guess from start to finish, even the marketing side of things it’s above and beyond, it’s crazy.In 2016, Nike and Koston would release the \"Nike SB Koston 3 Hyperfeel\", taking inspiration from Nike's soccer line. This shoe would be one of the first skateboarding shoes to incorporate an ankle collar made of Flyknit material to provide support and stability. Upon the shoe's release, Koston claimed it to be \"the most progressive SB [Nike Skateboarding] shoe to date\". \n\nAs a sponsored rider for the Oakley sunglasses brand, Koston completed the \"Fear and Loathing in Australia\" video project that was filmed in early 2013. Accompanied by teammates, Rune Glifberg, Ryan Sheckler, and Curren Caples, Koston appears in a video that was published on June 5, 2013 and photographs that were shot by professional skateboarder Arto Saari. Koston revealed the injuries that he has sustained throughout his career on the micro-site for the project: \"Nothing major. Few bad ankle sprains, dislocated finger, stitches and tendonitis in the knee. #minor.\"\n\nAs of January 2016, Koston is sponsored by the following companies: Nike SB, Independent Truck Company, Spitfire Wheels, Fourstar, Diamond, Supreme, The Berrics, Oakley, Jessup, and Skullcandy. On Friday, February 20, 2015, he did a promotional spot on his Instagram account for the McDonald's Corporation, making him among the first popular professional skateboarders to advertise for the mega-chain.\n\nIn a 2009 video segment, Koston stated that his setup consisted of a Girl skateboard deck (8 and one-eighth-inch wide), Independent 139 trucks (high), Spitfire wheels, Bones Swiss bearings, and Bones yellow bushings (medium). Koston does not reveal the type of hardware or griptape that he used at the time, but, as of August 2012, he is sponsored by Diamond (hardware) and Jessup (griptape).\n\nOn November 19, 2015, Girl Skateboards made the announcement that Koston, along with professional skateboarder Guy Mariano, would no longer ride for the company. The news was announced through Girl's Instagram page, captioned \"Thanks for the memories.\" Both skaters were original team members of Girl, riding for the company for 22 years. On January 8, 2016 a picture was posted to Skate Mental's instagram page of Koston's name on a deck. The picture was quickly deleted. Koston has stated in an interview that he will be riding Skate Mental and WKND boards while he and Guy Mariano work on their unnamed company. However, in William Strobeck's promotional video \"KING PUPPY\" for Supreme and Nike's 2016 collaboration, Koston was filmed riding a Fucking Awesome board.\n\nAlong with friend and professional skateboarder Mariano, Koston cofounded the Fourstar clothing brand in 1996: \"The year was 1996, Guy Mariano and I had no clothing sponsors, and at that point in our lives we had purchased enough Polo, Hilfiger and Nautica gear to think, hey, maybe we should start a clothing company.\" As of July 2013, Fourstar sponsors a team of thirteen skateboarders and has released four videos. Koston was also a part-owner of the Lakai shoe brand that, like Fourstar, is distributed by Crailtap. \n\nThe Berrics is a privately owned, indoor skatepark owned by Koston and Steven Berra. It is also a website that features content filmed in the skatepark, as well other skateboard-related media. The facility's name is a portmanteau of the owners' names (the \"Ber\" of Berra's surname and the \"ric\" of Koston's first name).\n\nFounded by professional Australian surfer Josh Kerr and professional US skateboarders Mikey Taylor and Paul Rodriguez, the Saint Archer Brewing Co. is a microbrewery that is co-owned by the brand's \"Ambassadors,\" including Koston. The team of Ambassadors includes professional skateboarders Sean Malto, Brian \"Slash\" Hansen, and Bryan Herman; professional and non-professional surfers Taylor Knox, Dusty Payne, Laura Enever, and Jeff Johnson; former professional snowboarder Todd Richards; photographer Atiba Jefferson; and surfboard shaper Chris Christenson.\n\nKoston has been described as the \"Michael Jordan of skateboarding\" by teammate and professional skateboarder Brandon Biebel. Paul Rodriguez has identified Koston as the person that he would most like to model his career after and explained Koston's significance in a July 2013 interview: \"This guy to me is the end all, be all. You got to understand, this guy, he's my 100% role model in life. I studied everything he's ever done. You know, I love this guy, he's my favorite skater—period.\" Rodriguez also stated that his all-time favorite video parts are those of Koston.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Flip trick\n\nA flip trick is a type of skateboarding trick in which the skateboard rotates around its vertical axis, or its vertical axis and its horizontal axis simultaneously. The first flip trick called a kickflip, originally called a \"magic flip,\" was invented by professional skateboarder Rodney Mullen.\n\nThe following is a list of general skateboarding terms that will assist novice readers to better understand the descriptions of flip tricks contained in this article:\n\nThe concepts of frontside and backside originate from surfing, whereby the terms defined the position of the surfer in relation to the wave.\n\n\nAn abbreviated form of the title \"nose ollie\", a nollie is an ollie executed at the front of the skateboard when the rider shifts his stance from the bottom to the top of the board. The rider then uses his front foot, instead of his back foot, to propel the board upwards. Professional skateboarders Paulo Diaz, Karl Watson, Shuriken Shannon, Tuukka Korhonen, Sean Malto and Tiago Lemos have been recognized for their ability to perform the nollie trick.\n\nA switch is a stance that is opposite to one's natural stance. For example, riding with your left foot forwards as opposed to normally riding with your right foot forwards. A \"regular\" skater's switch stance is \"goofy\", and .\n\nFirst executed by Eddie Elguera during the 1970s, \"fakie\" is a skateboarding stance in which the skater is in his normal stance; however rolling backwards(towards the back foot). .\n\nThe shuvit move was invented by professional skateboarder Eddy Dela Rosa. A \"shuvit\" involves rotating the skateboard in a 180-degree motion without flipping the board. It involves pushing (or \"popping\") the tail while also shoving the board under the rider's feet. While the board rotates beneath the rider, he/she maintains the same position in the air. If performed with a larger rotation, the trick is named according to the extent of the rotation: a 360-, 540-degree, etc. shuvit. Professional skateboarder Christophe \"Willow\" Wildgrube performed a frontside 360-degree pop shuvit for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website.\n\nFor the execution of a grind, one makes moving contact with an object using the axles between the wheels, called trucks. Generally, no other part of the skateboard should be in contact with the object that is the subject of the grind. Numerous variations have been invented, whereby flip tricks are combined with grinds, such as the 'kickflip 50-50', 'nollie flip crooked grind', or 'crooked grind nollie flip out'.\n\nIn a slide, one makes contact with an object using any part of the wooden deck construction of the skateboard, including the griptape, and moves along the object. Numerous variations have been invented, whereby flip tricks are combined with slides, such as the \"kickflip boardslide\" and the \"kickflip tailslide\".\n\nGrabs are a skateboarding trick usually executed on transitional terrain, in the air between takeoff and landing. They consist of the rider holding on to any part of the skateboard while in air. They can also be executed on flat ground—for example, a \"boneless\" is a grab trick performed on flat ground, whereby one foot is used to lift off the ground and the other is used to grab the skateboard. Numerous variations have been invented, whereby flip tricks are combined with grabs, such as the \"kickflip indy grab\".\n\nThe fundamental tricks include the ollie, frontside 180, backside 180, pop shove-it, kickflip and heelflip. Combinations and variations were then derived from these basic tricks, such as the kickflip shove-it (varial kickflip), heelflip front sideshove-it (varial heelflip), hardflip, inward heelflip, nollie flip, nollie heelflip, nollie 360 flip, fakie kickflip, fakie heelflip, fakie 360 flip and the laser flip (heelflip 360 fs shuvit).\n\nAll tricks can be performed in any of the four stances—natural, fakie, switch, and nollie—and all flip tricks can be performed frontside or backside. When the board spins on both axes, it is more common for both to spin in the same direction, such as with 360 flips and laser flips; however, the board flips in contrasting angles for hardflips and inward heelflips.\n\nA finger flip requires the skateboarder to flip the board in any direction using their fingers on the nose or tail; the first ollie finger flip was invented by Mullen in 1986. Mullen has been filmed executing finger flip 360-flips and Tony Hawk executed the first finger flip in 'vert' skateboarding (skateboarding on ramp structures that consist of vertical transition).\n\nThis was the first version of the kickflip, whereby the rider hooks one foot under the board to create the flipping motion. Mullen explained to Canadian magazine, \"SBC Skateboarding\":\nPeople were doing the original Kickflips, where you hook your foot over the side, and the set-up was so rotten. You had to stand parallel [like a skier]. People tried that trick on banks, and rolled in standing like that and fell straight back. I understood that this trick needed no set-up, and it’d be an important move—for me, at least. I knew it gave me a whole new doorway to go through.\n\nA flip whereby the rider alights from the board, flips the board horizontally, 360 degrees, and then catches the board with his/her feet when the board re-lands on its wheels.\n\nWhen a skateboarder horizontally flips the board 360 degrees by flicking the corner of the board towards the skater—the trick was invented by Mullen in 1982 in a Floridian farmhouse. Instances of multiple spins are named according to how many spins are completed (e.g. double kickflip, triple kickflip, etc.)—professional skateboarder Daewon Song was filmed in 2010, performing both a double and triple kickflip, in a web video entitled \"Daewon Dorking Around at DVS\".\n\nSimilar to a kickflip, the heelflip is instead executed with the heel section flipping away from the skater this time. For a regular-footed skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of a view from behind the skater. Again, a kick formulates part of the ollie, but unlike the kickflip, the kick is directed forward and outwards, away from the rider's toe side (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel—hence the name. The trick was invented by Mullen in 1982. Instances of multiple spins are named according to how many spins are completed (e.g. double heelflip, triple heelflip, etc.)—skateboard videographer, Jon Fistemanu, is filmed executing a double heelflip in a 2010 web video entitled \"Daewon Dorking Around at DVS\".\n\nA kickflip combined with a frontside or backside 180-degree ollie—the trick is also known as a frontside or backside flip. The backside 180 kickflip was invented by Mullen in 1984. Professional skateboarder Andrew Reynolds performed a frontside kickflip for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website. Professional skateboarder (and co-owner of The Berrics) Steve Berra performed a backside kickflip for the \"Trickipedia\" section of his website. Multiple spins can also be incorporated into this trick and a frontside 180 double kickflip was filmed for the \"Skateology\" web-based video series.\n\nA heelflip combined with a frontside or backside 180-degree movement—the trick is also known as a frontside or backside \"heel\". Song is filmed performing a frontside heelflip on a transitional structure located on the back of a truck in a web-based video entitled \"DVS Daewon x Almost Love Child\".\n\nA late flip is a kickflip executed in a secondary motion, using your front or back foot, after or at the peak of an ollie—this is different from the one fluid motion that is involved with the execution of an ollie. Professional skateboarder Mike Mo Capaldi used a late flip variation in his heat against Shane O'Neill in the \"Battle at the Berrics V\" competition.\n\nAn \"[[Freestyle skaterrics website.\n\nThis flip trick variation involves the execution of a back-foot ollie impossible (the board wrapping 360 degrees around your back foot), followed by a flipping of the board, also with the back foot, as part of the same motion. The trick is also called the \"Mo flip\" because it was popularized by professional skateboarder [[Mike Mo Capaldi]].\n\nProfessional skateboarder [[Chris Haslam (skateboarder)|Chris Haslam]] was filmed performing this trick in slow motion and the footage was published on the Internet-based RIDE Channel. Haslam performs the trick while adopting his natural stance (goofy), but when the trick is performed \"switch\" it is called a \"Merlin twist.\"\n\nA varial kickflip (also known as a kickflip shuvit or 180 flip) is a kickflip combined with a backside-pop shuvit. The trick featured prominently in the Blueprint video \"The First Broadcast\" and the trick has received a significant amount of criticism from within the skateboard community; former Blueprint rider Mark Baines has stated in an online interview:\nThe shuv-it flip thing is weird. I don’t think there are many tricks that look bad all the time. Gino can do heelflips and make them look like the best trick ever. It’s how it’s done not what it is. I wouldn’t say my shuv-it flips were that good though. The fakie varial flip in First Broadcast is the best thing I ever filmed though. People basically hear or read something on a forum then feel they gotta hate it I suppose. I don’t really know. Like I say a lot of the time with tricks it’s how it’s done.\nA \"varial heelflip\" (originally known as a \"heelflip shuvit\") is a heelflip combined with a frontside pop shuvit. Professional skateboarders [[Chico Brenes]] and Moose (the latter filmed the [[High-definition video|high-definition (HD)]] version) filmed the trick for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website. The official name of the trick in the 21st century was a point of contention among skateboarders; the issue was discussed on The Berrics website in early March 2013 in a short video segment entitled \"Name Game\" and the \"varial heelflip\" title emerged as the favored name.\n\nA combination of a 360-degree backside-pop shuvit and a kickflip. Also known as a tre flip. Professional skateboarders such as Josh Kalis, Capaldi, Ethan Fowler, and Stefan Janoski have been recognized for their 360 flips. The trick was invented by Mullen in 1983.\n\nAn extra rotation can also be added, known as a \"360 double flip\", and Capaldi, O'Neill, and Song have been filmed executing the trick; O'Neill was also filmed executing the trick in switch stance as part of [[The Berrics#Battle at the Berrics 6|Battle at the Berrics 6]]. Footage of professional skateboarder Chris Cole, executing a 360 triple flip, was released on the internet in 2010.\n\nA combination of a fakie laser flip (360 Heelflip) and a frontside half-cab. The invention of this trick has been credited to professional skateboarder [[Rick Howard]]; however, Howard has publicly stated that he does not appreciate the recognition, as he does not believe that he is the trick's inventor. Song has executed the trick numerous times during the period from 2011 to early 2013 (X Games Real Street, \"5-Incher\", \"5-Incher B-Side Edit\", \"iFun\" web clip, and \"Who Is Daewon Song?\"). Early in his career, Song also performed the trick on transition without the tail hitting the ground—as is usually the case in skateboarding—and the trick also appears in his World Industries \"Love Child\" video part.\n\nA hardflip combines a frontside pop shuvit with a kickflip. This trick is awkward to execute, and the board sometimes appears to move vertically through the legs—the degree of verticality is determined by the front-foot action. The first hardflip to be captured on film was in the World Industries \"Love Child\" video and was executed by Daewon Song—Song stated in an online interview:\nThe worst hardflip ever documented? It was the first, but it was the worst, so it's cool. So it's like first and worst. Back then, too, I didn't even know what it was. [Be]cause all I know is that I had to mule-kick the f*** out of my front...back foot, move it out of the way, and if you shot a photo, there would definitely be three frames of something that just did not look right.\n\nProfessional skateboarders such as Stevie Williams (executed a hardflip to nosegrind at Love Park in [[Philadelphia]], U.S.), Gino Ianucci, Chet Thomas, and Kris Markovic have been recognized for their hardflips. In the Almost \"5-Incher\" video, [[Lewis Marnell]] performs a hardflip to 5-0 grind. Sponsored skateboarder Brandon Turner executed a hardflip down the famous Carlsbad Gap (no longer in existence) in California, US.\n\nDouble hardflips have also been executed and Jake McAtee was filmed in 2009 performing the variation on a \"hip\" structure located at a skate park.\n\nA 360 frontside pop shuvit combined with a \nkickflip. Pro skater Sean Malto and Donovan strain both performed 360 hardflips in an unsanctioned battle for Battle of the Berrics X in 2017.\nProfessional skateboarder Jimmy Carlin was filmed executing a 360 hardflip down a set of stairs in the video \"Capital Motion\". American skateboarder Robbyn Spangler-Magby (amateur) has also been filmed executing the trick—at 1,000 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] with a Redlake N3 high speed camera—for the Skateology web-based video series.\n\nThe 360 Hard-Flip was first documented in the 2005 video \"Synopsis\" it was performed by Al Garcia and was executed over a hip. The video featured top skaters Gershon Mosley, Aaron Snyder, and Dan Pageau. \"Synopsis\" marks the first video that both Mike Mo and Nick Merlino made their first appearance in.\n\nA nollie hardflip late backside 180 (often mistakenly thought of as a hardflip late backside 180), this trick was popularized by [[Kareem Campbell]] with his only performance of it on transition in Issue 30 of \"411 Video Magazine\" covering September-October 1998.\n\nA hardflip with backside 360-degree body rotation—the trick has been credited to Spangler-Magby.\n\nA flip trick in which a frontside 360 shuvit is combined with a heelflip (also known as frontside 360 shove-it heel flips)—the trick was invented by Mullen. Professional skateboarder [[Torey Pudwill]] has been recognized for his laser flips and he performed the trick for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website. Double laser flips have also been performed.\n\nA backside-pop shuvit (180 degree) combined with a heelflip. Flow skateboarder James Espinoza was filmed performing a fakie variation on The Berrics website.\n\nAn inward heelflip executed at the front of the board in the nollie position. Professional skateboarder Bryan Herman performs the trick in a promotional video clip for his signature model shoe the Emerica \"G6\", and professional skateboarder [[Chris Cole (skateboarder)|Chris Cole]] was filmed executing a nollie inward heelflip at the Woodward facility in [[Egypt]] in 2010. Professional skateboarder Lenny Rivas filmed a \"Trick Tip\" for CCS TV (Internet video channel for the CCS online retail outlet) in December 2012.\n\nA backside 360 shuvit combined with a heelflip.\n\nAn inward heelflip with two heelflip rotations. Unsponsored skateboarder Carell Harvey was filmed, with a Redlake N3 high-speed camera at 1,000 frames per second, performing the variation in 2011.\n\nA 360 inward double is a 360 inward heelflip with two heelflip rotations.\n\nA bigspin inward heel is a 360-degree inward heelflip with a 180-degree body rotation in the same direction. It is believed that pro-skater Tom Stano created this trick in an early 1980s skating video.\n\nThe skateboarder's body spins 360 degrees in the same direction as the board during a kickflip. Professional skateboarder [[Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder)|Paul Rodriguez]] finished in second place in \"[[The Berrics#Battle at the Berrics 2|The Battle of the Berrics 2]]\" (contest) to Cole, as he was unable to execute the 360-degree kickflip.\n\nA bigflip is a 360 flip combined with a backside 180-degree body rotation. Rodriguez executes a bigspin down a set of stairs in the final scene of the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] \"#skateeverydamnday\" commercial that was filmed in China in 2012. Professional skateboarder Mark Appleyard performed the trick for \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website.\n\nA 540-degree flip with a 180-degree body rotation (when a 360-degree body rotation is executed, the trick is known as a \"Gazelle flip/360 Bigspin\").\n\nA 720 flip with a 180-degree backside rotation of the body (when the board spins 720 degrees, does one flip and your body does a 180 degree rotation the same way your board does). Invented and landed by Sewa Kroetkov and filmed by Chris Chann.\n\nA Laser flip combined with a frontside 180-degree body rotation in the same direction. Amateur skateboarder Felipe Gustavo performs a switch version for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website.\n\nA hardflip with a frontside 360-degree body rotation. The double grape flip consists of two hardflips and the 360-degree body rotation—the double variation was invented by [[Donovan Strain]].\n\nFlipping the board by using one foot that is under the board and flipping it in the kickflip or heelflip direction—this trick was invented by Mullen in 1992. While skateboarding on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], Mullen performs numerous variations of this flip trick in his \"[[Rodney Mullen vs. Daewon Song#Round 3|Almost: Round Three]]\" video part.\n\nA shuv-it, with a late underflip performed by the back foot. While professional skateboarders rarely perform this trick, numerous segments of home video footage, in which unsponsored skateboarders perform the trick, has been published on the Internet.\n\nThe rider uses the same pressure that would be applied if he/she is attempting to adopt a \"[[Freestyle skateboarding tricks#Primo Slide|primo]]\" position (when the board is positioned on its side/edge); however, one foot is placed under the board so that the board is not completely in a \"dark\" position (when the board is upside down, with the griptape facing the ground). The other foot is then placed on the tail of the board when the board is upside down—the foot beneath the board is then used to scoop the board up, and then around. The rider then jumps onto the board to land in the starting position. Mullen invented the Casper 360 flip in 1983.\n\nA flatground trick performed without touching the floor. Starting in a normal stance, the rider uses backfoot pressure to flip the board into the \"dark\" position, standing on the underside of the board's tail and nose with either foot. Then, in one swift movement, the skateboarder applies pressure to the side of the board, with either foot lifting up onto the opposite side of the board. The skateboarder then uses the other foot to scoop the board over and around, while jumping to land back on the right side of the board.\n\nA nollie casper flip is a half-nollie flip that is caught upside down, with the front foot under the front trucks; the board is then flipped back over, heelflip-style, with a combined pop shuvit action.\n\nThis flip trick is a half-heelflip—the front foot catches the board upside down—combined with a backside shuvit.\n\nA kickflip or heelflip shuvit with a 180-degree body rotation in the opposite direction to the rotation of the board.\n\nA [[nightmare flip]] is a varial kickflip with an extra kickflip rotation. Also known as varial double kickflip\n\nA Hospital flip consists of two separate motions: firstly, the skateboarder performs a kickflip but stalls the rotation of the board at the halfway point; the front foot then executes an upward flick that causes the board to spin 180 degrees along the longitudinal axis.\n\nFootage of an alpha flip is provided in a YouTube tutorial by Cotton Mouth Skateboards that features a skateboarder combining a backside 180 with a 360-degree hospital flip of the board around the front foot. The tutorial states: \"The front foot never leaves the board(Its easier this way. However, it is a hospital flip, not an impossible, so it may).\"\n\nFootage of both a regular beta flip and fakie beta flip were published on the Cotton Mouth Skateboards YouTube channel in 2012 and 2010, respectively. In the 2010 video clip, the skateboarder describes a fakie beta flip as, \"a fakie backside 360 while you do an alpha flip\"; thus, a beta flip can be described as a backside 360 with a 360-degree rotation of the board around the front foot.\n\nPerformed by pushing with the front foot directly off the nose of the board after an ollie, causing the board to rotate almost vertically 180 degrees towards the frontfoot between the rider's legs while flipping the board 180 degrees so it lands wheels down. Carlin has described the trick as \"Pretty much a varial flip that goes down.\" The trick was invented by Darrell Stanton.\n\nA dolphin/forward flip with a 360-degree rotation. It was named the \"Reda flip\" by Moroccan skateboarder Reda Hadada. Two days after he landed the trick, Chris Chann also landed it. He was inspired by Hadada's video and changed the name to \"Dragon flip\" for his YouTube series \"Trick Challenge\" (episode 11) in April 2014. Chan got the idea for the name from the [[anime]] television series \"[[Dragon Ball Z]]\", which he had been watching the night before filming.\n\nA forward flip combined with a heelflip.\n\nFor an unward flip, the board rotates in the same manner as an \"inward heelflip\", but the board is flipped from under the board with the front foot. This trick is easiest in the nollie position and is considered the complete opposite of a \"nerdflip\". Due to the awkward foot positioning required for an unward flip, the flip trick is typically performed by advanced skateboarders. The trick was invented by Mullen.\n\nA flip trick in which a 540-degree board flip is combined with a 360-degree body rotation in the same direction. So basically a big flip (big spin with kickflip) then immediately after landing 180 pivot. The trick was invented by Mullen in 1981.<ref name=\"Gaz\" /\n\nThis trick is performed like a kickflip, but after the board has made the full kickflip rotation, the front foot flips the board back in the opposite direction like a heelflip from the underside of the board. It is essentially a kickflip with a late front foot underflip.\n\nA pressure varial kickflip.\n\nA pressure 360 flip, flipped with the toe of the back foot. \n\nA quarter-kickflip, late back-foot varial heelflip that was invented by Mullen.\n\nA nollie backside flip followed by a late kickflip—the trick was invented by [[Jerry Hsu]] and was captured in the [[Osiris Shoes|Osiris]] shoe company video \"The Storm\". Hsu was filmed performing the trick on transition during the 2009 Zumiez Couch Tour.\n\nA one and a half varial kick-flip (almost a nightmare flip) that transitions into an anti-Casper flip in a single motion.\n\nA half kick flip shuv-it that transitions into a half late heel flip in a single motion—the trick is named after its inventor, professional skateboarder [[Chris Haslam (skateboarder)|Chris Haslam]].\n\nInvented by Haslam, the name of the trick is taken from the Russian ([[Cyrillic]]) version of the name of fellow professional skateboarder Nestor Judkins (sponsored by [[Enjoi]] skateboards, Krux trucks, RVCA clothing, and [[adidas]] footwear). The trick is a switch, half frontside flip to back foot bigspin flip. In his online introduction of the truck for sponsor, Strange Notes ([[Independent Trucks]]), Haslam explained:\n\nHaslam also invented a switch flip trick that, as of 2012, had not been named. The trick was filmed for the Strange Notes company under the title, \"Chris Haslam Crazy Ass trick\".\n\nThe rider is in a \"hang ten\" position and then pops the board down, resulting in a pressure nollie hardflip through the rider's legs.\n\nThis flip trick can be executed while rolling along or in a stationary position. The skateboarder can either start on the board or on the ground (if the board is rolling, the skateboarder usually hops off the board first). The skateboarder places his/her hands on the board and then quickly pulls the board's edge up, causing it to flip, and then the skater lands on the board with both feet.\n\nFor a rail flip, the skateboarder stands on the side of the board and uses the back foot to flip the board with pressure.\n\nA Railstand nightmare flip is a double-kick flip shuvit executed from a \"primo\" position.\n\nA Frightmare flip is a nightmare flip with a frontside 180-degree body rotation.\n\nA \"no comply\" is a trick where the skater plants his/her foot, and then uses the back foot and knee to lift the board off the ground. It is a freestyle trick that can be combined with pressure flips, finger flips, and spins. In 2011, a no comply frontside bigspin heelflip was filmed by the Skateology web-based video series.\n\nHaslam performed a \"Switch No Comply Frontside 360 Heelflip\" in May 2013 for the Ride Channel's \"Skateboarding in Slow Motion\" segment.\n\nA trick whereby the front foot is planted on the ground and a pressure flip is then performed in one motion. This flip trick usually involves running and catching the board with front foot.\n\nA bigspin kickflip, whereby the skateboarder's body transitions into a fakie backside 180 after the bigspin kickflip has completed its rotation.\n\nA flip trick in which the board flips in a similar fashion to a frontside kickflip, but the action of the front foot is absent—the flip of the board is reliant upon the pushing down action of the back foot. Aaron \"Jaws\" Homoki has filmed a \"Trick Tip\" video for the RIDE Channel on YouTube, in which he commends professional skateboarder [[Chad Muska]] for his execution of the trick. Muska has received broader recognition for his execution of the trick and it is, therefore, also called a \"Muska flip\".\n\nA late back-foot varial/shuvit flip—the name of the trick was coined by Jimmy Carlin; however, it is unclear who invented the trick.\n\nIs basically an inward heelflip without the heelflip as it is executed only by the same foot used to pop it up whether in the nose or tail—pressure flips are executed using a scooping technique, rather than the \"popping\" action of ollie-based tricks. In an instructional video, Hawk described the action that underpins the trick as a \"pushing/scooping action, instead of an ollie\" and states that the trick is \"old school\", forgotten by later generations of skateboarders. American skateboard shop owner and former professional skateboarder Nate Sherwood is well known for a variety of pressure flip tricks, and Sherwood invented the \"Laser pressure flip\".\n\nA pressure kickflip that rotates 360 degrees.\n\nThe trick became the second flip trick to be named the \"Mo flip,\" as it is a highlight of Capaldi's opening part in Lakai's \"Fully Flared\" video, as well as during his finals match against Shane O'neill in the \"Battle Of The Berrics 5\" contest. The trick is later performed by [[Nyjah Huston]] in \"Battle At The Berrics 7\" in April 2014.\n\nFlip tricks can be executed by 'popping' the boards nose or tail, or by using the foot to lift the board up from underneath (underflip). Basic flip tricks are performed by popping the board with one foot, and using the other foot to flip the raised end. Less common flip variations can be achieved popping the board in an unusual way, where the pop itself makes the board flip. These include pressure flips and toe flips that were more popular in early skateboarding. Flip tricks are usually performed while the skateboarder is rolling, although they may be performed while stationary.\n\n[[Category:Skateboarding tricks]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]"

                "Tupac Shakur\n\nTupac Amaru Shakur ( ) (born Lesane Parish Crooks; June 16, 1971September 13, 1996), also known by his stage names 2Pac and Makaveli, was an American rapper, poet and actor. Shakur sold over 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. His double disc albums \"All Eyez on Me\" (1996) and his \"Greatest Hits\" (1998) are among the best-selling albums in the United States. Shakur is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time and he has been listed and ranked as one of the greatest artists of any genre by many publications, including \"Rolling Stone\", which ranked him 86th on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. On April 7, 2017, Shakur was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.\n\nShakur began his career as a roadie, backup dancer and MC for the alternative hip hop group Digital Underground, eventually branching off as a solo artist. Most of the themes in Shakur's songs revolved around the violence and hardship in inner cities, racism, and other social issues. Both of his parents and several other people in his family were members of the Black Panther Party, whose ideals were reflected in his songs. During the latter part of his career, Shakur was a vocal participant during the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry, becoming involved in conflicts with other rappers, producers, and record-label staff members, most notably The Notorious B.I.G. and his label, Bad Boy Records. Aside from his career in music, Shakur was also an actor, starring in six films and one TV show in the 1990s, including \"Poetic Justice\" (1993), \"Gang Related\" (1997) and \"Gridlock'd\" (1997).\n\nOn September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times in a drive-by shooting at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where he died from his injuries six days later.\n\nShakur was born on June 16, 1971, in the East Harlem section of Manhattan in New York City. His birth name was Lesane Parish Crooks, but in 1972, he was renamed after Túpac Amaru II, the 18th-century Peruvian revolutionary who was executed after leading an indigenous uprising against Spanish rule. Shakur was African American.\n\nHis mother Afeni Shakur (born Alice Faye Williams in North Carolina) and his father Billy Garland were active members of the Black Panther Party in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Lesane was born a month after his mother was acquitted of more than 150 charges of \"Conspiracy against the United States government and New York landmarks\" in the New York Panther 21 trial.\n\nMany people in Shakur's life were involved with the Black Liberation Army; some were convicted of serious criminal offenses and imprisoned, including his mother. His godfather, Elmer \"Geronimo\" Pratt, a high-ranking Black Panther, was convicted of murdering a school teacher during a 1968 robbery, although his sentence was later overturned. His stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, spent four years at large on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list beginning in 1982. Mutulu was wanted for having helped his friend (no relation) Assata Shakur (also known as Joanne Chesimard), Tupac's godmother, to escape from a penitentiary in New Jersey in 1979. She had been imprisoned since 1977 for killing a state trooper in 1973. She lived as a fugitive for several years before gaining asylum in Cuba in 1985. Mutulu was caught in 1986 and eventually imprisoned for the 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck in which two police officers and a guard were killed.\n\nShakur had an older stepbrother, Mopreme \"Komani\" Shakur, and a half-sister, Sekyiwa, two years his junior. Mopreme performed in many of his recordings. In 1986, his family moved to Baltimore, Maryland. After completing his second year at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, he transferred to the Baltimore School for the Arts. There he studied acting, poetry, jazz, and ballet. He performed in Shakespeare plays and in the role of the Mouse King in the ballet \"The Nutcracker\". Shakur, accompanied by one of his friends, Dana \"Mouse\" Smith, as his beatbox, won many rap competitions and was considered to be the best rapper in his school. He was remembered as one of the most popular kids in his school because of his sense of humor, superior rapping skills, and ability to mix with all crowds.\n\nShakur developed a close friendship with Jada Pinkett (later Jada Pinkett Smith) that lasted until his death. In the documentary \",\" Shakur says, \"Jada is my heart. She will be my friend for my whole life.\" Pinkett Smith calls him \"one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime.\" A poem written by Shakur titled \"Jada\" appears in his book, \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete\", which also includes a poem dedicated to Pinkett Smith called \"The Tears in Cupid's Eyes.\" During his time in art school, Shakur became affiliated with the Baltimore Young Communist League USA. He began dating the daughter of the director of the local chapter of the Communist Party USA.\n\nIn 1988, Shakur and his family moved to Marin City, California, a suburban community located north of San Francisco. He attended Tamalpais High School in nearby Mill Valley. Shakur contributed to the school's drama department by performing in several productions. In an English class, Shakur wrote a paper, \"Conquering All Obstacles,\" in which he said: \"our raps, not the sorry story raps everyone is so tired of. They are about what happens in the real world. Our goal is [to] have people relate to our raps, making it easier to see what really is happening out there. Even more important, what we may do to better our world.\"\nHe began attending the poetry classes of Leila Steinberg in 1989. That same year, Steinberg organized a concert with a former group of Shakur's, \"Strictly Dope\"; the concert led to him being signed with Atron Gregory. He set him up as a roadie and backup dancer with the hip hop group Digital Underground in 1990.\n\nBefore using his first name as his rap name, Shakur went by the alias MC New York when starting his career in Baltimore.\nAlthough Shakur began recording in 1987, his professional entertainment career did not take off until the early 1990s when he debuted in Digital Underground's \"Same Song\" from the soundtrack to the 1991 film \"Nothing but Trouble\", and also appeared with the group in the film. The song was later released as the lead song of the Digital Underground extended play (EP) \"This Is an EP Release\", the follow-up to their debut hit album \"Sex Packets\". Shakur appeared in the accompanying music video. After his rap debut, he performed with Digital Underground again on the album \"Sons of the P\". Shakur went on to feature Shock G and Money-B from Digital Underground in his track \"I Get Around\", which ranked #11 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nIn November 1991, Shakur released his debut solo album, \"2Pacalypse Now\". Though the album did not generate any \"Top Ten\" hits, \"2Pacalypse Now\" is hailed by many critics and fans for its underground feel, with many rappers such as Nas, Eminem, Game, and Talib Kweli having pointed to it as inspiration. Although the album was originally released on Interscope Records, the rights to its distribution are now owned by Amaru Entertainment, the label owned by Shakur's mother. The album's name is a reference to the 1979 film \"Apocalypse Now\".\n\n\"2Pacalypse Now\" generated significant controversy for numerous reasons. The songs \"Trapped\" and \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies. Dan Quayle criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney claimed he was influenced by \"2Pacalypse Now\" and its theme of police brutality before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, \"There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society.\" Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood. He said, \"I started out saying I was down for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang,\" Shakur said. \"I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males. I just figured since I lived that life I could do that, I could rap about that.\" The record was important in showcasing Shakur's political conviction and his focus on lyrical prowess. On MTV's Greatest Rappers of All Time list, \"2Pacalypse Now\" was listed as one of Shakur's \"certified classic\" albums, along with \"Me Against the World\", \"All Eyez on Me\" and \"\". \"2Pacalypse Now\" went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. It featured three singles: \"Brenda's Got a Baby\", \"Trapped\", and \"If My Homie Calls\".\n\nHis second studio album, \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\", was released in February 1993. The album did better than its predecessor both critically and commercially, debuting at number 24 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album contains many tracks emphasizing Shakur's political and social views, and there are noticeable differences in production from his first effort. While \"2Pacalypse Now\" had an indie-rap-oriented sound, \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\" is generally considered Shakur's \"breakout\" album. It spawned the hits \"Keep Ya Head Up\" and \"I Get Around\" and reached platinum status. On vinyl, Side A (tracks 1–8) was labeled the \"Black Side\" and Side B (tracks 9–16) the \"Dark Side\". It is Shakur's tenth-biggest selling album, with 1,366,000 units moved as of 2004.\n\nIn late 1993, Shakur formed the group Thug Life with a number of his friends, including Big Syke (Tyruss Himes), Macadoshis (Diron Rivers), his stepbrother Mopreme Shakur, and the Rated R (Walter Burns). The group released their only album \"\" on September 26, 1994, which went gold. The album featured the single \"Pour Out a Little Liquor\", produced by Johnny \"J\" Jackson, who went on to produce a large part of Shakur's album \"All Eyez on Me\". The group usually performed their concerts without Shakur. The album was originally released by Shakur's label Out Da Gutta Records, though Amaru Entertainment has since gained the rights to it. Among the notable tracks are \"Bury Me a G\", \"Cradle to the Grave\", \"Pour Out a Little Liquor\" (which also appears on the soundtrack to the 1994 film \"Above the Rim\"), \"How Long Will They Mourn Me?\" and \"Str8 Ballin'\". As a result of criticism of gangsta rap at the time, the original version of the album was scrapped and re-recorded with many of the original songs being cut. The album contains ten tracks because Interscope Records felt many of the other recorded songs were too controversial to release. Although the original version of the album was not completed, Shakur performed the planned first single from the album, \"Out on Bail\" at the 1994 Source Awards. \"Thug Life: Volume 1\" was certified Gold. The track \"How Long Will They Mourn Me?\" later appeared on 2Pac's posthumous \"Greatest Hits\" album.\n\nShakur's third album, \"Me Against The World\", was released in March 1995 and was very well-received, with many calling it the magnum opus of his career. It is considered one of the greatest and most influential hip-hop albums of all time. It is Shakur's fourth-best-selling album with 3,524,567 copies sold in the United States as of 2011. \"Me Against the World\" won best rap album at the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards.\n\n\"Dear Mama\" was released as the album's first single in February 1995, along with the track \"Old School\" as the B-side. It would become the album's most successful single, topping the Hot Rap Singles chart and peaking at the ninth spot on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The single was certified platinum in July 1995, and later placed at #51 on the year-end charts. The second single, \"So Many Tears\", was released in June, four months after the first single. The single would reach number six on the Hot Rap Singles chart, and number 44 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Temptations\", released in August, was the third and final single from the album; it would be the least successful of the three released, but still did fairly well on the charts, reaching number 68 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number 35 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks, and number 13 on the Hot Rap Singles charts.\n\n\"All Eyez on Me\" was the fourth studio album by 2Pac, recorded in October 1995 and released on February 13, 1996, by Death Row Records and Interscope Records. The album is frequently recognized as one of the crowning achievements of 1990s rap music. Steve Huey of AllMusic stated that \"despite some undeniable filler, it is easily the best production 2Pac's ever had on record\". It was certified 5× Platinum after just 2 months in April 1996 and 9× platinum in 1998. The album featured the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number one singles \"How Do U Want It\" and \"California Love\". It featured five singles in all, the most of any 2Pac album. Moreover, \"All Eyez on Me\" (which was the only Death Row release to be distributed through PolyGram by way of Island Records) made history as the first double-full-length hip-hop solo studio album released for mass consumption. It was issued on two compact discs and four LPs. Chartwise, \"All Eyez on Me\" was the second album from 2Pac to hit number one on both the \"Billboard\" 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. It sold 566,000 copies in the first week of its release and was charted in the top 100 for one-week Soundscan sales since 1991. By the end of 1996, the album had sold 5 million copies. The album won the 1997 Soul Train R&B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year Award. Shakur also won the Award for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist at the 24th Annual American Music Awards.\n\n\"Makaveli – \", commonly shortened to \"The 7 Day Theory\", is Shakur's fifth and final studio album and was released under his new stage name Makaveli. The album was completely finished in a total of seven days during the month of August 1996. The lyrics were written and recorded in three days and mixing took an additional four days. In 2005, MTV.com ranked \"The 7 Day Theory\" at #9 on their greatest hip hop albums of all-time list and, in 2006, recognized it as a classic. The emotion and anger showcased on the album have been admired by a large part of the hip hop community. George \"Papa G\" Pryce, former Head of Publicity for Death Row, claimed that \"\"Makaveli\", which we did was sort of tongue-in-cheek and it was not really to come out and after Tupac was murdered, it did come out. But before that, it was going to be a sort of an underground [record].\"\nThe album peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the \"Billboard\" 200. The album generated the second-highest debut-week sales total of any album that year. It was certified 4× Platinum on June 15, 1999.\n\nIn October 1995, Shakur was released from prison after serving nine months of a sentence for sexual assault and formed a new group called Outlaw Immortalz. Shakur joined the Death Row label, under which he released the single \"California Love\".\n\nOn February 13, 1996, Shakur released his fourth solo album, \"All Eyez on Me\". This double album was the first and second of his three-album commitment to Death Row Records. It sold more than nine million copies. The record was a general departure from the introspective subject matter of \"Me Against the World\", being more oriented toward a thug and gangsta mentality. Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. Dr. Dre left his post as in-house producer to form his own label, Aftermath. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums \"Still I Rise\", \"Until the End of Time\", \"Better Dayz\", \"Loyal to the Game\" and \"Pac's Life\". He also began the process of recording an album, \"One Nation\", with the New York-based Boot Camp Clik and their label Duck Down Records.\n\nOn June 4, 1996, he and Outlawz released the diss track \"Hit 'Em Up\", a scathing lyrical assault on The Notorious B.I.G. and others associated with him. In the track, Shakur claimed to have had sexual intercourse with Faith Evans, the wife of Wallace, Shakur's former friend and rival, and attacked Bad Boy's street credibility. Shakur was convinced that some members associated with Bad Boy had known about the 1994 attack on him due to their behavior that night and the information that his sources gave to him. According to a 2005 interview with Jimmy Henchman, in \"Vibe\" magazine, after the attack, Shakur immediately accused Henchman, an associate of Bad Boy CEO Sean Combs, of orchestrating the attack. Shakur, therefore, aligned himself with Suge, Death Row's CEO, who was already bitter toward Combs over a 1995 incident at the Platinum Club in Atlanta, Georgia, which culminated in the death of Jake Robles, the friend and bodyguard of Suge Knight; Knight was adamant in voicing his suspicions about Combs' involvement. In the years following their killings, associates of both Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. have made comments indicating the pair, were it not for their deaths, would have reconciled.\n\nCollaborator Buckshot claimed in 2015 that Shakur defended him against Suge Knight, who had insisted that the East Coast rapper could not come with him to Las Vegas on the grounds of the ongoing hip hop rivalry. Shakur asserted that he would not board the plane unless accompanied by Buckshot and was described by the fellow rapper as looking \"discomforted\" while they recorded a song together in a studio after Shakur \"tore up the plane tickets\".\n\nDuring an August 15, 1996, appearance at the Brotherhood Crusade Rally, which featured several artists discussing the importance of voting, Shakur compared the sales of Death Row records to voters in the U.S. and the influence he and other artists had over an adoring fanbase.\n\nWhen Shakur recorded \"Hit 'Em Up\", a diss song toward Biggie, he recruited three members from the former group, Dramacydal, with whom he had worked previously and was eager to do so again. Shakur, with the three New Jersey rappers and other associates, formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. When 2Pac signed to Death Row after his release from prison, he recruited step brother Mopreme Shakur and Big Syke from Thug Life. Hussein Fatal, Napoleon, E.D.I. Mean, Kastro, Yaki Kadafi, and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added, and together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on 2Pac's Multi-Platinum smash \"All Eyez on Me\". They later dropped the Immortal part of their name after the untimely deaths of 2Pac and Yaki Kadafi and moved on as Outlawz without the members of Thug Life. Young Noble was later added and appeared on 2Pac's second Death Row release \"\". It was on 2Pac's Makaveli album that Outlawz first came to the greater rap community's notice, appearing on a few songs.\nThe idea behind the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding with the names of various tyrants or enemies of America, past, and present. Outlawz chose in later years to make a backronym out of the letters of their group name \"Operating Under Thug Laws as Warriorz\" although it does not stand for the group's name and is used infrequently.\n\nOn forming the Outlawz, Shakur gave each of them a name of a dictator/military leader or an enemy of America.\n\nFor himself, Shakur created the alias \"Makaveli\" from Renaissance Italian philosopher and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli, whose writings inspired Shakur in prison, but who also preached that a leader could eliminate his enemies by all means necessary. He mentioned Makaveli Records a few times before his death. This was supposed to be a music label for up-and-coming artists that Shakur had an interest in developing or potentially signing, and his own future projects would have been published through it as well.\n\nIn addition to his endeavors in the music industry, Shakur acted in films. He made his first film appearance in \"Nothing but Trouble\" (1991), as part of a cameo by the Digital Underground. His first starring role was in the 1992 film \"Juice\". He played Roland Bishop, a violent member of the Wrecking Crew, for which he was hailed by \"Rolling Stone\"s Peter Travers as \"the film's most magnetic figure\". He then went on to star in \"Poetic Justice\" (1993) opposite Janet Jackson and the basketball drama \"Above the Rim\" (1994). After his death, three more completed films featuring Shakur were released: \"Bullet\" (1996), \"Gridlock'd\" (1997), and \"Gang Related\" (1997).\n\nShakur had been slated to star in the 1993 Hughes brothers' film \"Menace II Society\" but was replaced by Larenz Tate after assaulting Allen Hughes as a result of a quarrel. Shakur reportedly wanted another type of role, but Hughes would not conform to his wishes, leading to the altercation between the pair which, according to Tyrin Turner, also led members of Shakur's entourage to become physically aggressive toward Hughes. In 2013, Hughes said Shakur would have outshined the other actors had he been in the film, \"because he was bigger than the movie.\" Hughes' comments were seen as validation that he had forgiven the rapper since the incident. Larenz Tate, who had several rehearsals with Shakur before his part was recast, recalled Shakur being close to the Hughes brothers but that his actions were the result of \"creative differences\".\n\nDirector John Singleton mentioned that he wrote the script for his film \"Baby Boy\" with Shakur in mind for the lead role. It was eventually filmed with Tyrese Gibson in his place and released in 2001, five years after Shakur's death. The film features a mural of Shakur in the protagonist's bedroom, as well as featuring the song \"Hail Mary\" in the film's score.\n\nShakur's music and philosophy are rooted in many American, African-American, and world entities, including the Black Panther Party, black nationalism, egalitarianism, and liberty. Shakur's love of theater and Shakespeare also influenced his work. A student of the Baltimore School for the Arts where he studied theater, Shakur understood the Shakespearean psychology of inter-gang wars and inter-cultural conflict. During a 1995 interview, Shakur stated:\n\n[…] I love Shakespeare. He wrote some of the rawest stories, man. I mean look at Romeo and Juliet. That's some serious ghetto shit. You got this guy Romeo from the Bloods who falls for Juliet, a female from the Crips, and everybody in both gangs is against them. So they have to sneak out and they end up dead for nothing. Real tragic stuff. And look how Shakespeare busts it up with Macbeth. He creates a tale about this king's wife who convinces a happy man to chase after her and kill her husband so he can take over the country. After he commits the murder, the dude starts having delusions just like in a Scarface song. I mean the king's wife just screws this guy's whole life up for nothing [...].\n\nIn a European interview music journalist Chuck Philips said that what impressed him the most about Shakur was that he was a poet. Philips said \"I like sacred texts, myths, proverbs, and scriptures. [...] When Tupac came along, I thought he was quite the poet [...] It wasn't just how cleverly they rhymed. It wasn't just the rhythm or the cadence. I liked their attitude. It was protest music in a way nobody had ever thought about before. [...]These artists were brave, wise and smart – wickedly smart. Tupac had so many sides. He was unafraid to write about his vulnerabilities.\"\n\nShakur's debut album, \"2Pacalypse Now\", revealed his socially conscious side. On this album, Shakur attacked social injustice, poverty, and police brutality on songs \"Brenda's Got a Baby\", \"Trapped\", and \"Part Time Mutha\". On this initial release, Shakur helped extend the success of such rap groups as Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, X-Clan, and Grandmaster Flash, as he became one of the first major socially conscious rappers from the West Coast.\n\nOn his second record, Shakur continued to rap about the social ills facing African-Americans, with songs like \"The Streetz R Deathrow\" and \"Last Wordz\". He also showed his compassionate side with the anthem \"Keep Ya Head Up\", while simultaneously putting his legendary aggressiveness on display with the title track from the album \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\" He added a salute to his former group Digital Underground by including them on the playful track \"I Get Around\". Throughout his career, an increasingly aggressive attitude can be seen pervading Shakur's subsequent albums.\n\nThe contradictory themes of social inequality and injustice, unbridled aggression, compassion, playfulness, and hope all continued to shape Shakur's work, as witnessed with the release of his incendiary 1995 album \"Me Against the World\". In 1996, Shakur released \"All Eyez on Me\", and many of the tracks are considered by critics to be classics, including \"Ambitionz Az a Ridah\", \"I Ain't Mad at Cha\", \"California Love\", \"Life Goes On\" and \"Picture Me Rollin\". Shakur described \"All Eyez on Me\" as a celebration of life, and the record was critically and commercially successful.\n\nShakur had enjoyed and had been influenced by the work of contemporary English and Irish pop musicians as a teenager such as Kate Bush, Culture Club, Sinéad O'Connor, and U2. His style on \"2Pacalypse Now\" was highly influenced by the social consciousness and Afrocentrism pervading hip hop in the late 1980s and early 1990s. \"All Eyez on Me\" was a change of style from his earlier works; while still containing socially conscious songs and themes, Shakur's album was heavily influenced by party tracks and tended to have a more \"feel good\" vibe than his earlier albums.\n\nShakur never professed to follow a particular religion, but his lyrics in singles such as \"Ghetto Gospel\" and \"Only God Can Judge Me\" and poems such as \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete (poetry collection)\" suggest he believed in God. Many analysts currently describe him as a deist. He believed in Karma but rejected a literal afterlife and organized religion.\nShakur has had several family members who were members of the Black Panthers; Mutulu Shakur, his step-father; Assata Shakur, his step-aunt; Billy Garland, his biological father; and Afeni Shakur, his mother. Shakur publicly spoke out against interracial marriage in an interview with \"Source\" magazine in 1994, but later retracted these comments.\n\nHis bandana tied into rabbit ears was considered by one writer as one of hip-hop's most recognizable style choices.\n\nShakur was friends with Mike Tyson, Chuck D, Marlon Wayans, Jim Carrey, and Rosie Perez. He befriended fellow rappers Snoop Dogg and Freddie Foxxx, collaborating on songs with the pair and writing to Foxxx while in prison. Tupac attended the John Muir High School prom with his god sister Tashauna Howard. He was also engaged to Kidada Jones. He had a three-year relationship with Madonna.\n\nBilly Garland said Shakur's anger was derived from his frustrations in being misunderstood, pointing specifically to whenever his commitment to the black community and the West Coast were questioned.\n\nIn October 1991, Shakur filed a $10 million civil suit against the Oakland Police Department, alleging that the police brutally beat him for jaywalking. Shakur received approximately $43,000 in settlement money, much of which went to pay his lawyer.\n\nOn August 22, 1992, in Marin City, Shakur performed at an outdoor festival and stayed for an hour afterward signing autographs and pictures. A confrontation occurred and Shakur drew a legally registered Colt Mustang, and allegedly dropped it. As it was picked up by a member of his entourage, a bullet was discharged. About away, Qa'id Walker-Teal, a 6-year-old boy, was pedaling his bicycle at a school playground nearby when a bullet struck him in the forehead and killed him. Although the police matched the bullet to a .38-caliber pistol registered to Shakur, and although his stepbrother, Maurice Harding, was initially arrested on suspicion of firing the weapon, no charges were filed. Marin County prosecutors have said they were stymied by a lack of witnesses. In 1995, a wrongful death suit was brought against Shakur by Qa'id's mother. The defense attorney acknowledged that the bullet that killed Qa'id was traced by authorities to a gun registered to Shakur. The suit was dropped when Shakur agreed to pay a $300,000–$500,000 settlement to the parents.\n\nOn April 5, 1993, Shakur was charged with one count of felonious assault. He was accused of attempting to hit rapper Chauncey Wynn from the group M.A.D. with a baseball bat at a concert at Michigan State University. The incident reportedly began when Shakur became angry and threw a microphone. Shakur pleaded guilty on September 14, 1994, to a misdemeanor in exchange for the dismissal of the felonious-assault charge. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 20 of which were suspended, and ordered to perform 35 hours of community service.\n\nIn October 1993, in Atlanta, two brothers and off-duty police officers, Mark and Scott Whitwell, were with their wives celebrating Mrs. Whitwell's passing of the state bar examination. The officers were drunk and in possession of stolen guns. As they crossed the street, a car with Shakur inside passed them or \"almost struck them\". The Whitwells argued with the driver, Shakur, and the other passengers, who were joined by a second passing car. Shakur shot one officer in the buttocks and the other in the leg, back, or abdomen, according to varying news reports. Mark Whitwell was charged with firing at Shakur's car and later lying to the police during the investigation. Shakur was charged with the shooting. Prosecutors dropped all charges against the parties.\n\nIn early 1994, he was found guilty of assaulting \"Menace II Society\" co-director Allen Hughes and served 15 days in jail. The previous year, Shakur had boasted during an appearance on \"Yo! MTV Raps\" that he had \"beat up the director of Menace II Society\", the line later being used against him in court.\n\nIn November 1993, Shakur and others were charged with sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room. Shakur denied the charges. According to Shakur, he had prior relations days earlier with the woman that were consensual (the woman admitted she performed oral sex on Shakur). The complainant claimed sexual assault after her second visit to Shakur's hotel room; she alleged that Shakur and his entourage raped her. As a result of the trial, Shakur was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse, and acquitted of the weapons and sodomy charges. The judge described the crimes during the sentencing of Shakur to 1½–4½ years in prison, as \"an act of brutal violence against a helpless woman.\" While appearing on the \"Arsenio Hall Show\", Shakur stated he was innocent of all charges and he was hurt that \"a woman would accuse me of taking something from her\" when he was raised by and was surrounded by females.\n\nIn October 1995, Shakur's case was on appeal but because of his considerable legal fees, he could not raise the $1.4 million bail. After serving nine months of his sentence, Shakur was released from the Clinton Correctional Facility on October 12, 1995, due in large part to the help and influence of Suge Knight, the CEO of Death Row Records, who posted a $1.4 million bail pending appeal of the conviction, in exchange for Shakur releasing three albums under the Death Row label. On April 5, 1996, a judge sentenced him to serve 120 days in jail for violating terms of his release on bail.\n\nOn the night of November 30, 1994, the day before the verdict in his sexual abuse trial was to be announced, Shakur was robbed and shot five times by three men in the lobby of Quad Recording Studios in Manhattan. Shakur stated that he believed the robbery to be a setup for the attack, wondering why they would take jewelry and leave his Rolex watch. Shakur checked out of the Bellevue Hospital Center against doctor's orders, three hours after surgery. In the day that followed, he entered the courthouse in a wheelchair and was found guilty of three counts of molestation and found not guilty of six others, including sodomy, stemming from his 1993 arrest for sexual assault.\n\nIn a 1995 interview with \"Vibe\" magazine, Shakur accused Sean Combs, Jimmy Henchman, and Biggie, among others, of setting up the Quad Recording Studios attack. \"Vibe\" changed the names of the accused assailants upon publication. Later evidence did not implicate Biggie in the studio assault. When Biggie's entourage went downstairs to check on the incident, Shakur was being taken out on a stretcher, giving the finger to those around.\n\nOn March 17, 2008, Chuck Philips wrote in the \"Los Angeles Times\" about an alleged order for an attack on Shakur. The article was retracted by the \"LA Times\" because it partially relied on FBI documents, supplied by a man convicted of fraud, which turned out to be forged. In 2011, Dexter Isaac admitted to attacking Shakur. Following Isaac's public confession, Philips named Isaac as one of his unnamed sources for the retracted article.\n\nShakur began serving his prison sentence on sexual-assault charges at Clinton Correctional Facility on February 14, 1995. Shortly afterward, he released his Multi-Platinum album \"Me Against the World\". Shakur became the first artist to have an album at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 while serving a prison sentence. \"Me Against the World\" made its debut on the \"Billboard\" 200 and stayed at the top of the charts for four weeks. The album sold 240,000 copies in its first week, setting a record for highest first week sales for a solo male rap artist at the time. While serving his sentence, he married his long-time girlfriend, Keisha Morris, on April 4, 1995; the couple divorced in 1996. Shakur stated that he married her \"for the wrong reasons\". In an interview after his release, Shakur claimed to have only written one song during his sentence. While imprisoned, Shakur became interested in philosophy, philosophy of war, and military strategy by studying the works such as \"The Prince\" by Italian philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli and \"The Art of War\" by Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu. The works inspired his pseudonym \"Makaveli\" under which he released the album \"\". The album presents a stark contrast to previous works. Throughout the album, Shakur continues to focus on the themes of pain and aggression, making this album one of the emotionally darker works of his career.\n\nWhile in prison, Shakur wrote to Death Row Uncut director Nina Bhadresher about his plans to begin a \"new chapter\" of his life. According to Kevin Powell, who spoke to Shakur following his release from prison, Shakur \"seemed like a completely transformed person.\" Powell recalled Shakur being more dark and menacing to the extent that Powell wondered whether he had really known Shakur.\n\nOn the night of September 7, 1996, Shakur attended the Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson boxing match with Suge Knight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. After leaving the match, one of Knight's associates spotted Orlando \"Baby Lane\" Anderson, an alleged Crips gang member from Compton, California, in the MGM Grand lobby. Earlier that year, Anderson and a group of Crips had robbed a member of Death Row's entourage in a Foot Locker store. Knight's associate told Shakur, who attacked Anderson. Shakur's entourage, as well as Knight and his followers, assisted in assaulting Anderson. Shakur punched Anderson in the face. The fight was captured on the hotel's video surveillance. After the brawl, Shakur went with Knight to Death Row–owned Club 662 (now known as restaurant/club Seven). Shakur rode in Knight's 1996 black BMW 750iL sedan as part of a larger convoy, which included many in Shakur's entourage.\n\nAt 11:00–11:05 p.m. (PDT), they were halted on Las Vegas Boulevard by Metro bicycle police for playing the car stereo too loudly and not having license plates, which were found in the trunk of Knight's car; the party was released a few minutes later without being ticketed. At 11:10 p.m. (PDT), while they were stopped at a red light at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in front of the Maxim Hotel, a vehicle occupied by two women pulled up on their left side. Shakur, who was standing up through the sunroof, exchanged words with the women and invited them to Club 662. At 11:15 p.m. (PDT), a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac with unknown occupants pulled up to the sedan's right side. Someone inside rolled down a window and rapidly fired gunshots at Shakur. He was hit four times, twice in the chest, once in the arm, and once in the thigh. One of the bullets went into Shakur's right lung. Knight was hit in the head by fragmentation. The bodyguard, Frank Alexander, stated that, when he was about to ride along with the rapper in Knight's car, Shakur asked him to drive the car of Shakur's fiancée, Kidada Jones, instead, in case they needed additional vehicles for the drive from Club 662 to the hotel. The bodyguard reported in his documentary, \"Before I Wake\", that, shortly after the assault, one of the convoy's cars drove off after the assailant but that he never heard from the occupants.\nAfter arriving at the scene, police and paramedics took Knight and a wounded Shakur to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada. Chris Carroll, the first Las Vegas police officer to arrive on the scene, heard Shakur's last words, \"fuck you\". Carroll reports that he refused to say another word to him or another officer. According to an interview with the music video director Gobi, while at the hospital, Shakur received news from a Death Row marketing employee that the shooters had called the record company and threatened Shakur. Gobi informed the Las Vegas police but said that the police claimed to be understaffed. No attackers came. At the hospital, Shakur was heavily sedated, was placed on life-support machines, and was ultimately put under a barbiturate-induced coma after repeatedly trying to get out of the bed.\nWhile in the intensive-care unit, on the afternoon of September 13, 1996, Shakur died from internal bleeding; doctors attempted to revive him but could not stop the hemorrhaging. His mother, Afeni, made the decision to tell the doctors to stop. He was pronounced dead at 4:03 p.m. (PDT). The official causes of death were noted as respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest in connection with multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nShakur's body was cremated the next day. Some of his ashes were purportedly later mixed with marijuana and smoked by members of the Outlawz. However, E.D.I. Mean claimed in an interview in 2014 that, despite his belief at the time that the ashes were those of Shakur, he later found that the ashes did not belong to Shakur, which has led some people to believe that Shakur did not die at all.\n\nHis fifth album, \"\", was released two months later along with numerous other posthumous albums.\n\nIn 2002, the \"Los Angeles Times\" published a two-part story by investigative reporter Chuck Philips, titled \"Who Killed Tupac Shakur?\", based on yearlong research that reconstructed the crime and the events leading up to it. Information gathered by the paper indicated that: \"the shooting was carried out by a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier. Orlando Anderson, the Crip whom Shakur had attacked, fired the fatal shots. Las Vegas police discounted Anderson as a suspect and interviewed him only once, briefly. He was later killed in an unrelated gang shooting.\" The article also reported the involvement of East Coast rapper Biggie, Shakur's rival at the time, and several New York criminals.\n\nBefore they died, The Notorious B.I.G. and Anderson denied any role in the murder. In support of their claims, Biggie's family produced computerized invoices suggesting that Biggie was working in a New York recording studio the night of the drive-by shooting. His manager Wayne Barrow and fellow rapper Lil' Cease (James Lloyd) made public announcements denying Biggie's role in the crime and claimed further that they were with him in the recording studio the night of the event. The \"New York Times\" called the evidence \"inconclusive\", noting:\n\nThe pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called \"Nasty Boy\" on the afternoon Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace \"wrote half the session\", was \"In and out/sat around\" and \"laid down a ref\", shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, said in an interview that he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. 'We would have heard about it,' Mr. Alfred said.\"\nIn 2011, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the FBI released documents revealing its investigation of the Jewish Defense League for making death threats against Shakur and other rappers.\n\nAt a Mobb Deep concert following the death of Shakur and the release of \"\", Cormega recalled in an interview that the fans were all shouting \"Makaveli\", and emphasized the influence of \"The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory\" and of Shakur himself even in New York at the height of the media-dubbed \"intercoastal rivalry\".\n\nShakur is held in high esteem by other MCs: In the book \"How to Rap\", Bishop Lamont (Philip Martin) notes that Shakur \"mastered every element, every aspect\" of rapping and Fredro Starr (Fred Scruggs) of Onyx says Shakur \"was a master of the flow.\" \"Every rapper who grew up in the Nineties owes something to Tupac,\" wrote 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson). \"He didn't sound like anyone who came before him.\" About.com, for their part, named Shakur the most influential rapper ever.\n\nChuck Philips writes that \"the slaying [of Tupac Shakur] silenced one of modern music's most eloquent voices—a ghetto poet whose tales of urban alienation captivated young people of all races and backgrounds. The 25-year-old Shakur had helped elevate rap from a crude street fad to a complex art form, setting the stage for the current global hip-hop phenomenon\".\n\nTo preserve Shakur's legacy, his mother founded the Shakur Family Foundation (later renamed the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation or TASF) in 1997. The TASF's stated mission is to \"provide training and support for students who aspire to enhance their creative talents.\" The TASF sponsors essay contests, charity events, a performing arts day camp for teenagers and undergraduate scholarships. The Foundation officially opened the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts (TASCA) in Stone Mountain, Georgia, on June 11, 2005. On November 14, 2003, a documentary about Shakur entitled \"\" was released under the supervision of his mother and narrated entirely in his voice. It was nominated for Best Documentary at the 2005 Academy Awards. Proceeds will go to a charity set up by Shakur's mother Afeni. On April 17, 2003, Harvard University co-sponsored an academic symposium entitled \"All Eyez on Me: Tupac Shakur and the Search for the Modern Folk Hero\". The speakers discussed a wide range of topics dealing with Shakur's impact on everything from entertainment to sociology.\n\nMany of the speakers discussed Shakur's status and public persona, including State University of New York at Buffalo English professor Mark Anthony Neal who gave the talk \"Thug Nigga Intellectual: Tupac as Celebrity Gramscian\" in which he argued that Shakur was an example of the \"organic intellectual\" expressing the concerns of a larger group. Professor Neal has also indicated in his writings that the death of Shakur has left a \"leadership void amongst hip-hop artists.\" Neal further describes him as a \"walking contradiction\", a status that allowed him to \"make being an intellectual accessible to ordinary people.\"\n\nProfessor of Communications Murray Forman, of Northeastern University, spoke of the mythical status about Shakur's life and death. He addressed the symbolism and mythology surrounding Shakur's death in his talk entitled \"Tupac Shakur: O.G. (Ostensibly Gone)\". Among his findings were that Shakur's fans have \"succeeded in resurrecting Tupac as an ethereal life force.\" In \"From Thug Life to Legend: Realization of a Black Folk Hero\", Professor of Music at Northeastern University, Emmett Price, compared Shakur's public image to that of the trickster figures of African-American folklore which gave rise to the urban \"bad-man\" persona of the post-slavery period. He ultimately described Shakur as a \"prolific artist\" who was \"driven by a terrible sense of urgency\" in a quest to \"unify mind, body, and spirit\".\n\nIn \"Holler If You Hear Me: Searching for Tupac Shakur\", Michael Eric Dyson indicated that Shakur \"spoke with brilliance and insight as someone who bears witness to the pain of those who would never have his platform. He told the truth, even as he struggled with the fragments of his identity.\" At one Harvard Conference the theme was Shakur's impact on entertainment, race relations, politics and the \"hero/martyr\". In late 1997, the University of California, Berkeley offered a student-led course entitled \"History 98: Poetry and History of Tupac Shakur.\"\n\nIn late 2003, the Makaveli Branded Clothing line was launched by Afeni. In 2005, Death Row released \"\". The DVD was the final recorded performance of Shakur's career, which took place on July 4, 1996, and features a large number of Death Row artists. In August 2006, \"Tupac Shakur Legacy\" was released. The interactive biography was written by Jamal Joseph. It features unseen family photographs, intimate stories, and over 20 removable reproductions of his handwritten song lyrics, contracts, scripts, poetry, and other personal papers. Shakur's sixth posthumous studio album, \"Pac's Life\", was released on November 21, 2006. It commemorates the 10th anniversary of Shakur's death. He is still considered one of the most popular artists in the music industry .\n\nAccording to \"Forbes\", in 2008 Shakur's estate made $15 million. In 2002, they recognized him as a \"Top-Earning Dead Celebrity\", coming in at number ten on their list.\n\nBET named 2Pac 'The Most Influential Rappers of All Time'. They then went on to say \"his confounding mixture of ladies' man, thug, revolutionary and poet has forever altered our perception of what a rapper should look like, sound like and act like. In 50 Cent, Ja Rule, Lil Wayne, newcomers like Freddie Gibbs and even his friend-turned-rival Biggie, it's easy to see that Pac is the most copied MC of all time. There are murals bearing his likeness in New York, Brazil, Sierra Leone, Bulgaria and countless other places; he even has statues in Atlanta and Germany. Quite simply, no other rapper has captured the world's attention the way Tupac did and still does.\"\nOn April 15, 2012, a \"hologram\" of Shakur (technically a 2-D video projection) performed his songs \"Hail Mary\" and \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\" with Snoop Dogg at the Coachella Music Festival. The effect was created using an optical illusion called Pepper's ghost. The video footage was created by visual effects company Digital Domain. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were in talks of a possible tour involving the two rappers and the projection version of Shakur, which was later turned down by Dr. Dre.\nTupac's 1998 album Greatest Hits returned to the Billboard 200 the following week for the first time since 2000, reaching No. 129 with 4,000 copies sold according to Nielsen SoundScan (a gain of 571% over the previous week). The MC's other albums also saw gains, including \"All Eyez On Me\" (2,000; up 95%) and \"Me Against the World\" (1,000; up 53%).\nHis singles also saw a boost in sales. His biggest seller of the week was \"Hail Mary\"—the song his projection opened with at Coachella. His second biggest seller was his No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hit \"California Love\" (featuring Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman), shifting 11,000 downloads (119% increase). His third best-seller was the second Tupac song that was performed at Coachella – \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\" (with Snoop). It sold 9,000 (up 881%).\n\n\"Holler If Ya Hear Me\" (2014), was a Broadway play based on the lyrics of Tupac. The production lasted 6 weeks before it folded due to being one of Broadway's worst-selling musicals in recent years. It was announced in January 2015 the following month would see an exhibit dedicated to Shakur opened at the Grammy Museum. Executive director Robert Santelli praised Shakur as \"one of the most original and important of all hip hop artists\", adding that his writings were \"both powerful and provocative\". During a panel for the exhibit, attended by his mother Afeni, cousins and various members of his extended family, rapper YG said that he was inspired by Shakur to return to school and that Shakur was like a \"father figure\" to some.\n\nOn December 24, 2015, Demetrius Shipp, Jr. was cast as Shakur in a biopic titled \"All Eyez on Me\", which started filming in Atlanta in December 2015. With distribution from Morgan Creek Productions, the film had been in development since 2013, with producers Randall Emmett and George Furla having sued Morgan Creek for $10 million in October. Emmett and Furla claimed breach-of-contract after the production company allegedly picked a lead, set a budget and production schedule without their approval. Morgan Creek also sued Afeni Shakur for the music rights for the film. Music video director Benny Boom helmed \"All Eyez on Me\", which had been hamstrung by production problems. Multiple directors were involved with the film before Boom, including John Singleton and Antoine Fuqua. The film was released to negative reviews on June 16, 2017, which would have been Shakur's 46th birthday.\n\nIn 2003, MTV's \"22 Greatest MCs\" countdown listed Shakur as the \"Number 1 MC\", as voted by the viewers. In 2004, at the VH1 Hip Hop Honors Shakur was honored along with DJ Hollywood, Kool DJ Herc, KRS-One, Public Enemy, Run-D.M.C., Rock Steady Crew, and Sugarhill Gang. A \"Vibe\" magazine poll in 2004 rated Shakur \"the greatest rapper of all time\" as voted by fans. Editors of About.com ranked him No. 5 on their list of the \"Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007)\". In 2012, \"The Source\" ranked him No. 5 on their list of the top 50 hip-hop lyricists of all time. In a 2005 \"Rolling Stone\" magazine vote, Shakur was named No. 86 of the \"100 Immortal Artists of All Time\" behind Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and John Lennon. MTV ranked him at No. 2 on their list of \"The Greatest MCs of All Time\". Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame in 2002. VH1 ranked him 69th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time. At the First Annual Turks & Caicos International Film Festival held on Tuesday, October 17, 2006, Shakur was honored for his undeniable voice and talent and as a performer who crossed racial, ethnic, cultural and medium lines; his mother accepted the award on his behalf.\n\nIn 2008, The National Association Of Recording Merchandisers in conjunction with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame recognized him as a very influential artist and has added him in their Definitive 200 list.\n\nOn June 23, 2010, Shakur was inducted to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry. The seat of the Catholic Church released a list of 12 songs onto the social networking Web site's streaming music service. Among the artists included are Mozart, Muse, and Dame Shirley Bassey; the list also includes Shakur's song \"Changes\", which was released two years after his shooting death on a greatest hits album in 1998.\n\nHis double album, \"All Eyez on Me\", is one of the highest-selling rap albums of all time, with over 5 million copies of the album sold in the United States alone by April 1996; it was eventually certified 9x platinum in June 1998 by the RIAA. In July 2014 it was recertified 10x platinum.\n\nShakur's hit song \"Dear Mama\" is one of 25 songs that were added to the National Recording Registry in 2010. The Library of Congress has called Dear Mama \"a moving and eloquent homage to both the murdered rapper's own mother and all mothers struggling to maintain a family in the face of addiction, poverty, and societal indifference.\" The honor came seven days after what would have been Shakur's 39th birthday. Shakur is the third rapper to enter the library, outside of the copyright office, behind Grandmaster Flash and Public Enemy.\n\nIn 2016, Shakur was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, when on December 20, 2016, it was announced that he and 5 others would be inducted into the Hall on April 7, 2017. At the ceremony, Shakur was inducted by his friend and fellow hip hop artist Snoop Dogg, who delineated several stories about their time together and of the time Shakur spent in the hospital before his death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShakur's life has been recognized in big and small documentaries, each trying capture the many different events during his short lifetime, most notably the Academy Award nominated \"\", released in 2003.\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Randall cattle\n\nRandall Cattle or Randall Lineback Cattle are dual-listed by the American Livestock Breed Conservancy as a critically endangered American landrace breed. This cattle breed originated in Sunderland, Vermont.\n\nRandall cattle are a rare breed of purebred cattle developed in Sunderland, Vermont, USA, on the farm of Samuel Randall, and later his son, Everett Randall. The Randall family kept a closed herd for over 80 years. Randalls are considered to be a landrace breed, descended from the local cattle common in New England in the nineteenth Century. \n\nIn 1985 the Randall cattle were rescued from the Randall farm after Everett Randall had died. The animals were widely dispersed but soon began to disappear. Cynthia Creech, then living in Tennessee, stepped in to purchase most of the remaining animals to preserve the genetics from extinction. During the following years the breed was called various names. There are now two separate breed associations charged with promoting and registering the Randall or Randall Lineback animals: the Randall Cattle Registry and the Randall Lineback Breed association. \nRandall Linebacks are an all-purpose breed, meaning they originally served as dairy, meat, and draft animals. From fewer than 20 animals the breed population has increased to over 350 breeding females.\n\nRandall cattle are quite variable in size and conformation and have a constitution that is suited to the New England climate. Randalls on average are medium in size with the cows weighing about 600-1100 lbs. and bulls weighing from 1000 to 1800 lbs. or more. Randall cattle have a \"Colour-sided\" lineback pattern, black markings on a white base, varying from almost white to very dark. Other subtle shades such as blue, mahogany, and gray have been observed, and there are now a number of recessive reds. \n\nRandall meat characteristics can vary between different family lines, for example some produce a lean carcass with yellow fat and others produce a beefier well marbled carcass. \n\nCalving difficulties are rare, and metabolic disorders have not been seen. They have strong maternal and survival instincts, high intelligence, and are very docile when handled regularly. \n\nThis breed is uniquely adapted to extensive or low input farming systems. Historically, the most suitable and natural environment for these cattle has been on small scale forage-based farms, subsistence farms, and homesteads. It is on such farms and homesteads that the unique genetic attributes of the Randalls can be fully expressed.\n\nMost Randall Lineback cattle are currently found in the Eastern United States and Canada, all on cool weather farms. The largest Randall Lineback herd is located at Chapel Hill Farm, in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. The second largest herd, and the Randall Registry, call South Kent, Connecticut home. Other, much smaller, herds exist, most of them dairying. While breed numbers are greatly improved, the breed remains critically endangered, according to the American Livestock Breed Conservancy.\n\n",
                "Afeni Shakur\n\nAfeni Shakur Davis (born Alice Faye Williams; January 10, 1947 – May 2, 2016) was an American activist and businesswoman. Shakur was the mother of American rapper and actor, Tupac Shakur.\n\nShakur was born Alice Faye Williams on January 10, 1947, in Lumberton, North Carolina, the daughter of Rosa Belle, a homemaker, and Walter Williams, a trucker.\n\nIn 1968 at the age of twenty-one, she changed her name to Afeni Shakur, \"Afeni\" meaning \"lover of people\" and \"Shakur\" being Arabic for \"thankful to god\", respectively. She was then living in Harlem, New York, where she joined the far-left Black Panther Party. She became a section leader of the Harlem chapter and a mentor to new members, including Jamal Joseph, Cleo Silvers and Dhoruba Bin-Wahad. She also worked with Billy Garland (who is Tupac's biological father) and Geronimo Pratt (who became Tupac's baptismal sponsor). \n\nIn April 1969, Shakur was arrested on charges of conspiring with other Black Panther members to carry out bombings in New York. With bail set at $100,000 each for the 21 suspects, the Black Panthers decided to raise bail money first for Joseph and Shakur so that those two could work on raising bail for the others. Shakur had been effective in raising bail funds for jailed Panthers. After reading Fidel Castro's \"History Will Absolve Me\", Shakur chose to represent herself in court, telling other accused Panthers that if they were convicted, they would be the ones serving jail time, not the lawyers. Pregnant while on trial and facing a thirty-year prison sentence, Shakur interviewed witnesses and argued in court. She and the others in the \"Panther 21\" were acquitted in May 1971 after an eight-month trial. Her son Lesane Parish Crooks was born on June 16, 1971 (he would be renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur the following year, in 1972).\n\nExactly one year following her son's death, with revenue from his albums released posthumously, Afeni Shakur founded the Georgia-based Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation, which provides art programs for young people, and Amaru Entertainment, the holding company for all Tupac's unreleased material. She also launched a fashion clothing line, Makaveli Branded; all proceeds go to his charity, the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation.\n\nShakur was reportedly in federal court on July 20, 2007, to file an injunction to prevent Death Row Records from selling any unreleased material from Tupac after the company failed to prove that the unreleased songs were not part of its bankruptcy settlement. \n\nShe created a record label named Amaru Records to release Tupac's unreleased recordings. She won her court case against Death Row Record to receive 150 unreleased songs by her son.\n\nShakur traveled across the U.S., making guest appearances and delivering lectures. On February 6, 2007, she gave the keynote address for Vanderbilt University's Commemoration for Black History Month.\n\nOn May 2, 2016, police and paramedics responded to Shakur's home in Sausalito, California. She was transported to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead of a suspected heart attack. Her body was cremated.\n\n"

                "East Harlem\n\nEast Harlem, also known as Spanish Harlem or El Barrio, is a neighborhood of Upper Manhattan, New York City roughly encompassing the area north of the Upper East Side and East 96th Street up to about the 140s, east of Fifth Avenue to the East and Harlem Rivers. It lies within Manhattan Community District 11. Despite its name, it is generally not considered to be a part of Harlem.\n\nThe neighborhood is one of the largest predominantly Latino communities in New York City, mostly made up of Puerto Ricans, as well as sizeable numbers of Dominican, Cuban and Mexican immigrants. It includes the area formerly known as Italian Harlem, in which the remnants of a once predominantly Italian community remain. The Chinese population has increased dramatically in East Harlem since 2000.\n\nEast Harlem has historically suffered from many social issues, such as the highest jobless rate in New York City, teenage pregnancy, AIDS, drug abuse, homelessness, and an asthma rate five times the national average. It has the second highest concentration of public housing in the United States, closely following Brownsville, Brooklyn. Police services to the neighborhood are divided between the 23rd and the 25th Precincts. Conversely, East Harlem is notable for its contributions to Latin freestyle and salsa music.\n\nHowever, East Harlem is undergoing some gentrification. In February 2016, East Harlem was one of four neighborhoods featured in an article in \"The New York Times\" about \"New Hot Neighborhoods\", and the city was considering re-zoning the area.\n\nThe area which became East Harlem was rural for most of the 19th century, but residential settlements northeast of Third Avenue and East 110th Street had developed by the 1860s. The construction of the elevated transit line to Harlem in 1879 and 1880, and the building of the Lexington Avenue subway in 1919, urbanized the area, precipitating the construction of apartment buildings and brownstones. The extension of cable cars up Lexington Avenue into East Harlem was stymied by the incline created by Duffy's Hill at 103rd Street, one of the steepest grades in Manhattan. East Harlem was first populated by poor German, Irish, Scandinavian, and Eastern European Jewish immigrants, with the Jewish population standing at 90,000 around 1917. In the 1870s, Italian immigrants joined the mix after a contractor building trolley tracks on First Avenue imported Italian laborers as strikebreakers. The workers' shantytown along the East River at 106th Street was the beginning of an Italian neighborhood, with 4,000 having arrived by the mid-1880s. As more immigrants arrived, it expanded north to East 115th Street and west to Third Avenue.\n\nEast Harlem now consisted of pockets of ethnically-sorted settlements – Italian, German, Irish, and Jewish – which were beginning to press up against each other, with the spaces still between them occupied by \"gasworks, stockyards and tar and garbage dumps\". In 1895, Union Settlement Association, one of the oldest settlement houses in New York City, began providing services in the area, offering the immigrant and low-income residents a range of community-based programs, including boys and girls clubs, a sewing school and adult education classes.\n\nSouthern Italians and Sicilians, with a moderate number of Northern Italians, soon predominated, especially in the area east of Lexington Avenue between 96th and 116th Streets and east of Madison Avenue between 116th and 125th Streets, with each street featuring people from different regions of Italy. The neighborhood became known as \"Italian Harlem\", the Italian American hub of Manhattan; it was the first part of Manhattan to be referred to as \"Little Italy\". The first Italians arrived in East Harlem in 1878, from Polla in the province of Salerno, and settled in the vicinity of 115th Street.\n\nThere were many crime syndicates in Italian Harlem from the early Black Hand to the bigger and more organized Italian gangs that formed the Italian-American Mafia. It was the founding location of the Genovese crime family, one of the Five Families that dominated organized crime in New York City. This includes the current 116th Street Crew of the Genovese family. During the 1970s, Italian East Harlem was also home to the Italian-American drug gang and murder-for-hire crew known as the East Harlem Purple Gang.\n\nIn the 1920s and early 1930s, Italian Harlem was represented in Congress by future Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, and later, in the 1940s, by Italian-American civil rights lawyer, activist, and socialist Vito Marcantonio. The Italian neighborhood approached its peak in the 1930s, with over 100,000 Italian-Americans living in its crowded, run-down apartment buildings. The 1930 census showed that 81 percent of the population of Italian Harlem consisted of first- or second-generation Italian Americans. (Somewhat less than the concentration of Italian Americans in the Lower East Side's Little Italy with 88 percent; Italian Harlem's total population, however, was three times that of Little Italy.)\n\nThe Italian community in East Harlem remained strong into the 1980s, but it has slowly diminished since then. However, Italian inhabitants and vestiges of the old Italian neighborhood remain. The annual Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the \"Dancing of the Giglio\", the first Italian feast in New York City, is still celebrated there every year on the second weekend of August by the Giglio Society of East Harlem. Italian retail establishments still exist, such as Rao's restaurant, started in 1896, and the original Patsy's Pizzeria which opened in the 1933. In May 2011, one of the last remaining Italian retail businesses in the neighborhood, a barbershop owned by Claudio Caponigro on 116th Street, was threatened with closure by a rent increase.\n\nPuerto Rican and Latin American immigration after the First World War established an enclave at the western portion of East Harlem – around 110th Street and Lexington Avenue – which became known as \"Spanish Harlem\". The area slowly grew to encompass all of East Harlem, including Italian Harlem, as Italians moved out – to the Bronx, Brooklyn, upstate New York and New Jersey – and Hispanics moved in during another wave of immigration in the 1940s and 1950s. Although in certain areas, particularly around Pleasant Avenue, Italian Harlem lasted through the 1970s, today most of the former Italian population is gone. Most of these predominantly older residents are clustered around Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, mainly from 114th to 118th Streets. According to the 2000 Census, there were only 1,130 Italian-Americans still living in this area.\n\nThe newly dominant Puerto Rican population, which reached 63,000 in 1950, continued to define the neighborhood according to its needs, establishing bodegas and botánicas as it expanded; by the 1930s there was already an enclosed street market underneath the Park Avenue railroad viaduct between 111th and 116th Streets, called \"La Marqueta\" (\"The Market\"). Catholic and evangelistic Protestant churches appeared in storefronts. Although \"Spanish Harlem\" had been in use since at least the 1930s to describe the Hispanic enclave – along with \"Italian Harlem\" and \"Negro Harlem\" – the name began to be used to describe the entire East Harlem neighborhood by the 1950s. Later, the name \"El Barrio\" (\"The Neighborhood\") began to be used, especially by inhabitants of the area.\n\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, large sections of East Harlem were leveled for urban renewal projects, and the neighborhood was one of the hardest hit areas in the 1960s and 1970s as New York City struggled with deficits, race riots, urban flight, gang warfare, drug abuse, crime and poverty. Tenements were crowded, poorly maintained, and frequent targets for arson. In 1969 and 1970, a regional chapter of the Young Lords which were reorganized from a neighborhood street gang in Chicago by Jose (Cha-Cha) Jimenez, ran several programs including a Free Breakfast for Children and a Free Health Clinic to help Latino and poor families. The Young Lords came together with the Black Panthers and called for Puerto Rican independence and neighborhood empowerment. Still, as of the early 2000s, the Latin Kings gang was still prevalent in East Harlem.\n\nBy the beginning of the 21st century, East Harlem was a racially diverse neighborhood, with about a third of the population being Puerto Rican. As it has been throughout its history, it is predominantly a working-class neighborhood.\n\nUntil 2006, property values in East Harlem climbed along with those in the rest of New York City. With increased market-rate housing, including luxury condos and co-ops – most built on formerly vacant lots – there has been some decline of affordable housing in the community. A number of young professionals have settled into these recently constructed buildings. This influx of \"yuppies\" has caused rents to rise, more buildings in the area to get gut renovations, and changes to area demographics.\n\nOn March 12, 2014 at 9:00 EDT, a large explosion and fire at 1644–1646 Park Avenue killed eight people and injured more than 70.\n\nThe \"New York Post\" listed one part of the neighborhood – the block of Lexington Avenue between East 123rd and 124th Streets – as one of \"the most dangerous blocks in the city\" because police crime statistics for 2015 showed that 19 assaults had taken place there, more than for any other city block. The \"Post\" also reported that there were, according to the Harlem Neighborhood Block Association, \"22 drug-treatment programs, four homeless-services providers and four transitional-living facilities\" in East Harlem.\n\nEast Harlem has begun to feel the effects of gentrification. In February 2016, an article in \"The New York Times\" about \"New York's Next Hot Neighborhoods\" featured East Harlem as one of four such areas. A real-estate broker described it as \"one of the few remaining areas in New York City where you can secure a good deal\". The article mentioned new luxury developments, access to transportation, the opening of new retail stores, bars and restaurants, and national-brand stores beginning to appear on the outskirts of the neighborhood. Primarily, though, it was the cost of housing in comparison to the rest of Manhattan, which the article noted as the major factor. Beginning in 2016, the New York City government was seeking to rezone East Harlem \"to facilitate new residential, commercial, community facility, and manufacturing development\". The residents of the neighborhood generated a suggested zoning plan, the \"East Harlem Neighborhood Plan\", which was offered to the city in February 2017, but in August 2017 residents and the Manhattan Borough President, Gale Brewer, complained that the city had ignored their plan almost entirely.\n\nThe New York City Department of City Planning calculated data for East Harlem North and East Harlem South from the 2010 Census. The two sub-neighborhoods had a combined population of 115,921, an increase of 1,874 (1.4%) from the combined 114,047 in the 2000 Census.\n\nBased on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of East Harlem North was 58,019, an increase of 871 (1.5%) from the 57,148 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .\n\nThe racial makeup of the neighborhood was 6.8% (3,936) White, 35.5% (20,625) African American, 0.2% (128) Native American, 3.0% (1,766) Asian, 0.0% (9) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (185) from other races, and 1.3% (769) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 52.7% (30,601) of the population.\n\nBased on data from the 2010 Census, the population of East Harlem South was 57,902, an increase of 1,003 (1.8%) from the 56,899 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .\n\nThe racial makeup of the neighborhood was 17.4% (10,072) White, 24.6% (14,227) African American, 0.2% (96) Native American, 8.3% (4,802) Asian, 0.1% (55) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (218) from other races, and 1.6% (933) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 47.5% (27,499) of the population.\n\nManhattan Community District 11, which covers East Harlem in its entirety, is a mostly low and moderate income area. It is made up of first and second generation Puerto Ricans, African-Americans, Italian-Americans, Asian-Americans, West Indian Americans (Especially Dominican Americans and Cuban Americans), and a growing population of Mexican Americans and Salvadoran Americans and other Central American immigrants.\n\nIt has one of the highest concentrations of Puerto Ricans in all of New York City. In the 2000 Census, 52.1% of residents described themselves as of Hispanic origin, 35.7 as non-Hispanic black, 7.3 as non-Hispanic white, 2.7 Asian and Pacific Islander Nonhispanic, 1.7% as two or more non-Hispanic races, and 0.5% as another race. By New York City averages, the youth makes up a larger than normal percentage of the East Harlem population with 30.6% of residents age 18 or younger.\n\n93.6% of all housing units were renter-occupied, and over 25% of the population resided in public housing units managed by the NYCHA. 46.5 percent of the population receive a form of income support by the government.\n\nAccording to a 2010 study, the number of Asians in East Harlem nearly tripled between 2000 and 2010, largely due to Chinese people moving to East Harlem. Increasing rents in Lower Manhattan's Chinatown have driven many into public and subsidized housing developments in the neighborhood. Advocates have been calling for Chinese language services to be available in the community centers to accommodate the growing number of Chinese residents in the area. In 2000, the Chinese population in the northern portion was less than one percent, but by 2010, it has gone up to being three percent in the area. In the southern part, it rose from 4.6% to 8.4%.\n\nAs of 2010, the Puerto Rican population was 27.7% in zip code 10029, and 23.4% in 10035. 10035 also has a large Mexican population, at 10.7%.\n\nThe Harlem River separates the Bronx and Manhattan, necessitating several spans between the two New York City boroughs. In East Harlem, the Wards Island Bridge, also known as the 103rd Street Footbridge, connects Manhattan with Wards Island. The Triboro Bridge is a complex of three separate bridges that offers connections between Queens, Manhattan (Harlem), and the Bronx.\n\nPublic transportation service is provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. The New York City Subway's IRT Lexington Avenue Line runs through East Harlem, with an express station at 125th Street (served by the ) as well as local stations at the 116th Street, 110th Street, 103rd Street, and 96th Street (served by the ). There is also a Second Avenue Subway station at 96th Street on the . MTA Regional Bus Operations and bus routes serve East Harlem as well. Metro-North Railroad has a commuter rail station at Harlem – 125th Street, connecting to Westchester County and Connecticut.\n\nSocial problems, including poverty, crime, and drug addiction, have plagued the area since the 1970s. Although crime rates have dropped from the historically high numbers of the past, East Harlem suffers from Manhattan's highest violent crime rate, with 15 murders in 2011.\n\nEast Harlem has the highest concentration of shelters and facilities in Manhattan, with eight homeless shelters, 36 drug and alcohol treatment facilities and 37 mental health treatment facilities. It also has the highest jobless rate in the entire city, as well as the city's second highest cumulative AIDS rate. The asthma rate is also 5 times larger than national levels. The neighborhood also suffers from a high poverty rate. Union Settlement Association is one of the neighborhood's largest social service agencies, reaching more than 13,000 people annually at 17 locations throughout East Harlem, through a range of programs, including early childhood education, youth development, senior services, job training, the arts, adult education, nutrition, counseling, a farmers' market, community development, and neighborhood cultural events.\n\nA lack of access to healthy food causes serious hardships to citizens of East Harlem, a neighborhood which is considered to be a food desert. According to an April 2008 report prepared by the New York City Department of City Planning, East Harlem is an area of the city with the highest levels of diet-related diseases due to limited opportunities for citizens to purchase fresh foods.\n\nWith a high population density and a lack of nearby supermarkets, the neighborhood has little access to fresh fruit and vegetables and a low consumption of fresh foods. Citizens of East Harlem are likely to buy food from grocery stores that have a limited supply of fruits and vegetables, which are often of poor quality and generally more expensive than the same products sold at supermarkets. Compared to the Upper East Side, supermarkets in Harlem are 30% less common. Without access to affordable produce and meats, East Harlem residents have difficulty eating a healthy diet, which contributes to high rates of obesity and diabetes.\n\nIn 2011, Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer announced a program which would send Veggie Vans to East Harlem senior centers and housing projects. In 2012, Whole Foods announced two uptown locations, one being on 125th Street and Lenox Avenue, the other in the Upper East Side. In 2010, Aldi's Grocery opened at the East River Plaza located at E. 117th St. and FDR Drive, providing access to affordable food for East Harlem's residents. In 2013, a new Super FI Emperior Grocery store opened up in East Harlem on 103rd Street and Lexington Avenue.\n\nEast Harlem is dominated by public housing complexes of various types, with a high concentration of older tenement buildings between these developments. The neighborhood contains the highest geographical concentration of low income public housing projects in the United States. The total land area is .\n\nAfter a wave of arson ravaged the low income communities of New York City throughout the 1970s, many of the residential structures in East Harlem were left seriously damaged or destroyed. By the late 1970s, the city began to rehabilitate many abandoned tenement style buildings and designate them as low income housing.\n\nDespite recent gentrification of the neighborhood, large numbers of apartment buildings have been deliberately kept vacant by their owners. Although the businesses on the ground floor are retained, landlords do not want to have the trouble involved in residential tenants. In some cases, landlords are waiting for a revived economy, warehousing the apartments so that they can rent them later at a higher rent.\n\nIn 2007, a survey of Manhattan's buildings found that 1,723 were significantly vacant, three-quarters of them north of 96th Street. A 1998 survey found that one-quarter of low-rise residential buildings on avenues or major cross streets in East Harlem had sealed-up residential floors, despite having commercial businesses on the ground floor.\n\nThere are twenty-four New York City Housing Authority developments located in East Harlem.\n\nOther subsidized housing include:\n\nThe schools in East Harlem are generally characterized by low test scores and high drop-out and truancy rates. As in other parts of the city, some schools require students pass through metal detectors and swipe ID cards to enter school buildings. Nevertheless, since 1982 the community has been home to the Manhattan Center for Science and Mathematics, which replaced Benjamin Franklin High School, a school which had the smallest graduating class in the city at the time of its closing.\n\nAmong the public charter schools in East Harlem are Success Academy Harlem 2 of Success Academy Charter Schools, the Harlem Village Academy, East Harlem Scholars Academies, and the DREAM Charter School.\n\nMajor medical care providers in the East Harlem area include Metropolitan Hospital Center and Mount Sinai Hospital, which serve residents of East Harlem and the Upper East Side. North General Hospital, which formerly served the area as well, is now closed. Many of the graduates of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai do local public health work, including work on asthma, diabetes, unsafe drinking water, lead paint and infectious diseases.\n\nThe neighborhood is home to one of the few major television studios north of midtown, Metropolis at 106th Street and Park Avenue, where shows such as BET's \"106 & Park\" and \"Chappelle's Show\" have been produced. PRdream.com, a web site on the history and culture of Puerto Ricans, founded a media gallery and digital film studio called MediaNoche in 2003. It presents technology-based art on Park Avenue and 102nd Street, providing exhibition space and residencies for artists and filmmakers, and webcasting events.\n\nMusic\n\nLiterature\n\nFilm\n\nMusic videos\n\nNotes\nFurther reading\n\n\n",
                "History of Harlem\n\nFounded in the 17th century as a Dutch outpost, Harlem developed into a farming village, a revolutionary battlefield, a resort town, a commuter town, a ghetto, and a center of African-American culture.\n\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, the area that would become Harlem (originally Haarlem) was inhabited by the Manhattans, a native tribe, who along with other Native Americans, most likely Lenape occupied the area on a semi-nomadic basis. As many as several hundred farmed the Harlem flatlands. The first European settlement in the area was by siblings Hendrick (Henry), Isaac and Rachel de Forest, Franco-Dutch immigrants in 1637. In 1639 Jochem Pietersen Kuyter established the homestead named \"Zedendaal\", or \"Blessed Valley\", stretched along the Harlem River from about the present 127th Street to 140th Street. Early European settlers were forced to flee to New Amsterdam in lower Manhattan whenever hostilities with the natives heated up, and the native population gradually decreased amidst conflict with the Dutch. The settlement was named \"Nieuw Haarlem\" (New Haarlem), after the Dutch city of Haarlem, and was formally incorporated in 1660 under leadership of Peter Stuyvesant. The Indian trail to Harlem's lush bottomland meadows was rebuilt by black laborers of the Dutch West India Company, and eventually developed into the Boston Post Road.\n\nIn 1664, the English took control of the New Netherland colony, and English colonial Governor Richard Nicolls established the \"Harlem Line\" as the southern border patent line of the village of Nieuw Haarlem (later, the village of Harlem) running approximately northward between near modern East 74th Street, at the East River, and West 129th Street, on the Hudson River. The British also tried to change the name of the community to \"Lancaster\", but the name never stuck, and eventually settled down to the Anglicized \"Harlem\". The Dutch took control of the area again for one year in 1673. The village grew very slowly until the middle 18th century, and it became a resort of sorts for the rich of New York City. Only the Morris-Jumel Mansion survives from this period.\n\nHarlem played an important role in the American Revolution. The British had established their base of operations in lower Manhattan, and George Washington fortified the area around Harlem to oppose them. From Harlem, he could control the land routes to the north, as well as traffic on the Harlem River. The New York Provincial Congress met in White Plains, as did the convention drafting the constitution for New York State. On September 16, 1776, the Battle of Harlem Heights, sometimes referred to as the \"Battle of Harlem\" or \"Battle of Harlem Plain\", was fought in western Harlem around the Hollow Way (now West 125th Street), with conflicts on Morningside Heights to the south and Harlem Heights to the north. The American troops were outnumbered, 5000 to 2000, and were ill-equipped compared to their opponents, but outflanked the British and forced them to retreat to the area around what is now West 106th Street. It was Washington's first American victory. Later that year, the British would avenge this defeat by chasing Washington and his troops north, then turning back and burning Harlem to the ground.\nRebuilding took decades, and infrastructure was improved much more slowly than was happening in New York City proper. The village remained largely rural through the early 19th century and, though the \"grid system\" of streets, designed downtown, was formally extended to Harlem in 1811, it does not seem that anybody expected it would mean much. The 1811 report that accompanied the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 noted that it was \"improbable that (for centuries to come) the grounds north of the Harlem Flat will be covered with houses.\"\n\nThough undeveloped, the area was not poor. Harlem was \"a synonym for elegant living through a good part of the nineteenth century.\" The village remained largely farmland estates, such as [Conrad] Van Keulen's Hook, \"orig\". Otterspoor, bordered north of the Mill Creek (now 108th St., \"orig\". Montagne Creek at 109th St.), which flowed into Harlem Lake, to the farm of Morris Randall, northwest on the Harlem River, and westward to the Peter Benson, or Mill Farm. This former bowery [of land] was subdivided into twenty-two equal plots, of about 6 to each, of which portions later owned by Abraham Storm, including thirty-one acres (east of Fifth Avenue between 110th & 125th St.) were sold by Storm's widow Catherine in 1795 to James Roosevelt (great grandfather of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, 1760–1847). This branch of the Roosevelt family subsequently moved to the town of Hyde Park, but several of Roosevelt's children remain interred in Harlem.\n\nAs late as 1820, the community had dwindled to 91 families, a church, a school, and a library. Wealthy farmers, known as \"patroons\", maintained these country estates largely on the heights overlooking the Hudson River. Service connecting the outlays of Harlem with the rest of the City of New York (on the southern tip of the island of Manhattan) was done via steamboat on the East River, an hour-and-a-half passage, sometimes interrupted when the river froze in winter, or else by stagecoach along the Boston Post Road, which descended from McGown's Pass (now in Central Park) and skirted the salt marshes around 110th Street, to pass through Harlem.\n\nThe New York and Harlem Railroad (now Metro North) was incorporated in 1831 to better link the city with Harlem and Westchester County, starting at a depot at East 23rd Street, and extending north to a railroad junction in Columbia County at Chatham, New York by 1851. Charles Henry Hall, a wealthy lawyer and land speculator, recognized the changes that this railroad would make possible in Harlem and began a successful program of infrastructure development, building out streets, gas lines, sewer lines, and other facilities needed for urban life. Piers were also built, enabling Harlem to become an industrial suburb serving New York City. The rapid development of infrastructure enabled some to become wealthy, and the area became important to politicians, many of whom lived in Harlem. New York mayors Cornelius Van Wyck Lawrence and Daniel Tiemann both lived in Harlem in this period. For many in New York City, Harlem was at this time regarded as a sort of country retreat. The village had a population of poorer residents as well, including blacks, who came north to work in factories or to take advantage of relatively low rents.\n\nBetween 1850 and 1870, many large estates, including Hamilton Grange, the estate of Alexander Hamilton, were auctioned off as the fertile soil was depleted and crop yields fell. Some of the land became occupied by Irish squatters, whose presence further depressed property values.\nDuring the American Civil War, Harlem saw draft riots, along with the rest of the city, but the neighborhood was a significant beneficiary of the economic boom that followed the end of the war, starting in 1868. The neighborhood continued to serve as a refuge for New Yorkers, but increasingly those coming north were poor and Jewish or Italian. Factories, homes, churches, and retail buildings were built at great speed. The Panic of 1873 caused Harlem property values to drop 80%, and gave the City of New York the opportunity to annex the troubled community as far north as 155th Street.\n\nRecovery came soon, and row houses (as distinct from the previous generation's free-standing houses) were being constructed in large numbers by 1876. Development accelerated in part in anticipation of elevated railroads, which were extended to Harlem in 1880. With the construction of the \"els\", urbanized development occurred very rapidly. Developers anticipated that the planned Lexington Avenue subway would ease transportation to lower Manhattan. Fearing that new housing regulations would be enacted in 1901, they rushed to complete as many new buildings as possible before these came into force. Early entrepreneurs had grandiose schemes for Harlem: Polo was played at the original Polo Grounds, later to become home of the New York Giants baseball team. Oscar Hammerstein I opened the Harlem Opera House on East 125th Street in 1889. By 1893, even row houses did not suffice to meet the growing population, and large-scale apartment buildings were the norm. In that year, \"Harlem Monthly Magazine\" wrote that \"it is evident to the most superficial observer that the centre of fashion, wealth, culture, and intelligence, must, in the near future, be found in the ancient and honorable village of Harlem.\"\n\nHowever, also in that year, the construction glut and a delay in the building of the subway led to a fall in real estate prices which attracted immigrant Eastern Europe Jews and Italians to Harlem in accelerating numbers. There had been a Jewish community of 12 in Harlem in 1869 that grew to a peak of almost 200,000 in about 1915. Presaging their resistance to the arrival of blacks, existing landowners tried to stop Jews from moving into the neighborhood. At least one rental sign declared \"\"Keine Juden und Keine Hunde\"\" (No Jews and no dogs). Italians began to arrive in Harlem only a few years after the Jews did. By 1900 there were 150,000 Italians in Harlem. Both groups moved particularly into East Harlem.\n\nThe Jewish population of Harlem embraced the City College of New York, which moved to Harlem in 1907. In the years after the move, 90% of the school's students were Jewish, and many of the school's most distinguished graduates date from this period. Both the Jewish and Italian Mafia emerged in East Harlem and soon expanded their operations to the entire neighborhood. West 116th Street between Lenox and 8th Avenue became a vice district. The neighborhood also became a major center for more conventional entertainment, with 125th Street as a particular center for musical theater, vaudeville, and moving pictures.\n\nThe Jewish presence in Harlem was ephemeral, and by 1930, only 5,000 Jews remained. As they left, their apartments in East Harlem were increasingly filled by Puerto Ricans, who were arriving in large numbers by 1913. Italian Harlem lasted longer, and traces of the community lasted into the 1970s in the area around Pleasant Avenue.\n\nBlack residents have been present in Harlem continually since the 1630s, and as the neighborhood modernized in the late 19th century, they could be found especially in the area around 125th Street and in the \"Negro tenements\" on West 130th Street. By 1900, tens of thousands lived in Harlem. The mass migration of blacks into the area began in 1904, due to another real estate crash, the worsening of conditions for blacks elsewhere in the city, and the leadership of black real estate entrepreneurs including Phillip Payton, Jr. After the collapse of the 1890s, new speculation and construction started up again in 1903 and the resulting glut of housing led to a crash in values in 1904 and 1905 that eclipsed the late-19th century slowdown. Landlords could not find white renters for their properties, so Philip Payton stepped in to bring blacks. His company, the Afro-American Realty Company, has been credited with the migration of blacks from their previous neighborhoods, the Tenderloin, San Juan Hill (now the site of Lincoln Center), Minetta Lane in Greenwich Village and Hell's Kitchen in the west 40s and 50s. The move to northern Manhattan was driven in part by fears that anti-black riots such as those that had occurred in the Tenderloin in 1900 and in San Juan Hill in 1905 might recur. In addition, a number of tenements that had been occupied by blacks in the west 30s were destroyed at this time to make way for the construction of the original Penn Station.\n\nIn 1907, black churches began to move uptown. Several congregations built grand new church buildings, including St Philip's on West 134th Street just west of Seventh Avenue (the wealthiest church in Harlem), the Abyssinian Baptist Church on West 138th Street and St Mark's Methodist Church on Edgecombe Avenue. More often churches purchased buildings from white congregations of Christians and Jews whose members had left the neighborhood, including Metropolitan Baptist Church on West 128th and Seventh Avenue, St James Presbyterian Church on West 141st Street, and Mt Olivet Baptist Church on Lenox Avenue. Only the Catholic Church retained its churches in Harlem, with white priests presiding over parishes that retained significant numbers of whites until the 1930s.\n\nThe early 20th-century Great Migration of blacks to northern industrial cities was fueled by their desire to leave behind the Jim Crow South, seek better jobs and education for their children, and escape a culture of lynching violence. During World War I, expanding industries recruited black laborers to fill new jobs, thinly staffed after the draft began to take young men. So many blacks came that it \"threaten[ed] the very existence of some of the leading industries of Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Alabama.\" Many settled in Harlem. In 1910, Central Harlem was about 10% black. By 1920, central Harlem was 32.43% black. The 1930 census showed 70.18% of Central Harlem's residents as black and lived as far south as Central Park, at 110th Street. The expansion was fueled primarily by an influx of blacks from the southern U.S. states, especially Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia, who took trains up the East Coast. There were also numerous immigrants from the West Indies. As blacks moved in, white residents left. Between 1920 and 1930, 118,792 white people left the neighborhood and 87,417 blacks arrived.\n\nBetween 1907 and 1915, some white residents of Harlem resisted the neighborhood's change, especially once the swelling black population pressed west of Lenox Avenue, which served as an informal color line until the early 1920s. Some made pacts not to sell to or rent to blacks. Others tried to buy property and evict black tenants, but the Afro-American Realty Company retaliated by buying other property and evicting whites. Some even attempted to convince banks to deny mortgages to black buyers, but soon gave up those efforts.\n\nSoon after blacks began to move into Harlem, the community became known as \"the spiritual home of the Negro protest movement.\" The NAACP became active in Harlem in 1910 and Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association in 1916. The NAACP chapter there soon grew to be the largest in the country. Activist A. Philip Randolph lived in Harlem and published the radical magazine \"The Messenger\" starting in 1917. It was from Harlem that he organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters. W. E. B. Du Bois lived and published in Harlem in the 1920s, as did James Weldon Johnson and Marcus Garvey.\n\nSouthern Italians and Sicilians, with a moderate number of Northern Italians, soon predominated, especially in the area east of Lexington Avenue between 96th and 116th Streets and east of Madison Avenue between 116th and 125th Streets, with each street featuring people from different regions of Italy. The neighborhood became known as \"Italian Harlem\", the Italian American hub of Manhattan; it was the first part of Manhattan to be referred to as \"Little Italy\". The first Italians arrived in East Harlem in 1878, from Polla in the province of Salerno, and settled in the vicinity of 115th Street.\n\nThere were many crime syndicates in Italian Harlem from the early Black Hand to the bigger and more organized Italian gangs that formed the Italian-American Mafia. It was the founding location of the Genovese crime family, one of the Five Families that dominated organized crime in New York City.\n\nIn the 1920s and early 1930s, Italian Harlem was represented in Congress by future Mayor Fiorello La Guardia, and later by Italian-American socialist Vito Marcantonio. The Italian neighborhood approached its peak in the 1930s, with over 100,000 Italian-Americans living in its crowded, run-down apartment buildings. The 1930 census showed that 81 percent of the population of Italian Harlem consisted of first- or second-generation Italian Americans. (Somewhat less than the concentration of Italian Americans in the Lower East Side's Little Italy with 88 percent; Italian Harlem's total population, however, was three times that of Little Italy.)\n\nAlthough in certain areas, particularly around Pleasant Avenue, Italian Harlem lasted through the 1970s, today most of the former Italian population is gone. Most of these predominantly older residents are clustered around Our Lady of Mount Carmel Church, mainly from 114th to 118th Streets. According to the 2000 Census, there were only 1,130 Italian-Americans still living in this area.\n\nStill, vestiges of the old Italian neighborhood remain. The annual Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel and the \"Dancing of the Giglio\", the first Italian feast in New York City, is still celebrated there every year on the second weekend of August by the Giglio Society of East Harlem. Italian retail establishments still exist, such as Rao's restaurant, started in 1896, and the original Patsy's Pizzeria which opened in the 1933. In May 2011, one of the last remaining Italian retail businesses in the neighborhood, a barbershop owned by Claudio Caponigro on 116th Street, was threatened with closure by a rent increase.\n\nStarting around the time of the end of World War I, Harlem became associated with the New Negro movement, and then the artistic outpouring known as the Harlem Renaissance, which extended to poetry, novels, theater, and the visual arts.\n\nThe growing population also supported a rich fabric of organizations and activities in the 1920s. Fraternal orders such as the Prince Hall Masons and the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks set up lodges in Harlem, with elaborate buildings including auditoriums and large bands. Parades of lodge members decked out in uniforms and accompanied by band music were a common sight on Harlem's streets, on public holidays, lodge anniversaries, church festivities and funerals. The neighborhood's churches housed a range of groups, including athletic clubs, choirs and social clubs. A similar range of activities could be found at the YMCA on 135th Street and the YWCA on 137th Street. The social pages of Harlem's two African-American newspapers, the \"New York Age\" and the \"New York Amsterdam News\", recorded the meetings, dinners and dances of hundreds of small clubs. Soapbox speakers drew crowds on Seventh and Lenox Avenues until the 1960s, some offering political oratory, with Hubert Harrison the most famous, while others, particularly in the late 1920s, sold medicine. Harlem also offered a wealth of sporting events: the Lincoln Giants played baseball at Olympic Field at 136th and Fifth Avenue until 1920, after which residents had to travel to the Catholic Protectory Oval in the Bronx; men's and women's basketball teams from local athletic clubs played in church gymnasiums, and, as they became more popular, at the Manhattan Casino on 155th Street, before giving way to professional teams, most famously the Rens, based at the Renaissance Ballroom on Seventh Avenue; and boxing bouts took place at the Commonwealth Casino on East 135th Street (run by white promoters the McMahon brothers). The biggest crowds, including many whites, came to see black athletes compete against whites.\nIt took years for business ownership to reflect the new reality. A survey in 1929 found that whites owned and operated 81.51% of the neighborhood's 10,319 businesses, with beauty parlors making up the largest number of black-owned businesses. By the late 1960s, 60% of the businesses in Harlem responding to surveys reported ownership by blacks, and an overwhelming fraction of new businesses were black owned after that time.\n\nMarginalized in the legitimate economy, a small group of blacks found success outside the law, running gambling on numbers. Invented in 1920 or 1921, numbers had exploded by 1924 into a racket turning over tens of millions of dollars every year. That year the \"New York Age\" reported that there were at least thirty bankers (the name given to someone running a numbers game) in Harlem, with many employing between twelve and twenty people to collect bets, and Marcellino, the largest banker, employing over one hundred. By the late 1920s, Wallace Thurman guessed there were over a thousand collectors taking bets from 100,000 clients a day. The most successful bankers, who could earn enormous sums of money, were known as Kings and Queens. The wealthiest numbers king of all was almost certainly the reputed inventor of the game, Casper Holstein. He owned a fleet of cars, apartment buildings in Harlem and a home on Long Island, but did not have the ostentatious style and lifestyle of many other kings. He, and other bankers, gave money to charities and loans to aspiring businessmen and needy residents. Holstein's role in the community extended further than most of his colleagues, included membership in the Monarch Lodge of the Elks, support for Marcus Garvey's Universal Negro Improvement Association, philanthropy in his native Virgin Islands, and patronage of the Harlem Renaissance.\n\nHarlem adapted rapidly to the coming of Prohibition, and its theaters, nightclubs, and speakeasies became major entertainment destinations. Claude McKay would write that Harlem had become \"an all white picnic ground\", and in 1927 Rudolph Fisher published an article titled \"The Caucasian Storms Harlem\". Langston Hughes described this period at length, including this passage from his 1940 autobiography,\n\nIn response to the white influx, some blacks operated alternative venues in their homes. Called buffet flats, they offered alcohol, music, dancing, prostitutes, and, commonly, gambling, and, less often, rooms to which a couple could go. Their location in residential buildings, typically on cross streets above 140th Street, away from the nightclubs and speakeasies on the avenues, offered a degree of privacy from police, and from whites: you could only find a buffet flat if you knew the address and apartment number, which hosts did not advertise.\n\nPuerto Rican and Latin American immigration after the First World War established an enclave at the western portion of East Harlem – around 110th Street and Lexington Avenue – which became known as \"Spanish Harlem\". The area slowly grew to encompass all of East Harlem, including Italian Harlem, as Italians moved out – to the Bronx, Brooklyn, upstate New York, and New Jersey – and Hispanics moved in during another wave of immigration in the 1940s and 1950s. The newly dominant Puerto Rican population, which reached 63,000 in 1950, continued to define the neighborhood according to its needs, establishing bodegas and botánicas as it expanded; by the 1930s there was already an enclosed street market underneath the Park Avenue railroad viaduct between 111th and 116th Streets, called \"La Marqueta\" (\"The Market\"). Catholic and evangelistic Protestant churches appeared in storefronts. Although \"Spanish Harlem\" had been in use since at least the 1930s to describe the Hispanic enclave – along with \"Italian Harlem\" and \"Negro Harlem\" – around the 1950s the name began to be used to describe the entire East Harlem neighborhood. Later, the name \"El Barrio\" (\"The Neighborhood\") began to be used, especially by inhabitants of the area.\n\nSince the 1920s, this period of Harlem's history has been highly romanticized. With the increase in a poor population, it was also the time when the neighborhood began to deteriorate to a slum, and some of the storied traditions of the Harlem Renaissance were driven by poverty, crime, or other social ills. For example, in this period, Harlem became known for \"rent parties\", informal gatherings in which bootleg alcohol was served and music played. Neighbors paid to attend, and thus enabled the host to make his or her monthly rent. Though picturesque, these parties were thrown out of necessity. Further, over a quarter of black households in Harlem made their monthly rent by taking in lodgers, many of whom were family members, but who sometimes brought bad habits or even crime that disrupted the lives of respectable families. Lodgers also experienced disruption, with many having to move frequently when households relocated, roommates quarreled or they could not pay rent. Urban reformers campaigned to eliminate the \"lodger evil\" but the problem got worse before it got better; in 1940, still affected by the Depression, 40% of black families in Harlem were taking in lodgers.\n\nThe high rents and poor maintenance of housing stock, which Harlem residents suffered through much of the 20th century, was not merely the product of racism by white landlords. By 1914, 40% of Harlem's private houses and 10% of its tenements were owned by blacks. Wealthier blacks continued to purchase land in Harlem, and by 1920, a significant portion of the neighborhood was owned by blacks. By the late 1960s, 60% of the businesses in Harlem responding to surveys reported ownership by blacks, and an overwhelming fraction of new businesses were black owned after that time.\n\nIn 1928, the first effort at housing reform was attempted in Harlem with the construction of the Paul Laurence Dunbar Houses, backed by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. These were intended to give working people of modest means the opportunity to live in and, over time, purchase, houses of their own. The Great Depression hit shortly after the buildings opened, and the experiment failed. They were followed in 1936 by the Harlem River Houses, a more modest experiment in housing projects. And by 1964, nine giant public housing projects had been constructed in the neighborhood, housing over 41,000 people.\n\nThe job losses of the Depression were exacerbated by the end of Prohibition in 1933 and by the Harlem Riot of 1935, which scared away the wealthier whites who had long supported Harlem's entertainment industry. White audiences decreased almost totally after a second round of riots in 1943. Many Harlemites found work in the military or in the Brooklyn shipyards during World War II, but the neighborhood declined rapidly once the war ended. Some middle-class blacks moved north or west to suburbs, a trend that increased after the 1960s Civil Rights Movement decreased discrimination in housing.\n\nThe neighborhood enjoyed few benefits from the massive public works projects in New York under Robert Moses in the 1930s, and as a result had fewer parks and public recreational sites than other New York neighborhoods. Of the 255 playgrounds Moses built in New York City, he placed only one in Harlem.\nThe earliest activism by blacks to change the situation in Harlem itself grew out of the Great Depression, with the \"Don't Buy Where You Can't Work\" movement. This was the ultimately successful campaign to force retail shops on 125th Street to hire black employees. Boycotts were originally organized by the Citizens' League for Fair Play in June 1934 against Blumstein's Department Store on 125th Street. The store soon agreed to integrate its staff more fully. This success emboldened Harlem residents, and protests continued under other leadership, including that of preacher and later congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., seeking to change hiring practices at other stores, to effect the hiring of more black workers, or the hiring of members of particular protesting groups.\n\nCommunism gained a following in Harlem in the 1930s, and continued to play a role through the 1940s. In 1935, the first of Harlem's five riots broke out. The incident started with a boy that was supposedly caught stealing from a store on 125th Street had been killed by the police. By the time it was over, 600 stores had been looted and three men were dead. The same year saw internationalism in Harlem politics, as Harlemites responded to the Italian invasion of Ethiopia by holding giant rallies, signing petitions and sending an appeal to the League of Nations. Such internationalism continued intermittently, including broad demonstrations in favor of Egyptian president Nasser after the Suez invasion of 1956.\n\nBlack Harlemites took positions in the elected political infrastructure of New York starting in 1941 with the election of Adam Clayton Powell Jr. to the City Council. He was easily elected to Congress when a congressional district was placed in Harlem in 1944, leaving his City Council seat to be won by another black Harlemite, Benjamin J. Davis. Ironically, Harlem's political strength soon deteriorated, as Clayton Powell, Jr. spent his time in Washington or his vacation home in Puerto Rico, and Davis was jailed in 1951 for violations of the Smith Act.\n\nThe year 1943 saw the second Harlem riot. Allegedly, a black soldier knocked down a policeman who then shot him. An onlooker shouted that the soldier had been killed, and this news spread throughout the black community and provoked rioting. A force of 6,600, made up of city police, military police and civil patrolmen, in addition to 8,000 State Guardsmen and 1,500 civilian volunteers was required to end the violence. Hundreds of businesses were destroyed and looted, the property damage approaching $225,000. Overall, six people died and 185 were injured. Five hundred people were arrested in connection with the riot.\n\nMany groups mobilized in Harlem in the 1960s, fighting for better schools, jobs, and housing. Some were peaceful and others advocated violence. By the early 1960s, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) had offices on 125th street, and acted as negotiator for the community with the city, especially in times of racial unrest. They urged civilian review boards to hear complaints of police abuse, a demand that was ultimately met. As chairman of the House Committee of Education and Labor at the start of the 1960s, Adam Clayton Powell Jr. used this position to direct federal funds to various development projects in Harlem.\n\nThe largest public works projects in Harlem in these years were public housing, with the largest concentration built in East Harlem. Typically, existing structures were torn down and replaced with city-designed and managed properties that would, in theory, present a safer and more pleasant environment than those available from private landlords. Ultimately, community objections halted the construction of new projects.\n\nFrom the mid-20th century, the terrible quality of local schools has been a source of distress. In the 1960s, about 75% of Harlem students tested under grade levels in reading skills, and 80% tested under grade level in math. In 1964, residents of Harlem staged two school boycotts to call attention to the problem. In central Harlem, 92% of students stayed home.\n\nThe influence of the southern nonviolent protest movement was muted in Harlem. Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was the black leader most respected in Harlem. But on September 20, 1958, Izola Curry, deluded into believing the NAACP was controlled by Communists, approached Dr. King at a Blumstein's book-signing, and asked him if he was Martin Luther King, Jr. When King replied in the affirmative, she said, \"I've been looking for you for five years\", then thrust a letter opener into his chest. NYPD officers took King, still in the chair where he had sat, to an ambulance that took him to Harlem Hospital, for removal of the blade. Reportage recalling the event for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day in 2014, noted:\n\nAt least two dozen groups of black nationalists also operated in New York, many of them in Harlem. The most important of these was the Nation of Islam, whose Temple Number Seven was run by Malcolm X from 1952–1963. Malcolm X was assassinated in the Audubon Ballroom in Washington Heights in 1965. The neighborhood remains an important center for the Nation of Islam.\n\nIn 1963, Inspector Lloyd Sealy became the first African-American officer of the NYPD to command a police station, the 28th precinct in Harlem. Community relations between Harlem residents and the NYPD were strained as civil rights activists requested that the NYPD hire more black police officers, specifically in Harlem. In 1964, across Harlem's three precincts, the ratio was one black police officer for every six white officers. A riot broke in the summer of 1964 following the fatal shooting of an unarmed 15-year-old black teenager by an off-duty white police lieutenant. One person was killed, more than 100 were injured, and hundreds more were arrested. Property damage and looting were extensive. The riot would later spread out of Manhattan and into the borough of Brooklyn and neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, the heart of Brooklyn's African-American community. In the aftermath of the riots, the federal government funded a pilot program called Project Uplift, in which thousands of young people in Harlem were given jobs during the summer of 1965. The project was inspired by a report generated by HARYOU called \"Youth in the Ghetto.\" HARYOU was given a major role in organizing the project, along with the National Urban League and nearly 100 smaller community organizations.\n\nIn 1966, the Black Panthers organized a group in Harlem, agitating for violence in pursuit of change. Speaking at a rally of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), Max Stanford, a Black Panther, declared that the United States \"could be brought down to its knees with a rag and some gasoline and a bottle.\"\n\nIn 1968, Harlemites rioted after the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., as did black residents in other U.S. cities. Two people died—one stabbed to death in a crowd and another trapped in a burning building. However, the rioting in New York was minor compared to that in other American cities. Mayor John Lindsay helped to quell the rioting by marching up Lenox Avenue in a \"hail of bricks\" to confront the angry crowds. (\"See also King assassination riots.\")\n\nLittle investment in private homes or businesses took place in the neighborhood between 1911 and the 1990s. However, the unwillingness of landlords elsewhere in the city to rent to black tenants, together with a significant increase in the black population of New York, meant that rents in Harlem were for many years \"higher\" than rents elsewhere in the city, even as the housing stock decayed. In 1920, one-room apartments in central Harlem rented for $40 to whites or $100–$125 to blacks. In the late 1920s, a typical white working-class family in New York paid $6.67 per month per room, while blacks in Harlem paid $9.50 for the same space. The worse the accommodations and more desperate the renter, the higher the rents would be. This pattern persisted through the 1960s; in 1965, CERGE reported that a one-room apartment in Harlem rented for $50–$74, while comparable apartments rented for $30–$49 in white slums. The high rents encouraged some property speculators to engage in block busting, a practice whereby they would acquire a single property on a block and sell or rent it to blacks with great publicity. Other landowners would panic, and the speculators would then buy additional houses relatively cheaply. These houses could then be rented profitably to blacks.\n\nAfter the Harlem River Houses, America's first federally subsidized housing project, were opened in 1937, other massive housing projects soon followed, with tens of thousands of units constructed over the next twenty years, especially in Harlem.\nIn the post-World War II era, Harlem ceased to be home to a majority of the city's blacks, but it remained the cultural and political capital of black New York, and possibly black America. The character of the community changed in the years after the war, as middle-class blacks left for the outer boroughs (primarily the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn) and suburbs. The percentage of Harlem that was black peaked in 1950, at 98.2%. Thereafter, Hispanic, Asian, and white residents have increased their share.\n\nThe high cost of space forced people to live in close quarters, and the population density of Harlem in these years was stunning—over 215,000 per square mile in the 1920s. By comparison, in 2000, Manhattan as a whole had a population density under 70,000 per square mile. The same forces that allowed landlords to charge more for Harlem space also enabled them to maintain it less, and many of the residential buildings in Harlem fell into disrepair. The 1960 census showed only 51% of housing in Harlem to be \"sound\", as opposed to 85% elsewhere in New York City. In 1968, the New York City Buildings Department received 500 complaints daily of rats in Harlem buildings, falling plaster, lack of heat, and unsanitary plumbing. Tenants were sometimes to blame; some would strip wiring and fixtures from their buildings to sell, throw garbage in hallways and airshafts, or otherwise damage the properties which they lived in or visited.\n\nAs the building stock decayed, landlords converted many buildings into \"single room occupancies\", or SROs, essentially private homeless shelters. In many cases, the income from these buildings could not support the fines and city taxes charged to their owners, or the houses suffered damage that would have been expensive to fix, and the buildings were abandoned. In the 1970s, this process accelerated to the point that Harlem, for the first time since before World War I, had a lower population density than the rest of Manhattan. Between 1970 and 1980, for example, Frederick Douglass Boulevard between 110th Street and 125th Street in central Harlem lost 42% of its population and 23% of its remaining housing stock. By 1987, 65% of the buildings in Harlem were owned by the City of New York, and many had become empty shells, convenient centers for drug dealing and other illegal activity. The lack of habitable buildings and falling population reduced tax rolls and made the neighborhood even less attractive to residential and retail investment.\n\nInadequate housing contributed to racial unrest and health problems. However, the lack of development also preserved buildings from the 1870–1910 building boom, and Harlem as a result has many of the finest original townhouses in New York. This includes work by many significant architects of the day, including McKim, Mead, and White; James Renwick; William Tuthill; Charles Buek; and Francis Kimball.\n\nBy some measures, the 1970s were the worst period in Harlem's history. Many of those Harlemites who were able to escape from poverty left the neighborhood in search of safer streets, better schools and homes. Those who remained were the poorest and least skilled, with the fewest opportunities for success. Though the federal government's Model Cities Program spent $100 million on job training, health care, education, public safety, sanitation, housing, and other projects over a ten-year period, Harlem showed no improvement.\n\nThe deterioration shows up starkly in the statistics of the period. In 1968, Harlem's infant mortality rate had been 37 for each 1000 live births, as compared to 23.1 in the city as a whole. Over the next eight years, infant mortality for the city as whole improved to 19, while the rate in Harlem increased to 42.8, more than double. Statistics describing illness, drug addiction, housing quality, and education are similarly grim and typically show rapid deterioration in the 1970s. The wholesale abandonment of housing was so pronounced that between 1976 and 1978 alone, central Harlem lost almost a third of its total population, and east Harlem lost about 27%. The neighborhood no longer had a functioning economy; stores were shuttered and by estimates published in 1971, 60% of the area's economic life depended on the cash flow from the illegal \"Numbers game\" alone.\n\nThe worst part of Harlem was the \"Bradhurst section\" between Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and Edgecombe, from 139th Street through 155th. In 1991, this region was described in the \"New York Times\" as follows: \"Since 1970, an exodus of residents has left behind the poor, the uneducated, the unemployed. Nearly two-thirds of the households have incomes below $10,000 a year. In a community with one of the highest crime rates in the city, garbage-strewn vacant lots and tumbledown tenements, many of them abandoned and sealed, contribute to the sense of danger and desolation that pervades much of the area.\"\nPlans for rectifying the situation often started with the restoration of 125th Street, long the economic heart of black Harlem. By the late 1970s, only marginalized and poor retail remained. Plans were drafted for a \"Harlem International Trade Center\", which would have filled the entire block between 125th Street and 126th, from Lenox to Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard, with a center for trade with the third world. A related retail complex was planned to the west, between Frederick Douglass Boulevard and St. Nicholas. However, this plan depended on $30 million in financing from the federal government, and with the election of Ronald Reagan to the presidency of the United States, it had no hope of being completed.\n\nThe city did provide one large construction project, though not so favored by residents. Starting in the 1960s and continuing through the 1970s, Harlemites fought the introduction of an immense sewage treatment plant, the North River Water Pollution Control Plant, on the Hudson River in West Harlem. A compromise was ultimately reached in which the plant was built with a state park, including extensive recreational facilities, on top. The park, called Riverbank State Park, was opened in 1993 (the sewage plant having been completed some years earlier).\n\nThe city began auctioning its enormous portfolio of Harlem properties to the public in 1985. This was intended to improve the community by placing property in the hands of people who would live in them and maintain them. In many cases, the city would even pay to completely renovate a property before selling it (by lottery) below market value. The program was soon beset by scandal—buyers were acquiring houses from the city, then making deals with churches or other charities in which they would inflate the appraised values of the properties and the church or charity would take out federally guaranteed 203(k) mortgage and buy it. The original buyer would realize a profit and the church or charity would default on the mortgage (presumably getting some kind of kickback from the developer). Abandoned shells were left to further deteriorate, and about a third of the properties sold by the city were tenements which still had tenants, who were left in particularly miserable conditions. These properties, and new restrictions on Harlem mortgages, bedeviled the area's residential real estate market for years.\n\nAfter four decades of decline, Central Harlem's population bottomed out in the 1990 census, at 101,026. It had decreased by 57% from its peak of 237,468 in 1950. Between 1990 and 2015 the neighborhood's population grew by 16.8%, with the percentage of black people decreasing from 87.6% to 62%, During this time, there was a significant drop to 54.4% in 2010, while the percentage of whites increased from 1.5% to 10% by 2015. Hispanics are the second largest demographic in Central Harlem, making up 23% of the population as of 2015, however, although whites make up only 10% of the population, they are the fastest growing demographic, with a 678% increase since 1990.\n\nFrom 1987 through 1990, the city removed long-unused trolley tracks from 125th Street, laid new water mains and sewers, installed new sidewalks, curbs, traffic lights, streetlights, and planted trees. Two years later, national chains opened branches on 125th Street for the first time – The Body Shop opened a store at 125th street and 5th Avenue, and a Ben & Jerry's ice cream franchise employing formerly homeless people opened across the street. Neither store is extant. The development of the region would leap forward a few years later with the 1994 introduction of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, which brought $300 million in development funds and $250 million in tax breaks.\n\nPlans were laid for shopping malls, movie theaters, and museums. However, these plans were nearly derailed in 1995 by the \"Freddy's Fashion Mart\" riot, which culminated in political arson and eight deaths. These riots did not resemble their predecessors, and were organized by black activists against Jewish shop owners on 125th street.\n\nFive years later, the revitalization of 125th Street resumed, with the construction of a Starbucks outlet backed in part by Magic Johnson (1999), the first supermarket in Harlem in 30 years, the Harlem USA retail complex, which included the first first-run movie theater in many years (2000), and a new home for the Studio Museum in Harlem (2001). In the same year, former president Bill Clinton took office space in Harlem, at 55 West 125th Street. In 2002, a large retail and office complex called Harlem Center was completed at the corner of Lenox and 125th. There has been extensive new construction and rehabilitation of older buildings in the years since.\n\nAfter years of false starts, Harlem began to see rapid gentrification in the late 1990s. This was driven by changing federal and city policies, including fierce crime fighting and a concerted effort to develop the retail corridor on 125th Street. The number of housing units in Harlem increased by 14% between 1990 and 2000, and the rate of increase has been much more rapid in recent years. Property values in Central Harlem increased nearly 300% during the 1990s, while the rest of New York City saw only a 12% increase. Even empty shells of buildings in the neighborhood were routinely selling for nearly $1,000,000 each as of 2007.\n\nIn January 2010, \"The New York Times\" reported that in \"Greater Harlem\", which they defined as running from the East River to the Hudson River, from 96th Street to 155th Street, blacks ceased to be a majority of the population in 1998, with the change largely attributable to the rapid arrival of new white and Hispanic residents. The paper reported that the population of the area had grown more since 2000 than in any decade since the 1940s. Median housing prices dropped farther in Harlem than in the rest of Manhattan during the real estate crash of 2008, but recovered more rapidly as well.\n\nThe neighborhood's changes have provoked some discontent. James David Manning, pastor of the ATLAH World Missionary Church on Lenox Avenue, has received press for declaring a boycott on all Harlem shops, restaurants, other businesses, and churches other than his own. He believes that this will cause an economic crash that will drive out white residents and drop property values to a level his supporters can afford. There have been rallies against gentrification.\n\nOn March 12, 2014, two buildings in East Harlem were destroyed in a gas explosion.\n\n",
                "Harlem\n\nHarlem is a large neighborhood in the northern section of the New York City borough of Manhattan. Since the 1920s, Harlem has been known as a major African American residential, cultural and business center. Originally a Dutch village, formally organized in 1658, it is named after the city of Haarlem in the Netherlands. Harlem's history has been defined by a series of economic boom-and-bust cycles, with significant population shifts accompanying each cycle.\n\nFollowing the Civil War, poor Jews and poor Italians were the predominant demographic in Harlem. African-American residents began to arrive in large numbers in 1905 as part of the Great Migration. In the 1920s and 1930s, Central and West Harlem were the focus of the \"Harlem Renaissance\", an outpouring of artistic work without precedent in the American black community. However, with job losses in the time of the Great Depression and the deindustrialization of New York City after World War II, rates of crime and poverty increased significantly. Harlem's African-American population peaked in the 1950s. In the second half of the 20th century, Harlem became a major hub of African-American businesses. In 2008, the United States Census found that for the first time since the 1930s, less than half of the residents were black, comprising only 40% of the population.\n\nSince New York City's revival in the late 20th century, Harlem has been experiencing the effects of gentrification and new wealth.\n\nHarlem is located in Upper Manhattan, often referred to as Uptown by locals. It stretches from the Harlem River and East River in the east, to the Hudson River to the west; and between 155th Street in the north, where it meets Washington Heights, and an uneven boundary along the south that runs along either 96th Street east of Fifth Avenue or 110th Street west of Fifth Avenue.\n\nCentral Harlem is bounded by Fifth Avenue on the east, Central Park on the south, Morningside Park, St. Nicholas Avenue and Edgecombe Avenue on the west, and the Harlem River on the north. A chain of three large linear parks—Morningside Park, St. Nicholas Park and Jackie Robinson Park—are situated on steeply rising banks and form most of the district's western boundary. On the east, Fifth Avenue and Marcus Garvey Park, also known as Mount Morris Park, separate this area from East Harlem. The bulk of the area falls under Manhattan Community Board No. 10. In the late 2000s, South Harlem, emerged from area redevelopment, running along Frederick Douglass Boulevard from West 110th to West 138th Streets.\n\nThe West Harlem neighborhoods of Manhattanville and Hamilton Heights comprise part of Manhattan Community Board No. 9. The two neighborhoods' area is bounded by Cathedral Parkway (110th Street) on the South; 155th Street on the North; Manhattan/Morningside Ave/St. Nicholas/Bradhurst/Edgecome Avenues on the East; and Riverside Park/the Hudson River on the west. Manhattanville begins at roughly 123rd Street and extends northward to 135th Street. The northern most section of West Harlem is Hamilton Heights.\n\nEast Harlem, also called Spanish Harlem, within Manhattan Community Board 11, is bounded by East 96th Street on the south, East 142nd Street on the north, Fifth Avenue on the west, and the Harlem River on the east.\n\nThe New York City Police Department patrols six precincts located within Harlem. The areas of West Harlem are served by the 30th Precinct, and the 26th Precinct, the areas of Central Harlem are served by the 28th and 32nd Precincts, and the areas of East Harlem are served by the 23rd and 25th Precincts.\n\nThe New York City Fire Department operates 9 firehouses in Harlem, organized into 2 Battalions. The following fire companies are quartered in Harlem: Engine 35, Engine 37, Engine 47, Engine 58, Engine 59, Engine 69, Engine 80, Engine 84, Engine 91, Ladder 14, Ladder 23, Ladder 26, Ladder 28, Ladder 30, Ladder 34, Ladder 40, and the Chiefs of the 12th and 16th Battalions.\n\nHarlem is represented by New York's 13th congressional district, the New York State Senate's 30th district, the New York State Assembly's 68th and 70th districts, and the New York City Council's 7th, 8th, and 9th districts.\n\nBefore the arrival of European settlers, the area that would become Harlem (originally Haarlem) was inhabited by the Manhattans, a native tribe, who along with other Native Americans, most likely Lenape occupied the area on a semi-nomadic basis. As many as several hundred farmed the Harlem flatlands. Between 1637 and 1639, a few settlements were established. During the American Revolution, the British burned Harlem to the ground. It took a long time to rebuild, as Harlem grew more slowly than the rest of Manhattan during the late 18th century. After the American Civil War, Harlem experienced an economic boom starting in 1868. The neighborhood continued to serve as a refuge for New Yorkers, but increasingly those coming north were poor and Jewish or Italian. The New York and Harlem Railroad, as well as the Interborough Rapid Transit and elevated railway lines, helped Harlem's economic growth, as they connected Harlem to lower and midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe Jewish and Italian demographic decreased, while the black and Puerto Rican population increased in this time. The early 20th-century Great Migration of blacks to northern industrial cities was fueled by their desire to leave behind the Jim Crow South, seek better jobs and education for their children, and escape a culture of lynching violence; during World War I, expanding industries recruited black laborers to fill new jobs, thinly staffed after the draft began to take young men. In 1910, Central Harlem was about 10% black. By 1930, it had reached 70%. Starting around the time of the end of World War I, Harlem became associated with the New Negro movement, and then the artistic outpouring known as the Harlem Renaissance, which extended to poetry, novels, theater, and the visual arts. So many blacks came that it \"threaten[ed] the very existence of some of the leading industries of Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Alabama.\" Many settled in Harlem. By 1920, central Harlem was 32.43% black. The 1930 census revealed that 70.18% of Central Harlem's residents were black and lived as far south as Central Park, at 110th Street.\n\nHowever, by the 1930s, the neighborhood was hit hard by job losses in the Great Depression. In the early 1930s, 25% of Harlemites were out of work, and employment prospects for Harlemites stayed bad for decades. Employment among black New Yorkers fell as some traditionally black businesses, including domestic service and some types of manual labor, were taken over by other ethnic groups. Major industries left New York City altogether, especially after 1950. Several riots happened in this period, including in 1935 and 1943.\n\nThere were major changes following World War II. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Harlem was the scene of a series of rent strikes by neighborhood tenants, led by local activist Jesse Gray, together with the Congress of Racial Equality, Harlem Youth Opportunities Unlimited (HARYOU), and other groups. These groups wanted the city to force landlords to improve the quality of housing by bringing them up to code, to take action against rats and roaches, to provide heat during the winter, and to keep prices in line with existing rent control regulations. The largest public works projects in Harlem in these years were public housing, with the largest concentration built in East Harlem. Typically, existing structures were torn down and replaced with city-designed and managed properties that would, in theory, present a safer and more pleasant environment than those available from private landlords. Ultimately, community objections halted the construction of new projects. From the mid-20th century, the low quality of education in Harlem has been a source of distress. In the 1960s, about 75% of Harlem students tested under grade levels in reading skills, and 80% tested under grade level in math. In 1964, residents of Harlem staged two school boycotts to call attention to the problem. In central Harlem, 92% of students stayed home. In the post-World War II era, Harlem ceased to be home to a majority of the city's blacks, but it remained the cultural and political capital of black New York, and possibly black America.\n\nBy the 1970s, many of those Harlemites who were able to escape from poverty left the neighborhood in search of safer streets, better schools and homes. Those who remained were the poorest and least skilled, with the fewest opportunities for success. Though the federal government's Model Cities Program spent $100 million on job training, health care, education, public safety, sanitation, housing, and other projects over a ten-year period, Harlem showed no improvement. The city began auctioning its enormous portfolio of Harlem properties to the public in 1985. This was intended to improve the community by placing property in the hands of people who would live in them and maintain them. In many cases, the city would even pay to completely renovate a property before selling it (by lottery) below market value.\n\nAfter the 1990s, Harlem began to grow again. Between 1990 and 2006 the neighborhood's population grew by 16.9%, with the percentage of blacks decreasing from 87.6% to 69.3%, then dropping to 54.4% by 2010, and the percentage of whites increasing from 1.5% to 6.6% by 2006, and to \"almost 10%\" by 2010. A renovation of 125th Street and new properties along the thoroughfare also helped to revitalize Harlem.\n\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, Central and West Harlem was the focus of the \"Harlem Renaissance\", an outpouring of artistic work without precedent in the American Black community. Though Harlem musicians and writers are particularly well remembered, the community has also hosted numerous actors and theater companies, including the New Heritage Repertory Theater, National Black Theater, Lafayette Players, Harlem Suitcase Theater, The Negro Playwrights, American Negro Theater, and the Rose McClendon Players.\n\nThe Apollo Theater opened on 125th Street on January 26, 1934, in a former burlesque house. The Savoy Ballroom, on Lenox Avenue, was a renowned venue for swing dancing, and was immortalized in a popular song of the era, \"Stompin' At The Savoy\". In the 1920s and 1930s, between Lenox and Seventh Avenues in central Harlem, over 125 entertainment places operated, including speakeasies, cellars, lounges, cafes, taverns, supper clubs, rib joints, theaters, dance halls, and bars and grills. 133rd Street, known as \"Swing Street\", became known for its cabarets, speakeasies and jazz scene during the Prohibition era, and was dubbed \"Jungle Alley\" because of \"inter-racial mingling\" on the street. Some jazz venues, including the Cotton Club, where Duke Ellington played, and Connie's Inn, were restricted to whites only. Others were integrated, including the Renaissance Ballroom and the Savoy Ballroom.\n\nIn 1936, Orson Welles produced his black \"Macbeth\" at the Lafayette Theater in Harlem. Grand theaters from the late 19th and early 20th centuries were torn down or converted to churches. Harlem lacked any permanent performance space until the creation of the Gatehouse Theater in an old Croton aqueduct building on 135th Street in 2006.\n\nFrom 1965 until 2007, the community was home to the Harlem Boys Choir, a touring choir and education program for young boys, most of whom are black. The Girls Choir of Harlem was founded in 1989, and closed with the Boys Choir.\n\nHarlem is also home to the largest African American Day Parade which celebrates the culture of African diaspora in America. The parade was started up in the spring of 1969 with Congressman Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. as the Grand Marshal of the first celebration.\n\nArthur Mitchell, a former dancer with the New York City Ballet, established Dance Theatre of Harlem as a school and company of classical ballet and theater training in the late 1960s. The company has toured nationally and internationally. Generations of theater artists have gotten a start at the school.\n\nManhattan's contributions to hip-hop stems largely from artists with Harlem roots such as Big L, Kurtis Blow and Immortal Technique. Harlem is also the birthplace of popular hip-hop dances such as the Harlem shake, toe wop, and Chicken Noodle Soup.\n\nHarlem is currently experiencing a gourmet renaissance with new dining hotspots popping up uptown around Frederick Douglass Boulevard. At the same time, some residents are fighting back against the powerful waves of gentrification the neighborhood is experiencing. On October 17, 2013, residents staged a sidewalk sit-in to protest a five-days-a-week farmers market that would shut down Macombs Place at 150th Street.\n\nReligious life has historically had a strong presence in Black Harlem. The area is home to over 400 churches. Major Christian denominations include Baptists, Pentecostals, Methodists (generally African Methodist Episcopalian, or \"AME\"), Episcopalians, and Roman Catholic. The Abyssinian Baptist Church has long been influential because of its large congregation, and recently wealthy on account of its extensive real estate holdings. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints built a chapel on 128th Street in 2005. Previously the Church had had a branch meeting around the corner in a former Jehovah's Witnesses Kingdom Hall. As of 2015 there are 3 LDS Wards meeting at the Harlem Chapel.\n\nMany of the area's churches are \"storefront churches\", which operate in an empty store, or a basement, or a converted brownstone townhouse. These congregations may have fewer than 30–50 members each, but there are hundreds of them. Others are old, large, and designated landmarks. Especially in the years before World War II, Harlem produced popular Christian charismatic \"cult\" leaders, including George Wilson Becton and Father Divine.\nMosques in Harlem include the Malcolm Shabazz Mosque No. 7 (formerly Mosque No. 7 Nation of Islam, and the location of the 1972 Harlem Mosque incident), the Mosque of Islamic Brotherhood and Masjid Aqsa. Judaism, too, maintains a presence in Harlem through the Old Broadway Synagogue. A non-mainstream synagogue of Black Hebrews known as Commandment Keepers, was based in a synagogue at 1 West 123rd Street until 2008.\n\nMany places in Harlem are New York City Landmarks, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, or are otherwise prominent:\n\nLike most neighborhoods in New York, the demographics of Harlem's communities have changed rapidly throughout the history of New York.\n\nIn 1910, 10% of Harlem's population was black but by 1930, they had become a 70% majority. The period between 1910 and 1930 marks a huge point in the great migration of African Americans from the South to New York. This point also marks an influx from downtown Manhattan neighborhoods where blacks were feeling less welcome, to the Harlem area. The black population in Harlem peaked in 1950 with a 98% share of the population (population 233,000).\n\nAs of 2000, Central Harlem had a black community comprising 77% of the population; however, the black population is declining as many African Americans moved out as more and more immigrants began to move in. Central Harlem is the most famous section of Harlem and thus is commonly referred to simply as Harlem. Central Harlem is home to the famous Apollo Theater.\n\nIn 2010, the population of Central Harlem was at 115,000 according to a regional census. Central Harlem is home to the Mount Morris Park neighborhood.\n\nIn 2010, the population of West Harlem was at 110,193 according to a regional census.\n\nWest Harlem, consisting of Morningside Heights, Manhattanville, and Hamilton Heights, as a whole is predominately Hispanic. African Americans make up about a quarter of the West Harlem population. However, Morningside Heights has a large number of White Americans. Morningside Heights is known as the \"Academic Acropolis of New York\". Educational institutions in the neighborhood include City College of New York, Columbia University, Barnard College, and New York Theological Seminary.\n\nIn 2010, the population of East Harlem was at 120,000.\n\nEast Harlem originally formed as a predominantly Italian American neighborhood, but its demographics have changed over the years. and it is now known as a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood. Italian Harlem formed when Southern Italian immigration began in the late 19th century. Italian Harlem is notable as the founding location of the Genovese crime family, one of the Five Families that dominated Italian organized crime in New York City as part of the Mafia (or \"Cosa Nostra\").\n\nThe area began its transition from Italian Harlem to Spanish Harlem when Puerto Rican migration began after World War II. This community of stateside Puerto Ricans is notable for its contributions to Salsa music. In recent decades, many Mexican and Salvadoran immigrants have also settled in East Harlem. East Harlem is also known as El Barrio and today is predominantly Hispanic, though with a significant Black presence. The area suffers from the highest violent crime rate in Manhattan.\n\nHarlem suffers from unemployment rates generally more than twice as high than the New York average and high mortality rates as well. In both cases, the numbers for men have been consistently worse than the numbers for women. Unemployment and poverty in the neighborhood resisted private and governmental initiatives to ameliorate them. During the Great Depression, unemployment in Harlem went past 20% and people were being evicted from their homes. In the 1960s, uneducated blacks could find jobs more easily than educated ones could, confounding efforts to improve the lives of people who lived in the neighborhood through education. Land owners took advantage of the neighborhood and offered apartments to the lower-class families for cheaper rent but in lower class conditions. As of 1999, 179,000 housing units were available for the citizens of Harlem. Housing activists in Harlem state that, even after residents were given vouchers for the Section 8 housing that was being placed, many were not able to live there and had to find homes elsewhere or become homeless. Infant mortality was 124 per thousand in 1928 (12.4%) . By 1940, infant mortality in Harlem was 5% (one infant in 20 would die), and the death rate from disease generally was twice that of the rest of New York. Tuberculosis was the main killer, and four times as prevalent among Harlem citizens than among the rest of New York's population.\n\nA 1990 study of life expectancy of teenagers in Harlem reported that 15-year-old girls in Harlem had a 65% chance of surviving to age 65, about the same as women in India. Fifteen-year-old men in Harlem, on the other hand, had a 37% chance of surviving to age 65, about the same as men in Angola. Infectious diseases and diseases of the circulatory system were to blame, with a variety of contributing factors, including consumption of the deep-fried foods traditional to the South, which may contribute to heart disease.\n\nIn the early 20th century, Harlem was a stronghold of the Italian Mafia. As the ethnic composition of the neighborhood changed, black criminals began to organize themselves similarly. However, rather than compete with the established mobs, gangs concentrated on the \"policy racket\", also called the numbers game, or \"bolita\" in East Harlem. This was a gambling scheme similar to a lottery that could be played, illegally, from countless locations around Harlem. According to Francis Ianni, \"By 1925 there were thirty black policy banks in Harlem, several of them large enough to collect bets in an area of twenty city blocks and across three or four avenues.\"\n\nBy the early 1950s, the total money at play amounted to billions of dollars, and the police force had been thoroughly corrupted by bribes from numbers bosses. These bosses became financial powerhouses, providing capital for loans for those who could not qualify for them from traditional financial institutions, and investing in legitimate businesses and real estate. One of the powerful early numbers bosses was a woman, Madame Stephanie St. Clair, who fought gun battles with mobster Dutch Schultz over control of the lucrative trade.\n\nThe popularity of playing the numbers waned with the introduction of the state lottery, which is legal but has lower payouts and has taxes collected on winnings. The practice continues on a smaller scale among those who prefer the numbers tradition or who prefer to trust their local numbers bank to the state.\n\nStatistics from 1940 show about 100 murders per year in Harlem, \"but rape is very rare\". By 1950, essentially all of the whites had left Harlem and by 1960, much of the black middle class had departed. At the same time, control of organized crime shifted from Italian syndicates to local black, Puerto Rican, and Cuban groups that were somewhat less formally organized. At the time of the 1964 riots, the drug addiction rate in Harlem was ten times higher than the New York City average, and twelve times higher than the United States as a whole. Of the 30,000 drug addicts then estimated to live in New York City, 15,000 to 20,000 lived in Harlem. Property crime was pervasive, and the murder rate was six times higher than New York's average. Half of the children in Harlem grew up with one parent, or none, and lack of supervision contributed to juvenile delinquency; between 1953 and 1962, the crime rate among young people increased throughout New York City, but was consistently 50% higher in Harlem than in New York City as a whole.\n\nInjecting heroin grew in popularity in Harlem through the 1950s and 1960s, though the use of this drug then leveled off. In the 1980s, use of crack cocaine became widespread, which produced collateral crime as addicts stole to finance their purchasing of additional drugs, and as dealers fought for the right to sell in particular regions, or over deals gone bad.\n\nWith the end of the \"crack wars\" in the mid-1990s and with the initiation of aggressive policing under mayors David Dinkins and subsequently Rudolph Giuliani, crime in Harlem plummeted. In 1981, 6,500 robberies were reported in Harlem; robberies dropped to 4,800 in 1990 during David Dinkins' mayoralty. By 2000, only 1,700 robberies were reported, and by 2010, only 1,100 were reported. There have been similar changes in all categories of crimes tracked by the New York City Police Department. In the 32nd Precinct, which services Central Harlem above 127th Street, for example, between 1990 and 2013, the murder rate dropped 89.4%, the rape rate dropped 67.5%, the robbery rate dropped 74.2%, burglary dropped 93.4%, and the total number of crime complaints dropped 77.6%.\n\nIn 1977, Isiah Robinson, president of the New York City Board of Education, was quoted as saying that \"the quality of education in Harlem has degenerated to the level of a custodial service.\" Currently the New York City Department of Education operates district public schools.\n\n, Harlem was the heart of the charter schools movement in Manhattan; of the 25 charter schools operating in Manhattan, 18 were in Harlem. In 2010, about one age-eligible Harlem child in five was enrolled in charter schools.\n\nThe New York Public Library operates the Harlem Branch Library at 9 West 124th Street, the George Bruce Library at 518 West 125th Street, the 115th Street Branch Library at 203 West 115th Street, and the 125th Street Branch Library at 224 East 125th Street, near Third Avenue.\n\nThe CUNY Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, New York College of Podiatric Medicine, City College of New York, and Touro College of Osteopathic Medicine, are all located in Harlem.\n\nThe Harlem River separates the Bronx and Manhattan, necessitating several spans between the two New York City boroughs. In East Harlem, the Wards Island Bridge, also known as the 103rd Street Footbridge, connects Manhattan with Wards Island. The Triboro Bridge is a complex of three separate bridges that offers connections between Queens, Manhattan (Harlem), and the Bronx.\n\nPublic transportation service is provided by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. This includes the New York City Subway and MTA Regional Bus Operations, as well as a Metro-North commuter rail stop at East 125th Street, connecting Westchester County with New York City. Some Bronx local routes also serve Manhattan, to provide customers with access between both boroughs.\n\nSubway routes include:\n\n\nBus routes include:\n\n\n\n\n"

                "Dog\n\nThe domestic dog (\"Canis lupus familiaris\" or \"Canis familiaris\") is a member of the genus \"Canis\" (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated, which implies that the direct ancestor of the dog is extinct. The dog was the first species to be domesticated and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.\n\nTheir long association with humans has led dogs to be uniquely attuned to human behavior and they are able to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canid species. New research seems to show that dogs have mutations to equivalent genetic regions in humans where changes are known to trigger high sociability and somewhat reduced intelligence. Dogs vary widely in shape, size and colors. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals and therapeutic roles. This influence on human society has given them the sobriquet \"man's best friend\".\n\nThe term \"domestic dog\" is generally used for both domesticated and feral varieties. The English word \"dog\" comes from Middle English \"dogge\", from Old English \"docga\", a \"powerful dog breed\". The term may possibly derive from Proto-Germanic \"*dukkōn\", represented in Old English \"finger-docce\" (\"finger-muscle\"). The word also shows the familiar petname diminutive \"-ga\" also seen in \"frogga\" \"frog\", \"picga\" \"pig\", \"stagga\" \"stag\", \"wicga\" \"beetle, worm\", among others. Piotr Gąsiorowski has suggested that Old English \"*docga\" is actually derived from Old English colour adjective \"dox\".\n\nIn 14th-century England, \"hound\" (from ) was the general word for all domestic canines, and \"dog\" referred to a subtype of hound, a group including the mastiff. It is believed this \"dog\" type was so common, it eventually became the prototype of the category \"hound\". By the 16th century, \"dog\" had become the general word, and \"hound\" had begun to refer only to types used for hunting. The word \"hound\" is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European word \"*kwon-\", \"dog\". This semantic shift may be compared with in German, where the corresponding words \"Dogge\" and \"Hund\" kept their original meanings. The term \"*ḱwon-\" may ultimately derive from the earliest layer of Proto-Indo-European vocabulary.\n\nA male canine is referred to as a \"dog\", while a female is traditionally called a \"bitch\" (derived from Middle English \"bicche\", from Old English \"bicce\", ultimately from Old Norse \"bikkja\". Since the word \"bitch\" has taken on derogatory connotations, nowadays it is less commonly used to refer to dogs). The father of a litter is called the \"sire\", and the mother is called the \"dam\". The process of birth is \"whelping\", from the Old English word \"hwelp\"; the modern English word \"whelp\" is an alternative term for puppy. A litter refers to the multiple offspring at one birth which are called puppies or pups from the French \"poupée\", \"doll\", which has mostly replaced the older term \"whelp\".\n\n\nIn 1758, the taxonomist Linnaeus published in his \"Systema Naturae\" the classification of species. \"Canis\" is a Latin word meaning dog, and under this genus he listed the dog-like carnivores including domestic dogs, wolves, and jackals. He classified the domestic dog as \"Canis familiaris\" (Linnaeus, 1758) and on the next page as a separate species he classified the wolf as \"Canis lupus\" (Linnaeus, 1758). In 1926, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) ruled in Opinion 91 that the domestic dog \"Canis familiaris\" (Linnaeus, 1758) be placed on its official list. In 1957, the ICZN ruled in Opinion 451 that \"Canis dingo\" (Meyer, 1793) was the name to be used for the dingo and that this be placed on its official list. These are the scientific names for the dog and dingo that appear on the \"Official Lists and Indexes of Names in Zoology\" of the ICZN.\n\nIn 1978, a review to minimize the number species listed under genus \"Canis\" proposed that \"\"Canis dingo\" is now generally regarded as a distinctive feral domestic dog. \"Canis familiaris\" is used for domestic dogs, although taxonomically it should probably be synonymous with \"Canis lupus.\"\" In 1982, the first edition of Mammal Species of the World included a note under \"Canis lupus\" with the comment: \"Probably ancestor of and conspecific with the domestic dog, \"familiaris\". \"Canis familiaris\" has page priority over \"Canis lupus\", but both were published simultaneously in Linnaeus (1758), and \"Canis lupus\" has been universally used for this species\". In the same year, an application was made to the ICZN to reclassify the dingo to \"Canis lupus dingo\" because it was proposed that the wolf (\"Canis lupus\") was the ancestor of dogs and dingoes, however the application was rejected.\n\nIn 2003, the ICZN ruled in its Opinion 2027 that the \"name of a wild species...is not invalid by virtue of being predated by the name based on a domestic form.\" Additionally, the ICZN placed the taxon \"Canis lupus\" as a conserved name on the official list under this opinion. In the third edition of \"Mammal Species of the World\" published in 2005, the mammalogist W. Christopher Wozencraft listed under the wolf \"Canis lupus\" what he proposed to be two subspecies: \"\"familiaris\" Linneaus, 1758 [domestic dog]\" and \"\"dingo\" Meyer, 1793 [domestic dog]\", with the comment \"Includes the domestic dog as a subspecies, with the dingo provisionally separate – artificial variants created by domestication and selective breeding. Although this may stretch the subspecies concept, it retains the correct allocation of synonyms.\" Although the earliest use of the name \"dingo\" was \"Canis familiaris dingo\" (Blumenbach, 1780), Wozencraft attributed it to Meyer from 1793 without comment.\n\nThis classification by Wozencraft is hotly debated by zoologists. Mathew Crowther, Stephen Jackson and Colin Groves disagree with Wozencraft and argue that based on ICZN Opinion 2027, the implication is that a domestic animal cannot be a subspecies. Crowther, Juliet Clutton-Brock and others argue that because the dingo differs from wolves by behavior, morphology, and that the dingo and dog do not fall genetically within any extant wolf clade, that the dingo should be considered the distinct taxon \"Canis dingo\". Jackson and Groves regard the dog \"Canis familiaris\" as a taxonomic synonym for the wolf \"Canis lupus\" with them both equally ranked at the species level. They also disagree with Crowther, based on the overlap between dogs and dingoes in their morphology, in their ability to easily hybridize with each other, and that they show the signs of domestication by both having a cranium of smaller capacity than their progenitor, the wolf. Given that \"Canis familiaris\" (Linnaeus, 1758) has date priority over \"Canis dingo\" (Meyer, 1793), they regard the dingo as a junior taxonomic synonym for the dog \"Canis familiaris\". Gheorghe Benga and others support the dingo as a subspecies of the dog from the earlier \"Canis familiaris dingo\" (Blumenbach, 1780). Xiaoming Wang and Richard H. Tedford proposed that the dog should be classified as \"Canis lupus familiaris\" under the Biological Species Concept and \"Canis familiaris\" under the Evolutionary Species Concept.\n\nThe origin of the domestic dog is not clear. It is known that the dog was the first domesticated species. The domestic dog is a member of the genus \"Canis\" (canines), which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The closest living relative of the dog is the gray wolf and there is no evidence of any other canine contributing to its genetic lineage. The dog and the extant gray wolf form two sister clades, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700 years ago, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago. These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human hunter-gatherers and not agriculturists.\n\nWhere the genetic divergence of dog and wolf took place remains controversial, with the most plausible proposals spanning Western Europe, Central Asia, and East Asia. This has been made more complicated by the most recent proposal that fits the available evidence, which is that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian wolves, these were then domesticated independently before going extinct into two distinct dog populations between 14,000-6,400 years ago, and then the Western Eurasian dog population was partially and gradually replaced by East Asian dogs that were brought by humans at least 6,400 years ago.\n\nDomestic dogs have been selectively bred for millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. Modern dog breeds show more variation in size, appearance, and behavior than any other domestic animal. Dogs are predators and scavengers, and like many other predatory mammals, the dog has powerful muscles, fused wrist bones, a cardiovascular system that supports both sprinting and endurance, and teeth for catching and tearing.\n\nDogs are highly variable in height and weight. The smallest known adult dog was a Yorkshire Terrier, that stood only at the shoulder, in length along the head-and-body, and weighed only . The largest known dog was an English Mastiff which weighed and was from the snout to the tail. The tallest dog is a Great Dane that stands at the shoulder.\n\nThe dog's senses include vision, hearing, sense of smell, sense of taste, touch and sensitivity to the earth's magnetic field. Another study suggested that dogs can see the earth's magnetic field.\n\nThe coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: \"double\" being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or \"single\", with the topcoat only.\n\nDomestic dogs often display the remnants of countershading, a common natural camouflage pattern. A countershaded animal will have dark coloring on its upper surfaces and light coloring below, which reduces its general visibility. Thus, many breeds will have an occasional \"blaze\", stripe, or \"star\" of white fur on their chest or underside.\n\nRegarding coat appearance or health, the coat can be maintained or affected by multiple nutrients present in the diet, see Coat (dog) for more information.\n\nThere are many different shapes for dog tails: straight, straight up, sickle, curled, or cork-screw. As with many canids, one of the primary functions of a dog's tail is to communicate their emotional state, which can be important in getting along with others. In some hunting dogs, however, the tail is traditionally docked to avoid injuries. In some breeds, such as the Braque du Bourbonnais, puppies can be born with a short tail or no tail at all.\n\nDespite their close genetic relationship and the ability to inter-breed, there are a number of diagnostic features to distinguish the gray wolves from domestic dogs. Domesticated dogs are clearly distinguishable from wolves by starch gel electrophoresis of red blood cell acid phosphatase. The tympanic bullae are large, convex and almost spherical in gray wolves, while the bullae of dogs are smaller, compressed and slightly crumpled. Compared with equally sized wolves, dogs tend to have 20% smaller skulls and 30% smaller brains. The teeth of gray wolves are also proportionately larger than those of dogs. Dogs have a more domed forehead and a distinctive \"stop\" between forehead and nose. The temporalis muscle that closes the jaws is more robust in wolves. Wolves do not have dewclaws on their back legs, unless there has been admixture with dogs that had them. Most dogs lack a functioning pre-caudal gland and enter estrus twice yearly, unlike gray wolves which only do so once a year. So-called primitive dogs such as Dingoes and Basenjis retain the yearly estrus cycle. Dogs generally have brown eyes and wolves almost always have amber or light colored eyes. The skin of domestic dogs tends to be thicker than that of wolves, with some Inuit tribes favoring the former for use as clothing due to its greater resistance to wear and tear in harsh weather. The paws of a dog are half the size of those of a wolf, and their tails tend to curl upwards, another trait not found in wolves The dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal. For example, height measured to the withers ranges from a in the Chihuahua to in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called \"blue\") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (\"red\" or \"chocolate\") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth. It is common for most breeds to shed their coat.\n\nThere are many household plants that are poisonous to dogs including begonia, Poinsettia and aloe vera.\n\nSome breeds of dogs are prone to certain genetic ailments such as elbow and hip dysplasia, blindness, deafness, pulmonic stenosis, cleft palate, and trick knees. Two serious medical conditions particularly affecting dogs are pyometra, affecting unspayed females of all types and ages, and gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat), which affects the larger breeds or deep-chested dogs. Both of these are acute conditions, and can kill rapidly. Dogs are also susceptible to parasites such as fleas, ticks, and mites, as well as hookworms, tapeworms, roundworms, and heartworms.\n\nA number of common human foods and household ingestibles are toxic to dogs, including chocolate solids (theobromine poisoning), onion and garlic (thiosulphate, sulfoxide or disulfide poisoning), grapes and raisins, macadamia nuts, xylitol, as well as various plants and other potentially ingested materials. The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous. Dogs can be exposed to the substance by scavenging garbage or ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death. Dogs are highly susceptible to theobromine poisoning, typically from ingestion of chocolate. Theobromine is toxic to dogs because, although the dog's metabolism is capable of breaking down the chemical, the process is so slow that even small amounts of chocolate can be fatal, especially dark chocolate.\n\nDogs are also vulnerable to some of the same health conditions as humans, including diabetes, dental and heart disease, epilepsy, cancer, hypothyroidism, and arthritis.\n\nIn 2013, a study found that mixed breeds live on average 1.2 years longer than pure breeds, and that increasing body-weight was negatively correlated with longevity (i.e. the heavier the dog the shorter its lifespan).\n\nThe typical lifespan of dogs varies widely among breeds, but for most the median longevity, the age at which half the dogs in a population have died and half are still alive, ranges from 10 to 13 years. Individual dogs may live well beyond the median of their breed.\n\nThe breed with the shortest lifespan (among breeds for which there is a questionnaire survey with a reasonable sample size) is the Dogue de Bordeaux, with a median longevity of about 5.2 years, but several breeds, including Miniature Bull Terriers, Bloodhounds, and Irish Wolfhounds are nearly as short-lived, with median longevities of 6 to 7 years.\n\nThe longest-lived breeds, including Toy Poodles, Japanese Spitz, Border Terriers, and Tibetan Spaniels, have median longevities of 14 to 15 years. The median longevity of mixed-breed dogs, taken as an average of all sizes, is one or more years longer than that of purebred dogs when all breeds are averaged. The dog widely reported to be the longest-lived is \"Bluey\", who died in 1939 and was claimed to be 29.5 years old at the time of his death. On 5 December 2011, Pusuke, the world's oldest living dog recognized by Guinness Book of World Records, died aged 26 years and 9 months.\n\nIn domestic dogs, sexual maturity begins to happen around age six to twelve months for both males and females, although this can be delayed until up to two years old for some large breeds. This is the time at which female dogs will have their first estrous cycle. They will experience subsequent estrous cycles semiannually, during which the body prepares for pregnancy. At the peak of the cycle, females will come into estrus, being mentally and physically receptive to copulation. Because the ova survive and are capable of being fertilized for a week after ovulation, it is possible for a female to mate with more than one male.\n\nFertilization typically occurs 2–5 days after ovulation; 14–16 days after ovulation, the embryo attaches to the uterus, and after 7-8 more days the heart beat is detectable.\n\nDogs bear their litters roughly 58 to 68 days after fertilization, with an average of 63 days, although the length of gestation can vary. An average litter consists of about six puppies, though this number may vary widely based on the breed of dog. In general, toy dogs produce from one to four puppies in each litter, while much larger breeds may average as many as twelve.\n\nSome dog breeds have acquired traits through selective breeding that interfere with reproduction. Male French Bulldogs, for instance, are incapable of mounting the female. For many dogs of this breed, the female must be artificially inseminated in order to reproduce.\n\nNeutering refers to the sterilization of animals, usually by removal of the male's testicles or the female's ovaries and uterus, in order to eliminate the ability to procreate and reduce sex drive. Because of the overpopulation of dogs in some countries, many animal control agencies, such as the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), advise that dogs not intended for further breeding should be neutered, so that they do not have undesired puppies that may have to later be euthanized.\n\nAccording to the Humane Society of the United States, 3–4 million dogs and cats are put down each year in the United States and many more are confined to cages in shelters because there are many more animals than there are homes. Spaying or castrating dogs helps keep overpopulation down. Local humane societies, SPCAs, and other animal protection organizations urge people to neuter their pets and to adopt animals from shelters instead of purchasing them.\n\nNeutering reduces problems caused by hypersexuality, especially in male dogs. Spayed female dogs are less likely to develop some forms of cancer, affecting mammary glands, ovaries, and other reproductive organs. However, neutering increases the risk of urinary incontinence in female dogs, and prostate cancer in males, as well as osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, cruciate ligament rupture, obesity, and diabetes mellitus in either sex.\n\nA common breeding practice for pet dogs is mating between close relatives (e.g. between half- and full siblings). In a study of seven different French breeds of dogs (Bernese mountain dog, basset hound, Cairn terrier, Epagneul Breton, German Shepherd dog, Leonberger, and West Highland white terrier) it was found that inbreeding decreases litter size and survival. Another analysis of data on 42,855 dachshund litters, found that as the inbreeding coefficient increased, litter size decreased and the percentage of stillborn puppies increased, thus indicating inbreeding depression.\n\nAbout 22% of boxer puppies die before reaching 7 weeks of age. Stillbirth is the most frequent cause of death, followed by infection. Mortality due to infection was found to increase significantly with increases in inbreeding. Inbreeding depression is considered to be due largely to the expression of homozygous deleterious recessive mutations. Outcrossing between unrelated individuals, including dogs of different breeds, results in the beneficial masking of deleterious recessive mutations in progeny.\n\nDog intelligence is the ability of the dog to perceive information and retain it as knowledge for applying to solve problems. Dogs have been shown to learn by inference. A study with Rico showed that he knew the labels of over 200 different items. He inferred the names of novel items by exclusion learning and correctly retrieved those novel items immediately and also 4 weeks after the initial exposure. Dogs have advanced memory skills. A study documented the learning and memory capabilities of a border collie, \"Chaser\", who had learned the names and could associate by verbal command over 1,000 words. Dogs are able to read and react appropriately to human body language such as gesturing and pointing, and to understand human voice commands. Dogs demonstrate a theory of mind by engaging in deception. An experimental study showed compelling evidence that Australian dingos can outperform domestic dogs in non-social problem-solving, indicating that domestic dogs may have lost much of their original problem-solving abilities once they joined humans. Another study indicated that after undergoing training to solve a simple manipulation task, dogs that are faced with an insoluble version of the same problem look at the human, while socialized wolves do not. Modern domestic dogs use humans to solve their problems for them.\n\nDog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli. As the oldest domesticated species, with estimates ranging from 9,000–30,000 years BCE, the minds of dogs inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a result of this physical and social evolution, dogs, more than any other species, have acquired the ability to understand and communicate with humans, and they are uniquely attuned to human behaviors. Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive abilities in the domestic dog. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine\nrelatives nor by other highly intelligent mammals such as great apes but rather parallel some of the social-cognitive skills of human children.\n\nUnlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. These genes have been shown to affect the catecholamine synthesis pathway, with the majority of the genes affecting the fight-or-flight response (i.e. selection for tameness), and emotional processing. Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared with wolves. Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation. Traits of high sociability and lack of fear in dogs may include genetic modifications related to Williams-Beuren syndrome in humans, which cause hypersociability at the expense of problem solving ability.\n\nDog communication is about how dogs \"speak\" to each other, how they understand messages that humans send to them, and how humans can translate the ideas that dogs are trying to transmit. These communication behaviors include eye gaze, facial expression, vocalization, body posture (including movements of bodies and limbs) and gustatory communication (scents, pheromones and taste). Humans communicate with dogs by using vocalization, hand signals and body posture.\n\nThe global dog population is estimated at 900 million and rising. Although it is said that the \"dog is man's best friend\" regarding 17–24% of dogs in developed countries, in the developing world they are feral, village or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon. Most of these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond aggressively. (11%). Little is known about these dogs, or the dogs in developed countries that are feral, stray or are in shelters, as the majority of modern research on dog cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes.\n\nBeing the most abundant and widely distributed terrestrial carnivores, feral and free-ranging dogs have the greatest potential to compete with other carnivores. A review of the studies in the competitive effects of dogs on sympatric carnivores did not mention any research on competition between dogs and wolves. Competition would favor the wolf as it is known to kill dogs, however wolves tend to live in pairs or in small packs in areas where they are highly persecuted, giving them a disadvantage facing large dog groups.\n\nWolves kill dogs wherever they are found together. One survey claims that in Wisconsin in 1999 more compensation had been paid for dog losses than livestock, however in Wisconsin wolves will often kill hunting dogs, perhaps because they are in the wolf's territory. Some wolf pairs have been reported to prey on dogs by having one wolf lure the dog out into heavy brush where the second animal waits in ambush. In some instances, wolves have displayed an uncharacteristic fearlessness of humans and buildings when attacking dogs, to the extent that they have to be beaten off or killed. Although the numbers of dogs killed each year are relatively low, it induces a fear of wolves entering villages and farmyards to take dogs. In many cultures, there are strong social and emotional bonds between humans and their dogs that can be seen as family members or working team members. The loss of a dog can lead to strong emotional responses with demands for more liberal wolf hunting regulations.\n\nCoyotes and big cats have also been known to attack dogs. Leopards in particular are known to have a predilection for dogs, and have been recorded to kill and consume them regardless of their size or ferocity. Tigers in Manchuria, Indochina, Indonesia, and Malaysia are reputed to kill dogs with the same vigor as leopards. Striped hyenas are major predators of stray dogs in Turkmenistan, India, and the Caucasus.\n\nThe spiked collar common on working and pet dogs is no mere ornament: it originated as a protection of the vulnerable neck of a dog from wolves, but also protects dogs from attacks by other dogs.\n\nDespite their descent from wolves and classification as Carnivora, dogs are variously described in scholarly and other writings as carnivores or omnivores. Unlike obligate carnivores, dogs can adapt to a wide-ranging diet, and are not dependent on meat-specific protein nor a very high level of protein in order to fulfill their basic dietary requirements. Dogs will healthily digest a variety of foods, including vegetables and grains, and can consume a large proportion of these in their diet, however all-meat diets are not recommended for dogs due to their lack of calcium and iron. Comparing dogs and wolves, dogs have adaptations in genes involved in starch digestion that contribute to an increased ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet.\n\nMost breeds of dog are at most a few hundred years old, having been artificially selected for particular morphologies and behaviors by people for specific functional roles. Through this selective breeding, the dog has developed into hundreds of varied breeds, and shows more behavioral and morphological variation than any other land mammal. For example, height measured to the withers ranges from in the Chihuahua to about in the Irish Wolfhound; color varies from white through grays (usually called \"blue\") to black, and browns from light (tan) to dark (\"red\" or \"chocolate\") in a wide variation of patterns; coats can be short or long, coarse-haired to wool-like, straight, curly, or smooth. It is common for most breeds to shed this coat.\n\nWhile all dogs are genetically very similar, natural selection and selective breeding have reinforced certain characteristics in certain populations of dogs, giving rise to dog types and dog breeds. Dog types are broad categories based on function, genetics, or characteristics.\nDog breeds are groups of animals that possess a set of inherited characteristics that distinguishes them from other animals within the same species. Modern dog breeds are non-scientific classifications of dogs kept by modern kennel clubs.\n\nPurebred dogs of one breed are genetically distinguishable from purebred dogs of other breeds, but the means by which kennel clubs classify dogs is unsystematic. DNA microsatellite analyses of 85 dog breeds showed they fell into four major types of dogs that were statistically distinct. These include the \"old world dogs\" (e.g., Malamute and Shar Pei), \"Mastiff\"-type (e.g., English Mastiff), \"herding\"-type (e.g., Border Collie), and \"all others\" (also called \"modern\"- or \"hunting\"-type).\n\nDomestic dogs inherited complex behaviors, such as bite inhibition, from their wolf ancestors, which would have been pack hunters with complex body language. These sophisticated forms of social cognition and communication may account for their trainability, playfulness, and ability to fit into human households and social situations, and these attributes have given dogs a relationship with humans that has enabled them to become one of the most successful species on the planet today.\n\nThe dogs' value to early human hunter-gatherers led to them quickly becoming ubiquitous across world cultures. Dogs perform many roles for people, such as hunting, herding, pulling loads, protection, assisting police and military, companionship, and, more recently, aiding handicapped individuals. This influence on human society has given them the nickname \"man's best friend\" in the Western world. In some cultures, however, dogs are also a source of meat.\n\nWolves, and their dog descendants, would have derived significant benefits from living in human camps—more safety, more reliable food, lesser caloric needs, and more chance to breed. They would have benefited from humans' upright gait that gives them larger range over which to see potential predators and prey, as well as better color vision that, at least by day, gives humans better visual discrimination. Camp dogs would also have benefited from human tool use, as in bringing down larger prey and controlling fire for a range of purposes.\nThe dogs of Thibet are twice the size of those seen in India, with large heads and hairy bodies. They are powerful animals, and are said to be able to kill a tiger. During the day they are kept chained up, and are let loose at night to guard their masters' house.\nHumans would also have derived enormous benefit from the dogs associated with their camps. For instance, dogs would have improved sanitation by cleaning up food scraps. Dogs may have provided warmth, as referred to in the Australian Aboriginal expression \"three dog night\" (an exceptionally cold night), and they would have alerted the camp to the presence of predators or strangers, using their acute hearing to provide an early warning.\n\nAnthropologists believe the most significant benefit would have been the use of dogs' robust sense of smell to assist with the hunt. The relationship between the presence of a dog and success in the hunt is often mentioned as a primary reason for the domestication of the wolf, and a 2004 study of hunter groups with and without a dog gives quantitative support to the hypothesis that the benefits of cooperative hunting was an important factor in wolf domestication.\n\nThe cohabitation of dogs and humans would have greatly improved the chances of survival for early human groups, and the domestication of dogs may have been one of the key forces that led to human success.\n\nEmigrants from Siberia that walked across the Bering land bridge into North America may have had dogs in their company, and one writer suggests that the use of sled dogs may have been critical to the success of the waves that entered North America roughly 12,000 years ago, although the earliest archaeological evidence of dog-like canids in North America dates from about 9,400 years ago. Dogs were an important part of life for the Athabascan population in North America, and were their only domesticated animal. Dogs also carried much of the load in the migration of the Apache and Navajo tribes 1,400 years ago. Use of dogs as pack animals in these cultures often persisted after the introduction of the horse to North America.\n\nIt is estimated that three-quarters of the world's dog population lives in the developing world as feral, village, or community dogs, with pet dogs uncommon.\n\n\"The most widespread form of interspecies bonding occurs between humans and dogs\" and the keeping of dogs as companions, particularly by elites, has a long history. (As a possible example, at the Natufian culture site of Ain Mallaha in Israel, dated to 12,000 BC, the remains of an elderly human and a four-to-five-month-old puppy were found buried together). However, pet dog populations grew significantly after World War II as suburbanization increased. In the 1950s and 1960s, dogs were kept outside more often than they tend to be today (using the expression \"in the doghouse\" to describe exclusion from the group signifies the distance between the doghouse and the home) and were still primarily functional, acting as a guard, children's playmate, or walking companion. From the 1980s, there have been changes in the role of the pet dog, such as the increased role of dogs in the emotional support of their human guardians. People and dogs have become increasingly integrated and implicated in each other's lives, to the point where pet dogs actively shape the way a family and home are experienced.\n\nThere have been two major trends in the changing status of pet dogs. The first has been the 'commodification' of the dog, shaping it to conform to human expectations of personality and behaviour. The second has been the broadening of the concept of the family and the home to include dogs-as-dogs within everyday routines and practices.\n\nThere are a vast range of commodity forms available to transform a pet dog into an ideal companion. The list of goods, services and places available is enormous: from dog perfumes, couture, furniture and housing, to dog groomers, therapists, trainers and caretakers, dog cafes, spas, parks and beaches, and dog hotels, airlines and cemeteries. While dog training as an organized activity can be traced back to the 18th century, in the last decades of the 20th century it became a high-profile issue as many normal dog behaviors such as barking, jumping up, digging, rolling in dung, fighting, and urine marking (which dogs do to establish territory through scent), became increasingly incompatible with the new role of a pet dog. Dog training books, classes and television programs proliferated as the process of commodifying the pet dog continued.\n\nThe majority of contemporary people with dogs describe their pet as part of the family, although some ambivalence about the relationship is evident in the popular reconceptualization of the dog–human family as a pack. A dominance model of dog–human relationships has been promoted by some dog trainers, such as on the television program \"Dog Whisperer\". However it has been disputed that \"trying to achieve status\" is characteristic of dog–human interactions. Pet dogs play an active role in family life; for example, a study of conversations in dog–human families showed how family members use the dog as a resource, talking to the dog, or talking through the dog, to mediate their interactions with each other.\n\nIncreasingly, human family members are engaging in activities centered on the perceived needs and interests of the dog, or in which the dog is an integral partner, such as dog dancing and dog yoga.\n\nAccording to statistics published by the American Pet Products Manufacturers Association in the National Pet Owner Survey in 2009–2010, it is estimated there are 77.5 million people with pet dogs in the United States. The same survey shows nearly 40% of American households own at least one dog, of which 67% own just one dog, 25% two dogs and nearly 9% more than two dogs. There does not seem to be any gender preference among dogs as pets, as the statistical data reveal an equal number of female and male dog pets. Yet, although several programs are ongoing to promote pet adoption, less than a fifth of the owned dogs come from a shelter.\n\nThe latest study using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) comparing humans and dogs showed that dogs have same response to voices and use the same parts of the brain as humans do. This gives dogs the ability to recognize emotional human sounds, making them friendly social pets to humans.\n\nDogs have lived and worked with humans in so many roles that they have earned the unique nickname, \"man's best friend\", a phrase used in other languages as well. They have been bred for herding livestock, hunting (e.g. pointers and hounds), rodent control, guarding, helping fishermen with nets, detection dogs, and pulling loads, in addition to their roles as companions. In 1957, a husky-terrier mix named Laika became the first animal to orbit the Earth.\n\nService dogs such as guide dogs, utility dogs, assistance dogs, hearing dogs, and psychological therapy dogs provide assistance to individuals with physical or mental disabilities. Some dogs owned by epileptics have been shown to alert their handler when the handler shows signs of an impending seizure, sometimes well in advance of onset, allowing the guardian to seek safety, medication, or medical care.\n\nDogs included in human activities in terms of helping out humans are usually called working dogs.\n\nPeople often enter their dogs in competitions such as breed-conformation shows or sports, including racing, sledding and agility competitions.\n\nIn conformation shows, also referred to as breed shows, a judge familiar with the specific dog breed evaluates individual purebred dogs for conformity with their established breed type as described in the breed standard. As the breed standard only deals with the externally observable qualities of the dog (such as appearance, movement, and temperament), separately tested qualities (such as ability or health) are not part of the judging in conformation shows.\n\nDog meat is consumed in some East Asian countries, including Korea, China and Vietnam, a practice that dates back to antiquity. It is estimated that 13–16 million dogs are killed and consumed in Asia every year. Other cultures, such as Polynesia and pre-Columbian Mexico, also consumed dog meat in their history. However, Western, South Asian, African, and Middle Eastern cultures, in general, regard consumption of dog meat as taboo. In some places, however, such as in rural areas of Poland, dog fat is believed to have medicinal properties—being good for the lungs for instance. Dog meat is also consumed in some parts of Switzerland. Proponents of eating dog meat have argued that placing a distinction between livestock and dogs is western hypocrisy, and that there is no difference with eating the meat of different animals.\n\nIn Korea, the primary dog breed raised for meat, the \"nureongi\" (누렁이), differs from those breeds raised for pets that Koreans may keep in their homes.\n\nThe most popular Korean dog dish is \"gaejang-guk\" (also called \"bosintang\"), a spicy stew meant to balance the body's heat during the summer months; followers of the custom claim this is done to ensure good health by balancing one's \"gi\", or vital energy of the body. A 19th century version of \"gaejang-guk\" explains that the dish is prepared by boiling dog meat with scallions and chili powder. Variations of the dish contain chicken and bamboo shoots. While the dishes are still popular in Korea with a segment of the population, dog is not as widely consumed as beef, chicken, and pork.\n\nIn 2005, the WHO reported that 55,000 people died in Asia and Africa from rabies, a disease for which dogs are the most important vector.\n\nCiting a 2008 study, the U.S. Center for Disease Control estimated in 2015 that 4.5 million people in the USA are bitten by dogs each year. A 2015 study estimated that 1.8% of the U.S. population is bitten each year. In the 1980s and 1990s the US averaged 17 fatalities per year, while in the 2000s this has increased to 26. 77% of dog bites are from the pet of family or friends, and 50% of attacks occur on the property of the dog's legal owner.\n\nA Colorado study found bites in children were less severe than bites in adults. The incidence of dog bites in the US is 12.9 per 10,000 inhabitants, but for boys aged 5 to 9, the incidence rate is 60.7 per 10,000. Moreover, children have a much higher chance to be bitten in the face or neck. Sharp claws with powerful muscles behind them can lacerate flesh in a scratch that can lead to serious infections.\n\nIn the UK between 2003 and 2004, there were 5,868 dog attacks on humans, resulting in 5,770 working days lost in sick leave.\n\nIn the United States, cats and dogs are a factor in more than 86,000 falls each year. It has been estimated around 2% of dog-related injuries treated in UK hospitals are domestic accidents. The same study found that while dog involvement in road traffic accidents was difficult to quantify, dog-associated road accidents involving injury more commonly involved two-wheeled vehicles.\n\n\"Toxocara canis\" (dog roundworm) eggs in dog feces can cause toxocariasis. In the United States, about 10,000 cases of \"Toxocara\" infection are reported in humans each year, and almost 14% of the U.S. population is infected. In Great Britain, 24% of soil samples taken from public parks contained \"T. canis\" eggs. Untreated toxocariasis can cause retinal damage and decreased vision. Dog feces can also contain hookworms that cause cutaneous larva migrans in humans.\n\nThe scientific evidence is mixed as to whether companionship of a dog can enhance human physical health and psychological wellbeing. Studies suggesting that there are benefits to physical health and psychological wellbeing have been criticised for being poorly controlled, and finding that \"[t]he health of elderly people is related to their health habits and social supports but not to their ownership of, or attachment to, a companion animal.\" Earlier studies have shown that people who keep pet dogs or cats exhibit better mental and physical health than those who do not, making fewer visits to the doctor and being less likely to be on medication than non-guardians.\n\nA 2005 paper states \"recent research has failed to support earlier findings that pet ownership is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, a reduced use of general practitioner services, or any psychological or physical benefits on health for community dwelling older people. Research has, however, pointed to significantly less absenteeism from school through sickness among children who live with pets.\" In one study, new guardians reported a highly significant reduction in minor health problems during the first month following pet acquisition, and this effect was sustained in those with dogs through to the end of the study.\n\nIn addition, people with pet dogs took considerably more physical exercise than those with cats and those without pets. The results provide evidence that keeping pets may have positive effects on human health and behaviour, and that for guardians of dogs these effects are relatively long-term. Pet guardianship has also been associated with increased coronary artery disease survival, with human guardians being significantly less likely to die within one year of an acute myocardial infarction than those who did not own dogs.\n\nThe health benefits of dogs can result from contact with dogs in general, and not solely from having dogs as pets. For example, when in the presence of a pet dog, people show reductions in cardiovascular, behavioral, and psychological indicators of anxiety. Other health benefits are gained from exposure to immune-stimulating microorganisms, which, according to the hygiene hypothesis, can protect against allergies and autoimmune diseases. The benefits of contact with a dog also include social support, as dogs are able to not only provide companionship and social support themselves, but also to act as facilitators of social interactions between humans. One study indicated that wheelchair users experience more positive social interactions with strangers when they are accompanied by a dog than when they are not. In 2015, a study found that pet owners were significantly more likely to get to know people in their neighborhood than non-pet owners.\n\nThe practice of using dogs and other animals as a part of therapy dates back to the late 18th century, when animals were introduced into mental institutions to help socialize patients with mental disorders. Animal-assisted intervention research has shown that animal-assisted therapy with a dog can increase social behaviors, such as smiling and laughing, among people with Alzheimer's disease. One study demonstrated that children with ADHD and conduct disorders who participated in an education program with dogs and other animals showed increased attendance, increased knowledge and skill objectives, and decreased antisocial and violent behavior compared with those who were not in an animal-assisted program.\n\nMedical detection dogs are capable of detecting diseases by sniffing a person directly or samples of urine or other specimens. Dogs can detect odour in one part per trillion, as their brain's olfactory cortex is (relative to total brain size) 40 times larger than humans. Dogs may have as many as 300 million odour receptors in their nose, while humans may have only 5 million. Each dog is trained specifically for the detection of single disease from the blood glucose level indicative to diabetes to cancer. The process of training a cancer dog requires six months. A Labrador Retriever called Daisy has detected 551 cancer patients with an accuracy of 93 percent and received the Blue Cross (for pets) Medal for her life-saving skills.\n\nEvery year, between 6 and 8 million dogs and cats enter US animal shelters. The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) estimates that approximately 3 to 4 million of those dogs and cats are euthanized yearly in the United States. However, the percentage of dogs in US animal shelters that are eventually adopted and removed from the shelters by their new legal owners has increased since the mid-1990s from around 25% to a 2012 average of 40% among reporting shelters (with many shelters reporting 60–75%).\n\nDogs have been viewed and represented in different manners by different cultures and religions, over the course of history.\n\nIn ancient Mesopotamia, from the Old Babylonian period until the Neo-Babylonian, dogs were the symbol of Ninisina, the goddess of healing and medicine, and her worshippers frequently dedicated small models of seated dogs to her. In the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian periods, dogs were used as emblems of magical protection.\n\nIn mythology, dogs often serve as pets or as watchdogs. Stories of dogs guarding the gates of the underworld recur throughout Indo-European mythologies and may originate from Proto-Indo-European religion. In Greek mythology, Cerberus is a three-headed watchdog who guards the gates of Hades. In Norse mythology, a bloody, four-eyed dog called Garmr guards Helheim. In Persian mythology, two four-eyed dogs guard the Chinvat Bridge. In Welsh mythology, Annwn is guarded by Cŵn Annwn. In Hindu mythology, Yama, the god of death, owns two watch dogs who have four eyes. They are said to watch over the gates of Naraka.\n\nThe hunter god Muthappan from North Malabar region of Kerala has a hunting dog as his mount. Dogs are found in and out of the Muthappan Temple and offerings at the shrine take the form of bronze dog figurines. In Philippine mythology, Kimat who is the pet of Tadaklan, god of thunder, is responsible for lightning. The role of the dog in Chinese mythology includes a position as one of the twelve animals which cyclically represent years (the zodiacal dog).\n\nIn Homer's epic poem the \"Odyssey\", when the disguised Odysseus returns home after 20 years he is recognized only by his faithful dog, Argos, who has been waiting for his return.\n\nIn Christianity, dogs represent faithfulness. Within the Roman Catholic denomination specifically, the iconography of Saint Dominic includes a dog, after the hallow's mother dreamt of a dog springing from her womb and becoming pregnant shortly thereafter. As such, the Dominican Order (Ecclesiastical Latin: \"Dominicanus\") means \"dogs of the Lord\" of \"hounds of the Lord\" (Ecclesiastical Latin: \"domini canis\").\n\nJewish law does not prohibit keeping dogs and other pets. Jewish law requires Jews to feed dogs (and other animals that they own) before themselves, and make arrangements for feeding them before obtaining them.\n\nThe view on dogs in Islam is mixed, with some schools of thought viewing it as unclean, although Khaled Abou El Fadl states that this view is based on \"pre-Islamic Arab mythology\" and \"a tradition to be falsely attributed to the Prophet\". Therefore, Sunni Malaki and Hanafi jurists permit the trade of and keeping of dogs as pets.\n\nIn China, Korea, and Japan, dogs are viewed as kind protectors.\n\nCultural depictions of dogs in art extend back thousands of years to when dogs were portrayed on the walls of caves. Representations of dogs became more elaborate as individual breeds evolved and the relationships between human and canine developed. Hunting scenes were popular in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Dogs were depicted to symbolize guidance, protection, loyalty, fidelity, faithfulness, watchfulness, and love.\n\nLists\n\n\n",
                "Evolution of the wolf\n\nThe evolution of the wolf occurred over a geologic time scale of 800 thousand years, transforming the first Middle Pleistocene wolf specimen that is recognized as being morphologically similar to \"Canis lupus\" into today's dog, dingo and gray wolf. Ecological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition has greatly influenced the wolf's genetic population structure and cranio-dental plasticity. Wolves went through a population bottleneck 20,000 years before present (YBP), which indicates that many wolf populations had gone extinct at a time that coincided with the Last Glacial Maximum and the expansion of modern humans worldwide with their technology for capturing large game. The domestic dog is the most widely abundant large carnivore and a descendant from one of those now-extinct wolf populations. Today, the wolf is represented by the many extant subspecies of \"Canis lupus\", which includes the dog and dingo.\n\nThe fossil record for ancient vertebrates is composed of rarely occurring fragments from which it is often impossible to obtain genetic material. Researchers are limited to morphologic analysis but it is difficult to estimate the intra-species and inter-species variations and relationships that existed between specimens across time and place. Some observations are debated by researchers who do not always agree, and hypotheses that are supported by some authors are challenged by others.\n\nThere is general agreement on the most ancient record, which shows that feliforms and caniforms emerged within the super-family Carnivoramorpha 43 million years before present (YBP). The caniforms included the fox-like genus \"Leptocyon\" whose various species existed from 34 million YBP before branching 11.9 million YBP into \"Vulpes\" (foxes) and Canini (canines). The jackal-sized \"Eucyon\" existed in North America from 10 million YBP and by the Early Pliocene about 6–5 million YBP the coyote-like \"Eucyon davisi\" invaded Eurasia. In North America it gave rise to early \"Canis\" which first appeared in the Miocene (6 million YBP) in south-western US and Mexico. By 5 million YBP the larger \"Canis lepophagus\" appeared in the same region.\n\nThe canids that had immigrated from North America to Eurasia – \"Eucyon\", \"Vulpes\", and \"Nyctereutes\" – were small to medium-sized predators during the Late Miocene and Early Pliocene but they were not the top predators. The position of the canids would change with the arrival of \"Canis\" to become a dominant predator across the Holarctic. The wolf-sized \"C. chihilensis\" appeared in northern China in the Mid-Pliocene around 4–3 million YBP. The large wolf-sized \"Canis\" appeared in the Middle Pliocene about 3 million years ago in the Yushe Basin, Shanxi Province, China. By 2.5 million years ago its range included the Nihewan Basin in Yangyuan County, Hebei, China and Kuruksay, Tadzhikistan. This was followed by an explosion of \"Canis\" evolution across Eurasia in the Early Pleistocene around 1.8 million YBP in what is commonly referred to as the \"wolf event\". It is associated with the formation of the mammoth steppe and continental glaciation. \"Canis\" spread to Europe in the forms of \"C. arnensis\", \"C. etruscus\", and \"C. falconeri\".\n\nThe fossil record is incomplete but it is likely that wolves arose from a population of small, early canids. Morphological evidence and genetic evidence both suggest that wolves evolved during the Pliocene and Early Pleistocene eras from the same lineage that also led to the coyote, with fossil specimens indicating that the coyote and the wolf diverged from a common ancestor 1.5 million years ago. The ancestor of the jackal and the other extant members of the \"Canis\" genus had split from the lineage before this time.\n\nAfter this separation from a common ancestor the species that were believed to be involved in the further evolution of the wolf and coyote - and the beliefs of some paleontologists - diverged. A number of researchers believed that the lines of \"C. priscolatrans\", \"C. etruscus\", \"C. rufus\" and \"C. lupus\" were components involved in some way that lead to the modern wolf and coyote.\n\n\"Canis lepophagus\" lived in the early Pliocene in North America. Kurten proposed that the Blancan \"C. lepophagus\" derived from smaller Miocene \"Canis\" species in North America. It then became widespread across Eurasia where it was either identical to, or closely related with, \"C. arnensis\" of Europe.\n\nJohnston describes \"C. lepophagus\" as having a more slender skull and skeleton than in the modern coyote. Robert M. Nowak found that the early populations had small, delicate and narrowly proportioned skulls that resemble small coyotes and appear to be ancestral to \"C. latrans\". Johnson noted that some specimens found in Cita Canyon, Texas had larger, broader skulls, and along with other fragments Nowak suggested that these were evolving into wolves.\n\nTedford disagreed with previous authors and found that its cranio-dental morphology lacked some characteristics that are shared by \"C. lupus\" and \"C. latrans\", and therefore there was not a close relationship but it did suggest \"C. lepophagus\" was the ancestor of both wolves and coyotes.\n\n\"Canis priscolatrans\" lived in the late Pliocene-Early Pleistocene in North America. The first definite wolf appeared in the Late Blancan/Early Irvingtonian, and named \"C. priscolatrans\" that was either very close to or a synonym for \"Canis edwardii\". It resembled \"C. rufus\" in cranial size and proportions but with more complex dentition. However, there are no fossils of \"C. rufus\" until the Late Rancholabrean.\n\nKurten was uncertain if \"C. priscolatrans\" derived from \"C. lepophagus\" and \"C. arnensis\", but believed that \"C. priscolatrans\" was a population of large coyotes that were ancestral to Rancholabrean and recent \"C. latrans\". He noted that \"C. arnensis\" of Europe showed striking similarities to \"C. priscolatrans\", and they could represent what once was a holarctic population of coyotes. Nowak disagreed, and believed that \"C. priscolatrans\" was a counterpart to the European \"C. etruscus\". Kurten later proposed that both \"C. priscolatrans\" and \"C. etruscus\" were part of a group which led to \"C. lupus\" but was not sure if they evolved separately from \"C. lepophagus\" or a possible common ancestor that was derived from \"C. lepophagus\".\n\nThe remains of the larger coyote-like \"Canis edwardii\" have been found in the later Pliocene in the south-western USA along with \"C. lepophagus\", which indicates a descent. Tedford recognised \"C. edwardii\" and found that the cranio-dental morphology of \"C. priscolatrans\" fell inside that of \"C. edwardii\" such that the species name \"C. priscolatrans\" was doubtful (\"nomen dubium\").\n\nThe North American wolves became larger, with tooth specimens indicating that \"C. priscolatrans\" diverged into the large wolf \"C. ambrusteri\". during the Middle Pleistocene in North America. Robert A. Martin disagreed, and believed that \"C. ambrusteri\" was \"C. lupus\". Nowak disagreed with Martin and proposed that \"C. ambrusteri\" was not related to \"C. lupus\" but \"C. priscolatrans\", which then gave rise to \"C. dirus\". Tedford proposed that the South American \"C. gezi\" and \"C. nehringi\" share dental and cranial similarities developed for hypercarnivory, suggesting \"C. ambrusteri\" was the common ancestor of \"C. gezi\", \"C. nehringi\" and \"C. dirus\".\n\n\"Canis dirus\" lived in the late Pleistocene to early Holocene in North and South America and was the largest of all \"Canis\" species. In 1987, new hypothesis proposed that a mammal population could give rise to a larger form called a hypermorph during times when food was abundant, but when food later became scarce the hypermorph would either adapt to a smaller form or go extinct. This hypothesis might explain the large body sizes found in many Late Pleistocene mammals compared to their modern counterparts. Both extinction and speciation - a new species splitting from an older one - could occur together during periods of climatic extremes. GloriaD.Goulet agreed with Martin and further proposed that this hypothesis might explain the sudden appearance of \"C.dirus\" in North America, and that because of the similarities in their skull shapes that \"C.lupus\" gave rise to the \"C.dirus\" hypermorph due to abundant game, a stable environment, and large competitors. Nowak, Kurten and Berta disagreed with Goulet and proposed that \"C. dirus\" was not derived from \"C. lupus\". The three noted paleontologists Xiaoming Wang, R. H. Tedford and R. M. Nowak have all proposed that \"C. dirus\" had evolved from \"C. ambrusteri\", with Nowak stating that there were specimens from Cumberland Cave, Maryland that indicated \"C. ambrusteri\" diverging into \"C. dirus\". The two taxa share a number of characteristics (synapomorphy), which suggests an origin of \"C. dirus\" in the late Irvingtonian in the open terrain in the midcontinent, and then later expanding eastward and displacing its ancestor \"C. ambrusteri\".\n\n\"Canis mosbachensis\" lived in the middle to late Pleistocene in Eurasia. The holotype of the Mosbach wolf \"C. mosbachensis\" (Soergel, 1925) was found in Jockgrim, (Germany). In 2010, a study found that the diversity of the \"Canis\" group decreased by the end of the Early Pleistocene to Middle Pleistocene and was limited in Eurasia to the small wolves of the \"C. mosbachensis–C. variabilis\" group that were a comparable size to the extant Indian wolf \"(Canis lupus pallipes)\", and the large hypercarnivorous \"Canis (Xenocyon) lycaonoides\" that was comparable in size to extant northern gray wolves. \"C. mosbachensis\" occurred between \"C. etruscus\" in the Early Pleistocene and the modern \"C. lupus\". \"C. mosbachensis\" was smaller than most North American wolf populations and smaller than \"C. rufus\", and has been described by Kurten as being similar in size to \"Canis papilles\". As wolves continue to evolve they become bigger. It was still living in Europe at a time coinciding with the North American Early Rancholabrean and had grown in size by the Late Rancholabrean. Nowak proposed that \"C. mosbachensis\" was the ancestor of Eurasian and North American wolves, and that one population of \"C. mosbachensis\" invaded North America where it became isolated by the later glaciation and there gave rise to \"C. rufus\". Another population of \"C. mosbachensis\" remained in Eurasia and evolved into \"C. lupus\", from where it invaded North America.\n\nTedford compared \"C. mosbachensis\" (which was once distributed from Western Europe to Khazakhstan) with \"C. variabilis\" (which was once distributed from Khazakhstan to China) as they both existed in the Middle Pleistocene across mid-latitude Eurasia. The only difference was that \"C. variabilis\" had \"nasal bones that terminate at or anterior to the most posterior position of the frontal-maxillary suture\", and therefore these two taxa could represent variation in the one geographically widespread mid-Pleistocene wolf.\n\nThe phylogenetic descent of the extant wolf \"C. lupus\" from \"C. etruscus\" through \"C. mosbachensis\" is widely accepted. Lumley considered \"C. mosbachensis\" to be a subspecies of the gray wolf and proposed a name of \"C. lupus mosbachensis\". However, other researchers propose that they can see no clear anatomical relationship between \"C. mosbachensis\" and \"C. etruscus\" and that it is more similar to \"C. arnensis\", and that it exhibits a size and dentition more similar to an omnivorous jackal.\n\nWang and Tedford proposed that the genus \"Canis\" was the descendant of the coyote-like \"Eucyon davisi\", and its remains first appeared in the Miocene (6 million YBP) in south-western USA and Mexico. By the Pliocene (5 million YBP), the larger \"Canis lepophagus\" appeared in the same region and by the Early Pleistocene (1 million YBP) \"Canis latrans\" (the coyote) was in existence. They proposed that the progression from \"Eucyon davisi\" to \"C lepophagus\" to the coyote was linear evolution. Additionally, \"C. edwardii\", \"C. latrans\" and \"C. aureus\" form together a small clade and because \"C. edwardii\" appeared earliest spanning the mid-Blancan (late Pliocene) to the close of the Irvingtonian (late Pleistocene) it is proposed as the ancestor.\n\nNowak and Tedford also believed that it was possible for \"C. lupus\" to have been derived from a Miocene or Pliocene canid line that preceded and was separate from \"C. lepophagus\". Wang and Tedford proposed that assuming the geological attribution of the material was correct then the earliest identifiable \"C. lupus\" remains date 800,000 YBP (Middle Pleistocene) with wolves similar to the living species occurring in both the Olyorian fauna (Early to Middle Pleistocene of Siberia) and in the Cripple Creek Sump fauna (Alaska), which points to an origin of these wolves in Beringia. Based on morphology from China, the Pliocene wolf \"C. chihliensis\" may have been the ancestor for both \"C. armbrusteri\" and \"C. lupus\" before their migration into North America. \"C. chihliensis\" appears to be more primitive and smaller than \"C. lupus\", and measurements of its skull and teeth are similar to \"C. lupus\" but those of its postcranial elements are smaller. \"C. amrusteri\" appeared in North America in the Middle Pleistocene and is a wolf-like form larger than any \"Canis\" at that time. At the end of the most recent glacial retreat during the past 30,000 years, warming melted the glacial barriers across northern Canada allowing arctic mammals to extend their range into mid-latitude North America, including elk, caribou, bison, and the gray wolf.\n\nIn Eurasia during the Middle Pleistocene, \"C. falconeri\" gave rise to the hypercarnivore genus \"Xenocyon\", which then gave rise to genus Cuon (the dhole) and genus Lycaon (the African hunting dog). Just before the appearance of \"C. dirus\", North America was invaded by genus \"Xenocyon\" that was as large as \"C. dirus\" and more hypercarnivorous. The fossil record shows them as rare and it is assumed that they could not compete with the newly derived \"C. dirus\". The large wolf \"C. antonii\" from late Pliocene to early Pleistocene China was assessed as being a variation within \"C. chihliensis\", and the large wolf \"C. falconeri\" occurred abruptly in Europe in the Early Pleistocene, perhaps representing a westward extension of \"C. antonii\".\n\nIn 2012, a study of the wolf-like \"Canis\" species of ancient China under the direction of Xiaoming Wang found that these were all quite close to \"C. lupus\" in both dental and post-cranial dimensions except for \"C. variabilis\", which was \"very strange\" compared to other \"Canis\" in China as it had much smaller cranio-dental dimensions than earlier and later species. The study concluded that \"It is very likely that this species is the ancestor of the domestic dog \"Canis familiaris\", a hypothesis that has been proposed by previous authors.\"\n\nThe Paleolithic dog was a Late Pleistocene canine. They were directly associated with human hunting camps in Europe over 30,000 (YBP) and it is proposed that they were domesticated. They are also proposed to be either a proto-dog and the ancestor of the domestic dog or a type of wolf unknown to science.\n\nIn 2002, a study was undertaken into the fossil skulls of two large canids that had been found buried within meters of the doorway of what was once a mammoth-bone hut at the Eliseevichi-I Upper Paleolithic site in the Bryansk Region on the Russian Plain, and using an accepted morphologically based definition of domestication declared them to be \"Ice Age dogs\". The carbon dating gave a calendar-year age estimate that ranged between 16,945-13,905 YBP. In 2013, a study looked at one of these skulls and its mitochondrial DNA sequence was identified as \"Canis lupus familiaris\".\n\nIn 2015, a zooarchaeologist stated that \"In terms of phenotypes, dogs and wolves are fundamentally different animals.\"\n\nIn 1986, a study of skull morphology found that the domestic dog is morphologically distinct from all other canids except the wolf-like canids. \"The difference in size and proportion between some breeds are as great as those between any wild genera, but all dogs are clearly members of the same species.\" In 2010, a study of dog skull shape compared to extant carnivorans proposed that \"The greatest shape distances between dog breeds clearly surpass the maximum divergence between species in the Carnivora. Moreover, domestic dogs occupy a range of novel shapes outside the domain of wild carnivorans.\"\n\nThe domestic dog compared to the wolf shows the greatest variation in the size and shape of the skull (Evans 1979) that range from 7 to 28 cm in length (McGreevy 2004). Wolves are dolichocephalic (long skulled) but not as extreme as some breeds of such as greyhounds and Russian wolfhounds (McGreevy 2004). Canine brachycephaly (short-skulledness) is found only in domestic dogs and is related to paedomorphosis (Goodwin 1997). Puppies are born with short snouts, with the longer skull of dolichocephalic dogs emerging in later development (Coppinger 1995). Other differences in head shape between brachycephalic and dolichocephalic dogs include changes in the craniofacial angle (angle between the basilar axis and hard palate) (Regodón 1993), morphology of the temporomandibular joint (Dickie 2001), and radiographic anatomy of the cribriform plate (Schwarz 2000).\n\nNowak indicated that orbital angle of the eye socket is an important characteristic defining the difference between the dog and the wolf, with the wolf having the lower angle. Nowak compared the orbital angles of four North American canines (including the Indian dog) and produced the following values in degrees: coyote-42.8, wolf-42.8, dog-52.9 dire wolf-53.1. The orbital angle of the eye socket was clearly larger in the dog than in the coyote and the wolf; why it was almost the same as that of the dire wolf was not commented on.\n\nMany authors have concluded that compared to the adult extant wolf, the adult domestic dog has a relatively reduced rostrum (front part of the skull), an elevated frontal bone, a wider palate, a broader cranium, and smaller teeth (Hildebrand1954; Clutton-Brock, Corbet & Hills 1976; Olsen 1985; Wayne 1986; Hemmer 1990; Morey 1990). Other authors have disagreed and have stated that these traits can overlap and vary within the two (Crockford 1999; Harrison 1973). Wolf cubs have similar relative skull proportions as adult dogs and this was proposed as evidence that the domestic dog is a neotenic wolf. This was proposed to be due to either human selection for juvenile appearance or due to a pleiotropic effect as a result of selection for juvenile behavior (Clutton-Brock 1977; Belyaev 1979; Wayne 1986; Coppinger and Schneider 1995). Wayne (1986) concluded that his dog samples did not have significant relative shortening of the rostrum compared to wolves, calling this identification feature into question. A 2004 study that used 310 wolf skulls and over 700 dog skulls representing 100 breeds concluded that the evolution of dog skulls can generally not be described by heterochronic processes such as neoteny although some pedomorphic dog breeds have skulls that resemble the skulls of juvenile wolves. \"Dogs are not paedomorphic wolves.\"\n\nCompared to the wolf, dog dentition is relatively less robust (Olsen 1985; Hemmer 1990), which is proposed to be due to the relaxation of natural selection when wolves became commensal scavengers, or to artificial selection (Olsen 1985; Clutton-Brock 1995). However, Kieser and Groeneveld (1992) compared the mandibulo-dental measurements of jackals (\"C. adustus, C. mesomelas\") and Cape foxes (\"Vulpes chama\") to equivalent-sized dogs and found that the canines of these other canids tended to be slightly smaller and their second molars larger compared to dogs, otherwise the proportions were essentially the same in all species. They concluded that \"...the teeth of canids appear to have evolved in concert with one another and relatively independently of differences in dimorphism, size or functional demands\". This calls into question the assumption that dog teeth are relatively small due to recent selection, suggesting that dog dentition is plesiomorphic from an ancestor that was smaller than the wolf.\n\nThe reduced body size of the early dog compared to a wolf is thought due to niche selection (Olsen 1985; Morey 1992; Coppinger &\nCoppinger 2001). Morey (1992:199) states that \"Results...are consistent with a hypothesis that early domestic dogs are evolutionary paedomorphs, products of strong selection for ontogenetically channeled size reduction and alterations of reproductive timing associated with the new domestic way of life.\" However, in an domestication experiment the domesticated foxes remained the same size as unselected foxes (Trutt 1999:167).\n\nWayne (1986) concluded that the dog is closer in skull morphology to \"C. latrans, C. aureus, C. adustus, C. mesomelas, Cuon alpinus\" and \"Lycaon pictus\" than to the wolf. Dahr (1942) concluded that the shape of the dog brain case is closer to that of the coyote than to that of the wolf. Manwell and Baker (1983) reviewed Dahr's work with the addition of dental data for canids and concluded that the dog ancestor was probably within the range of 13.6–20.5 kg, which is smaller than the range 27–54 kg for extant wolves (Mech 1970) and is comparable with the Dingo.\n\nThe auditory bulla of the dog is relatively smaller and flatter than that of the wolf (Harrison 1973; Clutton-Brock, Corbet & Hill 1976; Nowak 1979; Olsen 1985; Wayne 1986), which is proposed to be due to relaxed selection under domestication as the dog no longer required the acute hearing of the wolf. However, bulla shape has been shown to facilitate increased sensitivity to specific frequencies but shape and size may not be correlated with acuity (Ewer 1973). Therefore, the observed difference could be that the dog bulla has retained its ancestral shape.\n\nThe ventral edge of the dog's horizontal ramus of the mandible has a convex curve that does not exist in the wolf (Olsen 1985; Clutton-Brock 1995), and no discussion of this difference could be found in the literature. However, Biknevicius and Van Valkenburgh (1997) noticed that the horizontal ramus of bone-processing predators is thicker dorso-ventrally at the point caudal to the site of bone processing. This thickening may have been a function for niche adaptation by the dog's ancestor.\n\nA description of the superficial brain morphology of jackals (\"C. mesomelas, C. aureus\"), coyotes (\"C. latrans\"), wolves (\"C. lupus, C. rufus\"), and dogs indicated that the cerebellum of the dog closely approximates that of the coyote, which is closely aligned with the jackals, and that the wolves show numerous brain traits distinct from the other species (Atkins and Dillon 1971). Wolves also have serological and biochemical traits distinct from dogs (Leone and Wiens 1956; Lauer, Kuyt & Baker 1969).\n\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum, there was greater wolf genetic diversity than there is today, and within the Pleistocene gray wolf population the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically and ecologically distinct from one another. One author has proposed that the most likely explanation for the different morphological characteristics of the dog compared to the wolf is that the dog's ancestor was adapted to a different niche than the wolf.\n\nThe mitochondria within each cell contain many copies of a small circular DNA genome and in mammals it is 16,000–18,000 base pairs in length. A cell contains hundreds or thousands of mitochondria and therefore the genes contained within those mitochondria are more abundant than the genes that occur in the nucleus of the cell. The abundance of mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) is useful for the genetic analysis of ancient remains where the DNA has degraded.\n\nMitochondrial DNA sequences have a higher mutation rate than the mutation rate of nuclear genes and for mammals this rate is 5–10 times faster. The mitochondrial protein-coding genes evolve much faster and are powerful markers for inferring evolution history at category levels such as families, genera, and species. However, they have evolved at a faster rate than other DNA markers and there is a timing difference in its molecular clock that needs to be validated against other sources. The taxonomic status of uncertain species is better resolved through using nuclear DNA from the nucleus of the cell, which is more suitable for analyzing the recent history. In most cases, mDNA is inherited from the maternal ancestor. Therefore, phylogenetic analysis of mDNA sequences within species provides a history of maternal lineages that can be represented as a phylogenetic tree.\n\nThe mDNA sequences of the dog and wolf differ by only 0–12 substitutions within 261 base-pairs, whereas dogs always differed from coyotes and jackals by at least 20 substitutions. This finding implies that the dog derived from the wolf and that there has been repeated back-crossing, or that the dog may have descended from a now extinct species of canid whose closest living relative is the modern wolf.\n\nDNA studies may give unresolvable results due to the specimens selected, the technology used, and the assumptions made by the researchers. Any one from a panel of genetic markers can be chosen for use in a study, and the techniques used to extract, locate and compare sequences can be applied using advances in technology to observe longer lengths of base pairs that give better phylogenetic resolution. Phylogenetic trees based on different genetic markers have given conflicting results regarding the relationship between the wolf, dog and coyote. One study based on SNPs and another based on nuclear gene sequences showed dogs clustering with coyotes and separate from wolves. Another study based on SNP genotypes showed wolves clustering with coyotes and separate from dogs. Other studies based on a number of markers show the more widely accepted result of wolves clustering with dogs separate from coyotes. These results indicate that caution is needed when interpreting the results of genetic markers.\n\nThere are two key assumptions that are made for dating the divergence time for species: the generation time and the genetic mutation rate per generation. The time between generations for wolves is assumed to be three years based on the extant gray wolf, and two years for the dog based on the extant dog. One recent major study assumed a generation time of 2 years for the dog for as far back as 10,000 years ago, and then assumed a generation time of 3 years (the same as the wolf) before that to calculate a proposed divergence time between the two. In 2017, the wolf research scientist L. David Mech queried why evolutionary biologists were calculating the approximate time of the dog diverging from the wolf through using a wolf generation time of three years when published works using large data sets demonstrate a figure of 4.2-4.7 years. They were encouraged to recalculate their divergence dates accordingly.\n\nDNA studies are conducted but with \"the mutation rate as the dominant source of uncertainty.\" In 2005, Lindblad-Toh sequenced the first draft genome of the extant dog, and calculated a proposed mutation rate of 1x10 mutations per generation. In 2015, Skoglund was able to sequence the first draft genome of the 35,000 YBP Taimyr wolf and used its radio-carbon date to validate a proposed genetic mutation rate of 0.4x10 mutations per generation. The difference is a timing factor of 2.5, however another study stated that because only one Pleistocene wolf specimen has so far been sequenced, then the result should be treated with caution, with that study then providing both estimates to calculate the proposed divergence times between the wolf and dog. However, in 2016 the mutation rate of the 4,800 YBP Newgrange dog matched that of the Taimyr wolf.\n\nThe wolf-like canids (the canid subfamily Caninae) are a group of large carnivores that are genetically closely related because their chromosomes number 78. The group includes genus \"Canis\", \"Cuon\" and \"Lycaon\". The members are the dog \"(C. lupus familiaris)\", gray wolf (\"C. lupus\"), coyote (\"C. latrans\"), golden jackal (\"C. aureus\"), Ethiopian wolf (\"C. simensis\"), black-backed jackal (\"C. mesomelas\"), side-striped jackal (\"C. adustus\"), dhole (\"Cuon alpinus\"), and African wild dog (\"Lycaon pictus\"). Newly proposed members include the red wolf (\"Canis rufus\"), eastern wolf (\"Canis lycaon\"), and African golden wolf (\"C. anthus\"). As they possess 78 chromosomes, all members of the genus \"Canis\" (coyotes, wolves, jackals) are karyologically indistinguishable from each other, and from the dhole and the African hunting dog. The members of \"Canis\" can potentially interbreed and there is evidence that the Ethiopian wolf has hybridized with dogs. According to zoologist Reginald Pocock, a dhole interbred with a golden jackal. The African hunting dog is large, highly mobile, known to disperse over large distances and are rare throughout much of their geographical range, making opportunities for hybridization difficult. A study of the maternal mitochondrial DNA of the black-backed jackal could find no evidence of genotypes from the most likely mates – the side-striped jackal nor the golden jackal – indicating that male black-backed jackals had not bred with these. A search of the scientific literature could not find evidence of hybridization for the rare side-striped jackal.\n\nA DNA sequence alignment for the wolf-like canids gave a phylogenetic tree with the gray wolf and dog being the most closely related, followed by a close affiliation with the coyote, golden jackal and Ethiopian wolf, and the dog can hybridize in the wild with these three species. Next closest to this group are the dhole and African wild dog that both have unique meat-slicing teeth, suggesting that this adaptation was later lost by the other members. The two African jackals are shown as the most basal members of this clade, which means that this tree is indicating an African origin for the clade. The tree illustrates the genotype-phenotype distinction, where a genotype is an organism's full hereditary information and a phenotype is an organism's actual observed properties, such as morphology, development, or behavior. By phenotype, the dhole (genus \"Cuon\") and the African hunting dog (genus \"Lycaon\") are not classified as members of the genus \"Canis\", but by genotype they are closer to dogs, wolves and coyotes than are the two genus \"Canis\" jackals - the Side-striped jackal (\"C. adustus\") and the Black-backed jackal (\"C. mesomelas\").\n\nIn 2014, a whole-genome DNA study indicated that the golden jackal ancestral lineage had diverged from the wolf/coyote ancestral lineage 400,000 years ago, which is considerably more recent than previous estimates of 1.9 million years based on mitochondrial DNA, but with \"the mutation rate as the dominant source of uncertainty.\" Using an alternate mutation rate per generation (Skoglund 2015), the divergence time becomes 955,000-1 million YBP.\n\nIn 2015, a study of mitochondrial genome sequences and nuclear genome sequences of African and Eurasian canids indicated that extant wolf-like canids had colonized Africa from Eurasia at least 5 times throughout the Pliocene and Pleistocene, which is consistent with fossil evidence suggesting that much of the African canid diversity resulted from the immigration of Eurasian ancestors, likely coincident with Plio-Pleistocene climatic oscillations between arid and humid conditions. When comparing the African and Eurasian golden jackals, the study concluded that the African specimens represented a distinct monophyletic lineage that should be recognized as a separate species, \"Canis anthus\" (African golden wolf). According to a phylogeny derived from nuclear sequences, the Eurasian golden jackal (\"Canis aureus\") diverged from the wolf/coyote lineage 1.9 million years ago but the African golden wolf separated 1.3 million years ago. Mitochondrial genome sequences indicated the Ethiopian wolf diverged from the wolf/coyote lineage slightly prior to that.\n\nA study of the mitochondrial DNA of the wolves living in the Trans-Himalaya region have unique haplotypes, do not cluster phylogenetically with other gray wolves, were basal to all other wolves and are closer to the jackal. This indicates that these are the descendants of an ancient wolf distribution and a new taxonomic classification of \"Canis himalayensis\" is proposed. Later studies of mitochondrial DNA and other DNA sequences found that the Himalayan wolf formed a basal distinct monophyletic clade relative to the holarctic gray wolf. Its degree of divergence to the holarctic gray wolf is similar to the degree of divergence of the African golden wolf from the holarctic gray wolf. The Himalayan wolf possesses a unique X-chromosome haplotype but shares a Y-chromosome haplotype with the African golden wolf. The range of the Himalayan wolf includes the Himalayas then north across the Tibetan plateau to the Qinghai Lake in Qinghai Province, China.\n\nA haplotype (haploid genotype) is a group of genes in an organism that are inherited together from a single parent. A haplogroup is a group of similar haplotypes that share a common ancestor with a single-nucleotide polymorphism (a mutation). Mitochondrial DNA passes along a maternal lineage that can date back thousands of years.\n\nIn 2010, a study compared DNA sequences that were 230 base pairs in length from the mitochondrial control region of 24 ancient wolf specimens from western Europe dated between 44,000–1,200 YBP with those of modern gray wolves. Most of the sequences could be represented on a phylogenetic tree. However, the haplotypes of the Himalayan wolf and the Indian gray wolf could not because they were 8 mutations apart from the other wolves, indicating distinct lineages which had previously been found in other studies. The study found that there were 75 different gray wolf mDNA haplotypes that include 23 in Europe, 30 in Asia, 18 in North America, 3 in both Europe and Asia, and 1 in both Europe and North America. These haplotypes could be allocated into two haplogroups that were separated from each other by 5 mutations. Haplogroup 1 formed a monophyletic clade (indicating that they all carried the same mutation inherited from a single female ancestor). All other haplotypes were basal in the tree, and these formed 2–3 smaller clades that were assigned to haplogroup 2 that was not monophyletic.\n\nHaplogroups 1 and 2 could be found spread across Eurasia but only haplogroup 1 could be found in North America. The ancient wolf samples from western Europe differed from modern wolves by 1 to 10 mutations, and all belonged to haplogroup 2 indicating a haplogroup 2 predominance in this region for over 40,000 years before and after the Last Glacial Maximum. A comparison of current and past frequencies indicated that in Europe haplogroup 2 became outnumbered by haplogroup 1 over the past several thousand years but in North America haplogroup 2 became extinct and was replaced by haplogroup 1 after the Last Glacial Maximum. Access into North America was available between 20,000–11,000 years ago after the Wisconsin glaciation had retreated but before the Bering land bridge became inundated by the sea. Therefore, haplogroup 1 was able to enter into North America during this period.\n\nStable isotope analysis conducted on the bone of a specimen allows researchers to form conclusions about the diet, and therefore the ecology, of extinct wolf populations. This analysis suggests that the Pleistocene wolves from haplogroup 2 found in Beringia and Belgium preyed mainly on Pleistocene megafauna, which became rare at the beginning of the Holocene 12,000 years ago. One study found the Beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for the extant Indian gray wolf and the extant Himalayan wolf. The Pleistocene Eurasian wolves have been found to be morphologically and genetically comparable to the Pleistocene eastern-Beringian wolves, with some of the ancient European and Beringian wolves sharing a common haplotype (a17), which makes ecological similarity likely. Two ancient wolves from the Ukraine dated around 30,000 YBP and the 33,000 YBP \"Altai dog\" had the same sequence as six Beringian wolves, and another from the Czech Republic dated 44,000 YBP had the same sequence as two Beringian wolves.\n\nIt has been proposed that the Pleistocene wolves across northern Eurasia and northern North America represented a continuous and almost panmictic population that was genetically and probably also ecologically distinct from the wolves living in this area today. The specialized Pleistocene wolves did not contribute to the genetic diversity of modern wolves, and the modern wolf populations across the Holarctic are likely to be the descendants of wolves from populations that came from more southern refuges. Extant haplogroup 2 wolves can be found in Italy, the Balkans and the Carpathian Mountains but rare elsewhere in Europe. In Asia, only four haplotypes have been identified as belonging to this haplogroup, and two of them occur in the Middle East. Haplogroup 2 did not become extinct in Europe, and if before the Last Glacial Maximum haplogroup 2 was exclusively associated with the wolf ecomorph specialized in preying on megafauna, it would mean that in Europe it was capable of adapting to changing prey.\n\nIn 2013, a mitochondrial DNA sequencing of ancient wolf-like canids revealed another separate lineage of 3 haplotypes (forming a haplogroup) that was found in 3 Late Pleistocene specimens from Belgium; however, it has not been detected in extant wolves. One of these was the \"Goyet dog\".\n\nIn 2016, a study was undertaken due to concerns that previous mDNA studies may have been conducted with insufficient genetic resolution or limited geographical coverage and had not included sufficient specimens from Russia, China, and the Middle East. The study compared a 582 base pair sequence of the mitochondrial control region which gave twice the phylogenetic resolution of the 2010 study. The study compared the sequences of both modern wolves and ancient wolf specimens, including specimens from the remote areas of North America, Russia and China. The study included the Taimyr wolves, the Goyet \"dog\", the Altai \"dog\", Beringian wolves, and other ancient specimens.\n\nThe study found 114 different wolf haplotypes among 314 sequences, with the new haplotypes being found in Siberia and China. The phylogenetic tree resolved into 19 clades that included both modern and ancient wolves, which showed that the most basal clades included the Indian gray wolf and the Himalayan wolf, with a subclade of wolves from China and Mongolia falling within the Himalayan wolf clade. The two most basal North American haplotypes included the Mexican wolf and the Vancouver Island wolf, however the Vancouver Island wolf showed the same haplotype as a dog which indicates admixture, with the dog lineage basal to all extant North American subspecies. In Europe, the two most genetically distinct haplotypes form the Iberian wolf and separately the Italian wolf that was positioned close to the ancient wolves. The Greenland wolves all belonged to one haplotype that had been previously found among North American wolves and which indicates their origin from North America. The Eastern wolf was confirmed as a coyote/wolf hybrid. Wolves found in the regions of the Chukotka Peninsula, the North Korean border, Amur Oblast and Khakassia showed the greatest genetic diversity and with close links to all other wolves found across the holarctic. One ancient haplotype that had been found in Alaska (Eastern Beringia 28,000 YBP) and Russia (Medvezya \"Bear\" Cave, Pechora area, Northern Urals 18,000 YBP) was shared with some modern wolves found in China and Mongolia.\n\nThe previous finding of two wolf haplogroups was not clearly delineated in this study but it agreed that the genetic diversity of past wolves has been lost at the beginning of the Holocene in Alaska, Siberia, and Europe with limited overlap with modern wolves. For the ancient wolves of North America, instead of an extinction/replacement model suggested by a previous study, this study found substantial evidence of a population bottleneck in North America in which the ancient wolf diversity was almost lost around the beginning of the Holocene (no further elaboration in the study). In Eurasia, the loss of ancient lineages could not be simply explained and appears to have been slow across time with the reasons unclear.\n\nIn 2016, a study built on the work of another major study and analyzed the sequences of 12 genes that are located on the heavy strand of the mitochondrial genome of extinct and modern \"C. lupus\". The study excluded the sequences of the divergent Himalayan wolf and the Indian gray wolf. The ancient specimens were radiocarbon dated and stratagraphically dated, and together with the sequences generated a time-based phylogenetic tree. From the tree, the study was able to infer the most recent common ancestor for all other \"C. lupus\" specimens - modern and extinct - was 80,000 YBP and this date concured with the earlier study. The study could find no evidence of a population bottleneck for wolves until a few thousand years ago.\n\nThe phylogenetic tree showed the polyphyly of American wolves, the Mexican wolf was divergent from other North American wolves, and these other North American wolves formed two closely related clades. A scenario consistent with the phylogenetic, ice sheet and sea-level data was that during the Ice Age when sea levels were at their lowest, there was a single wave of wolf colonization into North America starting with the opening of the Bering land bridge 70,000 YBP and closing during the Late Glacial Maximum of the Yukon corridor that ran through the division between the Laurentide Ice Sheet and the Cordilleran Ice Sheet 23,000 YBP. Mexican wolves were part of the single wave and either diverged from the other wolves before entering North America or once in North America due to the change in its environment.\n\nAs wolves had been in the fossil record of North America but modern wolves could trace their ancestry back only 80,000 years, the wolf haplotypes that were already in North America were replaced by these invaders, either through competitive displacement or through admixture. The replacement in North America of a basal population of wolves by a more recent one supported the findings of earlier studies. There possibly existed a panmictic wolf population with gene flow spanning Eurasia and North America until the closing of the ice sheets. Once the sheets closed, the southern wolves were isolated and north of the sheets only the Beringian wolf existed. The land bridge became inundated by the sea 10,000 YBP, the sheets receded 12,000–6,000 YBP, the Beringian wolf went extinct and the southern wolves expanded to recolonize the rest of North America. All North American wolves are descended from those that were once isolated south of the ice sheets. However, much of their diversity was later lost during the twentieth century.\n\nStudies using mitochondrial DNA have indicated that the wolves of coastal south-east Alaska are genetically distinct from inland gray wolves, reflecting a pattern also observed in other taxa. They show a phylogenetic relationship with extirpated wolves from the south (Oklahoma), indicating that these wolves are the last remains of a once widespread group that has been largely extirpated during the last century, and that the wolves of northern North America had originally expanded from southern refuges below the Wisconsin glaciation after the ice had melted at the end of the Last Glacial Maximum. A whole-genome DNA study indicated that all North American wolves were monophyletic and therefore are the descendants of a common ancestor.\n\nDuring the same period, the Soya Strait between Hokkaido and Sakhalin Island was dry for 75,000 years and it was proposed that the extinct Ezo wolf (\"C. l. hattai\") arrived on Hokkaido from Sakhalin. However, the sequences indicated that it arrived in Hokkaido less than 10,000 YBP. The Ezo wolf was closely related to one of the North American clades, but different to the more southerly Japanese wolf (\"C. l. hodophilax\") that was basal to modern wolves. The Japanese wolf inhabited Kyushu, Shikoku, and Honshu islands but not Hokkaido Island. This indicates that its ancestor may have migrated from the Asian continent through the Korean Peninsula into Japan. The past sea levels of the Korean Strait together with the timing of the Japanese wolf sequences indicated that it arrived to the southern islands less than 20,000 YBP.\n\nThe dog was a very successful invader of North America and had established a widespread ecological niche by the Early–Middle Holocene. There was no overlap in niche between the dog and the wolf in comparison to the dog and other North American canids. By the Late Holocene, the dog's niche area was less in size than researchers had expected to find, indicating that it was limited by biotic factors. These regions include the northeast and northwest of the United States that correlate with the greatest densities of early human occupation, indicating that the dog had \"defected\" from the wolf niche to the human niche and explains why the dog's niche area was not as large as expected. The separation between dog and wolf may reflect the rapid rate in which domestication occurred, including the possibility of a second domestication event occurring in North America. Packs of wolves and hunter-gatherers hunt similar prey in a similar way within a similar group social structure that may have facilitated wolf domestication.\n\nThe wolf was exterminated in the southern part of their historic geographical range in North America by the middle of the 20th century. An mDNA study of 34 wolf remains from North America dated between 1856 and 1915 found their genetic diversity to be twice that of modern wolves in these regions, and two thirds of the haplotypes identified were unique. These results indicate that a historic population of several hundred thousand wolves once existed in Mexico and the western US.\n\nIn 1993, a study proposed that the wolves of North America display skull traits more similar towards the coyote than those wolves from Eurasia. In 2016, a whole-genome DNA study proposed, based on the assumptions made, that all of the North American wolves and coyotes diverged from a common ancestor less than 6,000–117,000 years ago. The study also indicated that all North America wolves have a significant amount of coyote ancestry and all coyotes some degree of wolf ancestry, and that the red wolf and eastern wolf are highly admixed with different proportions of gray wolf and coyote ancestry. One test indicated a wolf/coyote divergence time of 51,000 years before present that matched other studies indicating that the extant wolf came into being around this time. Another test indicated that the red wolf diverged from the coyote between 55,000-117,000 years before present and the Great Lakes region wolf 32,000 years before present. Other tests and modelling showed various divergence ranges and the conclusion was a range of less than 6,000 and 117,000 years before present. This finding conflicts with the fossil record that indicates a coyote-like specimen dated to 1 million years before present.\n\nThe domestic dog (\"Canis lupus familiaris\") is the most widely abundant large carnivore. Over the past million years, numerous wolf-like forms existed but their turnover has been high, and modern wolves are not the lineal ancestors of dogs. Although research had suggested that dogs and wolves were genetically very close relatives, later phylogenetic analysis strongly supported the hypothesis that dogs and wolves are reciprocally monophylic taxa that form two sister clades. This suggests that none of the modern wolf populations are related to the wolves that were first domesticated and the wolf ancestor of dogs is therefore presumed extinct. Recent mitochondrial DNA analyses of ancient and modern gray wolf specimens supports a pattern of population reduction and turnover. An alternate proposal is that during the ecological upheavals of the Late Pleistocene all of the remaining members of a dwindling lineage joined humans.\n\nIn 2016, a study investigated for the first time the population subdivisions, demography, and the relationships of gray wolves based on their whole-genome sequences. The study indicated that the dog was a divergent subspecies of the gray wolf and was derived from a now-extinct ghost population of Late Pleistocene wolves, and the dog and the dingo are not separate species. The genome-wide phylogenetic tree indicated a genetic divergence between New World and Old World wolves, which was then followed by a divergence between the dog and Old World wolves 27,000YBP - 29,000 YBP. The dog forms a sister taxon with Eurasian gray wolves but not North American wolves. The dog had considerable pre-ancestry after its divergence from the Old World wolves before it separated into distinct lineages that are nearly as distinct from one another as they are from wolves. The study suggested that previous datings based on the divergence between wolves and coyotes of one million years ago using fossils of what appeared to be coyote-like specimens may not reflect the ancestry of the modern forms.\nThe study indicated that the Mexican wolf was also a divergent form of gray wolf, suggesting that may have been part of an early invasion into North America. The Tibetan wolf was found to be the most highly divergent of the Old World wolves, had suffered a historical population bottleneck and had only recently recolonized the Tibetan Plateau. Glaciation may have caused its habitat loss, genetic isolation then local adaption.\n\nThe study indicated that there has been extensive genetic admixture between domestic dogs and wolves, with up to 25% of the genome of Old World wolves showing signs of dog ancestry, possibly as the result of gene flow from dogs into wolves that were ancestral to all modern wolves. There was evidence of significant gene flow between the European wolves plus the Israeli wolf with the basenji and boxer, which suggests admixture between the lineages ancestral to these breeds and wolf populations. For the lowland Asian wolves: the Central Russian and East Russian wolves and all of the lowland Chinese wolves had significant gene flow with the Chinese indigenous dogs, the Tibetan Mastiff and the dingo. For the highland Asian wolves: The Tibetan wolves did not show significant admixture with dogs; however, the Qinghai wolves had gene flow with the dingo and one of them had gene flow with the Chinese dogs. The New World wolves did not show any gene flow with the boxer, dingo or Chinese indigenous dogs but there was indication of gene flow between the Mexican wolf and the African basenji. All species within the \"Canis\" genus, the wolf-like canids, are phylogenetically closely related with 78 chromosomes and can potentially interbreed. There was indication of gene flow into the golden jackal from the population ancestral to all wolves and dogs (11.3%–13.6%) and much lower rates (up to 2.8%) from extant wolf populations.\n\nThe data indicated that all wolves shared similar population trajectories, followed by population decline that coincided with the expansion of modern humans worldwide and their technology for capturing large game. Late Pleistocene carnivores would have been social living in large prides, clans and packs in order to hunt the larger game available at that time, and these larger groups would have been more conspicuous targets for human persecutors. Large dogs accompanying the humans may have accelerated the rate of decline of carnivores that competed for game, therefore humans expanded across Eurasia, encountered wolves, domesticated some and possibly caused the decline of others.\n\nThe study concluded that admixture had confounded the ability to make inferences about the place of dog domestication. Past studies based on SNPs, genome-wide similarities with Chinese wolves, and lower linkage disequilibrium might reflect regional admixture between dogs with wolves and gene flow between dog populations, with divergent dog breeds possibly maintaining more wolf ancestry in their genome. The study proposed that analysis of ancient DNA might be a better approach.\n\nIn the same year, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These genes are thought to affect tameness and emotional processing ability. Another study provided a listing of all of the gray wolf and dog mDNA haplotypes combined in the one phylogenetic tree.\n\nThe dingo (\"Canis lupus dingo\") refers to the dog found in Australia. The dingo is a divergent subspecies of the gray wolf and is not a separate species, and is considered genetically to be a basal member of the domestic dog clade. The genetic evidence indicates that the dingo originated from East Asian domestic dogs and was introduced through the South-East Asian archipelago into Australia, with a common ancestry between the Australian dingo and the New Guinea Singing Dog.\n\nIn May 2015 a study was conducted on a partial rib-bone of a wolf specimen (named \"\"Taimyr-1\"\") found near the Bolshaya Balakhnaya River in the Taimyr Peninsula of Arctic North Asia, that was AMS radiocarbon dated to 34,900 YBP. The sample provided the first draft of the nuclear genome of a Pleistocene carnivore, and the sequence was deposited in the European Nucleotide Archive and classified as \"Canis lupus\".\n\nUsing the Taimyr-1 specimen's radiocarbon date, its genome sequence and that of a modern wolf, a direct estimate of the genome-wide mutation rate in dogs / wolves could be made to calculate the time of divergence. The data indicated that the previously unknown Taimyr-1 lineage was a wolf population separate to modern wolves and dogs and indicated that the Taimyr-1 genotype, gray wolves and dogs diverged from a now-extinct common ancestor before the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum, 27,000–40,000 years ago. The separation of the dog and wolf did not have to coincide with selective breeding by humans. Such an early divergence is consistent with several paleontological reports of dog-like canids dated up to 36,000 YBP, as well as evidence that domesticated dogs most likely accompanied early colonizers into the Americas.\n\nComparison to the gray wolf lineage indicated that Taimyr-1 was basal to gray wolves from the Middle East, China, Europe and North America but shared a substantial amount of history with the present-day gray wolves after their divergence from the coyote. This implies that the ancestry of the majority of gray wolf populations today stems from an ancestral population that lived less than 35,000 years ago but before the inundation of the Bering Land Bridge with the subsequent isolation of Eurasian and North American wolves.\n\nA comparison of the ancestry of the Taimyr-1 lineage to the dog lineage indicated that some modern dog breeds have a closer association with either the gray wolf or Taimyr-1 due to admixture. The Saarloos wolfdog showed more association with the gray wolf, which is in agreement with the documented historical crossbreeding with gray wolves in this breed. Taimyr-1 shared more alleles (gene expressions) with those breeds that are associated with high latitudes: the Siberian husky and Greenland dog that are also associated with arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the Shar Pei and Finnish spitz. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, although an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taimyr-1 population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. These results can be explained either by a very early presence of dogs in northern Eurasia or by the genetic legacy of Taimyr-1 being preserved in northern wolf populations until the arrival of dogs at high latitudes. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates that the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.\n\nAn attempt to explore admixture between Taimyr-1 and gray wolves produced unreliable results.\n\nAs the Taimyr wolf had contributed to the genetic makeup of the Arctic breeds, a later study suggested that descendants of the Taimyr wolf survived until dogs were domesticated in Europe and arrived at high latitudes where they mixed with local wolves, and these both contributed to the modern Arctic breeds. Based on the most widely accepted oldest zooarchaeological dog remains, domestic dogs most likely arrived at high latitudes within the last 15,000 years. The mutation rates calibrated from both the Taimyr wolf and the Newgrange dog genomes suggest that modern wolf and dog populations diverged from a common ancestor between 20,000–60,000 YBP. This indicates that either dogs were domesticated much earlier than their first appearance in the archaeological record, or they arrived in the Arctic early, or both.\n\nThe finding of a second wolf specimen from the same area (“\"Taimry-2\"”) and dated to 42,000 YBP has also been reported but yielded only mitochondrial DNA.\n\nIn 2015, a study looked at the mitochondrial control region sequences of 13 ancient canid remains and one modern wolf from five sites across Arctic north-east Siberia. The fourteen canids revealed nine mitochondrial haplotypes, three of which were on record and the others not reported before. The phylogentic tree generated from the sequences showed that four of the Siberian canids dated 28,000 YBP and one \"Canis c.f. variabilis\" dated 360,000 YBP were highly divergent. The haplotype designated as S805 (28,000 YBP) from the Yana River was one mutation away from another haplotype S902 (8,000 YBP) that represents Clade A of the modern wolf and domestic dog lineages. Closely related to this haplotype was one that was found in the recently-extinct Japanese wolf. Several ancient haplotypes were oriented around S805, including \"Canis c.f. variabilis\" (360,000 YBP), Belgium (36,000 YBP - the \"Goyet dog\"), Belgium (30,000 YBP), and Konsteki, Russia (22,000 YBP). Given the position of the S805 haplotype on the phylogenetic tree, it may potentially represent a direct link from the progenitor (including \"Canis c.f. variabilis\") to the domestic dog and modern wolf lineages. The gray wolf is thought to be ancestral to the domestic dog, however its relationship to \"C. variabilis\", and the genetic contribution of \"C. variabilis\" to the dog, is the subject of debate.\n\nThe Zhokhov Island (8,700 YBP) and Aachim (1,700 YBP) canid haplotypes fell within the domestic dog clade, cluster with S805, and also share their haplotypes with - or are one mutation away from - the Tibetan wolf (\"C. l. filchneri\") and the recently-extinct Japanese wolf (\"C. l. hodophilax\"). This may indicate that these canids retained the genetic signature of admixture with regional wolf populations. Another haplotype designated as S504 (47,000 YBP) from Duvanny Yar appeared on the phylogenetic tree as not being connected to wolves (both ancient and modern) yet ancestral to dogs, and may represent a genetic source for regional dogs.\n\nIn 2015, a study looked at the paleoecology of large carnivores across the Mammoth steppe during the Late Pleistocene by using stable isotope analysis of their fossil collagen to reconstruct their diets. Based on testing in Belgium, around 40,000 YBP the Cave hyenas preyed on mammoth, woolly rhinoceros, horses and reindeer, with cave lions taking reindeer and young cave bears. Wolves appear to have been out-competed by cave hyenas and had their diet restricted to chamois, giant deer and red deer. However, after the Last Glacial Maximum around 14,000 YBP, wolves had access to all prey species, the cave lion was restricted to reindeer, and the cave hyena had gone extinct. The data suggests that the extinction of the cave hyena allowed the wolf to become the dominant predator rather than the cave lion, just before the cave lion's extinction. Another study indicated that the wolf thrived compared to the cave hyena when there was greater snow cover.\n\nThe gray wolf (\"C. lupus\") inhabits environments ranging from the Arctic tundra to the deserts and dry shrublands of the Middle East. It was one of the most widely distributed large terrestrial mammals in the Late Quaternary when its range covered most of the Holarctic, and this range has been expanded in modern times alongside humans in the form of the domestic dog (\"C. lupus familiaris\"). Apart from domestication, humans have had a negative impact on the wolf by restricting its habitat through persecution. This has caused a dramatic decrease in its population size over the last two centuries. The shrinking of its habitats that overlap with those of close-relatives such as dogs and coyotes have led to numerous occurrences of hybridization. These events, in addition to recent turnovers (extinctions and repopulations by other geneotypes), has made the unravelling of the phylogeographic history of the wolf difficult.\n\nAn ecotype is a variant in which the phenotypic differences are too few or too subtle to warrant being classified as a subspecies. These can occur in the same geographic region where distinct habitats such as meadow, forest, swamp, and sand dunes provide ecological niches. Where similar ecological conditions occur in widely separated places it is possible for a similar ecotype to occur. This is different to a subspecies, which may exist across a number of different habitats. In animals, ecotypes can be regarded as micro-subspecies that owe their differing characteristics to the effects of a very local environment. Ecotypes have no taxonomic rank.\n\nGray wolves have a wide, natural distribution across the Holarctic that includes many different habitats, which can vary from the high arctic to dense forests, open steppe and deserts. The genetic differences between different populations of gray wolves is tightly linked to the type of habitat in which they live. Differences in genetic markers among the Scandinavian wolf population has arisen in only just over a decade due to their small population size, which indicates that these differences are not dependent on a long time spent in isolation and that larger population patterns can evolve in just a few thousand years. These differences can also include fur color and density, and body size. The differences can also include behavior, as coastal wolves eat fish and tundra wolves migrate. These differences have been observed between two wolf populations that are living in close proximity. It has been shown that mountain wolves do not interbreed with nearby coastal wolves, and the Alps of France and Switzerland have been repopulated with wolves from the mountains of nearby Italy and from the far away mountains of Croatia rather than from the nearer lowlands, which indicates that distance is not the driving force in differences between the two ecomorphs.\n\nIn 2013, a genetic study found that the wolf population in Europe was divided along a north-south axis and formed five major clusters. Three clusters were identified occupying southern and central Europe in Italy, the Carpathians, and the Dinaric-Balkans. Another two clusters were identified occupying north-central Europe and the Ukrainian steppe. The Italian wolf consisted of an isolated population with low genetic diversity. Wolves from Croatia, Bulgaria, and Greece formed the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. Wolves from Finland, Latvia, Belarus, Poland and Russia formed the north-central Europe cluster with wolves from the Carpathians cluster a mixture of wolves from the north-central cluster and the Dinaric-Balkans cluster. The wolves from the Carpathians were more similar to the wolves from the Ukrainian Steppe than they were to wolves from north-central Europe. These clusters may have been the result of expansion from glacial refugia, an adaptation to local environments, and landscape fragmentation and the killing of wolves in some areas by humans.\n\nIn 2016, two studies compared the sequences of 42,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms in North American gray wolves and found that they formed six ecotypes. These six wolf ecotypes were named West Forest, Boreal Forest, Arctic, High Arctic, Baffin, and British Columbia. The studies found that precipitation and mean diurnal temperature range were the most influential variables on sequence variation. These findings were in accord with previous findings that precipitation influenced morphology, and that vegetation and habitat type influenced wolf differences. One of these studies found that the variation in 11 key genes had an impact on wolf vision, sense of smell, hearing, coat color, metabolism, and immunity. The study identified 1,040 genes that are potentially under selection due to habitat variation, and therefore that there was evidence of local adaption of the wolf ecotypes at a molecular level. Most notable was the positive selection of genes that influence vision, coat color, metabolism and immunity in the Artic and High Arctic ecotypes, and that the British Columbia ecotype also has a unique set of adaptions. The local adaptation of a wolf ecotype most likely reflects a wolf’s preference to remain in the type of habitat that it was born into.\n\nEcological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence gray wolf genetic population structure and cranio-dental plasticity. During the Last Glacial Maximum, there was greater wolf genetic diversity than there is today, and within the Pleistocene gray wolf population the variations between local environments would have encouraged a range of wolf ecotypes that were genetically, morphologically and ecologically distinct from one another.\n\nThe oldest \"Canis\" remains found in Europe were from France and dated to 3.1 million YBP, followed by \"Canis cf. etruscus\" (where cf. in Latin means confer, uncertain) from Italy dated to 2.2 million YBP. \"C. lupus\" first appeared in Italy during Marine Isotope Stage 9 (337,000 YBP). In Britain, it was the only canid species present from MIS 7 (243,000 YBP), with the oldest record from Pontnewydd Cave in north Wales. During the Ice Age, Britain was separated from Europe by only the Channel River.\n\nA study of Pleistocene \"C. lupus\" in Britain at different time periods found that its abilities to crush, slice meat and eat bone highlighted its cranio-dental plasticity. These responses to dietary changes showed species-wide dietary shifts, and not just local ecomorphs, in response to climatic and ecological variables. The survival of \"C. lupus\" during the Pleistocene can be attributed largely to its plastic cranio-dental morphology.\n\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum 20,000 YBP, the Pleistocene steppe stretched across northern and central Eurasia and through Beringia into North America. The Pleistocene wolves of Beringia, and perhaps those across the steppe, were adapted to this habitat. Their tooth and skull morphology indicates that they specialized in preying on now-extinct Pleistocene megafauna, and their tooth wear indicates that their behavior was different to modern wolves. This highlights the success of \"C. lupus\" as a species in adapting to different environmental conditions. This gray wolf ecomorph became extinct at the end of the glaciation, along with the horse and other species on which it depended, and was replaced by wolves from southern North America. This indicates that specialized wolf ecomorphs can become extinct when their environment changes even though the habitat may still support other wolves. Wolves went through a population bottleneck 20,000 YBP that coincides with the Last Glacial Maximum, which indicates that many wolf populations may have gone extinct at the same time as the Beringian wolves.\n\nThere are a small number of \"Canis\" remains that have been found at Goyet Cave, Belgium (36,500 YBP) Razboinichya Cave, Russia (33,500 YBP) Kostenki 8, Russia (33,500–26,500 YBP) Predmosti, Czech Republic (31,000 YBP) and Eliseevichi 1, Russia (17,000 YBP). Based on cranial morphometric study of the characteristics thought to be associated with the domestication process, these have been proposed as early Paleolithic dogs. These characteristics of shortened rostrum, tooth crowding, and absence or rotation of premolars have been documented in both ancient and modern wolves. Rather than representing early dogs, these specimens may represent \"a morphologically distinct local, now extinct, population of wolves\".\n",
                "Origin of the domestic dog\n\nThe origin of the domestic dog is not clear. The domestic dog is a member of the genus \"Canis\", which forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant terrestrial carnivore. The closest living relative of the dog is the extant gray wolf and there is no evidence of any other canine contributing to its genetic lineage. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa as modern wolves are not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The archaeological record shows the first undisputed dog remains buried beside humans 14,700 years ago, with disputed remains occurring 36,000 years ago. These dates imply that the earliest dogs arose in the time of human hunter-gatherers and not agriculturists. The dog was the first species to be domesticated.\n\nWhere the genetic divergence of dog and wolf took place remains controversial, with the most plausible proposals spanning Western Europe, Central Asia, and East Asia. This has been made more complicated by the most recent proposal that fits the available evidence, which is that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian groups; these, before going extinct, were domesticated independently into two distinct dog populations between 14,000–6,400 years ago. The Western Eurasian dog population was partially and gradually replaced by East Asian dogs introduced by humans at least 6,400 years ago.\n\nSix million years ago at the close of the Miocene era, the earth's climate was gradually cooling and this would lead to the glaciations of the Pliocene and the Pleistocene (the Ice Age). In many areas the forests and savannahs were being replaced with steppe or grasslands and only those creatures that could adapt would survive. On opposite sides of the planet, two very different lineages would adapt to these changes and their evolution would produce two species that would become the most widely distributed of mammals. In southern North America, small woodland foxes were growing bigger and becoming more adapted to running, and by the late Miocene the first of the genus \"Canis\" had arisen, the ancestors of coyotes, wolves and the domestic dog. In eastern Africa, a split was occurring among the large primates. Some would remain in the trees, while others would move out of the trees, learn to walk upright, develop enlarged brains, and learn to avoid predators while becoming a predator themselves in the more open country. The two lineages would ultimately meet on the Eurasian continent. \"They were individual animals and people involved, from our perspective, in a biological and cultural process that involved linking not only their lives but the evolutionary fate of their heirs in ways, we must assume, they could never have imagined.\"\n\nDog evolution (from the Latin \"\": \"unrolling\") is the biological descent with modification that led to the domestic dog. This process encompasses small-scale evolution (changes in gene frequency in a population from one generation to the next) and large-scale evolution (the descent of different species from a common ancestor over many generations).\n\nThe domestic dog is the most widely abundant large carnivore. When and where dogs were first domesticated has taxed geneticists for the past 20 years and archaeologists for many decades longer. Identifying the earliest dogs is difficult because the key morphological characters that are used by zooarchaeologists to differentiate domestic dogs from their wild wolf ancestors (size and position of teeth, dental pathologies, and size and proportion of cranial and postcranial elements) were not yet fixed during the initial phases of the domestication process. The range of natural variation among these characters that may have existed in ancient wolf populations, and the time it took for these traits to appear in dogs, are unknown.\n\nHowever, recent studies based on genetics propose five generalizations about dogs.\n\n\nThe extinction of the wolves that were the direct ancestors of dogs, and the sustained admixture between different dog and wolf populations over at least the last 10,000 years, has blurred the genetic signatures and confounded efforts of researchers at pinpointing the origins of dogs. An alternate proposal is that during the ecological upheavals of the Late Pleistocene, all of the remaining members of a dwindling lineage joined with humans.\n\nDuring the last Ice Age, the most recent peak is known as the Last Glacial Maximum when a vast mammoth steppe stretched from Spain eastwards across Eurasia and over the Bering land bridge into Alaska and the Yukon. The continent of Europe was much colder and drier than it is today, with polar desert in the north and the remainder steppe or tundra. Forest and woodland were almost non-existent except for isolated pockets in the mountain ranges of southern Europe. The Late Pleistocene was characterized by a series of severe and rapid climate oscillations with regional temperature changes of up to 16 °C, which has been correlated with Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions. There is no evidence of megafaunal extinctions at the height of the Last Glacial Maximum, indicating that increasing cold and glaciation were not factors. Multiple events appear to have caused the rapid replacement of one species by another one within the same genus, or one population by another within the same species, across a broad area. As some species became extinct, so too did the predators that depended on them. The ancestors of modern humans first reached Europe, with their remains dated 43,000-45,000 years BP in Italy and in Britain.\n\nDuring the Last Glacial Maximum there were two types of wolf. The cold north of the Holarctic was spanned by a large, robust, wolf ecomorph that specialised in preying on megafauna. Another more slender form lived in the warmer south in refuges from the glaciation. When the planet warmed and the Late Glacial Maximum came to a close, whole species of megafauna became extinct along with their predators, leaving the more gracile wolf to dominate the Holarctic. The more gracile wolf was the ancestor of the modern gray wolf, which is the dog's sister but not its ancestor as the dog shows a closer genetic relationship to the now-extinct megafaunal wolf.\"\n\nThe date estimated for the evolutionary divergence of a domestic lineage from a wild one does not necessarily indicate the start of the domestication process but it does provide an upper boundary. The divergence of the domestic horse from the lineage that led to the modern Przewalski’s horse is estimated at 45,000 YBP but the archaeological record indicates 5,500 YBP. The variance could be due to the modern wild population not being the direct ancestor of the domestic one, or the impact of a split due to climate, topography, or other environmental changes. The divergence time does not imply domestication during this specific period. Some researchers propose that the \"dog was the dog before it was domesticated\" and that the ancestor of \"Canis familiaris\" was a wild \"Canis familiaris\", which had diverged from a common ancestor along with the gray wolf.\n\nEarly mitochondrial DNA analysis indicated that if the dog had descended from the modern gray wolf then the divergence would have occurred 135,000 YBP. Two later studies using whole genome sequencing indicated divergence times of 32,000 YBP or 11,000-16,000 YBP, with the assumed mutation rate \"the dominant source of uncertainty in dating the origin of dogs.\"\n\nIn 2015, a study was conducted on a partial rib-bone (designated as Taimyr-1) found near the Bolshaya Balakhnaya River in the Taymyr Peninsula, Arctic North Asia, that was AMS radiocarbon dated to 34,900 YBP. The sample provided the first draft genome from the cell nucleus of a Pleistocene carnivore and the sequence was identified as belonging to \"Canis lupus\". The sequence indicated that the Taimyr-1 lineage was separate to modern wolves and dogs. Using the Taimyr-1 specimen's radiocarbon date in addition to its genome sequence compared to that of a modern wolf, a direct estimate of the mutation rate in dogs and wolves could be made to calculate the time of divergence. The study indicated that the Taimyr-1 population, gray wolves and dogs diverged from a now-extinct common ancestor before the peak of the Last Glacial Maximum 27,000-40,000 years ago. Such an early divergence is consistent with several paleontological reports of dog-like canids dated up to 36,000 YBP, as well as evidence that domesticated dogs most likely accompanied early colonizers into the Americas. The study proposed that the timing of this separation of the dog and wolf did not have to coincide with selective breeding by humans.\n\nIn 2017, a study compared the nuclear genome sequences of Neolithic dog specimens with sequences from over 5,000 dogs and wolves. These Neolithic dog specimens included a dog sample from the Early Neolithic site in Herxheim, Germany dated 7,000 YBP, one from the Late Neolithic site of Kirschbaum (Cherry Tree) Cave near Forchheim, Germany dated 4,700 YBP, and one found in the Late Neolithic passage grave at Newgrange, Ireland dated 4,800 YBP. The study calculated a mutation rate for the 7,000 YBP Neolithic dog and found that it matched the mutation rate of the Taimyr-1 specimen, and noted that this also matched the mutation rate for the Newgrange dog that had been calculated in an earlier study. Using the 7,000 YBP specimen and this mutation rate, the dog-wolf divergence time is estimated to have occurred 36,900-41,500 YBP and this is consistent with the timing found with the Taimyr-1 specimen in an earlier study.\n\nWhere the genetic divergence of dog and wolf took place remains controversial, with the most plausible proposals spanning Western Europe, Central Asia, and East Asia. This has been made more complicated by the most recent proposal that fits the available evidence, which is that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian wolves, these were then domesticated independently before going extinct into two distinct dog populations between 14,000-6,400 years ago, and then the Western Eurasian dog population was partially and gradually replaced by East Asian dogs that were brought by humans at least 6,400 years ago.\n\nEurope\nIn 2007, a study of maternal mDNA sequences from dogs and wolves indicated that their haplotypes resolved into four monophyletic clades (a grouping that includes its ancestor), of which two clades showed a strong relationship between dogs and the wolves of Europe.\n\nSouth East Asia:\nIn 2009, a study of the maternal mitochondrial genome indicated the origin in south-eastern Asia south of the Yangtze River as more dog haplogroups had been found there. Paternal Y-chromosome DNA sequences indicated the south-western part of south-eastern Asia that is south of the Yangtze River (comprising South-East Asia and the Chinese provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi) because of the greater diversity of yDNA haplogroups found in that region. A criticism of this proposal is that no wolf remains have been found in this region and the earliest archaeological evidence of a dog dates to only 4,700 YBP.\n\nMiddle East: In 2010, a study using single nucleotide polymorphisms indicated that dogs originated in the Middle East due to the greater sharing of haplotypes between dogs and Middle Eastern gray wolves, else there may have been significant admixture between some regional breeds and regional wolves. In 2011, a study found that there had been dog-wolf hybridization and not an independent domestication.\n\nEast Asia: In 2002, a study of maternal mDNA indicated that the dog diverged from its ancestor in East Asia because there were more dog mDNA haplotypes found there than in other parts of the world, but this was rebutted because village dogs in Africa also show a similar haplotype diversity. In 2015, a whole genome analysis of modern dog and wolf sequences concluded that based on the genetic diversity of today's East Asian dogs, the dog had originated in southern East Asia, followed by a migration of a subset of ancestral dogs 15,000 YBP towards the Middle East, Africa and Europe and reaching Europe 10,000 YBP. Then, one of these lineages migrated back to northern China and admixed with endemic Asian lineages before migrating to the Americas. A criticism of this proposal is that no dog remains date beyond 12,000 YBP in this region but date to 14,000 YBP in western Europe, however it is accepted that archaeological studies in the Far East are generally lagging behind those in Europe.\n\nCentral Asia: In 2015, a study looked at 85,805 genetic markers of autosomal, maternal mitochondrial genome and paternal Y chromosome diversity in 4,676 purebred dogs from 161 breeds and 549 village dogs from 38 countries. Some dog populations in the Neotropics and the South Pacific are almost completely derived from European stock, and other regions show clear admixture between indigenous and European dogs. The indigenous dog populations of Vietnam, India, and Egypt show minimal evidence of European admixture, and exhibit indicators consistent with a Central Asian domestication origin, followed by a population expansion in East Asia. The study could not rule out the possibility that dogs were domesticated elsewhere and subsequently arrived in and diversified from Central Asia. Studies of extant dogs cannot exclude the possibility of earlier domestication events that subsequently died out or were overwhelmed by more modern populations.\n\nNo agreement using modern DNA: In 2016, a whole-genome study of wolves and dogs concluded that admixture had confounded the ability to make inferences about the place of dog domestication. Past studies based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms, genome-wide similarities with Chinese wolves, and lower linkage disequilibrium might reflect regional admixture between dogs with wolves and gene flow between dog populations, with genetically divergent dog breeds possibly maintaining more wolf ancestry in their genome. The study proposed that the analysis of ancient DNA might be a better approach.\n\nIn his 1868 book on \"Variation under Domestication\", Charles Darwin assessed the arguments for single or multiple origins of dogs, and noted the paleontological research of de Blainville who proposed that dogs were descended from a single extinct species. In 1934, an eminent paleontologist indicated that the ancestor of the dog lineage may have been the extinct \"Canis lupus variabilis\". In 1950, a morphological study of Japanese prehistoric dogs compared to extant wolves concluded: \"Therefore the living wolf kinds have nothing to do with the ancestral forms of the prehistoric dog races.\" In 1999, a study emphasized that while molecular genetic data seem to support the origin of dogs from wolves, dogs may have descended from a now extinct species of canid whose closest living relative was the wolf. The dog's lineage may have been contributed to from a ghost population. The advent of rapid and inexpensive DNA sequencing technology has made it possible to significantly increase the resolving power of genetic data taken from both modern and ancient domestic dog genomes. Attention was now turned to studies based on ancient DNA from fossil canids.\n\nEurope: In 2013, a study analysed the complete and partial mitochondrial genome sequences of 18 fossil canids dated from 1,000 to 36,000 YBP from the Old and New Worlds, and compared these with the complete mitochondrial genome sequences from modern wolves and dogs. Phylogenetic analysis showed that modern dog mDNA haplotypes resolve into four monophyletic clades with strong statistical support, and these have been designated by researchers as clades A-D. Based on the specimens used in this study, clade A included 64% of the dogs sampled and these were sister to a 14,500 YBP wolf sequence from the near Thayngen in the canton of Schaffhausen, Switzerland, with a most recent common ancestor estimated to 32,100 YBP. This group of dogs matched three fossil pre-Columbian New World dogs dated between 1,000 and 8,500 YBP, which supported the hypothesis that pre-Columbian dogs in the New World share ancestry with modern dogs and that they likely arrived with the first humans to the New World. Clade B included 22% of the dog sequences and was related to modern wolves from Sweden and the Ukraine, with a common recent ancestor estimated to 9,200 YBP. However, this relationship might represent mitochondrial genome introgression from wolves because dogs were domesticated by this time. Clade C included 12% of the dogs sampled and these were sister to two ancient dogs from the Bonn-Oberkassel cave (14,700 YBP) and the Kartstein cave (12,500 YBP) near Mechernich in Germany, with a common recent ancestor estimated to 16,000–24,000 YBP. Clade D contained sequences from 2 Scandinavian breeds (Jamthund, Norwegian Elkhound) and were sister to another 14,500 YBP wolf sequence also from the Kesserloch cave, with a common recent ancestor estimated to 18,300 YBP. Its branch is phylogenetically rooted in the same sequence as the \"Altai dog\" (not a direct ancestor). The data from this study indicated a European origin for dogs that was estimated at 18,800–32,100 years ago based on the genetic relationship of 78% of the sampled dogs with ancient canid specimens found in Europe. The data supports the hypothesis that dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture and was initiated close to the Last Glacial Maximum when hunter-gatherers preyed on megafauna.\n\nThe study found that three ancient Belgium canids (the 36,000 YBP \"Goyet dog\" cataloged as \"Canis\" species, along with Belgium 30,000 YBP and 26,000 years YBP cataloged as \"Canis lupus\") formed an ancient clade that was the most divergent group. The study found that the skulls of the \"Goyet dog\" and the \"Altai dog\" had some dog-like characteristics and proposed that the may have represented an aborted domestication episode. If so, there may have been originally more than one ancient domestication event for dogs as there was for domestic pigs.\n\nA criticism of the European proposal is that dogs in East Asia show more genetic diversity. However, dramatic differences in genetic diversity can be influenced both by an ancient and recent history of inbreeding. A counter-comment is that the modern European breeds only emerged in the 19th century, and that throughout history global dog populations experienced numerous episodes of diversification and homogenization, with each round further reducing the power of genetic data derived from modern breeds to help infer their early history.\n\nArctic North-East Siberia: In 2015, a study looked at the mitochondrial control region sequences of 13 ancient canid remains and one modern wolf from five sites across Arctic north-east Siberia. The fourteen canids revealed nine mitochondrial haplotypes, three of which were on record and the others not reported before. The phylogentic tree generated from the sequences showed that four of the Siberian canids dated 28,000 YBP and one \"Canis c.f. variabilis\" dated 360,000 YBP were highly divergent. The haplotype designated as S805 (28,000 YBP) from the Yana River was one mutation away from another haplotype S902 (8,000 YBP) that represents Clade A of the modern wolf and domestic dog lineages. Closely related to this haplotype was one that was found in the recently-extinct Japanese wolf. Several ancient haplotypes were oriented around S805, including \"Canis c.f. variabilis\" (360,000 YBP), Belgium (36,000 YBP – the \"Goyet dog\"), Belgium (30,000 YBP), and Konsteki, Russia (22,000 YBP). Given the position of the S805 haplotype on the phylogenetic tree, it may potentially represent a direct link from the progenitor (including \"Canis c.f. variabilis\") to the domestic dog and modern wolf lineages. The gray wolf is thought to be ancestral to the domestic dog, however its relationship to \"C. variabilis\", and the genetic contribution of \"C. variabilis\" to the dog, is the subject of debate.\n\nThe Zhokhov Island (8,700 YBP) and Aachim (1,700 YBP) canid haplotypes fell within the domestic dog clade, cluster with S805, and also share their haplotypes with – or are one mutation away from – the Tibetan wolf (\"C. l. chanco\") and the recently-extinct Japanese wolf (\"C. l. hodophilax\"). This may indicate that these canids retained the genetic signature of admixture with regional wolf populations. Another haplotype designated as S504 (47,000 YBP) from Duvanny Yar appeared on the phylogenetic tree as not being connected to wolves (both ancient and modern) yet ancestral to dogs, and may represent a genetic source for regional dogs.\n\nIn 2009, a study looked at the two earliest dog skulls that had been found at Eliseevich 1 in comparison to other much earlier but morphologically similar fossil skulls that had been found across Europe and concluded that the earlier specimens were \"Paleolithic dogs\", which were morphologically and genetically distinct from Pleistocene wolves that lived in Europe at that time. These also include the 36,000-year-old \"Goyet dog\" and the 33,000-year-old \"Altai dog\".\nLater studies suggested that it was possible for multiple primitive forms of the dog to have existed, including in Europe. European dog populations had undergone extensive turnover during the last 15,000 years that has erased the genomic signature of early European dogs, the genetic heritage of the modern breeds has become blurred due to admixture, and there was the possibility of past domestication events that had gone extinct or had been largely replaced by more modern dog populations.\n\nIn 2016, a study compared the mitochondrial DNA and whole-genome sequences of a worldwide panel of modern dogs, the mDNA sequences of 59 ancient European dog specimens dated 14,000-3,000 YBP, and the nuclear genome sequence of a dog specimen that was found in the Late Neolithic passage grave at Newgrange, Ireland and radiocarbon dated at 4,800 YBP. A genetic analysis of the Newgrange dog showed that it was male, did not possess genetic variants associated with modern coat length nor color, was unable to process starch as efficiently as modern dogs but more efficiently than wolves, and showed ancestry from a population of wolves that could not be found in other dogs nor wolves today. As the taxonomic classification of the \"proto-dog\" Paleolithic dogs as being either dogs or wolves remains controversial, they were excluded from the study. The phylogenetic tree generated from mDNA sequences found a deep division between the Sarloos wolfdog and all other dogs, indicating that breed's recent deriving from the German Shepherd and captive gray wolves. The next largest division was between Eastern Asian dogs and Western Eurasian (Europe and the Middle East) dogs that had occurred between 14,000-6,400 YBP, with the Newgrange dog clustering with the Western Eurasian dogs. The northern breed Greenland dog and the Siberian husky were poorly supported in the tree, possibly indicating mixed ancestry. (See also Taimyr wolf admixture)\n\nThe Newgrange and ancient European dog mDNA sequences could be largely assigned to mDNA haplogroups C and D but modern European dog sequences could be largely assigned to mDNA haplogroups A and B, indicating a turnover of dogs in the past from a place other than Europe. As this split dates older than the Newgrange dog this suggests that the replacement was only partial. The analysis showed that most modern European dogs had undergone a population bottleneck which can be an indicator of travel. The archaeological record shows dog remains dating over 15,000 YBP in Western Eurasia, over 12,500 YBP in Eastern Eurasia, but none older than 8,000 YBP in Central Asia. The study proposed that dogs may have been domesticated separately in both Eastern and Western Eurasia from two genetically distinct and now extinct wolf populations. East Eurasian dogs then made their way with migrating people to Western Europe between 14,000-6,400 YBP where they partially replaced the dogs of Europe. Two domestication events in Western Eurasia and Eastern Eurasia has recently been found for the domestic pig.\n\nThe hypothesis proposed is that an initial wolf population split into East and West Eurasian wolves. These were then domesticated independently before becoming extinct. The Western Eurasian dog population was then partially and gradually replaced by Asian dogs that were brought by humans at least 6400 years ago. A single domestication is thought to be due to chance, however dual domestication on different sides of the world is unlikely to have happened randomly and it suggests that external factors - an environmental driver - may have forced wolves to work together with humans for survival. It is possible that wolves took advantage of resources that humans had, or humans may have been introduced to wolves in an area in which they didn’t previously live.\n\nThe study used the radiocarbon age of the Newgrange dog to calibrate the mutation rate for dogs, which was similar to that calculated for the Late Pleistocene Taimyr wolf. Comparing the sequence of the Newgrange dog using this mutation rate with two modern wolves from Russia gave a divergence time between 20,000-60,000 YBP. However, these two modern wolves may not have been closely related to the population that gave rise to the dog, which may have diverged from their ancestor at a later time.\n\nIn 2017, a study compared the nuclear genome sequences of three Neolithic dog specimens from Germany and Ireland with sequences from over 5,000 dogs and wolves. The study found that modern European dogs descended from their Neolithic ancestors with no evidence of a population turnover found by an earlier study. The study found that a single dog-wolf divergence occurred 36,900-41,500 YBP, followed by a divergence between Southeast Asian and Western Eurasian dogs 17,500-23,900 YBP and this indicates a single dog domestication event occurring between 20,000-40,000 YBP. The study did not support a dual domestication event found by an earlier study.\n\nIn 2011, a study looked at the well-preserved 33,000-year-old skull and left mandible of a dog-like canid that was excavated from Razboinichya Cave in the Altai Mountains of southern Siberia (Central Asia). The morphology was compared to the skulls and mandibles of large Pleistocene wolves from Predmosti, Czech Republic, dated 31,000 YBP, modern wolves from Europe and North America, and prehistoric Greenland dogs from the Thule period (1,000 YBP or later) to represent large-sized but unimproved fully domestic dogs. \"The Razboinichya Cave cranium is virtually identical in size and shape to prehistoric Greenland dogs\" and not the ancient nor modern wolves. However, the lower carnassial tooth fell within the lower range of values for prehistoric wolves and was only slightly smaller than modern European wolves, and the upper carnassial tooth fell within the range of modern wolves. \"We conclude, therefore, that this specimen may represent a dog in the very early stages of domestication, i.e. an incipient dog, rather than an aberrant wolf... The Razboinichya Cave specimen appears to be an incipient dog...and probably represents wolf domestication disrupted by the climatic and cultural changes associated with the Last Glacial Maximum\".\n\nIn 2007, a mtDNA analysis of extinct eastern Beringian wolves showed that two ancient wolves from the Ukraine dated 30,000 YBP and 28,000 YBP and the 33,000 YBP Altai dog had the same sequence as six Beringian wolves, indicating a common maternal ancestor. In 2013, a DNA study of the Altai dog deposited the sequence in GenBank with a classification of \"Canis lupus familiaris\" (dog). \"The analyses revealed that the unique haplotype of the Altai dog is more closely related to modern dogs and prehistoric New World canids than it is to contemporary wolves... This preliminary analysis affirms the conclusion that the Altai specimen is likely an ancient dog with shallow divergence from ancient wolves. These results suggest a more ancient history of the dog outside of the Middle East or East Asia.\" The haplotype groups closest to the Altai dog included such diverse breeds as the Tibetan mastiff, Newfoundland, Chinese crested, cocker spaniel and Siberian husky.\n\nIn November 2013, a study looked at 18 fossil canids and compared these with the complete mitochondrial genome sequences from 49 modern wolves and 77 modern dogs. A more comprehensive analysis of the complete mDNA found that the phylogenetic position of the Altai dog as being either dog or wolf was inconclusive and cataloged its sequence as \"Canis species\" GenBank accession number JX173682. Of four tests, 2 tests showed its sequence to fall within the wolf clade and 2 tests within the dog clade. The sequence strongly suggests a position at the root of a clade uniting two ancient wolf genomes, two modern wolves, as well as two dogs of Scandinavian origin. However, the study does not support its recent common ancestry with the great majority of modern dogs. The study suggests that it may represent an aborted domestication episode. If so, there may have been originally more than one ancient domestication event for dogs as there was for domestic pigs.\n\nIn 2017, two prominent evolutionary biologists reviewed all of the evidence available on dog divergence and supported the specimens from the Altai mountains as being those of dogs from a lineage that is now extinct and that was derived from a population of small wolves that is also now extinct.\n\nDomesticated dogs are more clearly identified when they are associated with human occupation, and those interred side-by-side with human remains provide the most conclusive evidence, (refer to the table below – 14,708 YBP Bonn-Oberkassel dog).\n\nThe table below lists proposed early dog specimens, their location, and timing in years before present (listing the earliest estimate from the earliest and latest estimates provided) and color-coded as purple – Western Eurasia, red – Eastern Eurasia and green – Central Eurasia. The archaeological evidence shows the first dog remains to have been found early in both Western Eurasia and Eastern Eurasia, but not between them in Central Asia until much later.\n\nThe domestication of animals is the scientific theory of the mutual relationship between animals with the humans who have influence on their care and reproduction. Charles Darwin recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of natural selection or from selection on other traits.\n\nThere is a genetic difference between domestic and wild populations. There is also such a difference between the domestication traits that researchers believe to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and the improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates, and were selected during the initial episode of domestication of that animal or plant, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations. The dog was the first domesticant and was established across Eurasia before the end of the Late Pleistocene era, well before cultivation and before the domestication of other animals.\n\nAn apex predator is a predator that sits on the top trophic level of the food chain, while a mesopredator sits further down the food chain and is dependent on smaller animals. Towards the end of the Pleistocene era, most of today's apex predators were mesopredators and this included the wolf. During the ecological upheaval associated with the close of the Late Pleistocene, one type of wolf population rose to become today's apex predator and another joined with humans to become an apex consumer.\n\nIn August 2015, a study undertook an analysis of the complete mitogenome sequences of 555 modern and ancient dogs. The sequences showed an increase in the population size approximately 23,500 YBP, which broadly coincides with the proposed separation of the ancestors of dogs and present-day wolves before the Last Glacial Maximum (refer first divergence). A ten-fold increase in the population size occurred after 15,000 YBP, which may be attributable to domestication events and is consistent with the demographic dependence of dogs on the human population (refer archaeological evidence).\n\nAnimal domestication is a coevolutionary process in which a population responds to selective pressure while adapting to a novel niche that included another species with evolving behaviors.\n\nThe dog is a classic example of a domestic animal that likely traveled a commensal pathway into domestication. The dog was the first domesticant, and was domesticated and widely established across Eurasia before the end of the Pleistocene, well before cultivation or the domestication of other animals. It may have been inevitable that the first domesticated animal came from the order of carnivores as these are less afraid when approaching other species. Within the carnivores, the first domesticated animal would need to exist without an all-meat diet, possess a running and hunting ability to provide its own food, and be of a controllable size to coexist with humans, indicating the family \"Canidae\", and the right temperament with wolves being among the most gregarious and cooperative animals on the planet.\n\nAncient DNA supports the hypothesis that dog domestication preceded the emergence of agriculture and was initiated close to the Last Glacial Maximum 27,000 YBP when hunter-gatherers preyed on megafauna, and when proto-dogs might have taken advantage of carcasses left on site by early hunters, assisted in the capture of prey, or provided defense from large competing predators at kill-sites. Wolves were probably attracted to human campfires by the smell of meat being cooked and discarded refuse in the vicinity, first loosely attaching themselves and then considering these as part of their home territory where their warning growls would alert humans to the approach of outsiders. The wolves most likely drawn to human camps were the less-aggressive, subdominant pack members with lowered flight response, higher stress thresholds, less wary around humans, and therefore better candidates for domestication. The earliest sign of domestication in dogs was the neotonization of skull morphology and the shortening of snout length that results in tooth crowding, reduction in tooth size, and a reduction in the number of teeth, which has been attributed to the strong selection for reduced aggression. This process may have begun during the initial commensal stage of dog domestication, even before humans began to be active partners in the process.\n\nA maternal mitochondrial, paternal Y chromosome, and microsatellite assessment of two wolf populations in North America and combined with satellite telemetry data revealed significant genetic and morphological differences between one population that migrated with and preyed upon caribou, and another territorial ecotype population that remained in a boreal coniferous forest. Though these two populations spend a period of the year in the same place, and though there was evidence of gene flow between them, the difference in prey–habitat specialization has been sufficient to maintain genetic and even coloration divergence. A study has identified the remains of a population of extinct Pleistocene Beringian wolves with unique mitochondrial signatures. The skull shape, tooth wear, and isotopic signatures suggested these were specialist megafauna hunters and scavengers that became extinct while less specialized wolf ecotypes survived. Analogous to the modern wolf ecotype that has evolved to track and prey upon caribou, a Pleistocene wolf population could have begun following mobile hunter-gatherers, thus slowly acquiring genetic and phenotypic differences that would have allowed them to more successfully adapt to the human habitat.\n\nEven today, the wolves on Ellesmere Island do not fear humans, which is thought to be due to them seeing humans so little, and they will approach humans cautiously, curiously and closely.\n\nSome studies have found greater diversity in the genetic markers of dogs from East and Central Asia compared to Europe and have concluded that dogs originated from these regions, despite no archaeological evidence to support the conclusions. One reason for these discrepancies is the sustained admixture between different dog and wolf populations across the Old and New Worlds over at least the last 10,000 years, which has blurred the genetic signatures and confounded efforts of researchers at pinpointing the origins of dogs. Another reason is that none of the modern wolf populations are related to the Pleistocene wolves that were first domesticated. In other words, the extinction of the wolves that were the direct ancestors of dogs has muddied efforts to pinpoint the time and place of dog domestication.\n\nPhylogenetic analysis shows that modern dog mDNA haplotypes resolve into four monophyletic clades with strong statistical support, and these have been designated by researchers as clades A-D. Other studies that included a wider sample of specimens have reported two rare East Asian clades E-F with weaker statistical support. In 2009, a study found that haplogroups A, B and C included 98% of dogs and are found universally distributed across Eurasia, indicating that they were the result of a single domestication event, and that haplogroups D, E, and F were rare and appeared to be the result of regional hybridization with local wolves post-domestication. Haplogroups A and B contained subclades that appeared to be the result of hybridization with wolves post-domestication, because each haplotype within each of these subclades was the result of a female wolf/male dog pairing.\n\nHaplogroup A: Includes 64-65% of dogs. Haplotypes of subclades a2–a6 are derived from post-domestication wolf–dog hybridization.\n\nHaplogroup B: Includes 22-23% of dogs. haplotypes of subclade b2 are derived from post-domestication wolf–dog hybridization.\n\nHaplogroup C: Includes 10-12% of dogs.\n\nHaplogroup D: Derived from post-domestication wolf–dog hybridization in subclade d1 (Scandinavia) and d2 (South-West Asia). The northern Scandinavian subclade d1 hybrid haplotypes originated 480-3,000 YBP and are found in all Sami-related breeds: Finnish Lapphund, Swedish Lapphund, Lapponian Herder, Jamthund, Norwegian Elkhound and Hällefors Elkhound. The maternal wolf sequence that contributed to them has not been matched across Eurasia and its branch is phylogenetically rooted in the same sequence as the Altai dog (not a direct ancestor). The subclade d2 hybrid haplotypes are found in 2.6% of South-West Asian dogs.\n\nHaplogroup E: Derived from post-domestication wolf–dog hybridization in East Asia, (rare distribution in South-East Asia, Korea and Japan).\n\nHaplogroup F: Derived from post-domestication wolf–dog hybridization in Japan. A study of 600 dog specimens found only one dog whose sequence indicated hybridization with the extinct Japanese wolf.\n\nIt is not known whether this hybridization was the result of humans selecting for phenotypic traits from local wolf populations or the result of natural introgression as the dog expanded across Eurasia.\n\nIn May 2015, a study compared the ancestry of the Taimyr-1 wolf lineage to that of dogs and gray wolves.\n\nComparison to the gray wolf lineage indicated that Taimyr-1 was basal to gray wolves from the Middle East, China, Europe and North America but shared a substantial amount of history with the present-day gray wolves after their divergence from the coyote. This implies that the ancestry of the majority of gray wolf populations today stems from an ancestral population that lived less than 35,000 years ago but before the inundation of the Bering Land Bridge with the subsequent isolation of Eurasian and North American wolves.\n\nA comparison of the ancestry of the Taimyr-1 lineage to the dog lineage indicated that some modern dog breeds have a closer association with either the gray wolf or Taimyr-1 due to admixture. The Saarloos wolfdog showed more association with the gray wolf, which is in agreement with the documented historical crossbreeding with gray wolves in this breed. Taimyr-1 shared more alleles (i.e. gene expressions) with those breeds that are associated with high latitudes - the Siberian husky and Greenland dog that are also associated with arctic human populations, and to a lesser extent the Shar Pei and Finnish spitz. An admixture graph of the Greenland dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared material, although an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is consistent with the data. This indicates admixture between the Taimyr-1 population and the ancestral dog population of these four high-latitude breeds. These results can be explained either by a very early presence of dogs in northern Eurasia or by the genetic legacy of Taimyr-1 being preserved in northern wolf populations until the arrival of dogs at high latitudes. This introgression could have provided early dogs living in high latitudes with phenotypic variation beneficial for adaption to a new and challenging environment. It also indicates that the ancestry of present-day dog breeds descends from more than one region.\n\nAn attempt to explore admixture between Taimyr-1 and gray wolves produced unreliable results.\n\nAs the Taimyr wolf had contributed to the genetic makeup of the Arctic breeds, a later study suggested that descendants of the Taimyr wolf survived until dogs were domesticated in Europe and arrived at high latitudes where they mixed with local wolves, and these both contributed to the modern Arctic breeds. Based on the most widely accepted oldest zooarchaeological dog remains, domestic dogs most likely arrived at high latitudes within the last 15,000 years. The mutation rates calibrated from both the Taimyr wolf and the Newgrange dog genomes suggest that modern wolf and dog populations diverged from a common ancestor between 20,000 and 60,000 YBP. This indicates that either dogs were domesticated much earlier than their first appearance in the archaeological record, or they arrived in the Arctic early, or both.\n\nCharles Darwin recognized the small number of traits that made domestic species different from their wild ancestors. He was also the first to recognize the difference between conscious selective breeding in which humans directly select for desirable traits, and unconscious selection where traits evolve as a by-product of natural selection or from selection on other traits. Domestic animals have variations in coat color as well as texture, dwarf and giant varieties, and changes in their reproductive cycle, and many others have tooth crowding and floppy ears.\n\nAlthough it is easy to assume that each of these traits was uniquely selected for by hunter-gatherers and early farmers, beginning in 1959 Dmitry Belyayev tested the reactions of silver foxes to a hand placed in their cage and selected the tamest, least aggressive individuals to breed. His hypothesis was that, by selecting a behavioral trait, he could also influence the phenotype of subsequent generations, making them more domestic in appearance. Over the next 40 years, he succeeded in producing foxes with traits that were never directly selected for, including piebald coats floppy ears, upturned tails, shortened snouts, and shifts in developmental timing. In the 1980s, a researcher used a set of behavioral, cognitive, and visible phenotypic markers, such as coat colour, to produce domesticated fallow deer within a few generations. Similar results for tameness and fear have been found for mink and Japanese quail. In addition to demonstrating that domestic phenotypic traits could arise through selection for a behavioral trait, and domestic behavioral traits could arise through the selection for a phenotypic trait, these experiments provided a mechanism to explain how the animal domestication process could have begun without deliberate human forethought and action.\n\nThe genetic difference between domestic and wild populations can be framed within two considerations. The first distinguishes between domestication traits that are presumed to have been essential at the early stages of domestication, and improvement traits that have appeared since the split between wild and domestic populations. Domestication traits are generally fixed within all domesticates and were selected during the initial episode of domestication, whereas improvement traits are present only in a proportion of domesticates, though they may be fixed in individual breeds or regional populations. A second issue is whether traits associated with the domestication syndrome resulted from a relaxation of selection as animals exited the wild environment or from positive selection resulting from intentional and unintentional human preference. Some recent genomic studies on the genetic basis of traits associated with the domestication syndrome have shed light on both of these issues. A study published in 2016 suggested that there have been negative genetic consequences of the domestication process as well, that enrichment of disease-related gene variants accompanied positively selected traits.\n\nIn 2010, a study identified 51 regions of the dog genome that were associated with phenotypic variation among breeds in 57 traits studied, which included body, cranial, dental, and long bone shape and size. There were 3 quantitative trait loci that explained most of the phenotypic variation. Indicators of recent selection were shown by many of the 51 genomic regions that were associated with traits that define a breed, which include body size, coat characteristics, and ear floppiness. Geneticists have identified more than 300 genetic loci and 150 genes associated with coat color variability. Knowing the mutations associated with different colors has allowed the correlation between the timing of the appearance of variable coat colors in horses with the timing of their domestication. Other studies have shown how human-induced selection is responsible for the allelic variation in pigs. Together, these insights suggest that, although natural selection has kept variation to a minimum before domestication, humans have actively selected for novel coat colors as soon as they appeared in managed populations.\n\nIn 2015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication. A model that fitted the data included admixture with a now extinct ghost population of wild pigs during the Pleistocene. The study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at genetic loci that affect behavior and morphology. The study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created domestication islands in the genome. The same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.\n\nIn 2014, a whole genome study of the DNA differences between wolves and dogs found that dogs did not show a reduced fear response but did show greater synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is widely believed to be the cellular correlate of learning and memory, and this change may have altered the learning and memory abilities of dogs in comparison to wolves.\n\nUnlike other domestic species which were primarily selected for production-related traits, dogs were initially selected for their behaviors. In 2016, a study found that there were only 11 fixed genes that showed variation between wolves and dogs. These gene variations were unlikely to have been the result of natural evolution, and indicate selection on both morphology and behavior during dog domestication. There was evidence of selection during dog domestication of genes that affect the adrenaline and noradrenaline biosynthesis pathway. These genes are involved in the synthesis, transport and degradation of a variety of neurotransmitters, particularly the catecholamines, which include dopamine and noradrenaline. Recurrent selection on this pathway and its role in emotional processing and the fight-or-flight response suggests that the behavioral changes we see in dogs compared to wolves may be due to changes in this pathway, leading to tameness and an emotional processing ability. Dogs generally show reduced fear and aggression compared to wolves. Some of these genes have been associated with aggression in some dog breeds, indicating their importance in both the initial domestication and then later in breed formation.\n\nAMY2B (Alpha-Amylase 2B) is a gene that codes a protein that assists with the first step in the digestion of dietary starch and glycogen. An expansion of this gene in dogs would enable early dogs to exploit a starch-rich diet as they fed on refuse from agriculture. In a study in 2014, the data indicated that the wolves and dingo had just two copies of the gene and the Siberian Husky that is associated with hunter-gatherers had just three or four copies, whereas the Saluki that is associated with the Fertile Crescent where agriculture originated had 29 copies. The results show that on average, modern dogs have a high copy number of the gene, whereas wolves and dingoes do not. The high copy number of AMY2B variants likely already existed as a standing variation in early domestic dogs, but expanded more recently with the development of large agriculturally based civilizations. This suggests that at the beginning of the domestication process, dogs may have been characterized by a more carnivorous diet than their modern-day counterparts, a diet held in common with early hunter-gatherers. A later study indicated that because most dogs had a high copy number of the AMY2B gene but the arctic breeds and the dingo did not, that the dog's dietary change may not have been caused by initial domestication but by the subsequent spread of agriculture to most - but not all - regions of the planet.\n\nIn 2016, a study of the dog genome compared to the wolf genome looked for genes that showed signs of having undergone positive selection. The study identified genes relating to brain function and behavior, and to lipid metabolism. This ability to process lipids indicates a dietary target of selection that was important when proto-dogs hunted and fed alongside hunter-gatherers. The evolution of the dietary metabolism genes may have helped process the increased lipid content of early dog diets as they scavenged on the remains of carcasses left by hunter-gatherers. Prey capture rates may have increased in comparison to wolves and with it the amount of lipid consumed by the assisting proto-dogs. A unique dietary selection pressure may have evolved both from the amount consumed, and the shifting composition of, tissues that were available to proto-dogs once humans had removed the most desirable parts of the carcass for themselves. A study of the mammal biomass during modern human expansion into the northern Mammoth steppe found that it had occurred under conditions of unlimited resources, and that many of the animals were killed with only a small part consumed or left unused.\n\nDogs can infer the name of an object and have been shown to learn the names of over 1,000 objects. Dogs can follow the human pointing gesture; even nine-week-old puppies can follow a basic human pointing gesture without being taught. New Guinea singing dogs, a half-wild proto-dog endemic to the remote alpine regions of New Guinea, as well as dingoes in the remote Outback of Australia are also capable of this. These examples demonstrate an ability to read human gestures that arose early in domestication and did not require human selection. \"Humans did not develop dogs, we only fine-tuned them down the road.\"\n\nA dog's cranium is 15% smaller than an equally heavy wolf's, and the dog is less aggressive and more playful. Other species pairs show similar differences. Bonobos, like chimpanzees, are a close genetic cousin to humans, but unlike the chimpanzees, bonobos are not aggressive and do not participate in lethal inter-group aggression or kill within their own group. The most distinctive features of a bonobo are its cranium, which is 15% smaller than a chimpanzee's, and its less aggressive and more playful behavior. In other examples, the guinea pig's cranium is 13% smaller than its wild cousin the cavy, and domestic fowl show a similar reduction to their wild cousins. Possession of a smaller cranium for holding a smaller brain is a telltale sign of domestication. Bonobos appear to have domesticated themselves. In the farm fox experiment, humans selectively bred foxes against aggression, causing domestication syndrome. The foxes were not selectively bred for smaller craniums and teeth, floppy ears, or skills at using human gestures, but these traits were demonstrated in the friendly foxes. Natural selection favors those that are the most successful at reproducing, not the most aggressive. Selection against aggression made possible the ability to cooperate and communicate among foxes, dogs and bonobos. Perhaps it did the same thing for humans. The more docile animals have been found to have less testosterone than their more aggressive counterparts, and testosterone controls aggression and brain size. One researcher has argued that in becoming more social, we humans have developed a smaller brain than those of humans 20,000 years ago.\n\nAs a result of the domestication process there is also evidence of convergent evolution having occurred between dogs and humans. The history of the two is forever intertwined.\n\nIn 2007, a study found that dog domestication was accompanied by selection at three genes with key roles in starch digestion: AMY2B, MGAMand SGLT1, and was a striking case of parallel evolution when coping with an increasingly starch-rich diet caused similar adaptive responses in dogs and humans.\n\nIn 2013, a DNA sequencing study indicated that parallel evolution in humans and dogs is most apparent in the genes for digestion and metabolism, neurological processes, and cancer, likely as a result of shared selection pressures.\n\nIn 2014, a study compared the hemoglobin levels of village dogs and people on the Chinese lowlands with those on the Tibetan Plateau. It found the hemoglobin levels higher for both people and dogs in Tibet, suggesting that Tibetan dogs might share similar adaptive strategies as the Tibetan people. A population genetic analysis then showed a significant convergence between humans and dogs in Tibet. Like the Tibetan people, Tibetan mastiffs appear to have derived these benefits partially from the EPAS1 gene, acquired through introgression.\n\nIn 2015, a study found that when dogs and their owners interact, extended eye contact (mutual gaze) increases oxytocin levels in both the dog and its owner. As oxytocin is known for its role in maternal bonding, it is considered likely that this effect has supported the coevolution of human-dog bonding. One observer has stated, \"The dog could have arisen only from animals predisposed to human society by lack of fear, attentiveness, curiosity, necessity, and recognition of advantage gained through collaboration...the humans and wolves involved in the conversion were sentient, observant beings constantly making decisions about how they lived and what they did, based on the perceived ability to obtain at a given time and place what they needed to survive and thrive. They were social animals willing, even eager, to join forces with another animal to merge their sense of group with the others' sense and create an expanded super-group that was beneficial to both in multiple ways. They were individual animals and people involved, from our perspective, in a biological and cultural process that involved linking not only their lives but the evolutionary fate of their heirs in ways, we must assume, they could never have imagined. Powerful emotions were in play that many observers today refer to as love – boundless, unquestioning love.\"\n\nConvergent evolution is when distantly related species independently evolve similar solutions to the same problem. For example, fish, penguins and dolphins have each separately evolved flippers as a solution to the problem of moving through the water. What has been found between dogs and humans is something less frequently demonstrated: psychological convergence. Dogs have independently evolved to be cognitively more similar to humans than we are to our closest genetic relatives. Dogs have evolved specialized skills for reading human social and communicative behavior. These skills seem more flexible – and possibly more human-like – than those of other animals more closely related to humans phylogenetically, such as chimpanzees, bonobos and other great apes. This raises the possibility that convergent evolution has occurred: both \"Canis familiaris\" and \"Homo sapiens\" might have evolved some similar (although obviously not identical) social-communicative skills – in both cases adapted for certain kinds of social and communicative interactions with human beings.\n\nThe pointing gesture is a human-specific signal, is referential in its nature, and is a foundation building-block of human communication. Human infants acquire it weeks before the first spoken word. In 2009, a study compared the responses to a range of pointing gestures by dogs and human infants. The study showed little difference in the performance of 2-year-old children and dogs, while 3-year-old children's performance was higher. The results also showed that all subjects were able to generalize from their previous experience to respond to relatively novel pointing gestures. These findings suggest that dogs demonstrating a similar level of performance as 2-year-old children can be explained as a joint outcome of their evolutionary history as well as their socialization in a human environment.\n\nLater studies support coevolution in that dogs can discriminate the emotional expressions of human faces, and that most people can tell from a bark whether a dog is alone, being approached by a stranger, playing, or being aggressive, and can tell from a growl how big the dog is.\n\nIn 2002, a study proposed that immediate human ancestors and wolves may have domesticated each other through a strategic alliance that would change both respectively into humans and dogs. The effects of human psychology, hunting practices, territoriality and social behavior would have been profound. Wolves and dogs mark their territory with scent; however, humans do not have a keen sense of smell and may have begun to mark their territories with symbols, which became the first art and may have been generative of human culture. Wolves hunt large game; however, there is no evidence of pre-\"sapiens\" hunting large game. Early humans moved from scavenging and small-game hunting to big-game hunting by living in larger, socially more-complex groups, learning to hunt in packs, and developing powers of cooperation and negotiation in complex situations. As these are characteristics of wolves, dogs and humans, it can be argued that these behaviors were enhanced once wolves and humans began to cohabit. Communal hunting led to communal defense. Wolves actively patrol and defend their scent-marked territory, and perhaps humans had their sense of territoriality enhanced by living with wolves. One of the keys to recent human survival has been the forming of partnerships. Strong bonds exist between same-sex wolves, dogs and humans and these bonds are stronger than exist between other same-sex animal pairs. Today, the most widespread form of inter-species bonding occurs between humans and dogs. The concept of friendship has ancient origins but it may have been enhanced through the inter-species relationship to give a survival advantage.\n\nIn 2003, a study compared the behavior and ethics of chimpanzees, wolves and humans. Cooperation among humans' closest genetic relative is limited to occasional hunting episodes or the persecution of a competitor for personal advantage, which had to be tempered if humans were to become domesticated. The closest approximation to human morality that can be found in nature is that of the gray wolf, \"Canis lupus\". Wolves are among the most gregarious and cooperative of animals on the planet, and their ability to cooperate in well-coordinated drives to hunt prey, carry items too heavy for an individual, provisioning not only their own young but also the other pack members, babysitting etc. are rivaled only by that of human societies. Similar forms of cooperation are observed in two closely related canids, the African wild dog and the Asian dhole, therefore it is reasonable to assume that canid sociality and cooperation are old traits that in terms of evolution predate human sociality and cooperation. Today's wolves may even be less social than their ancestors, as they have lost access to big herds of ungulates and now tend more toward a lifestyle similar to coyotes, jackals, and even foxes. Social sharing within families may be a trait that early humans learned from wolves, and with wolves digging dens long before humans constructed huts it is not clear who domesticated whom.\n\nOn the mammoth steppe the wolf's ability to hunt in packs, to share risk fairly among pack members, and to cooperate moved them to the top of the food chain above lions, hyenas and bears. Some wolves followed the great reindeer herds, eliminating the unfit, the weaklings, the sick and the aged, and therefore improved the herd. These wolves had become the first pastoralists hundreds of thousands of years before humans also took to this role. The wolves' advantage over their competitors was that they were able to keep pace with the herds, move fast and enduringly, and make the most efficient use of their kill by their ability to \"wolf down\" a large part of their quarry before other predators had detected the kill. The study proposed that during the Last Glacial Maximum, some of our ancestors teamed up with those pastoralist wolves and learned their techniques. Many of our ancestors remained gatherers and scavengers, or specialized as fish-hunters, hunter-gatherers, and hunter-gardeners. However, some ancestors adopted the pastoralist wolves' lifestyle as herd followers and herders of reindeer, horses, and other hoofed animals. They harvested the best stock for themselves while the wolves kept the herd strong, and this group of humans was to become the first herders and this group of wolves was to become the first dogs.\n\nDuring the late Paleolithic, the increase in human population density, advances in blade and hunting technology, and climate change may have altered prey densities and made scavenging crucial to the survival of some wolf populations. Adaptations to scavenging such as tameness, small body size, and a decreased age of reproduction would reduce their hunting efficiency further, eventually leading to obligated scavenging. Whether these earliest dogs were simply human-commensal scavengers or they played some role as companions or hunters that hastened their spread is unknown.\n\nResearchers have proposed that in the past a hunting partnership existed between humans and dogs that was the basis for dog domestication. The transition from the Late Pleistocene into the early Holocene was marked by climatic change from cold and dry to warmer, wetter conditions and rapid shifts in flora and fauna, with much of the open habitat of large herbivores being replaced by forests. In the early Holocene, it is proposed that along with changes in arrow-head technology that hunting dogs were used by hunters to track and retrieve wounded game in thick forests. The dog's ability to chase, track, sniff out and hold prey can significantly increase the success of hunters in forests, where human senses and location skills are not as sharp as in more open habitats. Dogs are still used for hunting in forests today.\n\nIn Japan, temperate deciduous forests rapidly spread onto the main island of Honshu and caused an adaption away from hunting megafauna (Naumann’s elephant and Yabe’s giant deer) to hunting the quicker sika deer and wild boar in dense forest. With this came a change in hunting technology, including a shift to smaller, triangular points for arrows. A study of the Jōmon people that lived on the Pacific coast of Honshu during the early Holocene shows that they were conducting individual dog burials and were probably using dogs as tools for hunting sika deer and wild boar, as hunters in Japan still do today.\n\nHunting dogs make major contributions to forager societies and the ethnographic record shows them being given proper names, treated as family members, and considered separate to other types of dogs. This special treatment includes separate burials with markers and grave-goods, with those that were exceptional hunters or that were killed on the hunt often venerated. A dog's value as a hunting partner gives them status as a living weapon and the most skilled elevated to taking on a \"personhood\", with their social position in life and in death similar to that of the skilled hunters.\n\nIntentional dog burials together with ungulate hunting is also found in other early Holocene deciduous forest forager societies in Europe and North America, indicating that across the Holarctic temperate zone hunting dogs were a widespread adaptation to forest ungulate hunting.\n\nIn 2017, a study showed that 9,000 YBP the domestic dog was present at what is now Zhokhov Island, arctic north-eastern Siberia, which was connected to the mainland at that time. The dogs were selectively bred as either sled dogs or as hunting dogs, which implies that a sled dog standard and a hunting dog standard existed at that time. The optimal maximum size for a sled dog is 20–25 kg based on thermo-regulation, and the ancient sled dogs were between 16–25 kg. The same standard has been found in the remains of sled dogs from this region 2,000 YBP and in the modern Siberian husky breed standard. Other dogs were more massive at 30 kg and appear to be dogs that had been crossed with wolves and used for polar bear hunting. At death, the heads of the dogs had been carefully separated from their bodies by humans, probably for ceremonial reasons.\n\nThe study proposes that after having diverged from the common ancestor along with the grey wolf, the evolution of \"Canis familiaris\" proceeded in three stages. The first was natural selection based on feeding behavior within the ecological niche that had been formed through human activity. The second was artificial selection based on tamability. The third was directed selection based on forming breeds that possessed qualities to help with specific tasks within the human economy. The process commenced 40,000-30,000 YBP with its speed increasing with each stage until domestication became complete.\n\n"

                "Malik al-Ashtar\n\nMalik Al-Ashtar () (also known as Malik bin al-Harith al-Nakha'i) was one of the most loyal companions of Ali Ibn Abi Talib, the cousin of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Malik al-Ashtar became a Muslim during the time of Muhammad and since then remained an avid and loyal supporter of Muhammad's progeny and Hashemite clan. He rose to a position of prominence during the caliphate of Ali Ibn Abi Talib and participated in several battles, such as the Battle of Jamal and Siffin.\n\nMalik has been described as a \"brave\" and \"fearless\" warrior by numerous Shia sources and his title \"\"al-Ashtar\"\" signifies an eyelid injury he received during the Battle of Yarmouk.\n\nAlthough Malik's actual birth year is not known, many historians say that he was 10 years older than Ali Ibn Abi Talib and 20 years younger than Muhammad. Moreover, it is known that Malik was a Madh'hij, a sub-class of the Bani Nakha tribe from Yemen. which is also the tribe of another Sahabah named Amru bin Ma'adi Yakrib\n\nHis lineage is traced back to Yarab bin Qahtan which genealogy can be traced by sorting his paternal surname Malik bin Al Hareth bin Abed Yaghouth bin Salamah bin Rabha bin Al Harith bin Jathima bin Malik bin Al Naghe bin Amro bin Alaae bin Khald bin Mathgah bin Addad bin Zayd bin Urayb bin Zayd bin Kahlan bin Saba al Akbar bin Youshgab bin Yarab\n\nIn the year 30 AH (after Hijra) or 650 CE, many Muslims living in the city of Kufa were angered over the action of the governor Waleed ibn Uqba (the half brother of Uthman ibn Affan). Al-Waleed ibn Uqba was disliked and was a very controversial figure because of his actions. Even the Quran (sure 49 verse 6), exposes his character by stating that he is an evil man. In addition, Muhammad described him as a Fasiq (open sinner). He (Muhammad) said, \"He is an open sinner (Fasiq), get him out of the Islamic state.\" He was known to be an alcoholic who publicly consumed alcohol and was disliked because Islam prohibits the consumption of alcohol. The tipping point came when al-Waleed entered the mosque drunk to lead Fajr Namaz (morning prayer). He was so intoxicated that he read four Raka'ats. In fact, Ibn Taymiyyah, a 13th-century Sunni Islamic scholar stated, \"The Companions would pray behind people whom they knew to be open transgressors, such as when Abd-Allah ibn Mas'ud and other companions would pray behind Walid ibn 'Uqba ibn Abi Mu'it, who may have recently drunken alcohol (when he was praying) and would wind up praying four rakaats.\" However, Fajr namaz (morning prayer) is only two raka'ats. At the end of his fourth raka'at, al-Waleed turned around and asked the people if he should continue the prayer. This event enraged many Muslim citizens. They started to criticize him in markets, houses, and mosques. Furthermore, they started to question the leadership and judgement of Uthman bin Affan. Because clearly to them al-Waleed was violating the teachings of Islam and the rights of the Muslims. Thus, Malik al-Ashtar addressed the concerned Muslims by saying \"First we'd better advise him. Then we'll tell the Caliph about his bad behavior.\" So, Malik al-Ashtar and a group of ten people, one of whom was Kumayl ibn Ziyad, went to the palace of al-Waleed to address the issues they were having with him. However, they found him drinking alcohol. The delegation told him to behave in a proper manner, he scolded them, told them to leave and exiled them to Shaam (modern day Damascus, Syria). When the delegation of men reached Shaam, they addressed the issue to Mu'awiyah, who was the governor.\n\nThey were exiled them from Shaam to Homs. But eventually, Malik al-Ashtar, Kumayl ibn Ziyad, and the delegation made it back to Kufa. After coming back to Kufa and failing to remove al-Waleed, the delegation of Muslims (one of whom was Kumayl ibn Ziyad) led by Malik al-Ashtar set off on a journey to Madina, the capital of the Muslim empire, to address the issue with Uthman. Kumayl ibn Ziyad, Malik al-Ashtar, Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhaifa, and Abdur Rahman ibn Udays were the ones who spoke out most about al-Waleed and the corruption that was occurring.\n\nOn their way to Madina, Malik al-Ashtar and the delegation stopped at al-Rabathan to visit Abu Dharr al-Ghifari. Abu Dharr, who was a companion of Muhammad and firm supporter and companion of Ali, was banished to die in the desert of Al-Rabathan. At the time, 650 a.d, Abu Dharr's health was deteriorating. Narrations state that his wife would cry, seeing her husband slowly die in the desert. However, Abu Dharr told her the prophecy of his death, which was given to him the none other than Muhammad, messenger of God. He would say, \"One day, my friends and I was sitting with Allah's Apostle (Muhammad). And he said to us: One of you will die in the desert. And a group of believers will attend his death. All my friends passed away in their houses. And no one has remained but I. A person will come to your aid.\" His wife then stated, \"The time of Hajj (Pilgrimage) is over. And no one has passed through this desert.\" Abu Dharr then told her \"Don't worry! Go up the hill and look at the road of caravans.\" So she went and eventually saw a caravan coming towards her. When she saw the caravan, she started to wave a piece of cloth to get the attention of the on coming caravan. When the caravan approached her she started a conversation. \n\nMalik and the delegation then sat next to Abu Dhurr. They felt sorrow to see one of the great companions of the prophet in bad condition. Malik told Abu Dhurr that they were on their way to Medina to meet with Uthman over the issue of al-Waleed. Upon hearing the news of al-Waleed, Abu Dhur became sad.\n\nAfter the event of al-Rabathah, Malik and the delegation continued on their long journey to Medina. When finally met Uthman, they communicated their concerns and al-Waleed's behaviors to Uthman. However they were unsuccessful in their mission thus they decided to seek Hazrat Ali's help.\n\nSince Uthman denied to hear the concerns about al-Waleed, the delegation of concerned Muslims went to the house of Ali in Medina. They told Ali the situation with al-Waleed and Uthman. Ali was sad to hear the news. However, he assured them that he would visit Uthman personally regarding this issue. In his meeting with Uthman, Ali said \"Uthman, the Muslims are complaining of the rulers' persecution. And you know that very well I've heard Allah's Apostle (Muhammad) saying: On the Day of Judgement, the unjust imam will be brought to hell. And no one will support or excuse him. Then, he will be thrown into hell. He'll go round and round it till he gets into its intense heat.\" This statement made Uthman realize his mistakes. And as a result, Uthman promised to seek God's forgiveness and apologize to the Muslims. However, Marwan bin al-Hakam, the cousin of Uthman, persuaded Uthman not to do so by saying \"You'd better threaten the people so as no one would dare to say bad words against the Caliph (Uthman).\" Due to Marwan, Uthman broke his promise and became stricter. It is documented that he hit the noble companion Ammar ibn Yasir and whipped the companion Abdullah bin Masoud. The stricter policies caused an uproar in the Muslim empire; people began writing letter such as the following below.\nIn a true democratic matter, Malik al-Ashtar represented the enraged Muslim in a meeting with Uthman. In the meeting, Malik asked Uthman to step down from power, but Uthman refused. Uthman's refusal to step down only led to increasing problems. Ali tried to help Uthman and resolve the issue. He sent his own two sons, Hasan ibn Ali and Hussein ibn Ali to go to Uthman and protect him from the angry protesters. Despite this, protesters broke into Uthman's room and killed him. After the killing of Uthman, many Muslims went to Ali and asked him to become the new caliph (leader). But he refused, but Malik and others insisted that he become the caliph. To which Malik addresses, \"People, this is the Prophet's Regent. He has learnt the Prophet's knowledge. Allah's Book has mentioned his belief. Allah's Apostle [s] has told him that he will enter al-Ridhwan Garden. His personality is perfect The people in the past and present are certain of his behaviour and knowledge.\" Malik was one of the first to appoint Ali as the new caliph.\n\nAfter the downfall of Uthman, many Muslims wanted to gain power within the Islamic Empire. However, Ali was appointed as the new caliph. This upset power-hungry Muslims and the enemies of Ali. As a result, they planned to launch an offensive in the year 656 AD to fight against Ali under the claim that they wanted revenge for the killing of Uthman. One of these was Marwan al Hakim, who would later become a loyal supporter of Mu'awiyah. Marwan played a key role in the Battle of Jamal, in that he formed a large army to fight against Ali. He also bankrolled the army with money that he had stolen from the Public Treasury (money which was supposed to be for Muslim citizens) during the time of Uthman. The army included Aisha, Talha (a friend of Ali), Zubair (the cousin of Ali), and Marwan. Once the army was formed, the rebels headed to Basrah, Iraq. When Ali got news that a mutiny was going to occur, he also formed an army to combat the rebel forces. During the mutiny, the new governor of Kufa, Abu Musa al-Ashary, encouraged the Kufains (citizens of Kufa) not to join Ali's army. Additionally, he encouraged the people to distance themselves and disobey the new caliph, Ali. When Ali realized the situation in Kufa, he sent Malik al-Ashter to rally up troops. As a firm and loyal supporter of Ali Ibn Abi Talib, Malik rallied up the Kufian (citizens of Kufa) with a powerful speech. In the meantime, Abu Musa al-Ashary was commanding people to stay in their homes and not fight for Ali. Malik understood that he needed to remove Abu Musa al-Ashary. So Malik and a large group of fighters seized the palace. Luckily, Abu Musa al-Ashary was at the mosque. His guards informed him that Malik al-Ashtar and a large number of fighters had taken control of the palace. Since Abu Musa al-Ashary was not capable of fighting off Malik, he surrendered. And asked Malik to give him a day to leave Kufa. Malik accepted his offer and let Abu Musa al-Ashary leave peacefully. Once Abu Musa al-Ashary left, Malik delivered another powerful speech (in the mosque) that captivated the hearts of the Kufains. The speech successfully aroused more than 18,000 soldier to join him in order to defend against the rebel attack. 9,000 of those troops were under Malik's commands and the other 9,000 were under Hasan (the eldest son of Ali) commands. They quickly headed towards Dhiqaar, Iraq to join Ali's army. On the day of the Battle of Camel, Ali Ibn Abi Talib put Malik al-Ashtar in charge of the right wing of his army, Ammar ibn Yasir in charge of the left wing of his army, and gave the flag to his son Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah. After both sides introduced themselves (Arabian custom/tradition), Ali asked his army not to attack because they might be mistaken. He also asked his army is there is a brave soul who can take the Quran and appeal to them (the rebels). A brave young man told Ali that he is willing to do it. When the young man turned towards the rebels, the rebels killed him. After this, Ali raised his hands towards the sky and prayed \"Allah, the eyes are gazing at you! And the hands are extended! Our lord, judge between our nation and us with justice! And you're the best judge!\" When he finished, the war began. Malik al-Ashtar and his soldiers advanced fighting bravely. During the war, Ali Ibn Abi Talib told Malik that as long as the camel of Aisha is standing the war will continue. In order, to end the war he orders Malik al-Ashtar to cut the feet of the Aisha's camel. In addition, he orders Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, the blood brother of Aisha, to catch Aisha when she falls of the camel. Both Malik and Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr carried out their assignments, thus ending the battle. Above all, Ali ordered his soldiers to escort Aisha safely back to Medina, release the prisoners of war, and cure the injured rebels. Moreover, he forgave/pardoned all the rebels for their actions. However, after the war, Malik al-Ashtar and Ammar bin Yasir went to Aisha. Many scholars state that Malik was 70 years old in the Battle of Jamal. Overall, Malik al-Ahstar was the main cavalry and commander of the army of Ali Ibn Abi Talib in the Battle of Jamal (Battle of the Camel).\n\nAlthough the minor conflict occurred in Kirkeesya, the war took place at Siffeen (on the banks of the Euphrates) when Mu'awiyah headed a large reinforcing army to join Abi al-Awar al-Salmy and his army (Mu'awiyah's first army that attacked at night). Mu'awiyah brought reinforcements because during the minor conflict many of his soldiers were killed and injured. When they got to Siffeen, Mu'awiyah ordered an offensive to his army to gain control of the Euphrates River. By taking the controlling the water, Mu'awiyah violated an Islamic law and the laws of war. Therefore, Ali sent Sasaah bin Suhan, one of the companions of the Prophet, to ask for some water. He states to Mu'awiyah, \"Mu'awiyah, Ali says: Let us take some water. Then we'll decide what's between you and us, otherwise we will fight each other till the victor drinks.\" Mu'awiyah replied \"I'll answer you later on.\" After Sasaah bin Suhan left, Mu'awiyah sought advice from his trusted men about what he should do about the water situation. Al-Waleed bin Uthbah (the ex-governor of Kufa, which the Quran calls a Fasiq Sura 49 Verse 6) advised Mu'awiyah to \"Prevent them from drinking water to force them to surrender.\" Mu'awiyah and the other men agreed. Over the course of time, Malik watched the military supply and movements taking place on the river banks. He then realized that Mu'awiyah is tightening the siege of the Euphrates River. During the coarse of war, the soldier in the army of Ali Ibn Abi Talib became thirsty due to the physical exertion and blistering heat. Even Malik himself became thirsty. To which a man came up to Malik and said \"There's only little water in my water-skin, please drink it.\" But Malik refused and told him \"I won't drink till all soldiers drink!\" Noticing that most of the soldiers were thirsty, Malik went to Ali and said \"Amirul Mu'mineen, our soldiers are very thirsty. We've nothing but fighting.\" So Ali Ibn Abi Talib wrote a letter to Muawiyah asking for water. However, Mu'awiyah denied giving Ali Ibn Abi Talib's soldiers water. Once again, Malik al-Ashtar plays a huge role for the army of Ali Ibn Abi Talib . Ali Ibn Abi Talib calls Malik and asks him to lead his soldiers in an attack to gain possession of the Euphrates River. Malik and his men fight valiantly and won back the possession of the Euphrates river. The following day, an arrow with a letter attached was shot at Ali's army. Soldiers read the letter which said \"From a loyal brother in the Shamian Army, Mu'awiyah is going to open the river to drown you. So, be careful!\" and passed the news around. This news caused the soldiers to withdraw from the banks of the Euphrates River. Mu'awiyah noticed this and decided to recapture the river for his army. Yet again, Ali sends his soldiers to fight of Mu'awiyah's troops and gain control of the river. At this point, Mu'awiyah became worried that now Ali won't allow them to drink water from the river. He even ask Amr ibn al-As, \"Do you think Ali will prevent us from drinking water?\" To which Amr replied, \"Ali doesn't do as you do!\" Ironically, Mu'awiyah's writes a letter to Ali Ibn Abi Talib asking him for water since his (Mu'awiyah) soldiers were now thirsty. Ali Ibn Abi Talib grants Mu'awiyah and his soldiers permission to drink water from the Euphrates River. Allowing the rebels to drink water changed the mindset of some people in Mu'awiyah's army. They reflected upon both Mu'awiyah and Ali. And realized that Mu'awiyah did everything and anything including breaking Islamic laws to win the war. Whereas, Ali did everything to represent the true Islam even if it meant losing the war. And at nighttime, some of Mu'awiyah's troops went and joined Ali's army because they represented the truth and humanity.\n\nAs the battle continued, Malik al-Ashtar fought his way through the opposing army until he was two rows away from Mu'awiyah's tent. Only two rows away from killing Mu'awiyah and ending the war. However, a situation occurred. Mu'awiyah wanted to trick Ali's army to stop fighting and disunite them by creating confusion. Mu'awiyah loved the idea and ordered his soldiers to place the Quran on their spear. When most of the soldiers of Ali saw this they stopped fighting. Though Ali knew that it was a trick by Mu'awiyah to create confusion and disunity, he told his army \"It's a trick! I was the first to invite them to Allah's Book. And I was the first to believe in it. They've disobeyed Allah and broken His promise.\" (this is referring to the negotiation/persuading process before the war) Ali wanted his soldier to continue fighting because they were so close to victory. Despite Ali's effort, 22,000 soldiers dsobeyed his commands and said \"Stop fighting and order al-Ashtar to withdraw!\" Knowing that his own soldiers had turned their backs on him and a few group of true believers, Ali Ibn Abi Talib told his soldiers to command Malik to return for safety reasons. The messenger gave Malik the order. Even though, Malik knew that he has the opportunity to end the war and rid the world of Ma'uwiyah, he stopped and returned. Malik said \"If Ali ibn Abi Talib orders something, I have to return\".\n\nThey ceased fighting and agreed to an arbitration according to the Quran. Mu'awiyah chose Amr ibn al-As to represent him and Ali chose Abdullah bin Abbas (because he was a wise man who had a good knowledge of the Quran). But the rebel did not agree to Abdullah bin Abbas and told Ali to pick Abu Musa al-Ashary (because Abu Musa was not really a firm supporter of Ali therefore the rebels could get an upper hand in the arbitration). Ali replied to them saying \"I disagree with you on him. And Abdullah bin Abbas is better than he (Abu Musa).\" But the rebels again denied. Ali then chose Malik al-Ashtar to represent him. Once again, the rebels refused and insisted for Abu Musa. To avoid further chaos/conflict, Ali told them \"Do whatever you like!\" As a result, Amr ibn al-As and Abu Musa entered the arbitration. Knowing that Abu Musa was not a firm supporter of Ali, Amr ibn al-As deceived Abu Musa by saying \"Abu Musa, Mu'awiyah and Ali have caused all these troubles. So, lets dispose them and elect another man.\" Abu Musa took the bait and stated \"I'm removing Ali from the caliphate as I'm removing my ring from my finger.\", then he removed his ring. Afterwards, Amr ibn al-As said \"I'm fixing Mu'awwiyah to the caliphate as I'm fixing my ring to my finger.\", then he wore his ring. The trick worked but Ali still had control of the caliphate. Both sides did agree to a truce and a year of peace. Ali commanded his soldiers not to fight for a year, but a large group (who developed their own beliefs of \"La Hukma Illa Lillah\", meaning, \"no rulership except by Allah alone.\") broke away from Ali and disobeyed the agreement/orders. They became known as the Khawarij and fought Ali in the Battle of Nahrawan.\n\nAt the time, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr was the governor of Egypt. Amr ibn al-As, one of Mu'awiyah's companions, wanted to become the governor of Egypt. So he rallied 6,000 soldiers and headed towards Egypt. After finding out about the possible overthrow, Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr wrote to Ali Ibn Abi Talib asking for help and support. Ali Ibn Abi Talib wrote back assuring Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, son of the first caliph and then Ali's adopted son, that he is sending his best general and one of his closest companions, Malik al-Ashtar. Ali then told Malik: \"Malik, may Allah have mercy on you, go to Egypt. I have absolute trust in you. Rely on Allah! Use gentleness in its place and intensity in its place.\"\n\nMuhammad ibn Abū-Bakr was instructed to return to ʻAlī's capital city, Kufa. Malik Al-Ashtar was appointed Governor of Egypt in 658 (38 A.H.) by Alī ibn Abī-Tālib, the caliph of the Muslims, after the Battle of Siffin had ended.\n\nAccording to Shia tradition, when Mu'awiyah received the news that Ali appointed Malik al-Ashtar as the new governor of Egypt, he was overwhelmed with worry. Knowing that al-Ashtar was of ferocious built and strength, Muawiyah is said to have formulated a plot to assassinate him using poison imported from Rome and sent a delegate with the poison to a certain man owning vast lands in al-Qilzim City (a service station/resting spot for travelers) on the borders of Egypt, requesting that he poison al-Ashtar in exchange for lifelong tax exemption. The man is said to have agreed to the envoy's request.\n\nOn the way to Egypt, Malik al-Ashtar decided to stop at al-Qilzim. Upon his arrival, the man (who agreed to poison Malik) invited Malik, the new governor of Egypt, for lunch at his house. Malik humbly accepted the man's invitation without knowing that he was going to kill him by Muawiyah I on a suggestion of 'Amr ibn al-'As. They went to his home to have lunch. The man placed the poisoned honey in a cup and placed it on the table. Malik took a spoonful of the poisoned honey. When Malik consumed the honey, the poison spread rapidly throughout his body. Malik realized that he was poisoned as soon as he felt pain in his stomach. After realizing that he was poisoned, Malik placed his hand on his stomach and said \"In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. We belong to Allah, and we'll come back to Him!\" The poison was so destructive and toxic that within moments Malik al-Ashtar died. Muawiyah is said to have rejoiced upon hearing of al-Ashtar's death.\n\nMalik had two sons, the first was named Ishaq (Isaac) and the other was named Ibrahim (Abraham). Ishaq was a phenomenal warrior who supported and valiantly gave his life to protect Hussain ibn Ali, the son of Ali, in the Battle of Karbala. After Habib ibn Muzahir, Ishaq killed the most enemy fighters. On the other hand, Ibrahim ibn Malik al-Ashtar, the son of Malik al-Ashtar, along with Mukhtar al-Thaqafi rose against the killers of Hussain ibn Ali. The two killed most of the killers of Hussain and his army. For example, they caught and killed Umar ibn Sa'ad, Shimr ibn Thil-Jawshan, Sanan ibn Anas, Hurmala ibn Kahil and Ubaidullah Ibn Ziyad (these were Yazid I's soldiers who fought against Hussain).\n\nAmong his descendants are the Kalbasi family, who reside in Iran and some reside in Iraq. One branch of this family adds the title \"Ashtari\" to the end of their family name to denote this fact. \nIn Lebanon, the Hamadani family from the southern town of Nabatieh are also direct descendants who have maintained a family tree dating back to the Nakha'i tribe origins. The Mroueh family, after tracing their lineage, are also believed to be descendants. The Malek (or Malekian) family, from Mazandaran (Iran), are also believed to be descendants.\n\n",
                "Kumayl ibn Ziyad\n\nKumayl bin Ziyad an-Nakha'i () was among the most loyal companions of Imam Ali Ibn Abi Talib. Moreover, Kumayl occupies a prominent position in Sunni Islam. Converting to Islam during the time of Islamic prophet Muhammad, he rose to a position of prominence during the caliphates of Uthman and Ali. In the caliphate of Ali, Kumayl flourished and served him in the most disciplined of ways. However, he is recognized for his pious and humble nature as well as preserving Imam Ali's teachings. Kumayl is best known for the \"du'a\" (supplication) of Prophet Khidr, which is commonly known by the name \"du'a Kumayl.\"\n\nKumayl ibn Ziyad was born in the first year after Hijrah (622 CE).\n\nOne of the titles given to Kumayl was al-Nakha'i. It simply means a person from, or a member of, the tribe of Banu Nakha. \n\nSix months before the final expedition (under Muhammad), Muhammad told Khalid ibn al-Walid to go to the people of Yemen and to bring them slowly to the religion of Islam. However, Khalid ibn al-Walid's approach upset the Yemenis, who then began to hurl stones at him. When the news reached Muhammad, he turned to Ali and told him go to the people of Yemen. Ali went to the people of Yemen with a group of soldiers. As Ali mentioned the word Islam, the Yemeni started to throw stones at him. Despite being hit by a stone, Ali told his soldiers to remain calm. The crowd was drawn to the fact that even though they had abused Ali he returned with a calm demeanor and good manners. As a result, many of the Yemeni tribes including the Kinda, Banu Nakha, Hamadan, and Thaftan converted to Islam. Kumayl ibn Ziyad, Malik al-Ashtar, Hujr ibn Adi, and Uwais al-Qarani also converted to Islam.\n\nKumayl was very young when the prophet died in (632 CE). Malik al-Ashtar, Hujr ibn Adi, and Uwais al-Qarani were among those who moved to Kufa along with Kumayl ibn Ziyad. The first reporting of Kumayl living in Kufa is in document in the time of Uthman's caliphate.\n\nIn the year 30 AH (after Hijra), 650 CE, many Muslims living in the city of Kufa were angered by the actions of the governor Waleed ibn Uqba (the half brother of Uthman ibn Affan). He was known to be an alcoholic who publicly consumed alcohol. The tipping point came the day al-Waleed entered the mosque drunk to lead Fajr Namaz (morning prayer). He was so intoxicated that he read four Raka'ats. At the end of his fourth raka'at, he asked the people if he should continue the prayer. This event enraged many Muslim citizens, and they started to question the leadership and judgement of Uthman bin Affan. So Malik al-Ashtar and a group of ten people, one of whom was Kumayl ibn Ziyad, went to the palace of al-Waleed to address the issues they were having with him. However, they found him drinking alcohol. The delegation told him to behave in a proper manner. In reply he scolded them, told them to leave, and exiled them to Shaam (modern day Damascus, Syria). When the delegation reached Shaam, they addressed the issue to Mu'awiyah, who was the governor.\n\nAfter listening to the issues, Mu'awiyah exiled them from Shaam to Homs (modern day Syria). But eventually, Malik al-Ashtar, Kumayl ibn Ziyad, and the delegation made it back to Kufa. After coming back to Kufa and failing to remove al-Waleed, the delegation of Muslims (one of whom was Kumayl ibn Ziyad) led by Malik al-Ashtar set off on a journey to Madina, the capital of the Muslim empire, to address the issue with Uthman. Kumayl ibn Ziyad, Malik al-Ashtar, Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhaifa, and Abdur Rahman ibn Udays were the most vocal about al-Waleed and the corruption that was occurring.\n\nOn their way to Madina, Malik al-Ashtar and the delegation (one of whom was Kumayl ibn Ziyad) stopped at al-Rabathan to visit Abu Dharr al-Ghifari. Abu Dharr, who was a companion of Muhammad, and a firm supporter/companion of Ali, was banished to die in the desert of Al-Rabathan. At the time, 650 CE, Abu Dharr's health was deteriorating. Malik and the delegation then sat next to him. They were sorrowful that one of the great companions of the prophet was in such poor health. Malik told Abu Dhurr that they were on their way to Medina to meet with Uthman over the issue of al-Waleed. Upon hearing the news of al-Waleed, Abu Dhur became sad.\n\nAfter their visit at al-Rabathah, the delegation continued on their long journey to Medina. When they finally met Uthman, they communicated their concerns over al-Waleed's behaviors to him. Uthman took the same approach as al-Waleed had. He scolded them and told them to leave. This was mainly because he did not want to remove his half-brother from power. As a result, the delegates became even more disappointed. Even, Aisha (daughter of Abu Bakr) was upset and called him a long bearded Jew for not removing al-Waleed as governor.\n\nSince Uthman refused to hear their concerns about al-Waleed, the delegation, including Kumayl, went to the house of Imam Ali in Medina. They told him of the situation with al-Waleed and Uthman. Imam Ali was sad to hear the news however, he assured them that he would visit Uthman personally regarding this issue. He subsequently did so, and during his meeting with him he said: \"Uthman, the Muslims are complaining of the rulers' persecution. And you know that very well I've heard Allah's Apostle (Prophet Muhammad) saying: 'On the Day of Judgement, the unjust imam will be brought to hell. And no one will support or excuse him. Then, he will be thrown into hell. He'll go round and round it till he gets into its intense heat'.\" This statement made Uthman realize his mistakes, and as a result he promised to seek God's forgiveness and apologize to the Muslims. However, Marwan bin al-Hakam, Uthman's cousin, persuaded him not to do so by saying: \"You'd better threaten the people so as no one would dare to say bad words against the Caliph (Uthman).\" Heeding Marwan, Uthman broke his promise and became stricter. It is documented that he hit the noble companion Ammar ibn Yasir and whipped the companion Abdullah bin Masoud. His stricter policies caused an uproar in the Muslim empire; people began writing letters such as the following.\n\nIn true democratic fashion, Malik al-Ashtar represented the enraged Muslims in a meeting with Uthman. During the meeting, Malik asked him to step down from power but he refused. Uthman's refusal led to increasing problems. Imam Ali tried to help him and to resolve the issue. He sent his two sons, Imam Hasan ibn Ali and Imam Hussein ibn Ali to Uthman to protect him from the angry protesters. Despite this, the protesters broke into Uthman's room and killed him. After the killing, many Muslims, including Kumayl, went to Imam Ali asking him to become the new caliph (leader). But he refused. Despite his refusal, Malik, Kumayl and others insisted that he become the caliph. Malik addressed the protestors: \"People, this is the Prophet's Regent. He has learnt the Prophet's knowledge. Allah's Book has mentioned his belief. Allah's Apostle[s] has told him that he will enter al-Ridhwan Garden. His personality is perfect The people in the past and present are certain of his behaviour and knowledge.\" Malik and Kumayl were some of the first to appoint Imam Ali as the new caliph. Thus, Imam Ali accepted his new role and removed unjust governors and leaders from the Islamic Empire.\n\nIn view of Imam Ali becoming the new caliph, Kumayl thought that the coming years would be peaceful. On the contrary, Kumayl narrates:\n\nWhen Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib became caliph, we thought that the people would honor Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib, people would respect him. Those four-and-a-half years with Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib were the most turbulent years we ever faced in our live as human beings. I have never witnessed hatred like the hatred I witnessed against Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib. This man, when I was ten years of age, is the reason we the people of Yemen became Muslims. If it wasn't for him none of use would join the religion of Islam. And now when he becomes caliph, from every angle those who saw him give victory to Islam when he was younger. One by one they started coming out (against him). The confusion that began to effect us, the sahabah (companions) of Ali, was a confusion that you would never want to see. Because everyday there is an attack on our leader (Imam Ali) and there are wars against him. We finished the Jamal (a war), and they attacked him at Jamal. We finished Saffeen (another war), and they attacked him at Safeen. There were days where we sit with each other saying 'why is it that so many have a hatred for this man (Imam Ali)'. But the Imam would remain open with all of us. Any of us who approached him, he remained calm with us. He was a wall of unity for us.\n\nFurthermore, even after the Battle of Sifeen, Kumayl narrates:\n\nI remember one day after the Battle of Sifeen, we were walking past a house in Kufa, Imam Ameerul Momineen (Imam Ali) was with me. I heard from the house the most beautiful Quran being recited. A man recited the Quran in the middle of the night. I looked at Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib and said to him. 'O Imam this man reciting Quran, the words he is recites are so beautiful.' The Imam then looked at me and said 'Kumayl one day I will remind you about this man.\"\n\nMonths passed and the Khawaarij attacked Imam Ali at the Battle of Nahrawan. When the battle finished, Kumayl narrates:\n\nImam Ali ibn Abi Talib came up to me. He looked at me and said 'Kumayl do you see that man who has died over there from the Khawaarij army?' 'Mawla of course I see him.' He (Imam Ali) said 'Do you remember that night you and I were walking past a house and you said to me 'look how beautiful the Quran is from the man's house'?' I said to you 'wait there will be a day. That man laying there is that same man who was reciting the Quran.' What's the point of him reciting the Quran when he does not know my position within the Quran.\n\nKumayl further narrates:\n\nThose years (referring to the caliphate of Imam Ali) were the most turbulent years for the companions of Ali. We lost Malik al-Ashtar. We lost Ammar ibn Yasir. One by one the companions of Ali ibn Abi Talib were dying. I myself was in a state of confusion.\n\nKumayl was appointed governor of Hīt, Iraq by Imam Ali who told him never to leave Hīt when situations got tough. Unfortunately, one day a situation occurred. Mu'awiyah knew that if he could remove Shabath bin Rabie (also a companion of Imam Ali and the killer of Imam Husain ibn Ali, who was one of the last men to strike Imam Husain's neck, (the governor of Kafarqos, some say the city of Kirkeesya), then he could defeat Imam Ali. So Mu'awiyah attacked the city of Kafarqos to try to remove Shabath bin Rabie.\n\nKumayl narrates:\nI was in a state of confusion. Ali ibn Abi Talib had written to me saying' Kumayl never ever remove yourself from your city. I have put people in their different cities and they should never go and leave themselves.' When I saw Mu'awiyah attack. I wondered how can I leave this city when it is under attack, even though Ali ibn Abi Talib told me not to leave my city? I was in utter confusion. I left my city alone. I went to defend Shabath bin Rabie, and when I did so I received a letter from him (Letter 61 in the Nahj al-Balagha).\n\nIt is wrong of a person to disregard and neglect the duty entrusted to him and try to take up the work entrusted to someone else - and at a time when he is not required to do it. Such an attribution indicates a weak and harmful mentality. Your desire to invade Kirkisiya and to leave your province undefended and unattended shows the confusion in your mind. By such an action you will convert yourself into a kind of bridge, which your enemy can cross conveniently to reach your friends. Thus you will be a useless auxiliary who has neither power nor prestige nor dignity; who cannot stop his enemy's in-roads, nor can crush him, and who cannot defend his subjects nor can he be of any use or help to his ruler.\n\nKumayl goes on to say: \"I didn't know what to do. We were facing an absolute barrage of pressure from the attack at that time. We were holding on to Ameerul Momineen (Imam Ali) but Mu'awiyah was launching attack after attack, and we did not know what our stand had to be.\"\n\nEager to increase his understanding of this world, Kumayl ibn Ziyad loved to learn from his teacher, Imam Ali. Kuymal narrates:\n\nThere are times Ali ibn Abi Talib can see that you are going through difficulties. Those are the times when he takes you by the hand and reveals to you the secrets of this world. There are nights which I spent with Ali ibn Abi Talib where he increased my yaqeen (certainty) in Allah.\n\nFor example, the following discourse in which Imam Ali takes Kumayl to a graveyard outside Kufa:\n\nO Kumayl ibn Ziyad, truly these hearts are vessels and the best of them are those which hold the most. So retain from me that which I say to you. People are divided into three types: a lordly knower (\"alim rabbani\"); one who seeks knowledge (\"muta'allim\") for the sake of deliverance; and the common folk (\"hamaj ra'a\") following just anyone, swaying with every current, not desiring to be illumined by the light of knowledge, nor seeking refuge from any strong support.\n\nO Kumayl, knowledge is better than wealth, for knowledge guards you, while you must guard wealth; and wealth diminishes as it is spent, while knowledge increases as it is disbursed; and the results of wealth disappears with the disappearance of wealth.\n\nO Kumayl ibn Ziyad, the wise apprehension of knowledge (\"ma'rifat al-'ilm\") is a religion by which Allah is worshipped. Through it, man acquires obedience in his life and a good name after his death. And knowledge is a judge, while wealth is judged.\n\nO Kumayl ibn Ziyad, those who hoard wealth perish even while they live, but the knowers endure for as long as time subsists; their (material) forms are absent, but their (spiritual) images in the hearts are present. Ah, what abundant knowledge is here (pointing to the chest); would that I could find one to bear it. Yes, I found one who was quick to understand, but he could not be trusted with it, exploiting the tools of religion for the sake of worldly gain, empowering himself with the grace of Allah against his slaves, and with his proofs against his friends. Then there was one who was obedient to the bearers of truth, but lacking heartfelt insight; at the first appearance of obscurity; doubt was kindled in his heart. So alas, neither this one nor that! Nor one who is greedy for pleasure, submissive to passion, nor one obsessed with acquisition and accumulation-neither of them is a guardian of religion in any respect. They resemble mothering so much as grazing cattle! Thus does knowledge die with death of its bearers.\n\nBut indeed, my Allah, the earth will never be empty of one who establishes the proof of Allah, whether overtly with publicity or fearfully in obscurity, lest Allah's proofs and elucidations come to naught. But such as these - how many are they and where? By Allah, they may be the smallest number, but with Allah they are the greatest rank. Through them Allah preserves his proofs and elucidations, so that they entrust them to their compeets and sow them in the hearts of those resembling them.\n\nThrough them, knowledge penetrates the reality of insight. They rejoice in their intimacy with the spirit of certainty; they make easy what the extravagant find harsh; they befriend that by which the ignorant are estranged. With their bodies they keep company with the world, while their spirits are tied to the transcendent realm.\n\nThey are vice-regents of Allah on his earth, summoners to his religion. Ah, how I long to see them! Go now, Kumayl as you will.\n\nAnother example, Imam Ali takes Kumayl outside of Kufa on a starry night with a breeze of wind. He narrates:\n\nKumayl, these hearts are containers (of knowledge). The best of them are those that best preserve knowledge. Therefore, preserve what I say to you.\n\nThere are three classes of people. The first class knows Allah. The second learns knowledge as means of salvation. And the third is rabble: followers of every crier, who bend with every breeze. These men do not seek to be illuminated by the light of learning, nor do they resort to any authority.\n\nKumayl, knowledge is better than wealth. Knowledge guards you while you guard wealth. Wealth is diminished by expenditure while knowledge is increased even by giving it away.\n\nKumayl, those who amass wealth die even as they live while those who have knowledge will continue to exist for as long as time lasts.\"\n\nKumayl narrates:\n\nI was riding my horse behind Ali ibn Abi Talib. And while he was riding his horse and I am behind him, I called out to him, 'Whats the truth?' Imam Ali said 'Sorry'. I said 'What is the truth? Who are you?' He looked at me and said 'What have you got to do with the truth.' I said 'When you come to the door of bounties it is known that you never turn anyone away.' Imam Ali replied, 'What sprinkles in you, overflows in me. You want to know the truth who I am? You want to know the truth? You think you are close to me and you want to know the truth, you think you know the truth as to who I am? I will tell you what the truth is. The truth is the revelation of the splendor of the divine majesty without a sign.' I (Kumayl) said, 'I don't understand what you mean, tell me more.' He said 'It is the defacement of the conjecture through the clearing of the known.' I (Kumayl) said 'I don't understand, but continue telling me what is the truth.' He said 'It's the rendering of the veils by the triumph of mystery.' I said 'Tell me more.' He said 'It is the divine attraction, but through the apprehension of the known.' I said 'Tell me more.' He said 'It's that light of the morning eternity that continues to radiate through the unity of the temples and their disunity. That's who I am.' I did not have a clue as to what he meant. Imam Ali continue riding the horse and I continued riding behind him. Ali's final answer was: \"Extinguish the lamp, for the Sun has risen.\"\nKumayl ibn Ziyad saved many Du'as which he learned from Imam Ali. Two of these du'as are \"Du'a Sabah\" and \"Du'a of Prophet Khidr\" (renamed \"Du'a Kumayl\").\n\nIn the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful\n\nOh God, Oh He who extended the morning's tongue in the speech of its dawning, dispatched the fragments of the dark night into the gloom of its stammering, made firm the structure of the turning spheres in the measures of its display, and beamed forth the brightness of the sun through the light of its blazing! Oh, He who demonstrates His Essence by His Essence, transcends congeneity with His creatures and is exalted beyond conformity with His qualities!\n\nOh, He who is near to the passing thoughts of opinions, far from the regards of eyes, and knows what will be before it comes to be! Oh, He who has put me at ease in the cradle of His security and sanctuary, awakened me to the favors and kindness that He has bestowed upon me, and held from the claws of evil with His hand and His force!\n\nBless, O God, the guide to Thee in the darkest night, him who, of Thy ropes, clings to the cord of the longest nobility; him whose glory is evident at the summit of stout shoulders, and whose feet were entrenched in spite of slippery places in ancient time; and [bless] his household, the good, the chosen, the pious,\n\nAnd open for us, O God, the leaves of morning's door with the keys of mercy and prosperity! Clothe me, O God, with the most excellent robes of guidance and righteousness!\n\nPlant, O God, through Thy awesomeness, the springs of humility in the watering place of my heart! Cause to flow, O God, because of Thy awesomeness, tears of moaning from the corner of my eyes! And chastise, O God, the recklessness of my clumsiness with the reins of contentment! My God, if mercy from Thee does not begin with fair success for me, then who can take me to Thee upon the evident path?\n\nIf Thy deliberateness would turn me over to the guide of hope and wishes, then who will annul my slips from the stumbles of caprice? If Thy deliberateness should turn me over to the guide of hope and wishes, then who will annul my slips from the stumbles of caprice? If Thy help should forsake me in the battle with the soul and Satan, then Thy forsaking will have entrusted me to where there is hardship and deprivation. My God, dost Thou see that I have only come to Thee from the direction of hopes or clung to the ends of Thy cords when my sins have driven me from the house of union?\n\nSo what an evil mount upon which my soul has mounted – its caprice! Woe upon it for being seduced by its own opinions and wishes! And destruction be upon it for its audacity toward its Master and Protector! My God, I have knocked upon the door of Thy mercy with the hand of my hope, fled to Thee seeking refuge from my excessive caprice and fixed the fingers of my love to the ends of Thy cords.\n\nSo pardon, O God, the slips and errors I have committed and release me from the foot-tangling of my robe. For Thou art my Master, my Protector, my Support and my Hope and Thou art the object of my search and my desire in my ultimate end and stable abode. My God, how couldst Thou drive away a poor beggar who seeks refuge in Thee from sins, fleeing? Or how couldst Thou disappoint one seeking guidance who repairs to Thy threshold, running?\n\nNever! For Thy pools are full in the hardship of drought, Thy door is open for seeking and penetration and Thou art the goal of requests and the object of hopes. My God, these are the reins of my soul I have bound them with the ties of Thy will. These are the burdens of my sins I have averted them with Thy pardon and mercy. And these are my caprices that lead astray - I have entrusted them to the threshold of Thy gentleness and kindliness.\n\nSo make this morning of mine, O God, descend upon me with the radiance of guidance, and with safety in religion and this world! And [make] my evening a shield against the deception of enemies and a protection against the destructive blows of caprice!\n\nVerily Thou art able over what Thou wilt! Thou givest the kingdom to whom Thou wilt, and Thou seizest the kingdom from whom Thou wilt; Thou exaultest whom Thou wilt, and Thou abasest whom Thou wilt; in Thy hand is the good; Thou art powerful over all things. Thou makest the night to enter into the day, and Thou makest the day to enter into the night; Thou bringest forth the living from the dead, and Thou bringest forth dead from the living; and Thou providest whomsoever Thou wilt without reckoning.\n\nThere is no god but Thou! Glory be to Thee, O God, and Thine is the praise! Who knows Thy measure without fearing Thee? Who knows what Thou art without awe of Thee? Through Thy power Thou hast joined disparate things, through Thy gentleness Thou hast cleaved apart the daybreak and through Thy generosity Thou hast illumined the dark shrouds of night. Thou hast made waters, sweet and salt, flow forth from hard shining stones, sent down out of rain-clouds water cascading, and appointed the sun and moon a blazing lamp for the creatures, without experiencing in that which Thou originated either weariness or effort.\n\nSo, O He who is alone in might and subsistence and dominates His slaves with death and annihilation, Bless Muhammad and his household, the god-fearing, answer my supplication hear my call, destroy my enemies and actualize through Thy bounty my hope and desire.\n\nO best of those who is called to remove affliction and object of hope in every difficulty and ease! I have stated my need, so do not reject me, O my master, despairing of Thy exalted gifts. O All-generous! O All-generous! O All-generous! By Thy mercy, O Most Merciful of the merciful! And God bless the best of His creatures, Muhammad, and all his household!\n\nThen prostrate and say:\n\nMy God, my heart is veiled, my soul deficient, my intelligence defeated, my caprice triumphant, my obedience little, my disobedience much and my tongue acknowledges sins. So what am I to do? O He who covers defects! O He who knows the unseen things! Forgive my sins, all of them, by the sacredness of Muhammad and the household of Muhammad! O All-forgiver! O All-forgiver! O All-forgiver! By Thy mercy, O Most Merciful of the merciful!\n\nHistory\n\nKumayl narrates:It was in the Mosque in Basrah, Iraq. Imam Ali ibn Abi Talib was giving us a talk. He said all of you should recite the Du'a of Prophet Khidr. This du'a should be recited either on the 15th of Shaban (Islamic month), or on a Thursday night, or whenever you can. This du'a removes evils from your life, removes all forms of envy, and removes any suffering that will exist in your life. After the group of companions heard the du'a, they left to go home. Kumayl said, \"I stayed behind. I said 'O Amir al-Momineen can you teach me the du'a? Because I don't just want to listen to a du'a, I want to make sure that the du'a spreads in the lives of people for ever'.\" Imam Ali then told Kumayl, \"Allah may protect thee from the evils of the enemies and the plots contrived by impostors. O' Kumayl! in consideration of thy companionship and understanding, I grant thee this honour of entrusting this \"Du'a\" to thee.\" Kumayl wrote down the supplication to preserve it.\n\nHow and Why Did the Du'a's Name Change\n\nThe name of the Du'a changed from \"Du'a of Prophet Khidr\" to \"Du'a Kumayl\" because Kumayl memorized it and was one of the main people who spread the du'a. Over the years people began referring the du'a as \"Du'a Kumayl\" because he was the one who wrote it down and spread it to others.\n\nThe Du'a (Supplication)\nIn the Name of Allah, the most Beneficent, the most Merciful\nO Allah! Bless Muhammad and his progeny.\n\nO Allah! I beseech Thee by Thy mercy which encompasses all things, and by Thy power by which Thou overcometh all things, and submit to it all things, and humble before it all things, and by Thy might by which Thou hast conquered all things, and by Thy majesty against which nothing can stand up. And by Thy grandeur which prevails upon all things, and by Thy authority which is exercised over all things, and by Thy own self that shall endure forever after all things have vanished, and by Thy Names which manifest Thy power over all things, and by Thy knowledge which pervades all things, and by the light of Thy countenance which illuminates everything O Thou who art the light!\n\nO Thou who art the most holy! O Thou who existed before the foremost! O Thou who shall exist after the last!\n\nO Allah! Forgive me my such sins as would affront my continency O Allah! Forgive me my such sins as would bring down calamity.\nO Allah! Forgive me my such sins as would change divine favours into disfavours. O Allah! Forgive me my such sins as would hinder my supplication. O Allah! Forgive me such sins as bring down misfortunes or afflictions. O Allah! Forgive my such sins as would suppress hope.\n\nO Allah! Forgive every sin that I have committed and every error that I have erred. O Allah! I endeavor to draw myself nigh to Thee through Thy invocation, and I pray to Thee to intercede on my behalf, and I entreat Thee by Thy benevolence to draw me nearer to Thee. And grant me that I should be grateful to Thee, and inspire me to remember and to invoke Thee.\n\nO Allah! I entreat Thee begging Thee submissively, humbly and awestruck, to treat me with clemency and mercy, and to make me pleased and contented with what Thou hast allotted to me, and cause me to be modest and unassuming in all circumstances.\n\nO Allah! I beg Thee as one who is passing through extreme privation, and who supplicates his needs to Thee, and his hope has been greatly raised by that which is with Thee.\n\nO Allah! Great is Thy kingdom and exalted is Thy greatness. Thy plan is secret, Thy authority is manifest, Thy might is victorious and subduing, and Thy power is prevalent throughout. And it is not possible to escape from Thy dominion\n\nO Allah! Except Thee I do not find any one able to pardon my sins nor to conceal my loathsome acts. Nor have I any one except Thee to change my evil deeds into virtues. There is no god but Thou. Glory and praise be to Thee. I have made my own soul to suffer> I had the audacity (to sin) by my ignorance, relying upon my past remembrance of Thee and Thy grace towards me.\n\nO Allah! My Lord! How many of my loathsome acts hast Thou screened (from public gaze)? How many of my grievous afflictions (distresses) hast Thou reduced in severity? And how many of my stumbling hast Thou protected? How many of my detestable acts has Thou averted, and how many of my undeserving praises hast Thou spread abroad!?\n\nO Allah! My trials and sufferings have increased, and my evilness has worsened. My good deeds have diminished and my yokes (of misdeeds) have become firm. And remote hopes restrain me to profit (by good deeds). And the world has deceived me with its allurements, and my own self has been affected by treachery and procrastination.\nTherefore, my Lord! I implore Thee by Thy greatness not to let my sins and my misdeeds shut out access to my prayers from reaching Thy realm. And not to disgrace me by exposing those (hidden ones) of which Thou hast knowledge, nor to hasten my retribution for those vices and misdeeds committed by me in secret, which were due to evil mindedness, ignorance, excessive lustfulness and my negligence.\n\nO Allah! I beg Thee by Thy greatness to be compassionate to me in all circumstances, and well disposed towards me in all matters. My God! My Nourisher! Have I anyone except Thee from whom I can seek the dislodging of my evils and understanding of my problems?\nMy God! My Master! Thou decreed a law for me but instead I obeyed my own low desires, and I did not guard myself against the allurements of my enemy. He deceived me with vain hopes whereby I was led astray, and fate helped him in that respect. Thus I transgressed some of its limits set for me by Thee, and I disobeyed some of Thy commandments. Thou hast therefore a (just) cause against me in all those matters, and I have no plea against Thy judgment passed against me. I have therefore become (justifiably) liable to Thy judgment and afflictions.\n\nBut now I have turned to Thee, my Lord, after being guilty of omissions and transgressions against my soul, apologetically, repentantly, brokenheartedly, entreating earnestly for forgiveness, yielding, and confessing (to my guilt). As I can find no escape from that which was done by me, and having no refuge to which I could turn except seeking Thy acceptance of my excuse, and admitting me into the realm of Thy capacious mercy.\n\nO Allah! Accept my apology and have pity on my intense sufferings, and set me free from my heavy fetters (of evil deeds). My Nourisher! Have mercy on the infirmity of my body, the delicacy of my skin, and the brittleness of my bones.\n\nO' Thou! who originated my creation and accorded me my individuality, and ensured my upbringing and welfare, and provided my sustenance, I beg Thee to restore Thy favours and blessings upon me as Thou didst in the beginning of my life.\n\nO' my God! My master! My Lord! And my Nourisher! What! Wilt Thou see me punished with the fire kindled by Thee, despite my belief in Thy unity? And despite the fact that my heart has been filled with pure knowledge of Thee, and when my tongue has repeatedly praised Thee, and my conscience has acknowledged Thy love, and despite my sincere confessions (of my sins), and my humble entreaties submissively made to Thy divinity?\n\nNay, Thou art far too kind and generous to destroy one whom thyself nourished and supported, or to drive away from Thyself one whom Thou has kept under Thy protection, or to scare away one whom Thy self hast given shelter, or to abandon in affliction one Thou hast maintained and to whom Thou hast been merciful. I wish I had known o' my Master, my God and my Lord! Wilt Thou inflict fire upon faces which have submissively bowed in prostration to Thy greatness, or upon the tongues which have sincerely confirmed Thy unity, and have always expressed gratitude to Thee, or upon hearts which have acknowledged Thy divinity with conviction, or upon the minds which accumulated so much knowledge of Thee until they became submissive to Thee, or upon the limbs which strove, at the places appointed for Thy worship, to adore Thee willingly, and seek Thy forgiveness submissively? Such sort of harshness is not expected from Thee as it is remote from Thy grace, o' generous one!\n\nO' Lord! Thou art aware of my weakness to bear even a minor affliction of this world, and its consequence, and adversity affecting the denizen of this earth, although such afflictions are momentary, short-lived and transient. How then can I bear the retributions and the punishments of the hereafter which are enormous and of intensive sufferings, of prolonged period and perpetual duration, and which shall never be alleviated for those who deserve the same as those retributions will be the result of Thy wrath; and Thy punishment which neither the heavens nor the earth can withstand and bear! My Lord! How can I, a weak, insignificant, humble, poor and destitute creature of Thine be able to bear them?\n\nO' my God! My Lord! My King! And Master! Which of the matters shall I complain to Thee, and for which of them shall I bewail and weep? Shall I bewail for the pains and pangs of the punishment and their intensity, or for the length of sufferings and their duration?\nTherefore my Lord! If Thou wilt subject me to the penalties of hell in company of Thy enemies, and cast me with those who merited Thy punishments, and tear me apart from Thy friends and those who will be near to Thee, then my God, my Lord and my Master, though I may patiently bear Thy punishments, how can I calmly accept being kept away from Thee? I reckon that though I may patiently endure the scorching fire of Thy hell, yet how can I resign myself to the denial of Thy pity and clemency? How can I remain in the fire while I have hopes of Thy forgiveness?\n\nO' my Lord! By Thy honour truly do I swear that, if Thou wilt allow my power of speech to be retained by me in the hell, I shall among its inmates cry out bewailingly unto Thee like the cry of those who have faith in Thy kindness and compassion. And I shall bemoan for Thee, for being deprived of nearness to Thee, the lamentation of those who are bereaved, and I shall keep on calling unto Thee: 'Where art Thou o' Friend of the believers! O' Thou who art the last hope and resort of those who acknowledge Thee and have faith in Thy clemency and kindness. O' Thou who art the helper of those seeking help! O' Thou who art dear to the hearts of those who truly believe in Thee! And o' Thou who art the Lord of the universe.'\n\nMy Lord! Glory and praise be to Thee. Wouldst Thou wish to be seen disregarding the voice of a Muslim bondman, incarcerated therein hell for his disobedience, and imprisoned within its pits for his evil doings and misdeeds, crying out to Thee the utterance of one who has faith in Thy mercy, and calling out to Thee in the language of those who believe in Thy unity, and seeking to approach Thee by means of Thy epithet 'the Creator, the Nourisher, the Accomplisher, and the Protector of the entire existence?'\n\nMy Lord! Then how could he remain in torments when he hopefully relies upon Thy past forbearance, compassion and mercy?\nAnd how can the fire cause him suffering when he hopes for Thy grace and mercy? And how can its roaring flames char him when Thou heareth his voice and seeith his plight? And how can he withstand its roaring flames when Thou knowest his frailty? And how can he be tossed about between its layers when Thou knoweth his sincerity? And how can the guards of hell threaten him when he calls out to Thee? 'My Lord', and how would Thou abandon him therein (the hell) when he has faith in Thy grace to set him free?\n\nAlas! That is not the concept we hold of Thee, nor has Thy grace such a reputation, nor does it resemble that which Thou hast awarded by Thy kindness and generosity to those who believe in Thy unity. I definitely conclude that hadst Thou not ordained punishment for those who disbelieved in Thee, and hadst Thou not decreed Thy enemies to remain in hell, Thou wouldst have made the hell cold and peaceful and there would never have been an abode or place for any one in it; but sanctified be Thy Names, Thou hast sworn to fill the hell with the disbelievers from among the jinns and mankind together, and to place forever Thy enemies therein. And Thou, exalted be Thy praises, hadst made manifest, out of Thy generosity and kindness, that a believer is not like unto him who is an evil-liver.\n\nMy Lord! My Master! I, therefore implore Thee by that power which Thou determineth, and by the decree which Thou hast finalised and ordained, whereby Thou hath prevailed upon whom Thou hast imposed it, to bestow upon me this night, and this very hour, the forgiveness for all the transgressions that I have been guilty of, for all the sins that I have committed, for all the loathsome acts that I have kept secret, and for all the evils done by me, secretly or openly, in concealment or outwardly. And for every evil action that Thou hast ordered the two noble scribes to confirm, whom Thou hast appointed to record all my actions, and to be witnesses over me along with the limbs of my body, while Thou observeth over me besides them, and was witness to those acts concealed from them. Which Thou in Thy mercy hast kept secret, and through Thy kindness unexposed, and I pray to Thee to make my share plentiful in all the good that Thou dost bestow; in all the favours that Thou dost grant; and in all the virtues that Thou dost allow to be known everywhere; and in all the sustenance and livelihood that Thou dost expand and in respect of all the sins that Thou dost forgive and the wrongs that Thou dost cover up O' Lord! O' Lord! O' Lord!\n\nO' my God! My Lord! My King! O' Master of my freedom! O' Thou who holdeth my destiny, and who art aware of my suffering and poverty,\nO' Thou who knoweth my destitution and starvation. O' my Lord! O' Lord, O' Lord! I beseech Thee by Thy glory and Thy honour, by Thy supremely high attributes, and by Thy names, to cause me to utilise my time, day and night, in Thy remembrance, by engaging myself in serving Thee (Thy cause), and to let my deeds be such as to be acceptable to Thee. So much so that all my actions and offerings (prayers) may be transformed into one continuous and sustained effort, and my life may take the form of constant and perpetual service to Thee.\n\nO' my Master! O' Thou upon Whom I rely! O' Thou unto Whom I express my distress!\n\nO' my Lord! My Lord! My Lord! Strengthen my limbs for Thy service, and sustain the strength of my hands to persevere in Thy service. And bestow upon me the eagerness to fear Thee and constantly to serve Thee so that I may lead myself towards Thee in the field with the vanguards who are in the fore rank. And be swift towards Thee among those who hasten towards Thee, and urge eagerly to be near Thee. And draw myself towards Thee like them who sincerely draw themselves towards Thee. And to fear Thee like the fear of those who believe firmly in Thee. And thus I may join the congregation of the faithful congregated near Thee for protection.\n\nO' Allah! Whosoever intendeth evil against me, let ill befall him, and frustrate him who plots against me. And assign for me a place in Thy presence with the best of Thy bondsmen, and nearer abode to Thee. For verily that position cannot be attained except through Thy grace. And treat me benevolently, and through Thy greatness extend Thy munificence towards me. And through Thy mercy protect me and cause my tongue to accentuate Thy remembrance, and my heart filled with Thy love. And be liberal to me by Thy gracious response, and cause my evils to appear fewer and forgive me my errors. For verily, Thou hast ordained for Thy bondsmen Thy worship and bidden them to supplicate unto Thee and hast assured them of Thy response.\n\nSo, my Lord! I look earnestly towards Thee, and towards Thee, my Lord! I have stretched forth my hands. Therefore, by Thy honour, respond to my supplication and let me attain my wishes and, by Thy bounty, frustrate not my hopes, and protect me from the evils of my enemies, from among the jinns and mankind. O' Thou! Who readily pleased, forgive one who owns nothing but supplication for Thou doest what Thou willest.\n\nO' Thou! Whose Name is the remedy for all ills, and Whose remembrance is a sure cure for all ailments, and obedience to Whom makes one self sufficient, have mercy on one whose only asset is hope, and whose only armour is lamentation. O' Thou! Who perfecteth all bounties and Who wardeth off all misfortunes!\n\nO' Light! Who illuminates those who are in bewilderment! O' Omniscient! Who knoweth without (acquisition of) learning! Bless Mohammed and the Descendants of Mohammed, and do unto me in accordance with that which befitteth Thee. And deal with me not in accordance to my worth. May the blessings of Allah be bestowed upon His Apostle, and the Rightful Imams from his Descendants. And His peace be upon them plentifully.\n\nOn the 19th of Ramadan, while praying (Nafil Fajr) in the Great Mosque of Kufa, Imam Ali was attacked by a Khawarij named Abd-al-Rahman ibn Muljam. He struck Imam Ali with a poison-coated sword while he was prostrating. It is said that Ibn Muljam struck Imam Ali on the same spot where Amr Ibn Abduwud struck him in the Battle of Khandaq. The poison slowly started to affect Imam Ali's body. A few days later, on January 31, 661, (21 Ramadan 40 A.H) Imam Ali died. The news of his martyrdom saddened the hearts of his family, companions, as well as the Muslim Empire. Particularly, Kumayl, who cried after seeing his best friend leave this world. He became very emotional and saddened. Kumayl, himself, says: \"When I lost Ali ibn Abi Talib, I lost the secrets of Allah on Earth.\"\n\nThere are no historical records of Kumayl during the period between 40 AH (660 CE) to 80 AH (1000 CE). After the martyrdom of Imam Ali, Kumayl suddenly disappeared for 40 years. High scholars have no clue as to where he was during these years. He is not mentioned in any major events, including the Event of Ashura, nor is he mentioned after that event, until 80 AH (1000 CE). However, there is a theory that Kumayl was imprisoned by Governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad (no blood relation of Kumayl), because there are historical records of a person named Kumayl al-Hamadan'i, who was imprisoned by Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad. The title al-Hamadan'i is given to a person from the tribe of Hamadan of Yemen. The Hamadan tribe was one of the four major tribes of Yemen and was closely linked to the Banu Nakha tribe - the tribe that Kumayl ibn Ziyad is from, hence his title al-Nakha'i. The theory is that the historical records might have misspelled, or misinterpreted, or misunderstood, or confused Kumayl's title, so that Kumayl al-Hamadan'i was actually Kumayl al-Nakha'i (Kumayl ibn Ziyad).\n\nWhen Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan took power, he made Hajjaj ibn Yusuf the governor of Kufa. Al-Hajjaj did his best to please Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan by imprisoning protesters, innocent men, and women - mainly Shias. His prison held fifty thousand men and thirty thousand women. These prisons were not ordinary prisons; they were meant to torture individuals. For example, the prisons did not have roofs. Prisoners were subjected to intense sun and heat in summer, and to rain and cold temperatures in winter. To show the prisons' intensity, a mother went to see her young son who had been held as a prisoner for months. The guards led her to her son. Upon seeing her son, she denied him and said \"He's not my son. My son is white. This young man is a Negro. I don't know him.\" But after the son explained to her his markings, the mother was certain and began crying.\n\nIt is documented that Hajjaj had a particularly strong hatred towards Shias. It is also documented that Hajjaj's first public statement was: \"What do people do on Eid al-Adha? A subject replied: People sacrifice lambs.\" He replied, \"Very well then, from now on sacrifice anyone named Ali, Hasan, or Husain.\" To further show his hatred towards Shias, he also used to say publicly: \"I wish I could have been there are Karbala, so I could have been the man who beheaded Husain ibn Ali when he was on the ground.\"\n\nKumayl distanced himself from any political/Muslim affairs after the martyrdom of his best friend and teacher, Imam Ali. But when he herd that Hajjaj ibn Yusuf became governor, Kumayl took a stand. At the time Kumayl was either 82 or 83 years old.\n\nMoreover, people (not just Shia's) hated him with a passion because he was unjust and wicked. For example, he wanted them to fight in war only to see them die, conquer land only to ransack them of their treasures, and he killed innocent people. They were tired of him ruling with an iron fist. This can be most famously seen in The Revolt of Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath.\n\nHajjaj forced people to fight in war for his own personal benefit. One of these wars occurred in Turkey against the Turkish king Ratbil. He had sent Abd al-Rahman ibn Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath to conquer Turkey. He won several battles against the Turks, thus allowing him to advance deeper into Turkey. Despite winning these battles, Abd al-Rahman noticed that his soldiers were tired of war and needed a break to boost their morale. He sent a letter of Hajjaj asking permission for a resting period. Despite the circumstances, Hajjaj cursed and ordered Abd al-Rahman and his army to continue fighting. Hajjaj's letter stated: \"Very well, curse be on you and curse be on your soldiers.\" Upon reading the letter they became infuriated and decided to revolt against both Hajjaj and Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. Abd al-Rahman replied to Hajjaj, \"a man like you doesn't speak to me like this\". Subsequently, when Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan heard this news, he told Abd al-Rahman \"very well, I will remove Hajjaj and I will ensure that he does not stay in power\". Abd al-Rahman replied \"well you are the one that installed Hajjaj, therefore we will fight you\".\n\nAs a result, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan reinstated Hajjaj as governor of Kufa. With the intention to overthrow the government, Abd al-Rahman left Turkey and immediately gain a great deal of support, especially among the \"quras\" (Quran readers/reciters/teachers) who were the first to support him. Therefore, the \"quras\" formed their own battalion headed by Kumayl ibn Ziyad. Other supporters were, Kufains (who wanted to fight the persecution), poets, commoners, and religious jurists. They formed an army of over one hundred people, half of whom were foreigners who also faced persecution because they were treated as second class citizens by the Umayyads, who preferred Arabs to non-Arabs. Another notable warrior was Sa'id ibn Jubayr, a companion of Ali ibn Husayn. By 81 AH (700 CE), Abd al-Rahman and the rebels stormed Iraq and defeated Hajjaj's army. The downfall of Hajjaj's army freed many cities such as Sajestan, Kirman, and Fars all in Iran, and Basrah and Kufa in Iraq. Following the victory, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan opened his doors to negotiations with Abd al-Rahman and the rebels. He accepted some terms such as removing Hajjaj from power. People rejoiced because of their freedom and victory by overthrowing Hajjaj. Now that they had defeated Hajjaj they felt that they could also remove Abd al-Malik as well. For this reason, Abd al-Malik sent military supplies and support to Hajjaj. In addition, the Khurasan (modern day Iran) army also joined to support Hajjaj.\n\nIn 82 AH (701–702 CE), Abd al-Rahman, Kumayl Bin Ziyad, Sa'id ibn Jubayr, and the rebels clashed against Abd al-Malik, Hajjaj, and the Khurasan army in what would become known as the Battle of al-Jamājum (Battle of Deer). It has been said to have been a violent, bloody battle. Unfortunately there little detail about this battle except that Abd al-Malik, Hajjaj, and the Khurasan army managed to defeat the rebels. Some rebels escaped and Abd al-Rahman, Kumail Bin Zyyad, and Sa'id ibn Jubayr avoided being captured. Abd al-Rahman fled back to Turkey. Those who were less fortunate, or who were captured, were executed by command of Hajjaj.\n\nAfter the Battle of al-Jamājum, Hajjaj, who was still the governor of Kufa, ordered that all the rebels who escaped from the battle were to be captured and brought back to be punished. The main bounties were placed on Abd al-Rahman, Kumayl Bin Ziyad, and Sa'id ibn Jubayr. Hajjaj was able to capture Sa'id ibn Jubayr. The following is a dialog between Hajjaj and Sa'id ibn Jubayr after he was captured and presented to Hajjaj in his palace.\n\nHajjaj then executed Sa'id ibn Jubayr. After executing him, Hajjaj said the following:\n\nIt is also mentioned that Hajjaj ordered his forces to annoy/torture Kumayl's followers. For example, they deprived them of money leading to economic worries.\n\nAfter hearing the news about the torture of his family members and friends, Kumayl decided the only thing to do was to turn himself in to save them from persecution. He got his walking stick, ready to turn himself in. People around him asked: \"Kumayl, these people want you. Why don't you just hide.\" Kumayl replied, \"No, no more. A man who insults my master (referring to Imam Ali) is not a man I hide from. Who dare the insult. He (referring to Hajjaj) says where are the lovers of Abu Turab (Imam Ali). I am a lover of Abu Turab.\" Nonetheless, Hajjaj's forces brought Kumayl to him at his palace. In the meantime, Kumayl began remembering his past. He remembered the days when he was a soldier in the army of Imam Ali. He remembered the time when he led a small group of 400 soldiers to combat a raid by Mu'awiyah's army. He remembered disobeying Imam Ali (when leaving Hīt) and receiving a letter from Imam Ali. He remembered Imam Ali's words: \"Kumayl, order your family to do good. Order them to help people at night.\" When presented to Hajjaj, Kumayl saw a headsman carrying a sword with guards (who surrounded Hajjaj). Kumayl knew that death was certain. But, before his death Hajjaj and Kumayl engaged in the following dialog.\n\nSince Kumayl took a hardline stance over his love of Imam Ali, Hajjaj ordered the headsman to behead Kumayl. He was martyred at the age of 84 years.\n\nKumayl ibn Ziyad is held up as one of the greatest companions by many Muslims around the world. He left a great legacy with his words of wisdom, du'as (that he wrote down/preserved), his love for Imam Ali, his stance against oppression, corrupt rulers and martyrdom. His life highlighted that one should be disciplined, firm, have faith in Allah (God), and sacrifice to keep the message of Allah (God) alive. \"On Thursday nights, sweet words fly high in the sky full of stars. The words remind people of that great martyr whose name is connected with the supplication. His legacy will remain forever.\"\n\nShias all over the world recognize and honor Kumayl ibn Ziyad for his obedience, discipline, and love for Imam Ali. Furthermore, they revere him as a noble companion who preserved the secrets of the world, teachings of Imam Ali, and several \"du'as\" including \"Du'a Kumayl,\" which is recited by Shias on Thursday nights. They have a deep love for Kumayl because of his sacrifices for the religion of Islam.\n\nSunnis have mixed views of Kumayl ibn Ziyad. For example, some Sunni Rijal literature does not include Kuyaml's narrations because \"he has too much love for Imam Ali\". On the other hand, there are Sunni books of \"hadiths\" (reports) that accept Kumayl and respect him as a companion. Others see Kumayl as good companion of Imam Ali.\n\n\n",
                "List of Redwall characters\n\nThis article is about the characters in Brian Jacques' fantasy series \"Redwall\".\n\nThis is a list of the Abbey Warriors from the books \"The Legend of Luke\" to \"Eulalia!\".\n\nMartin I is an anthropomorphic mouse, appearing in the \"Redwall\" series by Brian Jacques.\n\nKnown as \"Martin the Warrior\" throughout the Redwall series, Martin, a woodland mouse, is the son of Luke the Warrior and his mate Sayna. Luke is the kindly leader of an idyllic tribe of mice. Their settlement is sacked by a wicked stoat pirate named Vilu Daskar, and Sayna is killed. Luke vows revenge against the corsair captain and sets out after him, refusing Martin's wishes to join him, but leaving his sword in his son's possession. Sometime later, Martin is captured by another tyrannical stoat called Badrang and becomes one of his horde of slaves. The young mouse is rebellious and insolent, however, and after spending some time as a slave, he manages to escape his captors. The son of Luke strikes out into the wilderness to rally help from other woodland creatures to come back with him to help liberate the rest of the slaves. He meets Laterose of Noonvale (normally called Rose), a mousemaiden with whom he develops a romantic relationship. She saves him from death numerous times, and shows that she is as much of a warrior as Martin. In the eventual assault on Badrang's fort, called Marshank, many of Martin's companions perish, including Rose, who is killed when Badrang throws her against a wall (in the TV series she dies when Badrang stabs her). However, Marshank is ultimately taken and Badrang slain by Martin himself, who reclaims his father's sword from the tyrant. The young mouse is devastated by the deaths of his friends, especially Rose, and he never takes on another love interest.\n\nAn unknown amount of time later, a still-young Martin the Warrior is making his way through the country called Mossflower, when he is beset upon and captured by soldiers of the land's ruling monarch, a wildcat named Verdauga. He is brought to the castle Kotir, before the king and his children, the princess Tsarmina and prince Gingivere. The cruel Tsarmina takes Martin's sword and breaks it, much to the warrior's dismay, after which Martin is thrown into the castle dungeons. Not long afterward, Tsarmina poisons and kills her lord father Verdauga, and frames her gentle brother for the regicide, thus taking the throne for herself. During the winter spent in the castle dungeon, Martin meets a fellow prisoner, Gonff the Mousethief, with whom he eventually escapes the prison with the help of a local rebel group. Martin and Gonff become inseparable companions, and together with new friends Dinny the mole and Log-a-Log Bigclub of the GUOSIM shrews, they set out on a quest to ultimately wrest Mossflower from Queen Tsarmina's ugly reign.\n\nThey resolve to enlist the help of Boar the Fighter, the Badger Lord of the mythical mountain Salamandastron, who they believe will be powerful enough to overthrow the wildcat queen. After an arduous journey to the faraway mountain stronghold, Boar the Fighter receives the companions and reforges Martin's broken blade with metal from a meteorite. However, before they can return to Mossflower, Salamandastron is besieged by the Badger Lord's nemesis, Ripfang the searat. Boar the Fighter is killed in the melee, but Ripfang's ship and crew are simultaneously mutinied by an uprising of oarslaves. Martin and his companions sail the ship back to Mossflower with a host of freed slaves, one of whom, called Timballisto, is a childhood friend of Martin's, and has knowledge of how to build siege equipment. The companions rally Mossflower's resistance forces and lay siege to Kotir, knocking down its walls and ultimately flooding it, with Martin slaying Tsarmina in a bloody duel. The warrior mouse suffers grievous wounds from this battle, but is ultimately nursed back to health, though it later appears some of his memories are lost to him forever. From the rubble of the fallen keep, the woodland allies construct Redwall Abbey in its place, forever a safe bastion for good creatures seeking respite from the wild world.\n\nIn \"The Legend of Luke\", when Redwall Abbey is at least partially constructed, Martin hears a guest at the Abbey singing a song that mentions Luke the Warrior. Recognizing that this is the same Luke who was his father, Martin finds out from the singer where he can learn more about his estranged sire. Gonff, Dinny, and some other companions join Martin as he journeys far to the northwest, toward the coast, and his birthplace. They encounter some of Luke's old friends, who relate to Martin and his company the full tale of what befell brave Luke after he left his son to pursue Vilu Daskar. They learn that, in his reckless pursuit of the pirate, Luke sailed into an ambush laid by Daskar when he realized he was being followed, and was taken prisoner as an oarslave. However, he was able to lead the greedy stoat into a trap of his own, claiming he could steer the ship to some hidden treasure. Once he had the wheel, he drove the vessel at several gigantic rocks during a fierce storm, rending the ship asunder and sending both himself and Vilu Daskar to the watery depths.\n\nBefore returning home, Martin is gifted with a tapestry of his father, which is later updated to look like Martin himself, and hangs in Redwall Abbey for generations afterward. With this journey behind him, Martin the Warrior, savior of Mossflower and Warrior of Redwall Abbey, decides to hang up his sword and pursue a life of peace until the end of his days. He appears as a vision to several of the Redwall champions, including Matthias, long after his death.\n\nHe appears in the books \"Mossflower,\" \"Martin the Warrior,\" and \"The Legend of Luke.\"\n\nMatthias is an anthropomorphic mouse, appearing in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nLater called Matthias the Warrior, Matthias is a male mouse of Redwall Abbey and the husband of Cornflower, father of Mattimeo, and the grandfather of Martin II. He is liked by many and expected by Abbot Mortimer to join the Order of Redwall as a peaceful care-giver. However, Matthias has the spirit of a warrior, always yearning for more to life and he has a passion for fighting. In \"Redwall,\" he is guided by the spirit of Martin the Warrior to find Martin's long-lost sword, which he then uses to protect Redwall Abbey from the invading forces of Cluny the Scourge. Afterwards, Matthias is named the Abbey Warrior and one of two new Redwall bells is named \"Matthias\" in his honour.\n\nHe appears in the books \"Redwall\" and \"Mattimeo.\" In Mattimeo, he goes on a quest to save his son and the other captured animals.\n\nMattimeo is an anthropomorphic mouse, appearing in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nMattimeo is the son of Matthias and Cornflower and the father of Martin II. His full name is Matthias Methuselah Mortimer, but everyone calls him Mattimeo for short (though sometimes his friends call him Matti). He is captured by Slagar the Cruel, along with other youngsters from the Abbey. Matthias and several others track down and rescue Mattimeo and the others.\n\nLater, Mattimeo marries Tess Churchmouse and they have a son, Martin - the second Redwall Warrior to have that name.\n\nMattimeo appears in the book \"Mattimeo\", and is mentioned in \"Redwall\".\n\nMartin II is an anthropomorphic mouse, appearing in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nMartin II is the son of Mattimeo and Tess Churchmouse and the grandson of Matthias and first appeared in \"The Pearls of Lutra\". Martin the Second was named for the first great warrior of Redwall. A tall, kindly mouse, Martin is a friend to all residents of Redwall Abbey. He spent many years honing his skills by aiding local woodlanders, including helping the Guosim shrew tribe fend off robber foxes.\nMartin is the third mouse ever to have suffered an attack of the Bloodwrath. (In the Redwall series, Bloodwrath is a condition when a character's eyes turn blood-red and they go berserk.) When Lask Frildur (a monitor lizard in the service of Ublaz Mad-Eyes), who had kidnapped Redwall's Abbot, hurtles the broken glasses that had belonged to the Abbot over the Abbey wall, Martin goes into the Bloodwrath, attempting to leap over the wall and slay the lizard. He would have done so, were it not for the restraint of the badger Auma and an otter.\nMartin later journeys to do battle with Ublaz Mad-Eyes, the pine marten emperor who seeks the Tears of All Oceans (six rose-hued pearls). Ublaz's troops make the major mistake of kidnapping Redwall's Abbot, and Martin comes hot on their heels with a group of companions. He engages Ublaz to a mortal duel, and, retreating after a vicious blow, the emperor steps upon a sleeping coral snake. The snake bites him several times before slithering back into its stone tank. Upon returning home, Martin swears fealty to Redwall's new Abbess, Tansy.\nLike his namesake, Martin the Second never marries. He presumably dies of old age, and his position is passed down to Arven the squirrel.\n\nMartin the Second appears in the book \"The Pearls of Lutra.\" However, he is also briefly mentioned at the end of \"Mattimeo\".\n\nArven is an anthropomorphic squirrel, appearing in the \"Redwall\" series.\nIn \"Pearls of Lutra\", Arven is a mischievous little squirrel who helps Tansy find the Pearls of Lutra (six rose-hued pearls) in order to pay the ransom for their Abbot, who was captured by pirates.\n\nIn \"The Long Patrol\", Arven is Redwall Abbey's Warrior. He fights in the battle against Damug Warfang and his Rapscallion army. Later he becomes Abbot, but passes away after just 3 seasons; this fact is mentioned in \"Marlfox\".\n\nDann, as his friends call him, is an anthropomorphic squirrel from the book \"Marlfox\". Dann lives with his father only, as his mother had died before the book began. His father, Rusvul Reguba, shortened his name to Dannflor when his mother died, since Rusvul and his wife couldn't agree on their son's name. Dann has warrior blood in his veins, but when he lets the great tapestry get stolen by two Marlfoxes his dad lashes out at him, telling Dann he is not worthy of the Reguba name. His father's statement causes Dann to become quite upset. Dann gets a message from Martin The Warrior telling him to go get the tapestry back. During the adventure he wields Martin's sword, which was taken from the blind badger Cregga's room. Though young, Dann becomes the Redwall Warrior at the end of \"Marlfox\".\n\nDeyna is an anthropomorphic otter, appearing in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nDeyna appears in \"Taggerung\". Kidnapped by a vermin tribe at birth, he is raised as their prophesied Taggerung, a great warrior. However, due to disagreements with his adopted father, he runs away and eventually comes to rest at Redwall where he discovers his mother and sister. He throws away his previous name of Zann Juskarath Taggerung \"Tagg\" and takes up his real name, Deyna, after his return to Redwall.\n\nOthers who may be considered minor warriors who used the sword of Martin are:\n\n\nThis mouse serves as Abbot of Redwall and is the successor to Abbot Cedric (although Cedric is never mentioned further in \"Redwall\" or even in other books of the series). He holds his Golden Jubilee as Abbot in the Summer of the Late Rose, ultimately giving Matthias a foothold to rise into the Champion he becomes by first conferring him the appointment of catching a fish with Brother Alf to grace the center table of the feast. He is one of the few who initially believes in Matthias. He is also close to Constance the Badger and appoints both Matthias and Constance as his generals when war reaches the Abbey. Unfortunately, he is an incredibly peaceful and un-warlike individual to the point that he allows Cluny and Redtooth to enter the Abbey for a parley, an unforgivable error in strategy. He is killed after being wounded by the poison barb Cluny wears on his tail, and on his deathbed makes Brother Alf the Abbot Mordalfus and blesses the forthcoming marriage between Cornflower and Matthias.\n\nAsmodeus Poisonteeth is a giant male adder who lives in an old sandstone quarry northeast of Redwall Abbey. He is also called \"Giant Ice Eyes\" by the shrews due to his possession of hypnotic powers. He is known to hiss his name, and is also unwittingly found by two of Cluny the Scourge's officers while dragging off another of his captain's corpses. For several years, he had possessed the sword of Martin, which he took from the sparrow King Bull Sparra. The mouse Matthias ventures into the adder's lair in search of Martin's sword. The serpent is found sleeping in the cave in which Asmodeus held the legendary sword. Matthias retrieves the sword, but Log-a-Log (a shrew) runs in and shouts hysterically on spotting the corpse of his shrew comrade Guosim, and the snake comes awake. With the sword he had taken, the mouse warrior quickly digs a hole out of the cave, and he is pulled out of the den by Log-a-Log. The snake gives chase, and is stuck in the small hole. He tries to hypnotize the two creatures, but a vision of Martin the Warrior comes in Matthias's thoughts and he breaks out of the snake's evil look. There, the reptile is destroyed, having his head cut off by the great sword's unbreakable edge. Asmodeus is voiced in the TV series by David Hemblen and by Nick Baty in the full-cast audiobook.\n\nBasil Stag Hare is an anthropomorphic hare in the Redwall series of books by Brian Jacques. Basil is a member of the Fur and Foot Fighters' and the Forty-Seventh Hare Border Rangers. Due to his admiration for stags, he took his second name for the creature. Basil is an expert in camouflage, and is well known for his appetite, as is the case with most hares. He lives alone in Mossflower Woods and becomes a close ally of Matthias, He distracts Cluny's gang of vermin while Matthias sneaks into St. Ninian's in an attempt to e rescue several hostages. Soon thereafter, he moves into Redwall Abbey, and assists Matthias throughout the remainder of Cluny's siege on the Abbey. In \"Mattimeo\" (the sequel to \"Redwall\"), Basil accompanies Matthias on his quest to rescue his son Mattimeo, and a group of other kidnapped children. He is voiced by Richard Binsley in the animated series, by Ron Delacruz in the full-cast audiobook of \"Redwall\" and by Simon Smithies in the audiobook of \"Mattimeo\".\n\nCluny the Scourge is an anthropomorphic rat.\n\nHe is an evil leader with an eye patch on his right eye and a poisoned barb on his unusually long tail, which is physically used as a whip (or in some cases, a fifth limb). He has a long ragged black cloak made of bat wings, fastened at the throat with a mole skull. Cluny is plagued in his dreams by the guardian spirit of Redwall, Martin the Warrior. According to the first chapters of the book, Cluny the Scourge is said to be a Portuguese rat (this being one of the few references to the human world in the whole series) as well as a sea rat. However, his true origins are uncertain, and it is also speculated that he was born in a jungle.\n\nCluny grew up as a searat, but came ashore with his army seeking plunder and destruction. His atrocities are told about across the land, though most believe him a story for frightening children. He commits many crimes, including the death of Matthias' family in the TV series. He comes to Mossflower seeking to take over, wanting to make Redwall Abbey into \"Cluny's Castle\". He expects little difficulty in defeating the inexperienced Redwallers, but is thwarted time and time again by their bravery and ingenuity.\n\nCluny's efforts are further hampered by nightmares of Martin the Warrior. Cluny keeps envisioning the warrior mouse, often with some other fell image with him, such as Cluny's dead captains or the serpent Asmodeus. Despite this, Cluny presses on. However, his plans, which include a battering ram, tunneling, getting onto the walls using a siege tower or plank stretched from a tree, all fail. He is successful, however, in cutting the image of Martin the Warrior out of the tapestry (which he theorizes will demoralize the Redwallers); it is eventually recovered, however.\n\nCluny eventually manages to get into Redwall by threatening the family of a dormouse he captured. The lead dormouse, named Plumpen, sneaks into Redwall and opens the main gate while everyone else is asleep. Cluny's horde breaks in, captures the defenders and takes over. Cluny mortally wounds Abbot Mortimer when Matthias, returning from his journey to find the Sword of Martin, attacks with an army of Guosim shrews and sparrows. Cluny's horde is defeated, and Cluny himself perishes at the warrior's paw when Matthias cuts down the Joseph Bell, crushing Cluny to death. However, the poison from the barb on the end of Cluny's tail is already taking effect on the Abbot by the time Matthias returns to him.\n\nCluny is portrayed as a good general and a fine tactician and is one of the three vermin invaders ever to make it into the Great Hall of the Abbey (the others being the raven General Ironbeak in \"Mattimeo\" and the Marlfoxes of \"Marlfox\") and the only one to invade \"en masse\", but he is still driven out by the Redwallers in the end. Cluny is a savage and skilled fighter (he had slain a pike, which he lost his eye to) and even Matthias the Warrior cannot beat him physically. He is only killed when he is crushed by the Joseph Bell of Redwall Abbey while fighting the mouse hero. His main weapon is his tail, from which he took his name, but in his battle with Matthias, he wields a metal spike taken from a church fence. His main outfit for battle is a set of armor with the horns of a stag beetle attached to the helmet.\n\nCluny is voiced on the TV series by Diego Matamoros, and by Jason Mulhearn in the full-cast audiobook (Mulhearn performed the character with a distinctive Spanish accent).\n\nA massive horde gathered together by Cluny the Scourge. When making plans for capturing the Abbey, he had his captains roam the countryside to forcefully recruit the ferrets, rats, stoats, and weasels into his army.\n\n\nCornflower is an anthropomorphic mouse in the Redwall series of books by Brian Jacques. She was voiced by Rachel Murphy in the full-cast audiobook of \"Redwall\" and by Alison Pill and Melissa McIntyre in the television series of \"Redwall\" and \"Mattimeo\", respectively.\n\nA pretty and kind young fieldmouse, Cornflower falls in love with Matthias, who shares her feelings but is bound to his duties as a novice of Redwall Abbey. \nIn \"Redwall\", Cornflower is of great help to Redwall Abbey during the Late Rose Summer War and is able to fend off Cluny the Scourge during one of his attacks. She happens to be on the parapet, and throws a lantern onto his siege tower, which causes it to burst into flames. When Abbot Mortimer is fatally wounded, he releases Matthias from his vows to become a monk at Redwall and ask that Matthias and Cornflower marry and be happy. She is the daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Fieldmouse, and after marrying Matthias, becomes mother of Mattimeo and grandmother of Martin the Second. Cornflower and her family reside in the gatehouse near the front of the abbey. She is a skilled cook and often wears headbands.\n\nIn \"Mattimeo\", Cornflower remains at the abbey as Matthias and other brave warriors head off to save the children, including their son Mattimeo, abducted by Slagar. When Redwall is attacked by General Ironbeak, Cornflower comes up with an idea to dress up as the ghost of Martin the Warrior to scare the superstitious birds. Her plan works, and the rooks and magpies become extremely frightened. Though she wishes to continue her masquerade in hopes of eventually gaining the upper hand on the birds, Abbot Mordalfus tells her to stop because she could be killed. Though the abbey dwellers are able to drive off Ironbeak, Cornflower grows worried as autumn approaches with no sign of Matthias and Mattimeo returning. However, as she is staring out from the walltop, she sees them coming back and runs down to greet them. At the conclusion of \"Mattimeo\", Cornflower and her husband have retired from their active lives at the abbey after Matthias passes down the role of the Warrior of Redwall to Mattimeo. With Mattimeo and Tess Churchmouse expecting their first child, Cornflower and Tess's mother persuade the young couple to name their son Martin, after the great warrior.\n\nFriar Hugo is an anthropomorphic mouse.\n\nHe is Abbot Mortimer's head chef of the kitchens and is instrumental in making the Abbot's golden jubilee feast a roaring success. His \"piece de resistance\" is his \"Grayling a la Redwall\", caught that day in the Abbey Pond after a two-hour struggle between the fish and Matthias and Brother Alf (later Abbot Mordalfus). Hugo uses white gooseberry wine, rosemary, thyme, beechnuts, fresh cream, and honey to bake the fish to perfection.\n\nThe Friar is characteristically fat; he is also very ceremonious. The Friar witnesses Matthias slaying Cluny by severing the Joseph Bell's ropes. Friar Hugo is close to Basil Stag Hare, the glutton who creates such a turnover of the food in his kitchen. A noble soul to the death, Friar Hugo tries to stop Slagar the Cruel in \"Mattimeo\" when the latter tries to kidnap the Redwallers' children, losing his life as a result; Basil Stag Hare openly laments his death.\n\nJess Squirrel is an anthropomorphic squirrel who appears in \"Redwall\" and \"Mattimeo\" from the Redwall series by Brian Jacques.\n\nJess Squirrel and her family live in Mossflower when Redwall Abbey comes under attack by Cluny the Scourge. Jess and her family come to Redwall after her son led Matthias there when he was lost, and they decide to remain at the Abbey while the war to capture Redwall rages. Jess, with her reputation as a champion climber, volunteers to scale the Abbey to retrieve the sword of Martin from the weathervane, although she is attacked by sparrows when she reaches it and forced to climb back down again. She reports that there are old rusty wires where the sword had probably once been, but it was not there.\n\nShortly afterwards, Jess and Basil Stag Hare concoct a plan to retrieve the stolen tapestry of Martin from Cluny, who is using it as a banner. They travel to Saint Ninian's, and with distraction, taunts, and a dishcloth they pretend is the tapestry they are able to snatch the genuine tapestry, passing it to each other like relay runners as they flee. Basil is slightly injured in the escape, so Jess takes the false banner and continues to taunt and chase the hordebeasts, taking to the trees. Cluny himself comes to try and wheedle her into giving back the banner with a mixture of threats and false promises about the safety of her family. Jess does not fall to his bait, but decides to play it off as though she believes him and gives him the false banner, then laughs when Cluny sees it is fake. She solemnly reports the loss of the dishcloth to Friar Hugo when she and Basil return to the Abbey.\n\nLater, when her son Sam is kidnapped by Slagar the Cruel, Jess sets out with Matthias and Basil Stag Hare to pursue the fox, and fights in the battle in the underground city of Malkariss.\n\nShe is voiced by Susan Roman in the animated series, by Eithne Brown in the \"Redwall\" full-cast audiobook, and Sandra Billinge in the \"Mattimeo\" audiobook.\n\nMethuselah is an anthropomorphic mouse.\n\nMethuselah is one of the oldest members of Redwall. He has seen many an Abbot and Abbess come and go, he has seen the Summer of the Late Rose thrice, and he has spent untold years studying the languages of all animals, as well as the history of Redwall and Mossflower Country. He is a Recorder, and therefore the Gatekeeper, because the two positions have remained together since the foundation of the Abbey. (Only after many years is the Recorder separated from the Gatehouse.) Methuselah has a special interest in the saga of Martin the Warrior, consequently taking interest in Matthias, in whom he sees many of the traits that distinguish a hero, going so far as to aid Matthias in finding the sword of Martin.\n\nMethuselah meets his death after restoring a tear in the tapestry of Martin the Warrior. The young fox Chickenhound (who later becomes Slagar the Cruel) is desperately trying to escape from Redwall with a sack of stolen valuables, and when Methuselah tries to stop him, the fox strikes him over the head with the heavy sack, unintentionally killing him.\n\nLater, one of the two new Redwall bells is named after Methuselah, in his remembrance.\n\nMethuselah was voiced by Colin Bean in the full-cast audiobook..\n\nWarbeak is an anthropomorphic sparrow.\n\nIn \"Redwall\", when Jess Squirrel climbs the outside of the Redwall Abbey building trying to reach the weathervane, which the Redwallers believe holds Martin the Warrior's sword, a bunch of sparrows attack Jess, among them Warbeak. To frighten the birds away, the Redwallers shoot arrows in the general direction of the sparrows, unintentionally wounding Warbeak in her leg. She falls to earth, where she rails at the young mouse Matthias, telling him that her king has a big sword and will kill Matthias with it. Matthias, believing that the sparrows must have Martin the Warrior's sword, forces Warbeak to accompany him on an indoor route to the attic where the sparrows live. Along the way, they become friends, and when the sparrow king captures Matthias, Warbeak and her mother try to save him. After the king drowns in the Abbey pond, Warbeak becomes the new Queen of the sparrows.\n\nIn \"Mattimeo\", Queen Warbeak is sent with a message from the Redwallers to Matthias, who is off tracking down the villainous fox Slagar. When Warbeak finally spots Matthias and company, they are in the midst of a battle with an army of rat archers. Warbeak and the sparrows plunge into the fight to help Matthias and Warbeak, along with most of her sparrow warriors, is killed. Her body is placed in a tree and covered in leaves, a sparrow custom.\n\nAbbess Germaine is an anthropomorphic mouse in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nGermaine is an old mouse and the Abbess of the mice from Loamhedge Abbey. She and her followers journey from their abbey after an epidemic breaks out and many die. Germaine and the mice take refuge with the badger Bella of Brockhall, since Tsarmina Greeneyes is the tyrant ruler of the land round about. The Abbess and Bella are old friends, the latter stating that in her youth she was a traveler, which is likely how she first met Germaine at Loamhedge.\n\nGermaine comes up with the plans for Redwall Abbey, and after Tsarmina is defeated, the woodlanders start building Redwall. Germaine is the new abbey's first Abbess, and she lives to be very old.\n\nGermaine appears in the books \"Mossflower\" and \"The Legend of Luke\".\n\nArgulor is an anthropomorphic golden eagle in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nArgulor is old and cannot see very well, but he is determined to eat Tsarmina's officer Ashleg, a pine marten (having never tasted pine martens before) and hunts and kills a number of her hordebeasts. Tsarmina is aware of this, and decides to use it to her advantage and get rid of Bane, a fox mercenary that is working for her (and she does not trust). She gives Bane a cloak that had belonged to Ashleg. Argulor sees what he thinks is Ashleg, and attacks. Bane fights with the eagle as he is lifted into the air, and they both kill each other.\n\nColumbine is an anthropomorphic mouse in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nColumbine is originally from an abbey called Loamhedge, and comes to the land of Mossflower with Abbess Germaine and other mice who were forced to leave Loamhedge when a deadly plague threatens their lives. She falls in love with Gonff the Mousethief, and is saddened when he accompanies Martin the Warrior on a quest to the mountain Salamandastron. She marries Gonff after he returns, and the self-proclaimed ruler of Mossflower, Tsarmina, is defeated. Work soon commences on a new Abbey called Redwall, and Gonff and Columbine have a son, also named Gonff, the day the gates of Redwall Abbey open.\n\nYoung Dinny is an anthropomorphic mole in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nDinny is a young mole who tags along on Martin's journey to the mountain Salamandastron. He helps get rid of the owl that continually frightened a colony of bats. Dinny also helps by getting himself, Martin, Log-a-Log, Gonff, and an eel named Snakefish out of captivity from a toad tribe called the Dampwatch. He also fights in the battle at Salamandastron. Dinny proves to be a hero in \"Mossflower\".\n\nIn \"The Legend of Luke\" Dinny is the Foremole (the leader of the moles). He accompanies Martin, Gonff and others on the journey to find out what befell Martin's father, Luke the Warrior after he had left Martin seasons before.\n\nFortunata is an anthropomorphic female fox in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nShe is a traitorous healer fox originally hired by Lord Verdauga Greeneyes to heal him of his illness. However, she secretly agrees to poison him on behalf of his daughter Tsarmina. Once Verdauga is dead and Tsarmina firmly in charge, Fortunata receives a high rank in her army. This, however, is exploited by the Corim, the resistance to Tsarmina's tyranny, who send an otter called the Mask (Skipper's brother) disguised as a fox called Patchcoat to make Fortunata believe that two hedgehogs had escaped from the prison of Kotir, and Fortunata flees. She masquerades as \"Besomtail\" during this, but is eventually killed by the Corim.\n\nGingivere is a name applying to two anthropomorphic cat characters from the Redwall book series.\n\nThe first Gingivere is a wildcat, son of Verdauga Greeneyes, brother of Tsarmina, and nephew of Ungatt Trunn. Gingivere is a gentle, honorable creature, unlike his sister Tsarmina. When Martin the Warrior is captured by a patrol and brought before Verdauga, Gingivere, a rather lenient creature, advises his father to have Martin escorted to the edge of Mossflower Woods and told never to return.\n\nA little later, Tsarmina frames Gingivere for the poisoning of their father, which she herself orchestrated. Gingivere is locked up, and his name is forbidden from speech in Kotir. Gingivere clearly sees who is truly guilty, and accuses his sister of the murder.\n\nIn the time that follows, Gingivere becomes gaunt and despairing in captivity. Fortunately, his positivity is restored when he finds himself neighbored by the young, captured hedgehogs Ferdy and Coggs. Amused by the little creatures' childishness, and their calling him Uncle, Gingivere soon becomes hopeful, and even orchestrates an arrangement with his sister's enemies to escape with the two young hedgehogs. Their escape comes in the form of the otter disguise master known as the Mask, who helps them break out. Unfortunately, Mask is fatally wounded, and dies before they can make it to Brockhall. Feeling duty bound to the otter for saving him and his young friends, Gingivere carries the limp form to where it can be put to rest.\n\nAfter a short time spent with the resistance, Gingivere departs, not wanting to increase Tsarmina's determination to destroy them with his presence. After journeying for a time, he meets a beautiful female cat, Sandingomm, and settles down with her. Becoming a farmer, Gingivere shelters the children and non-fighters of the resistance when they come seeking refuge.\n\nSquire Julian Gingivere is a descendent of the original Gingivere, and appears in the book \"Redwall\". Living in a barn some distance from Redwall Abbey, Julian is odd among cats in the fact that he is a vegetarian. He had lived with the owl Captain Snow, but the owl's appetite for meat, his bad table manners and their conflicting personalities led to a disagreement and then separation.\n\nDuring his search for Snow, young Matthias of Redwall comes across Julian. The two become friends, and Julian takes Matthias to see Snow. After Matthias learns what he wanted, he sets out after the adder Asmodeus. He later comes back to see Julian, and brings him along to meet Captain Snow. Extracting an apology from Snow, Matthias soon has the two back together, their disagreement forgotten. Julian later comes with Snow to Redwall, where they kill the last members of Cluny the Scourge's horde as they try to escape. Julian was voiced by Paul Denemy in the full-cast audiobook, and on the animated TV series by Keith Knight.\n\nGonff the Mousethief is an anthropomorphic mouse appearing in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nGonff was voiced by Dave Foode in the full-cast audiobook of \"Mossflower\". The character of Gonff is based on the author Brian Jacques as a young boy.\n\nKnown as the Prince of Mousethieves, a troublemaker and composer of songs and poems, Gonff is a humorous character. An orphaned woodland mouse in the time when Mossflower was dominated by Verdauga Greeneyes, Gonff is raised by and later becomes a member of the Corim, the resistance to the wildcat's tyranny. With skills of stealth and mimicry learned from just about every type of woodland creature, mainly the otters (whom Gonff even went so far as to mimic in speech), he regularly raids the larders of Castle Kotir, Verdauga's fortress.\n\nEventually, Gonff is caught and thrown in a cell with Martin the Warrior. With help from the Corim, the two escape and become best friends, Gonff always coming along on Martin's journeys. Upon returning to the Corim camp, Gonff falls in love with a lovely mouse from Loamhedge Abbey named Columbine. Gonff accompanies Martin on the quest to the legendary mountain Salamandastron, and upon their return and victory over Tsarmina, Verdauga's daughter, he marries Columbine.\n\nThe two take up residence at St. Ninian's church (later, they live at Redwall Abbey), along with their son, a chip off his father's block. Gonff accompanies Martin and several others on another journey, this time to learn the fate of Martin's father, Luke the Warrior. Along the way, they meet an orphan squirrel named Chugger, whom Gonff later adopts.\n\nGonff's line continues for many seasons, his heroic qualities expressing themselves in his descendant Dandin, his great-granddaughter Bryony, and his other descendants such as Bisky. Gonff rarely participates in battle, his best weapon being his wit. But when he does, he usually uses a dagger and a sling. He is friendly with all decent Mossflower residents, knowing many of their customs and speaking in their manner. He is also a player of the reed flute.\n\nTsarmina Greeneyes is an anthropomorphic wildcat appearing in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nTsarmina is a scheming, wicked wildcat, who lacks her father's honour and her brother's fairness. When the mouse Martin the Warrior is brought before them, she demands his execution, but her father has him imprisoned instead, to be released, escorted to the edge of their territory, and given back his sword at a later time. Tsarmina breaks the weapon's blade, tying a rope around the handle and placing it about Martin's neck as a sign of his encounter with them. Enraged, Martin swears to kill her.\n\nMurder is committed soon after, but not by Martin. Tsarmina, conspiring with her father's treacherous advisors, poisons her father and frames her gentle brother Gingivere for the crime. Taking over as queen of the fortress Kotir, she locks up her brother and seeks to enforce her rule. However, she meets resistance in the form of the Corim, the organization that was set up to oppose her and her father.\n\nTsarmina's plans are thwarted time and again by the determined woodlanders. She finds herself menaced by them, treacherous members of her own troops, and an old eagle named Argulor (who is determined to eat her, or another of her officers). Things are made worse after Martin and Gingivere escape her prison, leaving her looking foolish.\n\nAs time goes on, her sanity begins to decay, and she begins thinking that her brother is behind everything. She also keeps imagining herself drowning in water, which fills her with terror. Her empire crumbles and her nightmares became reality when her enemies flood Castle Kotir and destroy her forces. She meets Martin in one-on-one combat, and wounds him drastically. However, despite the severity of his wounds, the warrior mouse refuses to submit and continually rises to meet her in combat, filled with anger and fury. Tsarmina becomes alarmed at her seeming inability to slay Martin, and due to her tenuous grasp on reality, becomes overwhelmingly terrified of him. In a panic, she backs away from Martin. Her fear of Martin is so great it overwhelms her fear of water, and she backs into the lake created by the Kotir flooding. Desperate to escape Martin, Tsarmina goes in too deep and drowns, causing her original nightmare to become real.\n\nThis group serves as Tsarmina's army. They are based at Kotir castle. Among the members of the Thousand Eye Army are:\n\n\nVerdauga Greeneyes is an anthropomorphic wildcat in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nVerdauga is a warlord of Mossflower Woods, who rules the fortress Kotir with his \"Thousand Eye\" Army. He is the younger brother of Ungatt Trunn and the father of Tsarmina and Gingivere. He hails from the far north and settles in the abandoned fortress of Kotir to rule the native woodlanders for many seasons.\n\nA leader of flair, his many titles include Master of the Thousand Eyes, Lord of Mossflower, Slayer of Enemies, and Ruler of Kotir. Late in his old age, he suffers from an unknown illness and is tricked and poisoned by the joint efforts of his healer, Fortunata, and his treacherous daughter, Tsarmina, who takes over his position.\n\nVerdauga is one of the more merciful warlords in the \"Redwall\" series and certainly a just ruler, as he spares the life of Martin the Warrior after his guards bring him to Kotir for trespassing.\n\nVerdauga was voiced by Dave Foode in the full-cast audiobook. The name \"Verdauga\" is a Latin derivation meaning \"green eyes.\"\n\nSlagar the Cruel (born Chickenhound) is an anthropomorphic fox.\n\nHe has many hidden plans and reasons which he only reveals by his own free will. His most characteristic trait is his desire for revenge and his pursuit of it, leaving death and misery in its wake.\n\nSlagar reveals himself as Chickenhound, the young fox from \"Redwall\", to Mattimeo during their journey. He gives Mattimeo a biased story in which he is an innocent youngster whom the Redwallers are responsible for injuring, and he has personified them in Matthias. In truth, he is the son of the healer Sela. His mother was a traitor to both the horde of Cluny the Scourge they were employed by, and the Redwall creatures who took them in, to exploit the most benefit from each side. Chickenhound was Sela's assistant in her plans.\n\nCluny suspected the foxes were planning to double-cross him, and set a trap to expose them. They were caught, and Cluny ordered their execution by spearing. Sela was slain, but Chickenhound survived and dragged himself wounded to Redwall. He was cared for in the infimary, and told the Redwallers about Cluny's plans to tunnel into the abbey, an act that quite likely saved Redwall from being conquered. After he recovered, he began to believe that he was being imprisoned and escaped, stealing valuables on his way out. Pursued by the Redwallers, he accidentally killed an old mouse named Methuselah in his haste to escape.\n\nRunning for his life, Chickenhound hid in a cave under an old log where the giant adder Asmodeus Poisonteeth ambushed him and bit him in the face. Chickenhound escaped from the snake's lair and nursed himself back to health with the 'art of the healers'. The right side of his face remained horribly disfigured by the wound, and so Chickenhound began wearing a harlequin hood and mask to conceal it. His mind was twisted and warped by the venom, and he began to believe the Redwallers were responsible for his condition. Eventually, he renamed himself Slagar the Cruel and began to plot his 'revenge'.\n\nSlagar is a prolific slaver. This also demonstrates that he also has some other plan for collecting the slaves. Eventually, it is discovered that he acts as a slaver for Malkariss, a speaking statue which contains a prideful polecat, in an underground city of rats. Slagar has been slaving for many seasons before he comes to Redwall, as he had allied with Malkariss to provide him with new slaves. He has become infamous even before his attempt at Redwall and therefore, although not in view of Redwall, has made slaving a practice, but not his future.\n\nSlagar's future, as he determines it, is the command of the evil realm of Malkariss within the ruins of old Loamhedge, the abbey that preceded Redwall. His plans center on bringing the unfortunate young slaves to Malkariss, to align himself with the evil forces within. The lust for sweet revenge drives him into kidnapping Mattimeo and the Redwall young ones, but his dissatisfied hunger for power - and having his reward delayed - drives him to plot further to overthrow his master and rule the above and the below lands. Yet, before he could do this, the warriors of Redwall and Mossflower destroy Malkariss and free the slaves. Slagar meets with the bitter fate of being chased until he falls down a vast well hole and dies.\n\nHe was voiced by Simon Smithies in the full-cast audiobook of \"Redwall\" (as Chickenhound) and by Paul Braithwaite in \"Mattimeo\", and by Tim Curry in the animated series.\n\nVitch is a young rat who is one of Slagar's henchmen. He is accepted into Redwall Abbey because of his size, as well as the fact that he looks something like a mouse, enabling him to secretly spy on Redwall. After Malkariss' kingdom collapses, Vitch emerges alive and is killed by Slagar's bolos. His body is lowered into a pit and buried by Orlando the Axe.\n\nThis group is led by Slagar and consists of vermin slavers who help Slagar capture slaves for Malkariss. It is said by a crazy old rabbit Matthias and friends meet that once Slagar's slaves were captured and brought to Malkariss' domain, Slagar would either kill the remainder of the vermin or leave them behind. Besides Vitch, among the members of Slagar's gang are:\n\n\nMalkariss is an anthropomorphic polecat appearing in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nMalkariss is the evil ruler of a hellish underground kingdom where young animals work as slaves to build a city for him whilst he resides within an immense and terrifying statue of a demonic polecat. He issues his orders to his slaves via Nadaz.\n\nMatthias the Warrior and his comrades Orlando the Axe, a badger warrior, Basil Stag Hare, Jess Squirrel, Jabez Stump (a hedgehog), and Cheek the Otter discover the Kingdom of Malkariss when Matthias's son, Mattimeo, Auma, Orlando's daughter, and other slaves are kidnapped and taken there by Slagar.\n\nAfter a long journey they find the entrance to the Kingdom at the heart of a somewhat menacing wilderness. In the underground kingdom, they challenge Malkariss, Nadaz and Slagar in Malkariss's palace. Matthias does battle with a monstrous hybrid called the Wearet. During the battle, a basket is lowered down from Malkariss's statue and into The Void, a pit beneath the walkway upon which Matthias and the Wearet are duelling.\n\nThe fight climaxes with Matthias falling into The Void. He lands on the basket and bounces off. The basket opens and Malkariss emerges. He is revealed to be an ancient, frail and repulsively hideous polecat which picks up Matthias's sword, ominously saying \"\"You have looked upon Malkariss. You must die.\"\" Before he can slay the mouse, however, Malkariss's slaves arrive and upon recognizing their tyrant master, proceed to pelt him to death with stones and rocks.\n\nThe Kingdom of Malkariss is revealed to be the ruins of an ancient and forgotten abbey named Loamhedge, which Malkariss is presumably trying to rebuild. However, Malkariss does not appear in Jacques's novel \"Loamhedge\" and his origins remain unknown.\n\nNadaz is a rat and the leader of the Blackrobe Rats who serves as a high priest. After Malkariss is killed by the slaves, Nadaz assumes temporary management of the underground Kingdom and takes refuge within Malkariss's statue. Nadaz is killed when Orlando and Matthias demolish the statue.\n\nThe name Wearet applies to several characters in the Redwall novel series by Brian Jacques. Wearets are massive vermin, crosses between weasels and ferrets.\n\nA minion of the evil Malkariss, the Slavemaster Wearet appeared in answer to the challenge of Matthias the Warrior of Redwall Abbey. He proved to be a daunting opponent to the mouse warrior, armed with a weighted net and stabbing spear. After a long battle, the Slavemaster was able to knock Matthias off the ledge they were battling on, seemingly killing him. However, his victory was short lived, as he fell under the mad charge of Orlando the Axe and Matthias' other companions.\n\nLikely a descendant of the first Wearet, Kharanjul is the trident wielding ruler of the Abyss near Malkariss' former domain. Commander of a horde of assorted vermin, some of them likely descendants of the horde of Malkariss, Kharanjul was a massive warrior. He served to block the path of a group of Redwallers as they made their way home from the ruins of Loamhedge Abbey. However, he was slain when the massive tree trunk he and his horde stood upon was tipped into the Abyss by Bragoon and Saro. Kharanjul appears in \"Loamhedge\". He was voiced by Ron Delacruz.\n\nIn \"The Rogue Crew\", there is a crew of evil searats and corsairs, led by Razzid Wearat, captain of the infamous ship \"Greenshroud\".\n\nOrlando the Axe is an anthropomorphic badger. Orlando's weapon is a large battleaxe. His young daughter Auma was kidnapped by Slagar, and Orlando sets off to find her and make Slagar pay. On the way he meets Matthias the Warrior with others from Redwall who are tracking down Slagar too, Orlando joins forces with them.\n\nRollo Bankvole is an anthropomorphic vole. In \"Mattimeo\", he is a baby whose mother is killed and sister kidnapped by Slagar. Cornflower and Mrs. Churchmouse are the main ones who take care of him after this tragedy. Rollo proves to be helpful to the Redwallers though just a baby, inadvertently assisting them with a very important riddle.\n\nWhen General Ironbeak the raven and his army show up at Redwall and partially take it over, Rollo, Cornflower, and Mrs. Churchmouse are captured by Ironbeak as hostages. The Redwallers, however, capture three of Ironbeak's magpies, and they exchange prisoners.\n\nIn \"Pearls of Lutra\", Rollo is the elderly Recorder of Redwall Abbey. He and the young hedgehog maid Tansy, the squirrelmaid Craklyn, and the mousemaid Piknim figure out the riddles telling where the Tears of All Oceans (six beautiful rose-colored pearls) are hidden. Following the death of Piknim by a flock of jackdaws who had previously claimed St. Ninian's Church, Rollo orders its destruction due to the fact that it housed too many vermin over the seasons.\n\nGeneral Ironbeak is an anthropomorphic raven, appearing in the \"Redwall\" series .\n\nGeneral Ironbeak is the fiercest fighter in all of the Northlands. He grew tired of the cold and traveled south to Mossflower Woods with his army of birds. It is here that he sees Redwall Abbey and decides to conquer it while the warrior Matthias and his group are away pursuing Slagar the Cruel. He starts by infiltrating the loft and roof spaces of the Abbey. Ironbeak tries to capture a baby vole named Rollo, but is driven off by a Redwall Sister. General Ironbeak later manages to capture Baby Rollo, Matthias the Warrior's wife Cornflower, and Mrs. Churchmouse. He then delivers an ultimatum for the Redwall Abbey residents to surrender and he will return the hostages. While Abbot Mordalfus buys some time, the Redwall residents devise a plan. They manage to capture some members of General Ironbeak's flock and state that they will return them if he returns his hostages. Once the exchange is done, General Ironbeak and his army stock up on supplies and infiltrate the dormitories.\n\nGeneral Ironbeak then lays siege to Redwall Abbey. Matthias's wife Cornflower comes up with a plan to scare the superstitious birds. She dresses up in long-gone hero Martin the Warrior's armor while the Abbey's resident badger Constance calls out in a spooky voice to make the soldiers in General Ironbeak's flock think that Martin the Warrior's ghost has returned.\n\nWhen General Ironbeak leads his flock to capture the besieged Abbey creatures, a large red kite named Stryk Redkite (who has been healed by the Redwall Abbey residents) charges into battle and kills General Ironbeak. The surviving followers of General Ironbeak are flown back to the Northlands under the watch of Stryk Redkite.\n\nIn the cartoon, General Ironbeak wears a helmet to distinguish himself from the other members of his flock.\n\nGeneral Ironbeak's group are a bunch of birds who share his hatred of the cold of the Northlands and join him in a plot to take over Redwall Abbey. Among its members are:\n\n\nMariel Gullwhacker is a fictional character, an anthropomorphic mouse from the Redwall series of books by Brian Jacques. Mariel was voiced by Keddy Sutton in the full-cast audiobook of \"Mariel of Redwall\".\n\nThe daughter of Joseph the Bellmaker, Mariel accompanies her father on the voyage to deliver the Joseph Bell to Badger Lord Rawnblade Widestripe of Salamandastron. Along the way, they are captured by searats, and Mariel is enslaved. However, when her master, Gabool the Wild, comes at her with a sword, she bests him. As a result, she is thrown into the raging sea.\n\nMariel washes up on the shores of Mossflower Country, her memories blocked due to an injury suffered at sea. Taking the name Storm Gullwhacker, she sets off into the woods, eventually coming to Redwall Abbey. She later remembers who she is as a result of hearing a poem recited by Saxtus, one of the Abbey mice. After recovering her memories, she sets out with several companions, including her good friend Dandin the Sword Carrier, to kill Gabool.\n\nMariel and her friends have several adventures along the way, eventually meeting up with Rawnblade as the Badger Lord makes his own way to Gabool's fortress. Arriving on the isle of Terramort, she teams up with the resistance led by her father Joseph to depose Gabool. Mariel later comes back to Redwall with her father, but departs with Dandin to seek adventure together.\n\nFour seasons later, the duo become involved in the war against the evil Urgan Nagru. They fight gallantly alongside many allies, including the arriving Joseph. After Nagru is slain by Finnbarr Galedeep, Mariel and Dandin return to Redwall for a time, before leaving again to \"see what was over the horizon\" with a young hedgehog called Bowly Pintips.\n\nMariel's main weapon is a knotted piece of rope. Its name, Gullwhacker, comes from the fact that Mariel first uses it to ward off hungry seabirds. The original Gullwhacker, carried in the quest against Gabool, is later tied to the end of the rope used to ring the Great Joseph Bell.\n\nDandin the Sword Carrier is an anthropomorphic mouse. He is a descendant of Gonff the Mousethief. In \"Mariel of Redwall\" Dandin befriends Storm Gullwhacker the mousemaid when she arrives at Redwall. After Storm remembers her real name, Mariel, and all that has happened to her, she swears revenge on the searat Gabool the Wild and sets off to slay him. Dandin, Durry Quill, and Tarquin (a hare) go with Mariel on her quest.\n\nDuring \"Mariel of Redwall\", Dandin carries Martin the Warrior's sword; Simeon the blind herbalist was led by Martin's spirit to place it by Dandin as he slept.\n\nIn \"The Bellmaker\", Dandin and Mariel help the inhabitants of Southsward defeat Urgan Nagru and put the rightful ruler back on the throne. Dandin doesn't use Martin's sword in this book.\n\nDurry Quill is an anthropomorphic hedgehog in the novels \"Mariel of Redwall\" and \"The Bellmaker\". He was voiced by Greg Longridge in the audiobook \"Mariel of Redwall\" and by Dave Foode in the framing scenes for \"Martin the Warrior\".\n\nAs a young hedgehog, Durry grew up being trained as a Cellarhog by his beloved uncle Gabriel Quill. However, upon learning of the quest of Mariel Gullwhacker and Dandin the Sword Carrier, he decided to accompany them. The young hog's logic and knowledge of healing poultices proved invaluable in the journey to do battle with Gabool the Wild. Like his friends, Durry was a captain of the Trag resistance alongside Badger Lord Rawnblade Widestripe of Salamandastron and Joseph the Bellmaker.\n\nFour seasons later, Durry had replaced his late uncle as Cellarhog of Redwall Abbey. However, he was one of five chosen, along with his friend Rufe Brush, to journey to the land of Southsward and help Mariel and Dandin battle Urgan Nagru. Along the way, Durry was mentored in the ways of the warrior by the sea otter Finnbarr Galedeep. After the battle ended, Durry was given one of the otter's swords for his bravery, which he named Finnbarr in honor of its deceased former owner. Durry returned to Redwall, and later assisted Rufe in telling the story to a group of Dibbuns.\n\nDurry commonly wielded an assortment of daggers, but his usual attack method was to roll up in a ball, protecting himself and injuring enemies with his sharp spikes.\n\nGabool the Wild is an anthropomorphic rat.\n\nKnown as King of the Searats and Warlord of the Seas, Gabool was a pirate monarch whose fortress lay on the island of Terramort. Gabool terrorized the seas for years, following in the footsteps of many tyrants of Mossflower. Gabool's last great plunder was the Joseph Bell, and the capture of Joseph the Bellmaker and Mariel Gullwhacker. However, Gabool was humiliated when Mariel, a mere girl, defeated him in a duel.\n\nThrowing Mariel to the sea, Gabool later did the same to Joseph when the mouse refused to build a tower for his new bell. As his plans began to fail, Gabool began going insane, dreaming of Mariel, the bell, and a massive Badger Lord, and hallucinating the sounding of the bell when it was silent. Gabool's insanity went so far as killing several of his own captains, such as Flogga, Saltar, and Bluddrigg.\n\nGabool's nightmares came true when Mariel returned, leading an army of resistance forces and accompanied by the Bloodwrath-taken Badger Lord Rawnblade Widestripe. Despite trapping Rawnblade in a pit with a giant scorpion, Gabool was killed when the badger threw the scorpion Skrabblag out of the pit onto Gabool, and the creature stung him to death.\n\nGabool is voiced in the full-cast audiobook by Simon Smithies.\n\nGabool commanded many corsairs from his island of Terramort. The ships that are under the command of his corsairs are the \"Darkqueen\", the \"Rathelm\", the \"Blacksail\" (later renamed \"Hon Rosie\"), the \"Seatalon\", the \"Greenfang\", the \"Crabclaw\" (formerly the \"Periwinkle\"), the \"Waveblade\" (later renamed \"Gabriel\"), and the \"Nightwake\" (later renamed \"Abbot Bernard\").\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Honourable Rosemary (known also as Hon Rosie), is a female anthropomorphic hare. She is a major character in \"Mariel of Redwall\", and even more so in its successor, \"The Bellmaker\". In both books, she is renowned especially for her skill with a sling, bow, javelin etc., earning her the nickname 'Hawkeye', and for her annoying tendency to laugh tremendously at the most inappropriate of times.\n\nShe is a member of the Long Patrol, the army of fighting hares who serve Rawnblade Widestripe, the badger lord of Salamandastron, the extinct volcano by the sea.\n\nIn \"Mariel of Redwall\", Rosie is a good friend and comrade of Colonel Clary and Brigadier Thyme, also of the Long Patrol. Both hares are killed while fighting against overwhelming numbers of searats. Rosie, who takes part in the same battle herself, very nearly dies of her many grievous injuries, but survives because Redwallers find her while hunting down the remaining searats.\n\nRosemary's ardent admirer, Tarquin L. Woodsorrel, another anthropomorphic hare, chases after her in \"Mariel of Redwall\". He remains firmly convinced that he is the apple of her eye, and he composes love ballads in her name. At the end of the book, we learn that he has married Hon Rosie, and that they have had several baby hares (leverets).\n\nIn \"The Bellmaker\", Rosie is chosen by the spirit of Martin the Warrior to leave her husband at the Abbey and to embark upon a quest to find Mariel 'Gullwhacker' and her friend, Dandin the Sword Carrier, along with Mariel's father, (Joseph the Bellmaker), Rufe Brush (the Abbey bell-ringer), Durry Quill (the Abbey cellarhog) and Foremole (the head of moles in Redwall Abbey). The five set out to find the two adventurers. They meet some good friends on the way, and in the battle that takes place at the end of the book between the woodlanders of Mossflower Woods and the tyrant fox, Urgan Nagru, over the land called 'Southsward', these friends help them to win the war. Four of the travellers, including The Honourable Rosemary, return safely to the Abbey with Mariel and Dandin, but Joseph chooses to stay with the inhabitants of Southsward to help them rebuild their homes. Hon Rosie settles back into the quiet Abbey life with her husband, Tarquin, and their leverets.\n\nRufe Brush is an anthropomorphic squirrel. In the audiobook, he was voiced by Paul Braithwaite.\n\nRufe lived all his life at Redwall Abbey with friends like Dandin the Sword Carrier and Durry Quill. Serious and not given to much emotion, Rufe was originally written as being among the more business-like creatures at Redwall. After Dandin and Durry departed in the company of mousemaid Mariel, Rufe helped defend the Abbey against a searat invasion. After the great Joseph the Bellmaker came to Redwall, Rufe carried the sword of Martin the Warrior up to the Abbey weathervane. He was also appointed Abbey bellringer.\n\nRufe's own chance for adventure came when Martin the Warrior chose him as one of five to journey to Southsward to aid Dandin and Mariel in the battle against Urgan Nagru. Rufe was rewritten by Brian Jacques as being reluctant, having lived in Redwall all his life, but he persevered bravely with the help of several friends, including Joseph the Bellmaker, Finnbarr Galedeep, and a shrew named Fatch. As a result of his bravery in the battle, Rufe received one of Finnbarr's swords following the otter's death. In memory of his fallen comrades, he named the sword Fatch, since his shrew friend had given his life to save Rufe. Rufe would return to Redwall, where he spent the rest of his life. He later told the tale of his adventure to a group of Dibbuns.\n\nHe was mentioned as \"Rufe Brushtail\" in the book \"Salamandastron\".\n\nTarquin Longleap Woodsorrel is an anthropomorphic hare. He is a hare who was sent by the badger Lord of Salamandastron, Rawnblade, to Redwall Abbey. Tarquin composes terrible songs, and doesn't realize how awful they are.\n\nTarquin is one of the several who accompanies Mariel Gullwhacker on her quest to slay Gabool.\n\nHe is head over heels in love with the Honourable Rosemary (often known as Hon Rosie). She doesn't seem to take much notice of him, but he believes she adores him. At the end of the book it is revealed that Rosie has married Tarquin, and that they have several children.\n\nArula is an anthropomorphic mole from the \"Redwall\" series. She is one of the main characters in the book \"Salamandastron\". She is the grandmother of Burrem, an infant mole who listens to a story told by Dumble, who is a baby himself in the main narrative.\n\nArula was the friend of Samkim the squirrel. After the stoats Dingeye and Thura accidentally killed Redwall's recorder, Brother Hal, and stole the sword of Martin the Warrior, Arula went with Samkim to retrieve the sword. She also buries Thura, the first animal killed by Dryditch Fever.\n\nArula is among the army led against Ferahgo the Assassin to aid Salamandastron's hares and Badger Lord, Urthstripe the Strong. She and the other troops are led by Urthwyte the Mighty, the albino brother of Urthstripe.\n\nNear the end of the novel, Arula discovers a spring of cold water deep in Salamandastron, making it nearly invulnerable to siege.\n\nHer name comes from a Redwall fan named Laura, who gave Brian Jacques a curriculum vitae with reasons why she would make a good mole character.\n\nDingeye is a stoat who was a soldier in Ferahgo the Assassin's horde. He and his friend Thura (who was also a stoat) deserted the horde and wandered about aimlessly until they eventually ended up at Redwall Abbey. There, they were treated as guests, although they repaid the woodlanders by accidentally shooting Brother Hal in the neck with a bow and arrow. Afraid they would suffer dire consequences, the two stoats stole Martin the Warrior's sword and fled into Mossflower Woods.\n\nWhen Thura soon died of the dreaded Dryditch Fever in the depths of Mossflower, Dingeye continued without him, only to be caught up with by Ferahgo's tracker Dethbrush who beheaded him and took the sword.\n\nFerahgo the Assassin is an anthropomorphic weasel of average maturity, brown fur, and cold blue eyes. Like his son Klitch, he is quite handsome and charming, hiding a cruel viciousness beneath this persona. It is said that the more he smiles, the more dangerous he becomes. His normal outfit consists of a yellow tunic with a red vest, a fur loin cloth, and a knife belt. He is commonly known as just \"Ferahgo\".\n\nFerahgo was known to have an unpredictable personality, switching moods quickly from calm to dangerous. He is very greedy, and often went overboard with his greed, as shown with Sickear. He was also known to trick others into doing things for him, with his blue eyes and clever skills. He smiled a soothing, disarming smile quite often, and despite its soothingness, it usually meant death for someone.\n\nAs described in the earlier part of Salamandastron, Ferahgo is an accurate thrower of his skinning knives, once taking the ear off a stoat called Migroo when he failed to do Ferahgo's bidding. Ferahgo is also capable of skinning any soldier among his horde of Corpsemakers; although it has never actually been described in Salamandastron, he has hinted at it several times by saying things like \"There's a fresh edge on my skinning knife which I haven't used yet.\"\n\nAlthough never described in complete detail, Ferahgo killed the parents of the Badger Lords Urthstripe the Strong and Urthwyte the Mighty, and stole a medal previously belonging to them, which he wore around his neck for the majority of the novel.\n\nA few seasons later, the assassin traveled to the northern lands, and sought to take over the mountain of Salamandastron. However, he was opposed by Badger Lord Urthstripe and his army of hares (the Long Patrol). Along with his treacherous son Klitch, the poisoner fox Farran, and his horde (the Corpsemakers), the weasel laid siege to the mountain. Later, when an army of Urthstripe's allies (led by his brother Urthwyte) arrived, Ferahgo reached Urthstripe atop Salamandastron and fought him. They were both killed during the battle.\n\nKlitch is an anthropomorphic weasel. He is the son of Ferahgo the Assassin, and resembles him closely. The young weasel is described as being attractive, intelligent, and cunning. His normal attire includes a bright yellow tunic and a plumed beret.\n\nKlitch first appears when he infiltrates Salamandastron by befriending the badger Mara, succeeding in gaining her trust and gaining admission to the stronghold. He then betrays and imprisons her, and aids his father in the siege of Salamandastron. Later on, after an unsuccessful plot to kill his father, Ferahgo the Assassin approaches Klitch and informs of the failed attempt. Klitch, knowing nothing of the plot, answers his father of his innocence in the plot. Eventually he and Ferahgo breach the fortress, only to be attacked by a tribe of Guosim shrews, Samkim, Mara, and Urthwyte the Mighty. Ferahgo dies, but Klitch survives by hiding under two slain vermin he killed. After the great battle, he emerges from beneath them and begins to plan his future. Not having drunk anything for a while, Klitch finds a water barrel in the fortress and drinks from it. He dies nearly instantly, due to the poison placed in it earlier under Ferahgo's order.\n\nThe Corpsemakers is the name of Ferahgo the Assassin's army. The following consist of the known members of the Corpsemakers even though Ferahgo claimed to have more than 4,000 at his command:\n\n\nBrother Hal is a minor character in the fictional series Redwall by Brian Jacques, appearing in the book \"Salamandastron\". He is a recorder mouse of Redwall Abbey; it is his job to write down events and keep a record of everything that happens. He dies early on in the book as a result of an archery accident caused by two stoats, Dingeye and Thura, who were visiting Redwall. Thereafter, the stoats promptly leave, and take the sword of Martin the Warrior with them, which has only just recently been recovered. A young squirrel (who's fond of archery) named Samkim is suspected of accidentally killing Brother Hal. After escaping his imprisonment, Samkim and his sidekick Arula set out on a quest to recover Martin's sword and bring it back to Redwall Abbey.\n\nSamkim is an anthropomorphic squirrel. He was named after a Redwall fan, Samantha Kim.\n\nSamkim was an archer, causing much trouble whenever he used his bow. When Brother Hal was found dead with an arrow in his neck and Samkim nearby holding the bow, the first reaction was to accuse Samkim (indeed, Friar Bellows, on his way to the kitchens and the first to discover Samkim and Brother Hal, took this action). However, two stoats named Dingeye and Thura, taking refuge at Redwall, were the real perpetrators. Samkim is moved into the infirmary while the Abbey elders discuss the incident and the disappearance of Martin the Warrior's sword. As they are doing this, Samkim's friend Arula eavesdrops on the conversation and goes to tell Samkim, and together they leave the Abbey to track down the stoats and recover the sword of Martin.\n\nSamkim finds Thura, already dead, in an area of Mossflower woods; he had died of a sickness called Dryditch fever. A hedgehog called Spriggat discovers Dingeye's body, headless. All three of them then learn trackers were sent from Ferahgo the Assassin's horde to find and kill the stoats, from a family of rabbits (though they speak ambiguously of it). They then set off to ambush the group of trackers and recover Martin the Warrior's sword.\n\nSamkim reclaims the sword after its carrier, a fox called Dethbrush, was slain by a monster called the Deepcoiler during a duel between Samkim and the vermin on a logboat. Samkim, within moments of reclaiming the sword, loses it again as he stabs it into the roof of the Deepcoiler's mouth. The sword plunges deep into the creature's brain and it sinks into the water before Samkim can take the sword back. The Deepcoiler luckily washes up on an island the next day and the sword of Martin the Warrior is retrieved by the young badger Mara (another main character in the book).\n\nBadrang the Tyrant is an anthropomorphic stoat and the main villain in \"Martin the Warrior\".\n\nA former pirate captain, Badrang abandoned life at sea and began building a fortress known as Marshank. Capturing numerous slaves, including a young mouse named Martin, he also steals Martin's sword. Badrang keeps Martin captive for years, but eventually, the young warrior escapes. Badrang then faces humiliation, as a group of traveling performers escapes with his slaves and his fortress is stolen from him by a rival stoat captain named Tramun Clogg.\n\nSneaking back inside with his troops through a slaves' escape tunnel, Badrang reclaims Marshank, adding his rival's crew to his legion by offering them death, slavery, or horde membership, and putting the rival to work building the fortress. Badrang then is placed under siege, as a motley band of former slaves and traveling performers attack Marshank. Not giving in, Badrang manages to slay Felldoh, one of the prime members, who charges out to offer him single combat long before the others arrive.\n\nBadrang's luck runs out when Martin returns from a long journey to Noonvale, with an army of free creatures in tow that number as great as Badrang's horde in number, and have odds of two to one in skill. Overwhelming Marshank's defenses, the army threatens to slay Badrang. The stoat is attacked by Laterose (also known as Rose) of Noonvale (Martin's love) with her sling loaded as he tries to escape, but Badrang angrily throws the maiden against the wall, killing her.\n\nBadrang himself is killed when Martin plunges the sword Badrang has so long held into the stoat's chest after the death of Rose.\n\nBadrang's main weapon is Luke the Warrior's sword, which he had taken from Martin. Badrang is a cunning strategist who is not above fighting dirty, such as using poisoned weapons or killing his own lackeys.\n\nBadrang's voice was provided in the animated series by Diego Matamoros and by Simon Smithies in the full-cast audiobook.\n\n\nBrome is a mouse who was Laterose's younger brother. He was later known as Brome the Healer. Brome wandered off from his home in Noonvale and got captured by Badrang. His sister, Laterose, (known to friends as Rose), and her trusty mole friend, Grumm Trencher, went in search of him. Grumm rescued Brome, Martin, and Felldoh from Badrang's prison pit by digging a tunnel.\n\nBrome did not like killing anybody, and he was shocked when Felldoh speared some of Badrang's horde. So Brome was mainly the one who helped the wounded, although he fought in the final battle.\n\nCelandine is a female squirrel and a member of the Rambling Rosehip Players. She's young and pretty, but vain and very flirtatious. In the book, she flirts with Felldoh a lot; the latter is highly embarrassed by her silly remarks.\n\nCap'n Tramun Clogg (or Tramun Josiah Cuttlefish Clogg as referred by the TV series) is an anthropomorphic, fat stoat pirate.\n\nA pirate captain and former associate of Badrang the Tyrant, Clogg commands the vessel \"Seascarab\". Clogg's trademark is a massive pair of wooden clogs, and every available bit of hair on his body is braided. He worked with Badrang for an unknown period of time before they became separated, with Badrang going on to build Marshank.\n\nClogg later shows up at Marshank seeking slaves to crew his ship and revenge on his former partner-in-crime, Badrang. The two play at an alliance for a while, but each is actually seeking to put an end to the other. Clogg suffers much humiliation from Badrang, having the \"Seascarab\" sunk and letting the Rambling Rosehip Players into Marshank, where they stole away the slaves. Clogg chases after them, but fails to catch them.\n\nLater, when conflict begins between Badrang's horde and the Fur and Freedom Fighters - a resistance formed of former slaves and the Players - Clogg manages to trick his way into control of Marshank while Badrang is away. However, it is only temporary, as Badrang sneaks back in, retakes control and puts Clogg to work as a slave. Clogg's crew is forced into joining Badrang's horde, and Clogg continues to be a nuisance, weakening the morale of the vermin by making seemingly insane prophecies and ghostly voices.\n\nAfter Badrang dies at the paws of Martin the Warrior, a mad Clogg emerges from under a wheelbarrow and talks to his, among other dead horde members' corpses after declaring himself as the new \"Master\" of Marshank. His current fate is unknown.\n\nHe was voiced by John Stocker on the animated TV series, and by Dave Foode in the full-cast audiobook.\n\n\nFelldoh is an anthropomorphic squirrel.\n\nFelldoh was imprisoned by Badrang the Tyrant as an infant, along with his father, Barkjon. He grew up witnessing violent acts by Badrang, such as cold-blooded killings and beatings. As a result, he lost sensitivity to watching or committing violence. He also expressed a hatred of Badrang and swore he would one day escape Badrang's fort, Marshank, and personally kill the evil corsair. Just before the battle at the end of the book, Felldoh attempts to kill Badrang by beating him with a javelin, and nearly succeeds. Badrang, however, has his soldiers kill Felldoh. Felldoh's friends, Keyla, Brome, and Tullgrew, who had decided to spy on him, rushed to his body and carried it away. Later, Barkjon (Felldoh's father) tearfully says, \"They can't hurt him now.\" Felldoh's death, along with the death of Laterose and others, was avenged when Martin the Warrior killed Badrang.\n\nHe was voiced by Ali Mukaddam in the animated series.\n\nLaterose (mainly known as Rose) is a female mouse and was Martin the Warrior's companion throughout the book Martin the Warrior. She was Martin's love interest and killed by Badrang the Tyrant around the end of the book.\n\nBlaggut is a rat who was originally boatswain of the ship \"Pearl Queen\". He and his captain, Slipp, are the only ones to survive their ship being taken. The two find their way to Mossflower, where they come across the mousebabe and Furrtil the molemaid. Blaggut takes a liking to the two Dibbuns and prevents Slipp from harming them. Oak Tom and Treerose, squirrels, find the two searats and the two toddlers. Slipp claims that he is a cook and Blaggut a carpenter and they are taken to Redwall Abbey.\n\nAt the Abbey, Slipp tries to find the treasure of Redwall, but he and Blaggut are scared off by Simeon, who they think is a black shadow. Blaggut discovers he does have carpentry skills when he makes two little boats out of an empty barrel for two toddlers. In return for making the boats, the two Dibbuns reveal where the secret treasure of Redwall is but it turns out to be just toys.\n\nIn anger, Slipp tries to attack the helpless babes, but stabs badger Mother Mellus in the heart in the process. Slipp then steals a valuable cup and the two searats run from the Abbey. Out in Mossflower, Blaggut is upset at the death of Mother Mellus, insisting that the Redwallers had never harmed anyone. When Slipp angrily rebukes Blaggut, Blaggut kills Slipp for the death of Mellus, coldly saying that 'You won't hurt anyone no more!' He then returns to Redwall with the chalice Slipp had stolen and to face the Redwallers' judgement. He explains what happened and shows remorse for what he has done. The Redwallers understand that Blaggut was more of a victim than a predator and accept his apology, even going as far as to offer him a home there in Redwall Abbey as he had become quite popular with the Dibbuns. He politely refuses and decides to move to a cove by the sea where he will spend his life building boats. Blaggut occasionally visits Redwall Abbey, such as the time when he reports that the group that had left Redwall have returned.\n\nJoseph the Bellmaker is an anthropomorphic mouse in Brian Jacques' Redwall novels \"Mariel of Redwall\" and \"The Bellmaker\". He was voiced by Gordon Hall in the full-cast audiobook of \"Mariel of Redwall\".\n\nA skilled bellmaker, Joseph is the father of Mariel. He was commissioned to create the then unnamed Joseph Bell for Badger Lord Rawnblade Widestripe of Salamandastron. However, in the journey to deliver the bell, Joseph's ship ran afoul of Gabool the Wild. The Searat King took Joseph hostage, and wanted him to construct a tower so he could use the bell himself. Joseph refused, and Gabool threw him out of a window on the island of Terramort.\n\nJoseph was then saved by a fellow enemy of Gabool, a vole named Tan Loc. The two hid, and formed a resistance force from freed slaves. By using secret tunnels under the island, they were able to steal needed supplies and weapons. Joseph's life in hiding came to an end when Mariel returned to Terramort in the company of Lord Rawnblade, Dandin the Sword Carrier, and various others. Banding together, they attacked Gabool's fortress, and killed the evil searat. Joseph then came to live at Redwall, and his bell was given to the Abbey.\n\nSome seasons later, Martin the Warrior gave Joseph a dream of Mariel, who had departed to the south with Dandin. Together with Rufe Brush, Durry Quill, and other Redwallers, Joseph set sail for the kingdom of Southsward aboard the vessel \"Pearl Queen\". Whilst journeying, Joseph became great friends with the captain, Finnbarr Galedeep. Eventually, the group arrived, and Joseph along with his companions form Redwall and Southsward battle and kill the evil Urgan Nagru. After the battle Finnbarr is badly wounded by a spear in his side. Joseph placed Finnbarr's swords in his hands and faced him towards the sea as the brave sea otter lay dying. Joseph stayed on at Southsward, though he would later visit his friends at the Abbey.\n\nJoseph was a gray-furred mouse of great age. Despite this, he was incredibly limber, and wielded an assortment of weapons, usually daggers or a stave.\n\nUrgan Nagru is an anthropomorphic fox.\n\nUrgan's real name is unknown, as he took his first name and reversed last name from a dead wolf named Urgan. Claiming to have killed the wolf, and wearing its skin and skull as trophies, Urgan also called himself Foxwolf. However, he had actually skinned the already dead wolf. Despite this, he was a fierce fighter, his chosen weapon being metal hooks replacing the claws of the slain wolf in the skin he wore. After conquering the northern lands, he sailed with his horde to the southern country of Southsward.\n\nTaking over the local monarch's palace, Urgan attempted to establish domination over the land. However, he found opposition in the form of Redwall warriors and their shrew allies from the north, as well as an army of local squirrels, moles, and hedgehogs. When his army was beaten, he tried to escape, but found himself forced into battle with the sea otter Finnbarr Galedeep. Despite the otter being mortally wounded by one of Urgan's horderats, he was able to overcome Foxwolf in combat, bashing the would-be dictator's head into a nearby tree and driving the fangs of the head-mounted wolf skull into the fox's brain.\n\nUrgan's only known family was his mate, Silvamord, who was killed before him in a battle to hold the castle they had conquered.\n\n\nBryony is an anthropomorphic mouse.\n\nWhen a Redwaller finds baby Veil in a ditch, Bryony feels it is her duty to take care of the young ferret. She believes there is good in Veil, and defends him even when he steals things, believing that he didn't do it.\n\nWhen Veil is banished from Redwall for attempting to poison someone, Bryony (who still thinks the ferret is good at the bottom) and her friend Togget follow him. In the final fight of the book, Veil saves Bryony's life at the cost of his own when he takes a javelin meant for her. Unsure if he truly meant to save her, she eventually accepts that the young ferret had always been evil.\n\nAt the end of the book, Bryony has become the Abbess of Redwall.\n\nShang Damsontongue is an anthropomorphic female fox.\n\nShang is the large, tough-looking leader of the foxes of the Gorge, wielding a bolas, a four-thonged weapon with rounded pebbles fastened to its ends. Her name originates from her tongue, which is bright purple.\n\nShang is poisoned by Swartt Sixclaw after he offers her joint leadership of his horde. Her foxes then join Swartt.\n\nSwartt Sixclaw is an anthropomorphic ferret warlord.\n\nThe sworn enemy of Sunflash the Mace, Swartt's trademark is his left paw, which has six claws. This paw is left dead after a battle with Sunflash, but Swartt covers it in mail to serve as a weapon in battle. Swartt pursues his foe over a great distance, but eventually decides that he needs help. Going to the camp of the Warlord Bowfleg, Swartt poisons him and seizes control of his horde. Swartt gets stuck with Bowfleg's daughter Bluefen as his bride, thanks to the tradition that the new Warlord has to marry the old Warlord's daughter.\n\nSwartt continues to chase Sunflash, adding a band of foxes originally led by Shang Damsontongue to his horde. His wife gives birth to a young ferret, and then dies. Paying no attention, Sixclaw gives the child to an old horde member to raise. Thus, he cares not when the old one dies and his infant son is abandoned; however, the baby ferret is found by a woodlander and taken to Redwall Abbey, where he is raised by a young mousemaid named Bryony.\n\nAfter many seasons, Swartt catches up with Sunflash at the mountain of Salamandastron. Challenging his foe's forces, Swartt loses most of his horde, and is forced to flee. Sunflash pursues, but is captured before he can slay Swartt. At the same time, Swartt's son, named Veil, joins up with him, both despising each other and planning to slay the other. Later on, Veil stops him from slaying Bryony, who has just freed the captured Sunflash, by sacrificing his own life to save her. The vengeful badger throws his foe off the mountain, and Swartt dies, putting an end to the name of Sixclaw.\n\n\nVeil Sixclaw is the ferret son of Swartt Sixclaw. In the book, Veil has to choose on whose side to fight - against the kind Redwallers who cared for him as a baby, or against his true father.\n\nVeil is born to Swartt Sixclaw, the evil warlord in the book, and Bluefen, Swartt's wife. Swartt cares very little for his wife (and Veil), since it is tradition for a new Warlord to receive the old Warlord's daughter as a wife. (Swartt had killed Bluefen's father, Bowfleg, to win the horde for himself.)\n\nVeil comes to Redwall due to a battle near the Abbey itself. Swartt, hunting down Sunflash the Mace, decides to go down the main path in Mossflower Woods. Skarlath, a kestrel and Sunflash's friend, sees Swartt and his horde going down the path, and flies ahead to warn the Redwallers. After meeting with them, a squirrel devises a plan to gather an army of squirrel archers and otter slingers - what he calls an \"invisible army\". The army engages in battle with Swartt's horde, and pushes them to the west side of the path. In the haste to get out of the line of fire, Veil's elderly caretaker drops him, and dies. Veil is then found by a squirrel after the battle, and is taken back to Redwall.\n\nAt Redwall, Veil is raised by a mousemaid named Bryony. He is mischievous, but as he grows older, he becomes more malicious, and is banished by the Badger Mother, Bella of Brockhall, after unsuccessfully attempting to poison Friar Bunfold. Bryony and Bella speculate, however, that the mistrust of the other Abbey inhabitants on account of Veil being a ferret contributed to his behavior, and Bryony, believing him to be good at the bottom, follows him. Later in the novel, Veil and Bryony encounter Swartt, who tries to kill her with a poisoned javelin. Veil leaps in front of her, taking the javelin and dying instead.\n\nCraklyn is a young squirrel in \"The Pearls of Lutra\". She and her friend Piknim help Tansy the hedgehog and Rollo Bankvole the old Recorder to solve the riddles telling where each of the Pearls of Lutra are. At the end of the book Craklyn becomes the new Recorder of Redwall.\n\nIn \"The Long Patrol\", Craklyn is still the Recorder, but is elderly, as is Tansy (who is still Abbess). Craklyn is one of the five Redwallers who venture into the sunken tower of the ancient fortress of Kotir, below the collapsed south wall. They discover the treasure of Verdauga Greeneyes.\n\nCleckstarr Lepus \"Clecky\" Montisle is an anthropomorphic hare from the Northlands who traveled the oceans and later met Martin II.\n\nGrath Longfletch is an anthropomorphic otter. She is the last of the Holt of Lutra. All the other otters of the holt were killed by corsairs trying to take Lutra's beautiful pearls for Ublaz Mad-Eyes. Grath is at death's door, but eventually recovers. She makes herself a bow and arrows and sets off to avenge her holt. Then she meets Martin II (who's on a quest with Clecky the hare to rescue Abbot Durral from corsairs) and they join forces.\n\nGrath falls in love with Inbar Trueflight and at the end of the book they go to live with the Holt Rudderwake.\n\nPiknim is an anthropomorphic mouse who is a close friend of Craklyn. She is good at solving riddles and helps recover the Pearls of Lutra from their hiding places. However, she is killed by jackdaws at St. Ninian's church. Her death would soon lead to the church's destruction, ordered by Redwall's recorder Rollo.\n\nRomsca is a female pirate ferret sent by Ublaz Mad-Eyes to fetch the \"Tears of All Oceans\" (six pink pearls), which are in Redwall Abbey. Romsca is forced to travel with a monitor lizard named Lask Frildur, whom she hates. In Mossflower country Lask Frildur's monitor lizards capture a mouse and a bankvole (Abbot Durral and Viola). Romsca befriends Durral and protects him. In the end she and Lask fight to the death. She kills the monitor lizard, but is left with back and spine injuries so severe that she dies soon after resulting in a mutual kill. Her dying words are her giving Durral directions to the isle of Sampetra because Durral cannot sail back to Mossflower alone. Durral claims to see Romsca in dreams when he sleeps.\n\nRomsca, despite her somewhat minor role, was unusually popular with readers. The Redwall series has been criticized for a pattern in which species is destiny; that is, all mice, moles, hares, otters, etc. are innately good, while rats, ferrets, weasels, etc. are always bad. Romsca is a rare exception to this rule, and remains one of the only \"bad\" characters to demonstrate true goodness and nobility of character.\n\nTansy is an anthropomorphic female hedgehog.\n\nIn \"Pearls of Lutra\", Tansy is young, but stated at the beginning of the book to have good sense. Therefore, she is one of the few permitted to go outside the Abbey's walls into the surrounding area. A friend of hers is the toddler squirrel Arven, who sometimes chants at her, \"Tansy pansy toogle doo!\"\n\nTansy, along with her friends Craklyn, Piknim, and the elderly Recorder Rollo Bankvole, begins solving the riddles telling where six rose-tinted pearls (the \"Tears of All Oceans\") are hidden. Then, when Abbot Durral and a young vole are kidnapped by corsairs, Tansy and friends have another motivation for finding the pearls - they can exchange them for the captives.\n\nAt the end of \"Pearls of Lutra\", Tansy becomes Abbess.\n\nIn \"The Long Patrol\", Tansy is elderly, but still the Abbess. She's one of the five Redwallers who venture into the sunken tower of the ancient fortress of Kotir below the collapsed south wall, and discover the treasure of Verdauga Greeneyes.\n\nAn anthropomorphic pine marten, Ublaz Mad-Eyes is the Emperor of Sempetra and the one who sent pirates to steal the Pearls, a.k.a. Tears of all Oceans, from Lutra the otter and his holt. Many call him \"Mad-Eyes\" because of his hypnotic eyes, yet never to his face. On more than one occasion he has wormed his way out of sticky situations with his hypnosis. He kills Conva the pirate by hypnotising him and telling him he can fly just because he gave him a bad report, then he throws Conva's corpse in front of Conva's brother, who retaliates with war. Corsair fights against corsair, and Ublaz makes an uneasy pact with one of the corsair captains for loot. Things go sour when his monitor lizards, whom he sent to Mossflower, abduct the Abbot and a bankvole maid from the Abbey and drag them off to the Isle of Sampetra, where Ublaz rules. Once the Abbeydwellers see the Abbot is gone, they set off to find him, with Martin II leading the assault on Sampetra, where they slay many monitors, and force the rats of the isle into submission. Martin enters the throne room and finds Ublaz who mockingly welcomes him in a faux gesture of chivalry, but Ublaz gets impatient and duels Martin viciously, almost winning. However, Martin shoves Ublaz back into his pet serpent, which bites his foot and Ublaz dies from the poison. Martin reminds him of the real reason he had come: to avenge Lutra's holt.\n\nGrall is a black seagull who served Ublaz Mad-Eyes. Along with three of his companions, Grall flew to Mossflower Woods with a drawing of the Tears of all Oceans made by Conva for Lask Frildur. While in Mossflower, he eventually did meet up with Lask and Romsca. One of his crew was killed at Redwall Abbey by Gerul after the four gulls attacked. Grall died from exhaustion traveling back to Mad Eyes.\n\nUblaz Mad-Eyes has many corsairs in his group:\n\nThe Monitor Lizards come from Sempetra and make up Ublaz Mad-Eyes' guards. Among its members are:\n\n\nThe Trident Rats are a group of pirate rats who wield tridents. Among its members are:\n\n\n\nLady Cregga Rose Eyes is an anthropomorphic female badger, appearing in the \"Redwall\" series by \"Brian Jacques\".\n\nIn \"The Long Patrol\" she is the ruler of the mountain Salamandastron. The name \"Rose Eyes\" is derived from her permanently pink eyes, which came about due to her overwhelming affliction of the Bloodwrath (a state of mind in which the eyes of the individual become infused with blood (thus turning red), and then the creature goes berserk, experiences an intense desire for battle, and is completely heedless of any injury or obstacle). Cregga has an intense hatred for Damug Warfang and his Rapscallion army, to the point that she abruptly takes fully half of the Long Patrol, 500 fighting hares, and relentlessly pursues Damug across many leagues. The climax occurs when Damug (who is attacking a small contingent of Redwallers) meets Cregga and her army in combat. While the battle rages around them, Cregga and Damug Warfang ignore the fighting and focus only on each other. Cregga almost instantly overpowers Damug, but not before he inflicts grievous wounds on her eyes, permanently blinding her. Once the battle is won, the Redwallers nurse her back to health, and Cregga decides to stay at Redwall as the Badgermum, saying that her blindness has \"cured\" her of the Bloodwrath.\n\nIt is mentioned that Cregga Rose-Eyes is one of the mightiest badger warriors in the history of Salamandastron, and that she had suffered the Bloodwrath the worst.\n\nIn \"Marlfox\" Cregga is living at Redwall Abbey. Many Redwallers want her to be their Abbess (they are without a leader at the time), but she refuses. She helps fight against the Marlfoxes, and with the assistance of Ellayo Swifteye, even uses a longbow to shoot the Marlfox Ascrod dead.\n\nIn \"Taggerung\" Cregga is very old; so old no one knows how many seasons she has lived. Without telling anyone else, Cregga has, since the days of Abbess Songbreeze, been looking out for a Redwaller who embodies all of the character traits Songbreeze wanted in an Abbey leader. (Redwall has once again been without an Abbot/Abbess for many seasons.) Meanwhile, several vermin show up outside Redwall, telling the Redwallers to bring out the Taggerung. Nobody has any clue what the vermin are talking about, but Cregga stands up on the wall and parleys with them. One of the vermin accidentally shoots an arrow at her, which buries itself in the old badger's chest. Cregga dies several days later, but before she passes on, she declares Mhera, a young otter, to be the new Abbess.\n\nDamug Warfang is an anthropomorphic rat, appearing in the \"Redwall\" series by \"Brian Jacques\".\n\nAfter the death of his father, Gormad Tunn, Damug cheats to win a contest against his brother Byral Fleetclaw for leadership of the Rapscallion army, once controlled by his father.\n\nDamug has the chance to conquer Redwall Abbey, as his scouts have seen that the south wall has collapsed, but a disguised hare named Midge Manycoats informs him of a \"better\" place to stage the battle. His Rapscallions greatly outnumber the Abbey residents and the hares of the Long Patrol fighting with them. He might have won had he not ordered his troops to stop fighting and imprison their opponents. But that momentary delay gives Cregga Rose Eyes enough time to sweep in with her hares. Struggling, Cregga and Damug fall off the ridgetop, killing the rat leader. But Damug slashed the Badger Lady's face so severely that she is permanently blinded.\n\nIn the Rapscallion Army, Rapscours are scouts and are higher-ranking than rank-and-file soldiers, and Rapmarks are captains which are higher-ranking than Rapscours.\n\n\nMidge Manycoats is an anthropomorphic hare, appearing in the \"Redwall\" series by \"Brian Jacques\".\n\nMidge is a male hare of the Long Patrol army under Cregga Rose Eyes. He is shorter than the average hare, and works as a master of disguise under Major Périgord Habile Sinistra. He infiltrates the enemy camp and poses as a seer, tricking the warchief, Damug Warfang, into battling elsewhere instead of at Redwall Abbey. Before leaving the camp, he assists with the rescue of Fourdun, a squirrel the Rapscallions had captured.\n\nPasque Valerian is an anthropomorphic hare, appearing in the \"Redwall\" series by \"Brian Jacques\".\n\nShe is quite pretty and a good fighter. She is also a healer. Pasque and Tammo fall in love and are married four seasons after the Rapscallions are defeated.\n\nRussa Nodrey is an anthropomorphic squirrel.\n\nRussa was given the surname \"Nodrey\" due to her lack of a drey, or home, because no one could agree on or knew where she was from. She was a wandering female squirrel warrior who carried a powerful hardwood stick as a weapon. It was later inherited by Russano the Wise, whom Russa saves from a party of vermin when he is a badger babe at the cost of her life. She and a young hare named Tammo De Fformello Tussock search for the Long Patrol, a group of hares who patrol areas around their mountain, Salamandastron. After Tammo and Russa locate and join up with the Long Patrol, they learn that an evil band of vermin, called Rapscallions, are parading right towards Redwall. They have to defend Redwall against attack. In the journey to Redwall, Russa's life ends by protecting the badger babe they named Russano. In the end, Tammo finds himself with the Long Patrol fighting for freedom against the Rapscallion army.\n\nTamello De Fformelo Tussock is an anthropomorphic hare. Due to his long title, he is usually referred to by his nickname, Tammo.\n\nHaving heard stories of the Long Patrol from his father, former Long Patroller Colonel Cornspurrey De Fformelo Tussock, Tammo wishes to join the Patrol despite Cornspurrey's belief that he is too young, and needs to grow up and learn some discipline before joining. Tammo's mother, Mem Divinia, secretly makes plans for Tammo to run away and join the Long Patrol, and asks her old friend Russa Nodrey to take him to Salamandastron or Redwall.\n\nRussa and Tammo eventually meet up with eleven members of the Long Patrol, who are out tracking down Damug Warfang's evil Rapscallion army. Tammo is smitten with the beautiful Pasque Valerian, the patrol's medic. With the Rapscallions heading for Redwall, Tammo, Russa and the Patrol head for Redwall to help defend it. During the journey, Tammo is briefly held hostage by the Painted Ones and rescued by Russa; later, Russa is slain protecting a baby badger from the Rapscallions, who had killed its nurse. In honour of Russa's sacrifice, the baby badger is named Russano.\n\nAt Redwall, Tammo receives a message in the form of a riddle from the spirit of Martin the Warrior regarding him and fellow Patrol member Midge Manycoats, telling them they have to go to Damug Warfang's camp. Midge disguises himself as a vermin seer, and Tammo as his mute companion. They get to the camp, where Midge convinces Damug Warfang to battle elsewhere than the Abbey itself.\n\nTammo participates in the final battle of the book. He takes a pike in his leg during the battle, which leaves him with a mild limp for the rest of his life.\n\nFour seasons afterward Tammo marries Pasque Valerian. He also becomes a captain of the Long Patrol, though it is not stated exactly when this takes place. The two returned to Salamandastron shortly after, accompanying Lord Russano the Wise.\n\nBurble is a water vole who comes into the book in part two. He has no last name but belongs to the Riverhead tribe. He gets Dann and Song out to the water after the Riverheads' self-proclaimed leader trades a leader boat for Song's Leafwood, her stick weapon. The \"leader\" would not have traded the boat to the friends anyway, so Burble stole the boat and the Leafwood.\n\nDannflower Reguba is an anthropomorphic squirrel. Dann, as his friends call him, lives with his dad only. His mum died before the book began. Rusvul Reguba, his dad, shortens Dann's name to Dannflor when his mom died, as Rusvul and his wife couldn't agree on his name. He is a squirrel who has warrior blood in his veins, but when he lets Redwall's great tapestry get stolen by two Marlfoxes his dad lashes out at him, telling him he is not worthy of the Reguba name. This statement causes Dann to become quite upset. Dann gets a message from Martin The Warrior telling him to get the tapestry back. During the adventure he wields Martin's sword; it was taken from the badger-mum Cregga's room. At the end of \"Marlfox\" Dann becomes Redwall's Warrior.\n\nDippler is a young Guosim shrew. He becomes friends with Dannflor and Songbreeze, and they go off together to recover the Abbey's tapestry from the Marlfoxes.\n\nAt the end of the book, Dippler becomes the Guosim's new Log-a-Log.\n\nDwopple is a small mouse infant. He and his auntie Deesum are part of The Sensational Wandering Noonvale Companions Troupe. He is tricked by Mokkan (a Marlfox) and is captured. He is used as bait for the Redwallers. Dwopple was often pesky, such as using a slingshot to fire pebbles at others.\n\nGrandma Ellayo is a squirrel. She is Song's grandma and Janglur's mother. Ellayo likes to doze off in the gatehouse with Nutwing the owl. She was nomadic with her son and his wife and daughter, but they eventually decide to live at Redwall. Ellayo's father once told her of the Marlfox Island, and Ellayo had heard more about it from a kingfisher she'd met when Janglur was just a youngster. Ellayo also assists Cregga the blind badger in killing Ascrod the Marlfox with a longbow. She tells Cregga exactly where to aim.\n\nFlorian Dugglewoof Wilffachop is a hare who is the leader of The Sensational Wandering Noonvale Companions Troupe. Descended from Ballaw de Quincewold from \"Martin the Warrior\", Florian is usually very friendly, but becomes very angry if someone calls him a 'rabbit'. (Most hares do, actually.) Helps push the cart of the Troupe.\n\nJanglur Swifteye is an anthropomorphic squirrel who is the husband of Rimrose. He has heavy eyelids that give him a sleepy appearance, but foes in war have to watch out. Janglur has a strong reputation in war as a fighter. He is good friends with Dannflor's dad. He is nomadic with his wife, daughter, and mother. Ellayo Swifteye is his mom and Songbreeze's grandma.\n\nNutwing is an anthropomorphic owl, one of the three children of Taunoc and Orocca and who hatched during \"The Long Patrol\". Following the departure of his siblings, Nutbeak and Nutclaw, Nutwing remained at the Abbey, although becoming increasingly senile due to his old age.\n\nDuring the events of \"Marlfox\", Nutwing became friends with Ellayo Swifteye, occasionally dozing off in the gatehouse with her. On one such occasion, Nutwing remained in the gatehouse while the Redwallers, aided by Cregga, sought to rescue Dwopple from the Marlfoxes. On her return, Cregga was found to have been heavily wounded; Nutwing volunteered to get Sister Sloey's medical herbs and bandages, only to walk into the Marlfoxes Ascrod and Vannan, who had managed to enter the Abbey undetected along with two water rats during the fighting. Ascrod slew Nutwing, and used his body to prevent Songbreeze Swifteye from attacking him.\n\nSongbreeze \"Song\" Swifteye is an anthropomorphic squirrel who is the daughter of Janglur Swifteye and Rimrose and the granddaughter of Ellayo Swifteye. Song is a squirrel whose family is partially nomadic and travels to Redwall along with her family after encountering the two Marlfoxes Vannan and Ascrod. Song is a good singer and very pretty. She befriends Dannflor Reguba and Dippler, and they together rescue Redwall's tapestry from the Marlfoxes. Though young, Song becomes the Abbess at the end of \"Marlfox\".\n\nThe Marlfoxes were a mysterious brood of foxes with pale eyes and mottled silver-white fur, rumored to possess magical powers of invisibility. These rumors were apparently perpetuated by their very real stealth capabilities. Only one family of Marlfoxes appears in the series, though presumably more have existed in the past.\n\nSilth is the High Queen of Castle Marl. Silth was the mother of the Marlfox brood. Once a mighty warrior, she became senile in old age, having killed her mate and taking over the throne. In her delusions, Silth commanded her brood to search out beautiful things to surround herself with. Her insanity was further fueled by her daughter Lantur, who tormented her with the image of the White Ghost, a legendary figure based on the albino badger Urthwyte (from \"Salamandastron\"). Lantur later poisoned her mother, and Silth was lowered into the lake after her demise.\n\nThe King is the unnamed father of Ascrod, Vannan, Gelltor, Predak, Lantur, Mokkan, and Ziral who was murdered by Silth, his mate, because he wanted to call himself king. Lantur was his favorite daughter. While Lantur was terrifying Silth with the White Ghost, the rats said that the White Ghost was him, returned to avenge his murder.\n\nAscrod and Vannan were the two Marlfoxes who infiltrated Redwall to steal the tapestry of Martin the Warrior. His demise was made swift by Cregga, who shot a longbow arrow through an upper window straight through his head.\n\nGelltor is the rashest of the Marlfoxes. He originally wanted to go to war against Redwall for particularly no good reason (for taking an injury to the shoulder and the death of a water rat). He became the leader of the Marlfoxes after Mokkan abandoned them. He worked with Predak often before he was slain by Song's father Janglur, with a loaded sling blow to the skull. His axe was turned into a woodcutting axe.\n\nLantur as Marlfoxes go, was very sly. She spent her days frightening her mother, with the aim of scaring her to death. She was helped by her personal advisor, Wilce, who was, along with Ullig the Slave Captain, head of all the water rats on Queen Silth's island. Lantur eventually succeeded in poisoning her mother, but got a nasty surprise when Mokkan showed up at the island, being pushed to her death in the lake where she was killed by the Teeth of the Deeps. She was the smallest and youngest of the Marlfoxes, but the favorite of Silth's mate, her father.\n\nMokkan was the undisputed leader of the Marlfox brood, and was the fastest and strongest; perhaps the only equal to Mokkan among his six siblings, was Lantur, at home with their mother, the High Queen Silth. After the death of his mother, and slyly pushing Lantur into the lake, Mokkan became the High King of the Marlfoxes. However, his reign was short lived, when trying to escape from Redwallers and freed slaves, a freed hedgehog (Nettlebud, the long-lost daughter of Sollertree) used her shackles like a sling and knocked him from his boat and into the lake where he was eaten by the Teeth of the Deeps.\n\nWith the exception of Lantur & Mokkan, Predak was the last Marlfox to be slain. She perished at the final battle against Redwall, when the otter twin Borrakul strangled her and threw her off the battlements for killing his brother, Elachim.\n\nVannan along with Ascrod was one of the Marlfoxes that harassed the Swifteyes at the beginning of the story. She was killed by an otter javelin when Skipper of Otters returned to Redwall with many mighty otter crews.\n\nZiral is the first Marlfox slain. Her death started the war between the Redwallers and Marlfoxes. She was beheaded by Janglur Swifteye with her own axe.\n\nThis group serves the Marlfoxes as their army:\n\n\nRaventail is a barbarian ferret who led a group of twenty other ferrets. He and his group sided with the Marlfoxes when they heard that they had magic abilities. In the final battle, Raventail was fighting with Florian near the Abbey door when the hare knocked on the gate and alerted Lady Cregga Rose Eyes of the ferret's presence. The badger's paws shot out, grabbed the terrified Raventail and pulled him into the Abbey where she presumably killed him.\n\nLuke the Warrior is an anthropomorphic mouse, the father of Martin the Warrior. During Martin's flashback scenes in \"Martin the Warrior\", Luke's voice is provided by Colin Bean.\n\nLuke is born in Saint Ninian's Church, in Mossflower Woods south of what is later Redwall Abbey. However, with the arrival of the wildcat Verdauga Greeneyes, as a child he is forced away from his home. He becomes the chief of a tribe of nomadic mice, who soon settle in caves on the frigid northland shore. Soon after settling, his wife, Sayna, gives birth to Martin, who is always groping for his father's sword. While lighting a bonfire to celebrate their leader's son's birth, Luke's tribe is attacked by Vilu Daskar's \"Goreleech\" corsair crew, who kill Sayna and other members of the tribe.\n\nLuke, furious at the loss, begins making plans for his revenge. He crafts weapons for fighting the pirates, and keeps observations of their activities. His closest confidant is his little son Martin, who grows up learning his father's love of battle and knowledge of fighting. Eventually, Luke and his allies ambush a landing pirate ship, taking it over and repairing it in preparation to go after Vilu Daskar. During this time, his son Martin attempts to adopt a pirate sword for himself, but Luke has him throw it away, since Luke's own sword is Martin's inheritance. Luke also tells his son, to Martin's displeasure, that he is not coming on the journey. In a fit of tears, Martin tells Luke to name the ship \"Sayna\" after his mother.\n\nUpon setting off after Daskar, Luke leaves Martin his sword, and also sets a young mouse named Timballisto in charge of the tribe. Luke tells Martin to keep his sword safe, to use it in the defense of others, and to never let any creature take it from him. Once this is done, he sails off, vowing to return one day.\n\nLuke and his companions journey for many weeks, trailing Vilu Daskar. They face several obstacles, including storms and an island wherein dwells a tribe of murderous vermin and a giant snake. Unfortunately, Luke's ship is spotted by Daskar, and he lies in wait for the \"Sayna\", destroying her and killing most of the crew. Luke and a handful of others survive, Luke climbing aboard and attempting to throttle Daskar. He is pried off, and placed below to be a galley slave.\n\nLuke vows to slay Daskar, and meets a fellow warrior named Ranguvar Foeseeker. The two, along with the other slaves and a couple of Luke's comrades who had survived, plan to escape. Luke tricks Daskar into thinking he knows the location of a hidden treasure, buried by his tribe, and convinces the pirate to let him steer the \"Goreleech\" that way. He heads for the shoreline where his tribe dwells, hoping that his by now grown son Martin will be able to aid him.\n\nTo Luke's shock, the shore is deserted. Taking a new course of action, he turns the ship towards some nearby tall rock columns off the coast. Giving the signal to attack, he grabs Daskar and begins strangling him as the ship heads for the rocks. Ranguvar, free from her chains, helps fight off the pirates as the ship smashes into the rocks, breaking in half. One half, carrying Luke's surviving companions, becomes wedged in the rocks. The other, upon which Luke and Ranguvar fought, sinks to the bottom of the sea.\n\nYoung Martin does not learn of his father's fate until years later, when he sets out on a journey to find out what had become of his father. He finds Luke's comrades aboard the wedged half of the vessel, named \"Arfship\" because of being broken in half. After hearing the account, Martin looks at a bag of things that had belonged to his mother, and takes out a small colored stone. He drops it into the sea, as a farewell gift to his father and Ranguvar.\n\nLuke's sword is passed down among the warriors of Redwall. His grandfather was also named Martin, and Luke is the third of his family to carry the sword. A tapestry of this Martin, the image of his great-grandson, becomes the centerpiece for the great Redwall tapestry.\n\nThe following make up Luke the Warrior's crew on the Sayna:\n\n\nRanguvar Foeseeker is an anthropomorphic female black squirrel.\n\nShe was a powerful beast, a berserker who killed four of Vilu Daskar's \"Goreleech\" crew members before they overwhelmed and captured her. She was forced to help row the \"Goreleech\", where she met Luke the Warrior, who'd also been captured. Luke fooled Vilu Daskar into believing that he had buried his tribe's treasure among some huge columns of rock off the coast. Daskar permitted the Warrior to steer the ship to the \"treasure\". The oarslaves were freed, and in a last-ditch effort Luke steered the \"Goreleech\" towards the huge rocks, planning to crash the ship. Ranguvar went down fighting with Luke when the ship broke in two, their half of the ship sinking into the depths of the North Sea.\n\nReynard Chopsnout was a fox pirate and the captain of the Greenhawk. Reynard Chopsnout used a cutlass, mainly, but he was said to have used a scimitar in the fight against Luke the Warrior's tribe. He got his name when he lost his nose to a sword fight against a ferret and replaced it with a wad of pitch. Reynard Chopsnout and his crew launched an attack against Luke the Warrior and his tribe, but Reynard's forces were quickly routed and the fight ended when Luke killed Reynard Chopsnout on the ground with his soon-to-be famous battlesword.\n\nThe following make up Reynard Chopsnout's crew on the Greenhawk:\n\n\nVilu Daskar is an anthropomorphic stoat in \"The Legend of Luke\".\n\nDaskar is the captain of the largest corsair vessel ever to sail the seas, the red ship \"Goreleech\". Despite being a corsair, he is quite refined, and his wardrobe of royal finery is quite the opposite of ragged pirate garb. He spent years traveling the seas, plundering and capturing slaves to work his ship's oars. Because of his thorough eradication and intimidation of those who stood against him, he never had any enemies.\n\nNone, that is, until he made the mistake of attacking the tribe of Luke the Warrior. Vilu's horde sailed in while Luke and his warrior comrades were away, killing many of the tribe, including Luke's wife Sayna. Upon his return, Luke swore vengeance on the stoat. Capturing a pirate vessel, the Warrior and his allies sailed after Daskar. Captain Daskar learned of their pursuit, and laid an ambush for them. The trap worked, and their ship was destroyed and most of the crew killed. Luke, Dulam and Denno were taken captive. Vurg and Beau survived and tried to rescue them.\n\nDaskar believed a ruse engineered by Luke about the location of a non-existent treasure. The \"Goreleech\" sailed towards the tall rocks near the shore where Luke's tribe had lived, the supposed location of the treasure. Upon arriving at the destination, Luke steered the ship towards the rocks, and grabbed Daskar, throttling him. Daskar's crew, trying to rescue their captain, were set upon by Luke's remaining comrades and the freed slaves, led by the berserker Ranguvar Foeseeker, while Luke ignored Daskar's desperate pleading for his life, stating that Daskar would at long last face justice for his crimes. The ship crashed against the rocks, one half becoming wedged between them, the other-with Daskar, Luke, and Ranguvar aboard-sinking to the bottom of the sea.\n\nDaskar's weapon of choice was a bone-handled scimitar, with a matching knife.\n\nThe following make up Vilu Daskar's crew on the Goreleech.\n\n\nBrocktree was known as the Badger Lord who initiated the modern traditions of Salamandastron and is the main character of \"Lord Brocktree\". He was the son of Stonepaw, descendant of Lady Sable Brock, the father of Boar the Fighter, the grandfather of Bella of Brockhall, the great-grandfather of Sunflash, and distant ancestor of Rawnblade Widestripe. He founded the Long Patrol by organizing the mountain's hares into a military-like regimental structure. Brocktree was also responsible for organizing the leveret school, the mountain's general laws, and for creating the outer gardens, terraces, orchards and crop-growing areas. It is for these reasons (but primarily for organizing the Long Patrol) that Brocktree is often cited as the first true Badger Lord of Salamandastron.\n\nBefore questing to Salamandastron, Lord Brocktree ruled Mossflower Woods. When he left, Boar succeeded him.\n\nBrocktree's primary weapon was an enormous double-pawed broadsword, and physically he was a large, powerful male badger. Throughout the events of the book in which he made his debut (aptly named Lord Brocktree), the badger traveled to Salamandastron with the help and company of Dotti, a young hare from the mideastern hills (who, much to the badger's annoyance, called him by the nickname \"Brockers\"), to defeat the pestilence of the wildcat Ungatt Trunn and his Blue Hordes. Along the way they collected an army of woodlanders from the court of the hare king Bucko Bigbones, many of which were strong, young fighting hares, to help against the wildcat's horde. Brocktree eventually killed Ungatt Trunn and rid Salamandastron of his menace; he then took up residence as Lord of the mountain.\n\nAt the end of his long lifespan, Brocktree shared the leadership of Salamandastron with his son Boar. When he died, he was entombed in a secret upper chamber in the mountain in full armor. There he rested among mysterious prescient carvings to one day be discovered by his descendants. Brocktree later appears in a vision to Sunflash telling him to live on and become the ruler of Salamandastron.\n\nKing Bucko Bigbones was a mountain hare and self-appointed King. He ruled over a court in the North-East part of Mossflower. Bucko was very bigheaded as he boasted a lot and he was taller than most hares and strongly built. He issued a challenge to any passing creature, to challenge him for his crown in three events: Bragging, Feasting, and Fighting. Towards the end of his reign as \"King,\" Bucko had been growing lazy, developing a noticeable paunch that was repeatedly abused by Dotti in the Fighting Challenge.\n\nThe one to beat him was Dorothea Duckfontein Dillworthy, future General for the Long Patrol. Bucko then joined Dorothea and Lord Brocktree on the quest to liberate Salamandastron from Ungatt Trunn. As it turned out, Bucko had a score to settle with Trunn's Captain-in-Chief Karangool who reportedly beat him with the flat of his sword when he lived in the mountains and left numerous scars, not to mention driving the March Hares out of their homes. During the fight to win back Salamandastron, he swam towards a fleeing vermin ship and apparently slew Karangool (who was pushed off the ship by Ripfang). After the mountain was retaken, Bucko returned to his home along with his mountain hares even though he promised Dotti he would serve as leader of the northern part of the Long Patrol with the title \"General Bucko.\"\n\nFleetscut was a Salamandastron hare, famous for his fast speed. In his old age, Fleetscut could not run as swiftly, and when he was asked to recruit hares to assist the mountain against assault from Ungatt Trunn's Blue Hordes, Fleetscut was forced to enlist the help of Jukka the Sling and her squirrels with the journey. The two did not get on well as they argued frequently and referred to each other as \"bushtail\" and \"longears.\"\n\nEventually, and with the help of Lord Brocktree, Dorothea Duckfontein Dillworthy, and many others, he succeeded at his task. Fleetscut died with Jukka in the cellars of Salamandastron, attempting to repel an assault from a squad of Ungatt Trunn's vermin. They died as friends.\n\nJukka the Sling was the leader of a tribe of squirrels native to a pine grove near Salamandastron. She and her tribe, notably the healer Ruro, assisted Fleetscut on his quest to recruit hares to help Salamandastron, despite the fact that many members of the tribe (with the exception of Ruro) greatly disliked him.\n\nThough Jukka and her tribe saved Fleetscut from pursuing vermin, she refused his pleas for help, insisting that there was no way her tribe could dislodge the Blue Hordes. Her position was that there was no benefit to her and her tribe, which—plus the fact that her tribe found war as a business and only fought if they could scavenge weapons and equipment from the slain vermin afterwards—provoked hostility in Fleetscut, who accused Jukka and her squirrels of cowardice. Jukka took strong exception and for the sake of her pride decided to help Fleetscut find King Bucko Bigbones, who was rumored to have a large army of hares. However, she disliked the hare's righteousness and insulting manner and continually argued with Fleetscut for the duration of the journey, even after she and her squirrels had joined the army of Lord Brocktree.\n\nWhen the army reached Salamandastron, Jukka disguised herself as a Blue Hordebeast by shaving her tail and dyeing her fur, and conducted spy work inside the mountain. She received quite a bit of valuable information, but her disguise failed when she literally ran into Ungatt Trunn and inadvertently slipped back into her typical, archaic mode of speech. With no alternative, she fled, and encountered Fleetscut in the cellars and they were soon hemmed in by vermin. Though their only weapon was a javelin, the pair held the vermin in the tunnel until the rest of Brocktree's army could arrive. Both of them died in the attempt.\n\nJukka and Fleetscut died as comrades-in-arms, despite their former enmity.\n\nLord Stonepaw was the earliest Badger Lord who appeared as an actual character (and not just a mention) in the Redwall canon. He was the father of Lord Brocktree, grandfather of Lord Boar the Fighter, great-grandfather of Bella of Brockhall, and the great-great-grandfather of Lord Sunflash the Mace. He was also a descendent of Lady Sable Brock, great-grandfather-in-law to Barkstripe, and the distant ancestor of Rawnblade Widestripe.\n\nStonepaw ruled Salamandastron during a time of extensive peace, when the youngest hares of his command left the mountain to seek adventure elsewhere. Towards the end of his reign, the unprotected mountain was besieged by the hordes of the wildcat Ungatt Trunn. Stonepaw and his remaining hares, all rather elderly, hid in the underground passages and catacombs beneath Salamandastron. However, Trunn's Horde, led by Groddil, managed to track them down. Stonepaw immediately helped his hares into a secret passage, but stood behind to hold the vermin off while the hares got a head start.\n\nStonepaw slew many vermin in his rage, but it soon became evident that he could never escape with the rest, for within a short time the vermin wounded him badly and trapped him in a net. To their surprise, Stonepaw managed to gather his strength and stand, dragging the net and several entangled vermin with him. He grabbed up as many vermin he could in his paws, and with a final effort leapt into the bottomless pool in the middle of the catacombs, drowning himself and the vermin he dragged with him. Lord Brocktree and his band later dropped a flagon of red wine in the pool, to symbolize and honor Stonepaw's death.\n\nRuro is an anthropomorphic female squirrel in the book \"Lord Brocktree\".\n\nRuro is part of Jukka the Sling's squirrel tribe. When Fleetscut the hare asks for aid in th badger Lord Stonepaw's battle against the usurping wildcat, Ungatt Trunn, Ruro is the most receptive of his plea.\n\nRuro journeys with Jukka, Fleetscut, and the squirrel tribe to the court of the hare King Bucko, where the group meet up with Stonepaw's son, Lord Brocktree and his companions. Together, they raise an army and launch an assault upon the mountain of Salamandastron which is occupied by Ungatt Trunn, Lord Stonepaw having died some time earlier.\n\nRuro later succeeds Jukka as the new leader of the tribe.\n\nRuffgar Brookback is an anthropomorphic otter native to Mossflower Woods who is often called \"Ruff\" by his friends. He said he was \"Ruff by name, rough by nature\". He encountered Lord Brocktree and Dotti on their way to Salamandastron, and was attacked by Brocktree when mistaken for an enemy. After the encounter, Ruff joined their quest to liberate (or at the time simply journey to) Salamandastron. He gave good advice to Dotti in her competition against Bucko Bigbones and was one of the party who helped Dotti enforce her diet, weathering her tirades against him. He was also a good cook and learned one of his recipes from his grandmother. Ruff fought loyally at Brocktree's side, and when the battle was over joined Skipper of Otters Brogalaw on his journey back to his home.\n\nStiffener Medick was a boxing hare at Salamandastron during the rule of Lord Stonepaw. He was also the grandfather of Southpaw and Bobweave, who were boxing hares like him and who he was immensely proud of. He kept himself very fit, even in his old age, and committed himself to rigorous exercise each morning. He was an extremely talented boxer. When Salamandastron was under attack by Ungatt Trunn, Stiffener was one of the few to escape via a hidden tunnel. He played a major role in the rest of the attacks against Trunn, as he was one of the key figures in the Bark Crew.\n\nDuring the time in the caves Stiffener pulled stunts by boxing vermin to get supplies. The order was given by Stonepaw that Stiffner should lead the remaining hares out of Salamandastron.\n\nOnce out of Salamandastron, Stiffener took control and immediately started to plan a way to help his fellow companions, held hostage, escape. He teamed up with Brogalaw, the Skipper of otters to fight back Ungatt Trunn. His attempts helped out and the Bark Crew was formed to stop Ungatt's foraging crews from getting supplies to the mountain. His attempts paid off in that Ungatt's horde became weaker, allowing them to be easily overwhelmed. At the finishing battle Stiffner was reunited with his aforementioned grandsons.\n\nUngatt Trunn is an anthropomorphic wildcat.\n\nHis army is mostly the \"Blue Hordes\", which consists of various blue painted vermin - mainly rats.\n\nTrunn is from an unnamed land far across the sea. His father is Mortspear and his brother is Lord Verdauga Greeneyes. Assembling a massive army dubbed the Blue Hordes for their blue-dyed fur, Trunn sets sail across the ocean planning to conquer the mountain Salamandastron, the fortress of the Badger Lords. Trunn's force has thousands of soldiers, far more than any army ever seen in the Redwall world. The hordes also have a very large number of ships.\n\nWhen his armada is just off the shore of Salamandastron, Trunn's second in command lands first and demands the surrender of the mountain fortress. Lord Stonepaw refuses and the wildcat's army come ashore.\n\nAfter a long battle, Ungatt Trunn captures the mountain, killing many of the hares that guard it. Stonepaw hides with a small group of hares in the caves beneath Salamandastron. Despite a succession of defeats during a short guerrilla war in which Stonepaw dies, the wildcat's forces remain strong, but almost all of Ungatt Trunn's army desert him when Stonepaw's son Lord Brocktree arrives with an army. After being challenged by Brocktree to single combat, Trunn's spine is snapped by the powerful badger. He is cast in the sea, still alive, but just barely. Later that night, he washes up on shore, but he is thrown out in the sea again by his own seer. Trunn apparently dies.\n\nUngatt Trunn is portrayed as a good fighter and a brilliant general. His weapons of choice are the net and trident and he enjoys dark, cobwebbed rooms with the presence of spiders.\n\nWhenever Trunn is spoken to or questioned by another creature, either he or one of his soldiers claims that creatures \"of the lower orders\" are not worthy to speak to him. He is apparently used to scaring opponents into submission, as he attempts to have Salamandastron surrendered to him by making the stars \"fall\" from the sky, and making the earth shake. This is done through trickery and illusions, though it is apparently still impressive. Trunn is capable of expressing a grudging respect for the courage of the opponents facing him, such as the fighting hares of Salamandastron, and has a higher opinion of a courageous opponent than of the subservient vermin in his service - which in no way prevents Trunn from cruel and ruthless acts against his foes, if he deems this expedient.\n\nUngatt Trunn is one of the few invaders in the Redwall series to enter Salamandastron, and the only one to actually conquer it.\n\nThe Blue Hordes are the armies of Ungatt Trunn who sport blue-dyed fur. Among its members are:\n\nRipfang later resurfaces in Mossflower as captain of a large pirate ship called the \"Bloodwake\". He has been repeatedly raiding the coasts near Salamandastron and enslaving captured GUOSIM shrews, as well as Martin's friend Timbalisto. Ripfang's huge crew of searats attacks Salamandastron, but they are defeated by Martin and his comrades; Ripfang himself is seized and crushed to death by his mortally wounded nemesis, Boar the Fighter (the son of Lord Brocktree).\n\n\nBroggle, the young assistant Abbeycook, is an anthropomorphic squirrel. Being an aspiring cook to succeed Friar Bobb, he has a not surprisingly plump frame, and is a sedentary character.\n\nAt first, Broggle has no ability to speak confidently. Whenever someone asks him a direct question, he tries his best to answer, but stammers often and is difficult to understand. When Boorab the Fool shows up, however, he teaches Broggle to sing, which he finds a natural talent in. Before too long, Broggle has no trouble at all talking, and in fact enjoys it.\n\nBroggle's good friend and love interest is Fwirl. He eventually marries Fwirl, and the couple have a daughter, Rosabel.\n\nDeyna is the main character of the story, an impressively built anthropomorphic otter. Although he is trained by a vermin horde for most of his youth, he is not violence-oriented, and seems incapable of lying. He is an upright young otter with the impulse to do what is right.\n\nDeyna is the son of the otter Rillflag, who is murdered in an ambush while completing a birth ritual with him. Deyna is captured by Vallug Bowbeast, Rillflag's murderer, when Sawney Rath is told by Grissoul the seer that he is the next \"Taggerung,\" a deadly warrior not seen for many seasons. Tagg, as Deyna is renamed, realizes, however, that he is unwilling to kill for sport, or at all. He eventually runs away and leaves behind the group of vermin that had captured him when Sawney commands him to skin Felch the fox. When he reaches Redwall Abbey, however, he is captured and locked up, having been mistaken for a Juska vermin because of his intricate tattoos. He is then released impulsively by the assistant cook, Broggle, and he goes off to confront Eefera and Vallug Bowbeast, slaying both, but not before being struck by an arrow by Vallug. After the conflict settles, though, he is taken to see the local \"otterfixer,\" who removes his tattoos and the arrow he still bears. He eventually returns to Redwall to become the Abbey's Warrior.\n\nMhera is an anthropomorphic otter and Deyna's sister. When her father sets off to complete an otter birth ritual at the river with newborn Deyna and neither come back, Mhera and her mother are heartbroken.\n\nFifteen seasons later, a strange tattooed otter shows up and fights five vermin attacking Redwall. When he's brought back wounded and unconscious, Mhera discovers that the otter is her long-lost brother Deyna when she and her mother see the unusual birthmark on his paw.\n\nCregga the blind badger gets shot with an arrow in the chest by the vermin, and before she dies she declares Mhera to be Redwall's new Abbess, since Mhera embodied all the traits that Abbess Songbreeze had told Cregga seasons before to look for in a Redwall leader. Mhera is Redwall's first otter Abbot/Abbess.\n\nNimbalo the Slayer is an anthropomorphic mouse. He was voiced by Sam Donovan in the full-cast audiobook.\n\nNimbalo was born into a farming family. However, his mother left when he was very young, and his father was cruel and abusive. After enduring seasons of this, Nimbalo had enough, fighting back and running off on his own. Seeking to prove that he could no longer be beaten or pushed around, he adopted a tough guy attitude. Taking the nickname Slayer, he told many tales of his exploits, most of which were completely false.\n\nNimbalo eventually met up with Deyna the otter, and the two became fast friends and traveling companions. Opposing the forces of Deyna's former captors, the Juska clan, the two made their way through Mossflower Wood. Along the way, the two came across Nimbalo's old home, and Deyna accompanied his friend to see his father. Unfortunately, the Juska squad they had been tracking had been through, and had killed Nimbalo's father. Nimbalo grieved, cleaned up and locked the house, swearing vengeance.\n\nThe two made their way to Redwall Abbey, where Nimbalo was captured by the Juska. Breaking free, he slew the rat who killed his father and took back his father's axe. During the battle, Deyna was wounded, and it was from Deyna's mother that Nimbalo learned his friend's true identity: not the Taggerung, or Tagg as he had been called, but Deyna. Nimbalo was rather disappointed by the name, and wanted to start calling him Deyna the Dangerous. However, Deyna's mother threatened to tell everyone that his own name was Nimbalo the Nuisance. Nimbalo joined Deyna living at Redwall, eventually becoming the director of music. He took up the position from a hare, and learned to play the haredee gurdee, a complex instrument.\n\nNimbalo's weapon of choice was his father's battleaxe, which he liberated from his father's killer.\n\nRuggan Bor was a fearsome fox warlord and chieftain of the Juskabor. His fur was an unusual golden color, and he had green wavy lines tattooed on his forehead, along with yellow circles on the cheeks (this was his clan symbol).\n\nRuggan was an imperturbable and persistent beast. He also displayed the strange ability to get a beast's attention by simply staring at the back of its head, demonstrated when he needed to contact guards outside his tent. He was also described as very skilled in swordplay, although the book never actually portrayed him fighting anyone.\n\nRuggan took over the Juskazann tribe while its current leader Gruven Zann was off hunting Deyna the Taggerung. Gruven's mother Antigra plotted to remove Ruggan from power, but was discovered and executed by the fox. When Gruven returned and found he had been deposed, he lied to Ruggan, claiming that he had killed the otter, which would make him the new Taggerung. As a visibly unnerved Gruven kept changing his story, Ruggan patiently continued to question him on the subject, also consulting his seers Grissoul and Ermath to see if they could tell him the truth.\n\nUpon arriving at Redwall Abbey with Gruven to test the stoat's latest lie (he claimed to have killed Deyna in the ditch outside Redwall Abbey), Ruggan demanded the Abbeybeasts tell him the truth. Deyna, who had had his Juska tattoos removed and was unrecognizable, decided to confirm Gruven's story that the Taggerung was dead. Since this made Gruven the new Taggerung, Ruggan slew the stoat and proceeded to proclaim himself to be Taggerung. Elated by his newfound power, Ruggan laughed for what may have been the first time in his life, and prepared his troops to attack the Abbey. Lucky for the Abbeybeasts, Russano the Wise arrived with Long Patrol hares at that very instant. Ruggan, having heard of the Badger Lord's might, wisely refused to fight him. After his surrender, he was forcibly escorted back to the south coasts with his clan by the hares.\n\nThe Juskabor is a Juska tribe that was ruled by Ruggan Bor. Settled on the southern part of the western coast, they numbered roughly 300 and soon conquered their northern neighbors the Juskazann. However, they were outnumbered and humiliated in an attack on Redwall Abbey. Their clan symbol was green wavy lines on the forehead and yellow circles on the cheeks. Some members also had a black line flanked by red dots running down their muzzle (this tattoo showed that they had once been a Juskazann, before the takeover). Among its members are:\n\n\nSawney Rath was the ferret chieftain of the Juskarath tribe. He was old, and suffered from stomach pains, but threw knives quickly and accurately. Sawney was also very superstitious, as most Juska are, and relied on the clan's seer Grissoul. He also feared Redwall Abbey for all the stories he had heard about the vermin who tried to mess with it and the sound of Redwall's bells. Previously, his father was a Taggerung. He made a mortal enemy after slaying Antigra's mate Gruven. Rath was on the search for the new Taggerung, when Sawney's seer Grissoul predicted where he could find him. Sawney set off to find the Taggerung, and discovered him at a ford where an otter father was taking his Dibbun son Deyna for a swim.\n\nSawney had Deyna's father killed by Vallug Bowbeast. He adopted Deyna and renamed him Tagg. Rath then treated him as a son, caring for and nurturing him until the day Tagg refused to obey him any further. He began to hunt down the wayward Tagg, but as he entered the trees he was slain by Antigra who slung a rock at him from where she was gathering food. Gruven, who was Antigra's son originally named Zann, succeeded Rath as clan leader.\n\nThe Juskarath was one of the Juska clans of northwest Mossflower. The Juskarath were led by Sawney Rath and numbered roughly 60. After Gruven Zann was named chieftain of the tribe, it was renamed Juskazann. Their clan symbol was a black stripe down the muzzle, flanked by crimson dots. Among its members are:\n\n\nSagax (full name Sagaxus) is an anthropomorphic badger.\n\nHe is the son of the Badger Lord Hightor, ruler of the mountain Salamandastron. Sagax runs off with his friend Scarum (a hare), and the duo sail away with a pal of theirs, a young sea otter named Kroova Wavedog.\n\nAfter many escapades, Sagax and friends meet Triss and Shogg, and get to Redwall. But Princess Kurda, along with her immature brother Bladd and a horde of freebooters, are attacking the Abbey.\n\nMeanwhile, the Redwallers solve a riddle which leads them to Brockhall (a habitation under an ancient, enormous tree), forgotten for many seasons. There, along with Sagax, Triss and Shogg, they encounter Kurda and company, and three adder siblings that inhabit the place. Sagax, Shogg and Triss kill the snakes.\n\nSagax is one of the characters who afterward goes to the isle of Riftgard to help free the rest of the slaves.\n\nShogg is an anthropomorphic otter. Along with Triss and Welfo, he escapes slavery and sticks with Triss through thick and thin. Unfortunately, he is killed after taking an adder bite that was meant for Triss, and dies by her side. Shogg's sea otter friend Kroova takes his death very hard.\n\nTriss (Trisscar) is an anthropomorphic female squirrel from the novel \"Triss\". After escaping from slavery, she becomes the first female character to bear the Sword of Martin.\n\nWelfo is an anthropomorphic female hedgehog.\n\nShe escapes slavery on the isle of Riftgard with Triss and Shogg. While they're escaping in the royal boat, a vermin slingstone hits the mast, falls, and hits Welfo on her head. She's knocked out cold, and over the next few days, Welfo and her friends get progressively weaker and sicker, and Welfo is in real danger of dying when they spot Peace Island.\n\nThe island is inhabited by a colony of hedgehogs, and they take Welfo and her companions in. Welfo and Urtica, the chief's son, fall desperately in love with each other. Welfo stays on the island with Urtica when her two friends leave, and later marries him. Later, on their way to free the slaves of Riftgard, Triss and company stop by Peace Island to visit Welfo and the hedgehogs.\n\nThe so-called Pure Ferrets were a race of ferrets who rule over Riftgard, an island kingdom to the north of Mossflower Woods. Like many of the various regimes established in the saga, they maintain a horde of slaves and rats to do their bidding. The Royal House of Riftgard, their proper title, is also known for its own form of script, which it is said only Pure Ferrets can read. This script is inscribed into many pieces of their property, including the royal crown and ring. They speak with a European, possibly German accent. They seem to resemble World War II Nazis, for they share many similarities: The Pure Ferrets are white and call themselves pure (Nazis considered the Aryan race to be the whitest and purest of all), they spoke with thick (if not overly exaggerated) German accents and they enslaved other creatures, possibly because they considered them inferior.\n\nKing Sarengo was the first ruler of Riftgard. He, his son, and a group of ratguards took the fateful journey to Mossflower woods which ended with his death in the coils of a mother adder, who he in turn killed by breaking her spine between his jaws. The only survivor of the trip was his hydrophobic, blubbering son, Agarnu, who lost a leg in the journey back to his home. He was the victim of a mutual kill with Berussca.\n\nIt is mentioned that Sarengo carried a spiked ball and chain mace as his choice weapon. This weapon caused the joining of the three adder siblings who gained his royal crown and pawring.\n\nAgarnu is an anthropomorphic ferret.\n\nHe is the son of Sarengo and the father of Bladd and Kurda. He is depicted as a fat, one legged ruler, constantly dealing with the squabbles of his offspring. He sends them off to reclaim his father's royal symbols so that he can show his rightful place as ruler of Riftgard. However, the escaped slave Triss, with a band of liberators, returns at the end of the book to free the slaves. His litter carriers then promptly set him afloat in his chair, and as he pleads for mercy, his own weight carries him to the bottom of the sea.\n\nKurda is an anthropomorphic female ferret.\n\nSkilled with a sabre and quite greedy, Kurda is the main villain. She is the slime-gutted, good for nothing princess of Riftgard. She will kill any one who gets in the way of her doing what she wants. She is cruel to all the slaves under her father's rule, having them locked up and beaten often. Kurda gains a dangerous enemy when she runs through an old friend of Triss's as Triss and her friends make their escape. She resents her brother Bladd to no end, and the two constantly squabble like small children, Kurda often threatening him with her blades. She is eventually killed in Mossflower when she falls on her own blade while being pursued by Triss.\n\nThe fat and simple brother to Kurda, Bladd is King Agarnu's son. He is childlike and constantly fights with Kurda, often hiding behind guards or their father while he teases his dangerous sister. He befriends the freebooters that take him and his sister to Mossflower, to the disgust of Kurda. He is eager to help his pirate friends to get into Redwall but is killed when the Redwallers pour boiling oatmeal on him, the pot breaking his skull.\n\nThe Ratguard were the soldiers of Riftgard, in service to the Pure Ferret royal family of King Sarengo and his descendants. They were responsible for guarding the fort and protecting members of the royal family when they went abroad, as well as overseeing the slaves that labored at Riftgard. The Ratguards were defeated when Trisscar Swordmaid and her companions returned to Riftgard to free the rest of the slaves imprisoned there. Among the members of the Ratguard are:\n\n\nBerussca is an adder who is the mother of Zassiliss, Harssacss, and Sesstra and lived with them in what was once Brockhall. When Brockhall was attacked by King Sarengo, she managed to kill some of the Ratguard.\n\nBerussca was locked in battle with King Sarengo when she died in battle upon having a broken spine. The poison of Berussca slew King Sarengo resulting in a mutual kill between the two of them.\n\nZassiliss, Harssacss, and Sesstra are the three adders in Triss. They were bound together by King Sarengo's mace and chain landing on their tails. Zassiliss is the eldest snake. He wears King Agarnu's crown and is bound in the center of the group. Harssacss, brother of Zassiliss and Sesstra, was bound to the right of Zassiliss. Sesstra, sister of Zassiliss and Harssacss, the only daughter of Berussca, was bound with her brothers at the left of Zassiliss. Zassiliss was killed by Triss who stabbed him in the neck. Harsaccs was killed by Sagax. Sesstra was killed by Shogg.\n\nBragoon and Sarobando, Brag and Saro for short, are two fictional characters from the book \"Loamhedge\". Bragoon is an anthropomorphic male otter, while Sarobando is a female anthropomorphic squirrel. In the audiobook, Bragoon was voiced by Tim Lynskey and Saro by Angela Mounsey.\n\nBragoon and Saro lived at Redwall Abbey when they were young. They were renowned troublemakers as toddlers, always pulling pranks and getting into mischief. It was a relief to all when they departed to rove the world. They had many adventures through the long seasons, traveling all throughout the country surrounding Redwall. During this time, Bragoon was briefly a Skipper (leader) of Otters, but Saro was not too fond of the idea, so he gave it up.\n\nBragoon and Saro finally return to Redwall many seasons later. Whilst there, they learn of the plight of a young hare named Martha Braebuck, who is inexplicably unable to walk. Finding that they are the ones chosen by the spirit of Martin the Warrior to help Martha, Saro and Bragoon resolve to aid her. Martin had informed Martha in a dream that her cure is located at the ruins of the ancient, faraway abbey Loamhedge. Saro and Bragoon set off for Loamhedge, Bragoon carrying the sword of Martin the Warrior. However, they are followed by Martha's brother, Hortwill Braebuck, and his two friends. The lifelong friends find themselves hard pressed to put up with the young ones.\n\nAlong the way, Bragoon and Saro have more adventures, including an encounter with the huge badger Lonna Bowstripe. After reaching Loamhedge, they look for the mysterious thing they had been sent to find. However, they are unable to locate it, and so the two forge a parchment with a message on it, given away later by Bragoon's poor spelling and Saro's bad handwriting. During the return trip, the five wayfarers are attacked by the forces of the evil Kharanjul. The two adventurers, to save the three youngsters who tagged along, stay behind to do battle, succeeding only to find themselves fatally wounded. The two clasp paws as they die, and Martha, whose paralysis has been cured without the cure from Loamhedge, keeps a promise she had made to the two warriors, dancing on Redwall's walltop with her newfound ability to walk.\n\nBragoon and Saro are both depicted as warriors, and are armed accordingly. Aside from Martin's sword, Bragoon wields a staff, but can fight quite well with his own limbs. As for Saro, she is skilled with a sling.\n\nThe Jerbilrats are a horde of golden-furred rats exclusively in the novel \"Loamhedge\", in the Redwall series.\nThey appear in the desert above the high cliffs the travellers Bragoon, Sarobando, the young hare Horty and his two friends climb. They steal the travellers' water. Sarobando and Bragoon capture the leader, however, and interrogate him to find out where a water source is. Jiboa, the Jerbilrats' leader, refuses to tell them and instead tries to lead them to it. Horty creates an insulting song about the Jerbilrats as they travel.\nJiboa later chews through the rope and escapes, though is caught as prey by a buzzard. It is assumed that he is killed and eaten. Seeing their leader taken, the rest of his horde flee. They are not seen again in the novel.\n\nLonna Bowstripe was a massive Badger Lord who was raised by an older badger, Grawn, near the Eastern Coast. It was Grawn who taught him the ways of the archer and very well too, as he could shoot dead center in excess of 100 yards. Lonna was also born with the powers of a seer, a skill that is not found in woodlanders in general, albeit not uncommon among badgers. According to Grawn, his powers were one of the reasons he was so accurate with his bow, he could also contact creatures in their dreams, a feat he demonstrated only on Raga Bol vowing vengeance. Lonna also periodically had bloodwrath. Other characters commented frequently on his huge size.\n\nHe had a scar on his face, which he received during a near-fatal encounter with Raga Bol. His life was saved by the otters Abruc and Stugg, who rescued him and brought him back to health. Lonna had sworn an oath of vengeance against Bol, as the attack had ended with the killing of Grawn, and pursued him.\n\nLonna traveled for seasons tracking Bol and at one point was almost assassinated by three of his troops who were armed with poison darts.\n\nAfter a run-in with the party questing for Loamhedge Abbey, during which Martin the Warrior told him where to go, Lonna tracked Raga Bol to Redwall Abbey. Lonna stood outside the building slaying any vermin foolish enough to poke his head above the perimeter. Eventually, Lonna got his paws on Bol and used him as a club to whack Bol's own troops and was about to kill the searat when Bol was accidentally killed by the spears of his own crew who were trying to throw them at the badger. Many of the searats ran but Lonna tracked every last one down.\n\nAfter Redwall was saved, Lonna went on to become the next Lord of Salamandastron.\n\nRaga Bol is an anthropomorphic rat from the novel \"Loamhedge\". He is depicted as tall and sinewy, with green eyes.\n\nRaga Bol's ship is wrecked on the northeast coast of Mossflower, and there he loses his left paw in a battle with the badger Lonna Bowstripe. Lonna, sorely wounded, swears revenge on Bol, and Bol spends the rest of his life in morbid fear of all badgers. Raga Bol replaces his missing paw with a silver hook.\n\nBol leads his crew inland after finding out that Lonna is still alive, hoping to defeat his sworn enemy. He is plagued by visions and poor sleep, driving him to finally consult his seer, who advises him to send assassins out for Lonna. However, they are foiled by the powerful badger. Raga Bol's crew later captures two stoats from another vermin gang. Bol is about to roast them alive, but they promise him booty, loot and magic swords, if he will follow them to Redwall Abbey.\n\nBol tries several times to enter the Abbey, but has no luck. Among his strategies are trying to climb through a window, and burning down the front door itself. When Lonna Bowstripe arrives at the Abbey, the besiegers quickly become the besieged. Bol realises that all hope of taking the Abbey has been shattered, and decides that survival and escape now come first. He challenges Lonna to single combat, but not before he instructs his crew to throw spears and kill the badger if things are going badly.\nLonna gets Raga Bol in a death grip almost immediately. In addition, four spears thrown by Bol's own crew accidentally thud into his back, making sure he is well and truly dead. The rest of his crew is hunted down and killed by the vengeful badger.\n\nThe crew of Raga Bol, which is numbering about 50, consisted entirely of Searats. Together with their leader, the crew tried to overrun Redwall Abbey, but they failed. The whole crew was either killed by Lonna Bowstripe or the Redwallers.\n\n\nRakkety Tam MacBurl was a border squirrel, meaning he came from the far north. His main companion was Wild Doogy Plumm. Together the two of them traveled south as mercenaries and eventually arrived at the territory of Squirrelking Araltum and Idga Drayqueen. Once there, they pledged their swords to the royalty and quickly became two of the most revered fighters within the entire kingdom.\n\nAfter several seasons, however, the land soon had little need for active warriors, and the two became bored. To make matters worse, the two they had pledged loyalty to were prone to ordaining the most trivial of ceremonies and regulations. Tam, along with Doogy was imprisoned for insulting Araltum and Idga when asked to participate in such a ceremony.\n\nThe arrival of Gulo the Savage in Mossflower gave the warrior the excitement he was looking for. When the Squirrelking's soldiers were ambushed by Gulo, Tam and Doogy were sent to investigate and recover the royal banner which Gulo stole, in exchange for freedom from their pledge. At the scene, they were caught and knocked unconscious by some members of the Long Patrol who suspected that they were in league with the beasts who slaughtered 8 of their hares. A young sea otter who had witnessed the slaughter, Arflow, identified them as being innocent, and the true murderers—Gulo and his vermin—were revealed. Tam, Doogy, and the Long Patrol united and eventually arrived at Redwall Abbey. It is here where he received the Sword of Martin and he met Sister Armel, the Infirmary Keeper, and future wife of Tam.\n\nAfter a series of skirmishes with the wolverine, Tam eventually faced off against Gulo in a duel. Tam successfully beheaded his opponent by hitting him down the sharpened rim of his shield and ultimately saved Redwall. He mentioned that Martin the Warrior tipped him to sharpen his shield. Afterwards, he settled down and married Armel and had a daughter, Melanda MacBurl.\n\nTam and his family eventually traveled back to Squirrelking Araltum to finally be released from his and Doogy's pledge. After they were freed, Araltum and his family were dethroned, and Rakkety Tam was offered lordship over the Groves. However, Tam refused and traveled back to Redwall.\n\nWild Doogy Plumm is an anthropomorphic squirrel. He is voiced by Simon Smithies in the full-cast audiobook.\n\nDoogy Plumm is the best friend of Rakkety Tam MacBurl, and also comes from the northlands. However, because Doogy is a true northlander, while Tam is only a border-dweller, Doogy has a broad accent, reminiscent of that common among natives of Scotland. Doogy met Tam while traveling south, and the two joined forces and pledged their loyalty to Araltum Squirrelking and Idga Drayqueen, two squirrel monarchs who were looking for servants.\n\nDoogy and Tam were imprisoned after disobeying and insulting their masters. However, they were released after Idga's royal banner was stolen by the army of Gulo the Savage, on the condition that they would bring the banner back. Seeking to avenge their fallen comrades and to be released from their oaths to the squirrel monarchs, Doogy and Tam set off after them. Early on, they destroyed Gulo's wrecked ship, only to be taken captive by the Long Patrol army of Salamandastron. After they explained their purposes, they joined forces with an army of hares dispatched by the badger Lady Melesme.\n\nTraveling into Mossflower country, Doogy and Tam came to Redwall Abbey. They continued their battle with Gulo's forces, until a point where Doogy was captured and held hostage. Tam engaged Gulo in battle, and defeated the wolverine, freeing Doogy. However, while wielding the Sword of Martin, Tam ruined Doogy's stolen Claymore. As payment, Doogy took Tam's own claymore, which Tam swore was his for a long time afterward.\n\nMany seasons passed afterward, and Doogy became an uncle figure to Tam's daughter Melanda. He taught her the art of swordsmanship, and remarked that she was a better swordsbeast than he and her \"great lump of a dad\" put together. He and Tam finally returned to the court of the squirrel monarchs, and were released from their oaths. As a result of their freedom, Araltum and Idga's subjects rebelled, and the duo were deposed.\n\nDoogy had an identical armament to that of Rakkety Tam, including a Sgian Dubh, a dirk, a buckler, and a claymore. He was also a proficient boxer, instructed by a hare sergeant during the hunt for Gulo.\n\nBrigadier Buckworthy Crumshaw is a hare who was a veteran officer of the Long Patrol under Lady Melesme. He was known for being \"old school to the rigid backbone,\" and did not tolerate nonsense. He wore a monocle and was mustachioed, and carried a swagger stick.\n\nBrigadier Crumshaw was in charge of the 100 hares sent to Redwall Abbey to retrieve Melesme's drum from Gulo the Savage's horde of a hundred white vermin. He made immediate friends with Rakkety Tam MacBurl and Wild Doogy Plumm, recognizing two seasoned warriors. Crumshaw was also a friend of Tergen, who called him Brigadier Wotwot; he was responsible for curing Tergen of depression when the bird was wounded in action.\n\nUpon arriving at the Abbey, Crumshaw ran afoul of Gulo's troops and took an arrow in the shoulder; Sister Armel had to put his arm in a sling. Crumshaw stayed at Redwall with half of the Long Patrol to defend it while Tam took the other half to chase Gulo the Savage and half the vermin who had not stayed to attack the Abbey.\n\nAfter the Long Patrol made an agreement with the other half of the vermin to meet on the field west of the Abbey for battle, Crumshaw was confronted by Sergeant Wonwill and Captain Derron Fortindom, who argued that he couldn't fight with his arm in a sling. When the Brigadier refused not to lead the charge, Wonwill was forced to knock him out with a well-placed uppercut. Crumshaw was placed in the Gatehouse at Redwall Abbey.\n\nWhen Freeta and her companions sneaked into the Abbey via one of the wallgates, Crumshaw saw it all and made a lone charge from the gatehouse, his arm still in a sling. He was shot in the chest twice by arrows and then slashed in the face by Freeta's sword, but in his last dying breath he managed to grab the blade and use it to slay the vixen resulting in a mutual kill.\n\nUpon the discovery of the Brigadier's body, Wonwill remarked that Crumshaw wouldn't have wanted to go any other way but in battle. The young hare Flunkworthy then did an amazing impression of the Brigadier's voice, as if Crumshaw was telling his fellow hares to dry their eyes and carry on the war without him.\n\nHe was temporarily laid to rest beneath the Tapestry of Martin the Warrior, and later buried on the Abbey grounds.\n\nCaptain Derron Fortindom is a hare who was a Captain in the Long Patrol during the Seasons of the Savage. He was known to be the best hare alive with a sabre. He was also described as easily flustered by a pretty female.\n\nFortindom was one of fifty hares who stayed at Redwall Abbey to guard it from foxes and ermine, while Rakkety Tam tracked down Gulo the Savage with the other fifty hares. When Fargil and Graddu attempted to scout a way into the Abbey, the hares were ordered to take one fox prisoner and kill the other. Fortindom handled the slaying part, dueling Graddu and killing him. Later, when the vermin attacked the Abbey, Fortindom discovered a decoy plan set up by Captain Zerig. Using the vermin's own plan against them, the hares allowed the foxes and ermine to come inside the Abbey; Fortindom then locked the gate behind them to prevent them escaping, and the vermin were slain to a beast.\n\nFortindom was one of the marshalls in the final duel between Tam and Gulo. After the death of Gulo, Fortindom and Wonwill slew the last six remaining foxes and ermine between them. He later returned to Salamandastron, and was still residing there when Tam's daughter Melanda MacBurl came to visit fifteen seasons later.\n\nFerdimond \"Ferdy\" De Mayne is a hare who was part of the Long Patrol under Lady Melesme. He is shown to be brave, kind and honourable, though impulsive and hotheaded at times. He carried a rapier and had a fair tenor singing voice.\n\nDuring the Seasons of the Savage, Ferdimond proved himself to be a valiant warrior and loyal ally. He initially clashed with Wild Doogy Plumm, but after a boxing match, which ended in a tie, they became good friends. Ferdy, Doogy and Rakkety Tam MacBurl were chosen to be gallopers for the Long Patrol. They were tasked with getting to Redwall Abbey to warn its inhabitants of Gulo the Savage and his horde, who were rapidly approaching.\n\nWhen Kersey, another young member of the Long Patrol, lost her twin brother Dauncey in an ambush, Ferdimond was quick to comfort her. Soon after, the Patrol was split in two; Ferdimond was part of the group going out to fight, whereas Kersey stayed behind at Redwall Abbey in the defence group. Before Ferdimond left, Kersey presented him with Dauncey's sling and pebble bag, telling him to watch out for himself. He accepted them and asked if he may \"be lookin' out for [her]\" when he comes back, which she smilingly said would please her. After Gulo the Savage's death, the Long Patrol returned to Salamandastron, where Ferdy and Kersey eventually married. Not long after the birth of their son, Dauncey, they decided to make their home back at the Abbey, as its resident hares.\n\nKersey is a hare who was a scout (also known as a galloper or runner) of the Long Patrol under Lady Melesme. Despite being very young, she was good at her job, due to her bravery, speed and intelligence. Her weapon was a javelin.\n\nKersey was inseparable from her twin brother Dauncey, who was her fellow scout. They had a tendency to finish each other's sentences and to be very reckless. The latter got them into danger more that once and lead to Dauncey's death during an ambush. Kersey was devastated by his loss, thereafter becoming graver and a lot less headstrong.\n\nDuring the Seasons of the Savage, Kersey became close to another young member of the Long Patrol, Ferdimond De Mayne. At one point on the long march to Redwall Abbey, there was a risk of Kersey and Dauncey getting lost in the mist whilst they are out scouting, so Ferdimond sang to guide them back to the Patrol. Later, Ferdimond was quick to comfort Kersey after the death of her twin. When the Patrol was split in two, Ferdy was part of the group going out to fight, whereas Kersey stayed behind at Redwall Abbey in the defence group. Before Ferdimond left, Kersey presented him with Dauncey's sling and pebble bag, telling him to watch out for himself. He accepted them and asked if he may \"be lookin' out for [her]\" when he comes back, which she smilingly said would please her. After Gulo the Savage's death, the Long Patrol returned to Salamandastron, where Ferdy and Kersey eventually married. Not long after the birth of their son, Dauncey, they decided to make their home back at the Abbey, as its resident hares.\n\nHitheryon Jem was a male hedgehog who was the cousin of Abbot Humble. He was a wanderer throughout his adult years with his close friend Wandering Walt. He and Walt had were the only creatures to have witnessed the death of Askor, the brother of Gulo the Savage. Because of this, they went to Redwall Abbey in order to tell the creatures there of the impending danger.\n\nAfter the Seasons of the Savage, the pair remained to Redwall Abbey to live out the rest of their days.\n\nWandering Walt was a male mole and the close friend and sole companion of Hitheryon Jem. He was a wanderer throughout his adult life. Walt and Jem were the only creatures to have witnessed the death of Askor, the brother of Gulo the Savage. Because of this, they went to Redwall Abbey in order to tell the creatures there of the impending danger.\n\nAfter the Seasons of the Savage, the pair remained to Redwall Abbey to live out the rest of their days.\n\nYoofus Lightpaw was a kleptomaniac water vole who was well-versed in woodland lore. Though he was unfailingly kind and generous, he was also prone to stealing everything and anything he could get his paws on. He was the husband of Didjety Lightpaw, who scolded his ways but was secretly proud of her husband's talents.\n\nYoofus' first known act of thievery in Rakkety Tam was stealing from the vermin camp of Gulo the Savage's horde of a hundred white vermin. He pilfered a curved sword from Captain Urfig, and also took the banner of Squirrelking Araltum and Idga Drayqueen. He made off with these, unwittingly leaving behind a trail which resembled that of a wolverine. Gulo thought it was Askor and followed. Yoofus noticed and began leading the vermin in circles.\n\nHe ran into Rakkety Tam MacBurl, Wild Doogy Plumm, Ferdimond de Mayne and Tergen the Goshawk, who were immediately suspicious because he had the banner which they were searching for. He told the squirrels that he would give them the banner and help them rescue the kidnapped maidens, Sister Armel and Brookflow, who were in the claws of the vermin, in exchange for Rakkety Tam's claymore. Tam agreed, but didn't take the flag yet. He told Yoofus to go with Ferdimond and Tergen to Redwall Abbey.\n\nYoofus sneaked out of the Abbey with Tam's claymore and the flag of the Squirrelking, but he did not get far. Tam's patrol bumped into him (actually Skipper of Otters dove into a pond and retrieved the watervole by the tail, who had been hiding). Yoofus told the patrol that he had spied on Gulo, and that Gulo's plan was to attack the Abbey.\n\nTam's patrol had a skirmish with Gulo's horde, after which Doogy, Ferdimond and Yoofus went off to the north. Gulo sent Dirig, the only ermine Captain in the horde, after them. Yoofus cleverly led them into a clearing which was actually a swamp. Then the three met up with Log-a-Log Togey of the Guosim, who were friends of Yoofus'.\n\nTam formed a plan which involved leading Gulo and his vermin into a grove of pine trees where a bunch of crows roosted. Doogy and Yoofus did not take part in this plan, for they tripped and fell before entering the grove and were left behind. Yoofus decided to go back and plunder the vermin camp while Gulo was gone, and for once Doogy agreed. Yoofus stole the drum which Lady Melesme of Salamandastron meant to send to Redwall, which Doogy didn't approve of.\n\nThe two were taken captive by a gang of vermin led by a weasel, who were living in the dormouse family of Muskar Muskar and Lupinia Muskar, who knew Yoofus but somehow did not know he was a thief. The vermin gang was forcing the dormice to cook for them. Doogy and Yoofus sent the dormice outside, then set upon the vermin ferociously. The whole gang was killed.\n\nDoogy and Yoofus stayed overnight at the Muskar family's home, but in the morning Doogy discovered that Yoofus had bolted, taking Melesme's drum and his own dirk, in addition to the vermin gang's raft. Doogy and Muskar Muskar followed Yoofus back to his own home, where they met Yoofus' wife Didjety.\n\nYoofus made the age-old thief's excuse \"I was taking care of them for you\" and Doogy took his dirk and the drum back. Doogy spied Rockbottom the tortoise, and recognised him as the Walking Stone which Gulo was looking for! Doogy insisted the tortoise be brought to Redwall. Yoofus, Didjety and the drum accompanied him.\n\nYoofus tried to lead them to Redwall by waterways and sidestreams, but got them hopelessly lost. All three lost their patience with each other, and in the end it was Didjety who was leading them. Doogy noticed that Yoofus was eying the drum, and was suspicious that the volethief planned on stealing it.\n\nWhen they finally did get to the Abbey, Wild Doogy and the drum were taken captive by Gulo and his horde. Yoofus, Didjety and Rockbottom (or the Walking Stone) just managed to get into the Abbey, and were watching safely while Tam had his famous single combat with Gulo.\n\nAfter the vermin from the Land of Ice and Snow were vanquished, Skipper discovered Tam's claymore and the banner of Araltum, hidden where Yoofus had found Rockbottom (Walking Stone). Doogy took it, because Gulo had been fighting with his old one and it was destroyed, and Tam now fought with the Sword of Martin. Yoofus and Didjety returned to their home safely, taking with them the tortoise.\n\nGulo the Savage is an anthropomorphic wolverine. Gulo was voiced by Greg Longridge in the full-cast audiobook. His name is derived from Gulo gulo, the binomial name for the wolverine.\n\nOne of two sons of the mighty overlord Dramz, Gulo came from a land of ice across the sea to Mossflower Wood. After killing his father Dramz, Gulo sought to take the tortoise known as the Walking Stone, the symbol of power over the icy land. However, Gulo's brother Askor stole the tortoise and fled, burying it in Mossflower before being crushed by a falling tree and dying.\n\nEnraged and insane, Gulo came after with a band of white foxes and ermine. Cannibals all, the band killed eight members of the Long Patrol army, along with several squirrels. This provoked the pursuit of other members of the Patrol, as well as the squirrel warriors Rakkety Tam MacBurl and Wild Doogy Plumm. Believing the Walking Stone to be within Redwall Abbey, Gulo headed for the building. However, after an attack by Rakkety Tam's allies, he split his forces, one half attacking the Abbey, the other doing battle with Tam and his friends. The force was decimated by the Long Patrol and their Redwall allies, as well as a force of black birds and a fall down a waterfall.\n\nSurviving, by leaping from the log, Gulo took his remaining troops to Redwall. Tam declared combat on Gulo, who accepted. They met in single combat. The two struggled for some time, and Tam was nearly killed, but managed to defeat Gulo by forcing him onto Tam's shield, whereupon the sharpened edge beheaded the wolverine.\n\nGulo was a massive beast, the size of a full grown badger. He possessed sharp claws and teeth, and ordinarily wielded no other weapons. The one occasion he did use a weapon was when he dueled Rakkety Tam, using a claymore stolen from Doogy Plumm. He is well known for his ability to survive events that are well known for being \"certain death\" to all who engage in them.\n\nGulo the Savage's Horde consisted of foxes and ermines. They ate the flesh of their enemies and were known and feared as fighters in the Land of Ice and Snow. Despite their savagery, the horde was no match for the fighting skills of the Long Patrol hares on several occasions. The last six creatures in the horde perished after the Gulo's unsuccessful attack on Redwall Abbey. Among the members of Gulo the Savage's horde are:\n\n\nCuthbert Blanedale Frunk is an anthropomorphic hare, appearing in the \"Redwall\" series.\n\nFrunk was a Long Patrol hare under Badger Lord Mandoral Highpeak. He wore a waxed mustache and a monocle, and carried a sabre and a swagger stick. His daughter Petunia was brutally murdered by sea-raiding vermin on the shores of Salamandastron, which caused him deep mental trauma to the point of developing a dissociative identity disorder. After his daughter's death, Frunk hunted down the murderers, disposed of them, and took their ship, renaming it the \"Purloined Petunia\" in her honor. He then sailed the seas, looking for fights, and occasionally returning to Salamandastron.\n\nBefore his daughter's death, and his descent into madness, Major Blanedale was something of a legend in the Long Patrol army, considered a very skilled fighter and perilous warrior. Lord Mandoral refers to Blanedale as \"the Deathseeker\", telling Tiria Wildlough that Blanedale had become a berserker since the death of his daughter.\n\nFrunk changes personalities and characters a number of times, depending on how he is feeling. In addition to being the Long Patrol Regimental Major, he also believes himself to be the following:\n\n\nFrunk is responsible for guiding young Tiria Wildlough to Badger Lord Mandoral, who gives her the High Rhulain armor. Along with other Long Patrol hares, Frunk and Tiria sail in the \"Purloined Petunia\" to Green Isle, home of Tiria's otter clans. While at Green Isle, Frunk kills the wildcat son of Riggu Felis and those loyal to him in a berserk rage. Following this, he kills the ferocious Slothunog (a Nessie-like sea monster) but is himself killed in the process.\n\nMandoral Highpeak allows Frunk's name to live on in a ship he later captures, naming it the \"Fearless Frunk\".\n\nTiria Wildlough is an otter who is the daughter of Banjon Wildlough, and a descendent of Alem Mossguard, Runa Wildlough, Corriam Wildlough, and High Queen Rhulain Wildlough.\n\nShe grew up in Redwall Abbey, hoping to be Skipper of otters like her father, and is close friends with Tribsy, Girry, and Brinty. She is incredibly skilled with a sling, calling the one she carried \"Wuppit\". On one trek into Mossflower Woods, Tiria and her friends encounter a gang of young water rats torturing Pandion Piketalon, an Osprey. Tiria, an expert slinger, rescues the bird and acquires an iron barb that was stuck in his mouth from a battle with Riggu Felis.\n\nThat night, Tiria dreams of Martin the Warrior and a long-dead otter queen known as the Rhulain, who instruct her to liberate the otterclans of Green Isle. After she remembers the dream, a barnacle goose called Brantalis Skyfurrow gives her directions to the mountain stronghold Salamandastron. After another visit from Martin, Tiria, her father, Pandion, and Brink Greyspoke immediately depart for Salamandastron. Captain Cuthbert Blanedale Frunk, Log-a-Log Urfa, and the Guosim shrews assist in transportation via the \"Purloined Petunia\" to the mountain, where Lord Mandoral Highpeak outfitted her with the original Rhulain's armor, crafted by Lord Urthwyte the Mighty. Tiria was also given a new sling by Lord Mandoral.\n\nAfter the Petunia arrived at Green Isle, Brantalis flew from Redwall to deliver the coronet that accompanied the armor. Tiria slung the iron barb originally retrieved from Pandion from a great distance to kill Felis. After the defeat of the Feral Cat Army of Green Isle, Tiria became queen, ruling from the halcyon Holt Summerdell. Her new companions became Deedero Galedeep and Banya Streamdog.\n\nLeatho Shellhound was a male outlaw sea otter of the otterclans on Green Isle. A strong, agile and ferocious beast, he was the last of the Shellhounds. Among the outlaws and the otterslaves under Riggu Felis and his Feral-Cat army of Green Isle, Leatho was a legendary figure, defiant and ruthless in the face of the true enemy. To the cats, Leatho was a creature to be both loathed and feared.\n\nLeatho saved Brantalis Skyfurrow from death when he was struck in the neck from an arrow shot from the catguards (Weilmark Scaut among them), and bound the arrow wound in the goose's neck with a poultice of mud and wild radish leaves.\n\nWhen Chab, Whulky and their families were tied beneath the pier as punishment by the cats, Leatho gathered a group of otters and coordinated a plan for their rescue. While Banya Streamdog and Lorgo Galedeep freed them, Leatho and his friends created a diversion. With Leatho's cunning and conviction, the rescue was successful.\n\nFollowing this event, Leatho was rightfully praised as a hero among the outlaws. Back at the refuge cave on the coast, Ould Zillo the Bard created a ballad in honor of the courageous otter and the events. Although he was charmed by this spirit and appreciation, Leatho grimly announced the truth of the situation: Riggu Felis would want revenge, and a plan of defense had to be formulated until they could unite under the Otterqueen, the High Rhulain (who turned out to be the Redwaller Tiria Wildlough). He was also determined to free the otterslaves that were still imprisoned at the feral cat Fortress.\n\nWhen Riggu Felis (along with Scaut and Fleng) took his army to confront the outlaws, Leatho was on the front lines, making plans with Kolun Galedeep and Banya. The otters tried to lead Fleng and his catguards inland, away from their families on the coast. However, Riggu Felis saw right through this ploy, and instead led the rest of the army down the coast. Leatho soon realized the truth of the wildcat's actions, and rallying his otters, led the panicked troupe towards their homes and families. When they got there, they realized that Deedero Galedeep and Zillo had predicted such an event and abandoned their cave. Leatho was at a loss for how to protect his clans next. Ould Zillo told him about Holt Summerdell, and with no other option in sight, Leatho agreed.\n\nDuring his first sleep in the caverns at their new home, Leatho dreamed of Martin the Warrior, who gave him a cryptic message about the slaves still inside the wildcat's fortress. The next day while Leatho was gathering produce with Kolun, he told him he must soon be \"followin' a dream\". Leatho headed off to the fortress, and Kolun and Banya joined him.\n\nWhen the three reached the fortress, Leatho ran around to the slave compound, and talked to Runka Streamdog and Memsy. He wanted the slaves to be prepared to be freed in about four nights. However, when he dropped from the wall of the pens, he fell into the clever, waiting paws of Riggu Felis and his guards. The wildcat knocked the aggressive sea otter unconscious with one heavy blow of the butt of his war axe.\n\nRiggu Felis tied Leatho inside a wooden cage that was hanging from a high fortress tower. His demands were that if the clans did not surrender completely to him, the Shellhound would be left to wither and die. When Banya and Memsy brought this news back to Holt Summerdell, the clans rose up in anger and finally headed off to war with the cats.\n\nMeanwhile, Leatho was starving and frying in the relentless sun. When Lady Kaltag tried to spear him through the window, accusing the otter for Jeefra's death, she unknowingly severed one of his bonds. Exhausted and dehydrated, the outlaw was free, but still trapped inside his cage. Pandion Piketalon, the osprey, came to the otter and helped him to break open the ceiling of the cage. He clambered into the fortress window. However, unable to escape through the fortress, Leatho barricaded himself in the high chamber, making bloodcurdling threats to the cats on the other side of the door.\n\nWhile the clans—along with the newly arrived Long Patrol and Tiria—were battling with the cats of the fortress, the insane Lady Kaltag set the place on fire, in an attempt to kill Leatho who was still inside the high chamber. Made of wood, the place burst into flames. On orders from Tiria, both Brantalis and Pandion soared to the window and carried Leatho down into the lake. The defeat of Riggu Felis and the cats came soon after.\n\nDuring a victory feast, Tiria was informed by Brantalis of Brinty's death back at Redwall Abbey. Leatho, seeing her overwhelming grief, suggested an idea to help the young ottermaid in mourning. He gave her a small wooden figurine to represent Brinty, which she then tied up with flowers and tossed into the lake. Leatho then chanted an ancient Green Isle poem, a tribute to the dead. Tiria was consoled, and became a good friend to the Shellhound.\n\nLeatho helped the otters and the hares in final battle with Pitru and the remaining catguards. Following this, he returned to Holt Summerdell and formed the Green Clan Regiment along with Kolun and the other clan leaders. His job was to protect the shores of Green Isle from enduring such violence and vermin tyranny ever again.\n\nRiggu Felis is an anthropomorphic wildcat. He was voiced by Paul Braithwaite in the full-cast audiobook.\n\nWarlord and conqueror of Green Isle, Riggu Felis was a fearsome wildcat, possibly distantly related to Ungatt Trunn. He and his horde of feral cats, descendants of ordinary cats who had joined with their wildcat brethren, took over Green Isle, enslaving many of the otters in residence. Riggu's mate was a feral cat named Kaltag, and he had two sons: the cowardly Jeefra and the bullying Pitru. Riggu was wounded while trying to kill an osprey, and the entire lower half of his face was ripped away, leaving a clear view of the jaws. To hide this wound, Felis donned a chain mail mask that covered the lower half of his face.\n\nRiggu was constantly bickering with his two sons, whom he felt to be unworthy of his name. He tried to goad Jeefra into standing up to his brother, and he put down Pitru's bullying. However, his efforts proved in vain, and during a battle with otter outlaws, Pitru drowned his brother in a nearby lake. Pitru continued to oppose his father, claiming that with his youth and strength he would make a better warlord.\n\nRiggu's problems multiplied as the otter clans grew bolder and his wife became insane over the death of Jeefra. Pitru declared open rebellion on his father, and in the end departed their fortress with several scores of cats. The otter clans were reinforced by their new queen, High Rhulain Tiria Wildlough, and the hares of the Long Patrol.\n\nRiggu's defeat came abruptly. His wife, trying to kill an otter who had barricaded himself in the fortress whom she blamed for Jeefra's death, set fire to the building. Riggu then saw the osprey who had wounded him before, and hurled his weapon, slaying his nemesis. However, his triumph was short-lived, as Tiria used her sling to kill Riggu. The load: a barbed star, the same which had become stuck in the osprey's mouth when it had fallen into Riggu's trap before.\n\nRiggu's legacy crumbled thereafter. His wife died in the fire, and his last remaining son was killed by a Long Patrol hare and devoured by the monster Slothunog.\n\nRiggu's chosen weapon was a one bladed axe.\n\nLady Kaltag is a feral cat who was Riggu Felis' unfortunate wife. Unlike many of the vermin families in the series, she was attached to her sons Pitru and Jeefra and opposed powerfully to Riggu's decision to make them rank-and-file cats. She disapproved of Riggu Felis's teaching Pitru and Jeefra to take what they wanted by force. Upon Jeefra's death, her already fragile mind was pushed over the edge. She blamed many creatures of Jeefra's killing, including her husband for sending her sons to the barracks and the outlaw otter Leatho Shellhound. Ironically, her closest ally from then on was Jeefra's true killer Pitru.\n\nWhen Leatho Shellhound was captured, Kaltag made several vain attempts to kill him outright, such as throwing a spear at him, but was restrained on Riggu Felis' orders (Riggu wanted Leatho as a hostage). When Riggu and his soldiers were distracted in battle, however, Kaltag found Leatho trapped in a room in the fortress tower. Mad with hatred, she burned the room down. Although her death was not mentioned outright, it is assumed that she was killed by the fire.\n\nPitru is a half-wildcat half-feral cat who was the son of Riggu Felis and Lady Kaltag, and the brother of Jeefra. He was the fiercer of the two brothers, and wanted to be ruler of Green Isle. Pitru was very cruel to his brother, and taunted him about how he was going to rule the fortress.\n\nAfter deciding they were both spoilt, Riggu enlisted his sons under Weilmark Scaut as common soldiers. They ended up in a small boat which was capsized by rebelling otterslaves.\n\nPitru was the first to surface. A drowning and panicked Jeefra begged him for help, but Pitru refused, and smashed a wooden paddle over his brother's head and paws, knocking him out and killing him. The cats did not realize that Pitru had killed his brother, thinking it was the otters.\n\nWhen Riggu left his fortress, Pitru, the newly appointed Fortress Commander, made an impression on some of the catguards, in particular Yund, Balur, and Hinso. He ordered Yund to kill Atunra, Riggu's lifetime companion, and Yund complied. Pitru attempted to take over his father's fortress, but failed.\n\nLater, he abandoned the fortress with those loyal to him and set up an encampment on the side of the Deeplough. After defeating Riggu the otterclans launched an attack on Pitru's barricade along Deeplough's ridge, which was well defended on all fronts. Pitru's force was quickly overwhelmed and in the midst of battle Pitru was killed by Cuthbert Blanedale Frunk in a berserk killing spree. Since the mad hare was unable to use his pike axe at short distance, he pulled Pitru close and broke his back with the axehaft. His body was eaten by the Slothunog after Frunk threw himself and Pitru's body into the Deeplough.\n\nJeefra is a half-wildcat half-feral cat who was one of the sons of Riggu Felis and Lady Kaltag. He was the brother of Pitru. Jeefra was half a head taller than Pitru and was rather burly, but he was stupid, spoiled, whiny, and terrified of his fierce brother.\n\nRiggu was disgusted with the spoiled nature of his sons, so he sent them both to the guard barracks to work as regular catguards, ignoring Kaltag's protests. Soon afterwards, an attack by rebel-otters led by Leatho Shellhound burned part of the wildcat's fortress, and a quick turn of events found Pitru and Jeefra's boat sinking in the lake. Pitru escaped the water, but his brother was not so lucky. As Jeefra begged him for help, Pitru promptly snatched a wooden paddle and smashed it onto his brother's head and paws without a second thought. Jeefra's corpse was recovered from the depths and buried on dry land.\n\nPitru blamed his brother's death on Leatho Shellhound and Lady Kaltag was sure that the death of Jeefra was the fault of Riggu Felis.\n\nAtunra was a female pine marten, and the constant aide of Riggu Felis. She was completely loyal to him and had been so since their younger years.\n\nWhen Felis was attacked and severely wounded by Pandion Piketalon, Atunra treated the injury as best she could, sending Pitru and Jeefra for help. Later, when Pitru and Felis split forces to search for Leatho Shellhound and the Otter Clans of Green Isle, Atunra stayed behind to keep an eye on things for her master, annoying Pitru with her insistence that his father's rules should be kept regardless of whether he was actually present or not.\n\nAtunra was killed by Yund and thrown into the fortress lake after Pitru ordered him to do so. Weilmark Scaut discovered her body when he fell into the lake. She was avenged by Riggu Felis.\n\nRiggu Felis' army was the Feral Cat Army of Green Isle. The catguards numbered at least 200. There were two kinds of officers in the catguards: Weilmarks (another name for the captains of the guard), and Scorecats, who each commanded 20 catguards (as their name suggests).\n\n\nGorath the Flame is a badger who was a Salamandastron ruler, the husband of Salixa, and the father of Rowanbloom. Before he learned to control himself, he had a fierce and raging Bloodwrath. Gorath's family originated from far southern lands; after his parents died fighting in the Great Vermin Wars, Gorath and his grandparents fled the dangerous region hoping to find a place of peace. However, a storm wrecked their boat on the Northern Isles, stranding them.\n\nAfter spending seasons on the Isles, Sea Raiders, led by the fox Vizka Longtooth, raided the islands and slew Gorath's grandparents. After knocking Gorath unconscious with his mace and chain, forming a large scab, Vizka brought Gorath aboard his ship, the \"Bludgullet\", hoping to convert the badger into a Sea Raider, possibly to attack Salamandastron. Gorath, after displaying a bad case of the Bloodwrath, refused to become a Sea Raider and slew one of Vizka's crew members in retaliation for the death of his grandparents. Vizka decided to let him starve in order to break Gorath's will and eventually turn him.\n\nGorath was later rescued by Orkwil Prink, a young hedgehog from Redwall Abbey. During the escape, Gorath strangled Codj, the brother of Vizka Longtooth and his first mate, killing him in retaliation for Codj's part in killing his grandparents. Orkwil and Gorath returned to Redwall shortly after, where Gorath was taken ill due to the effects of his imprisonment on the \"Bludgullet\". Sister Atrata was able to heal Gorath, in the process removing the scab from where Vizka's mace had struck Gorath, leaving a flame-shaped scar.\n\nGorath later left the Abbey and travelled into Mossflower to slay Vizka, only to fall unconscious from the uncontrolled Bloodwrath. He later awoke in the company of a wise elder badger named Tabura, and his female assistant Salixa. Having been taught by the Tabura to control his Bloodwrath, Gorath returned to Redwall with the Tabura and Salixa for whom Gorath shared mutual feelings of affection. During this time he was also introduced to Mad Maudie Thropple, a Long Patrol hare who had been sent from Salamandastron to find him.\n\nGorath and Salixa, along with their friends, ended up on a gigantic sandstone plateau, where they fought off the combined forces of Vizka and the Brownrats with the assistance of Log-a-Log Osbil and his Guosim shrews. They managed to fight off the vermin with assistance from the Redwallers and their Mossflower allies. With the Brownrats and Vizka's crew disbanded and in retreat, Gorath returned to the \"Bludgullet\" where he confronted Vizka. The two battled, Gorath finally triumphing when he snapped Vizka's spine. Instead of returning to Redwall, Gorath set out on the \"Bludgullet\", now renamed \"Eulalia\", to Salamandastron, where he met Lord Asheye and eventually succeeded him as the new Badger Lord.\n\nOrkwil Prink is an anthropomorphic male hedgehog.\n\nOrkwil was abandoned as a babe by his thieving parents and was found and taken into Redwall by Granspike Niblo. He grew up much like his parents: he was a thief and a sneak. Eventually, the Redwallers could take no more of him and exiled him for a season. At first he was thrilled by the idea, but after one night in the woodlands, he felt otherwise due to various mishaps, such as having his supplies stolen by magpies. The following day, he met a grumpy, unnamed watervole. In an attempt to get some food, he worked for the vole. However, the vole cheated him, and threatened to kill him if he did not leave. Then he decided to sleep, only he slept unwittingly into a swamp.\n\nHe woke up the next morning half-sunk in the swamp. Clinging to a branch, he shouted for help. Codj and some of Vizka Longtooth's scouts heard his cries and pulled him out of the swamp. When he refused to tell the location of Redwall Abbey, they chained him to the \"Bludgullet\"'s mast next to Gorath. Being a thief, he was able to pick the lock and escape with Gorath. He was able to get the starving Gorath some food by going to the grumpy watervole's home and scaring him off. The two went to Redwall Abbey, and warned them of Longtooth and his crew. His exile was declared over by Abbot Daucus.\n\nMeanwhile, Vizka had captured the watervole. He has the watervole take him to Redwall, where the watervole is captured during a failed ruse to get Vizka into Redwall. The vole is interrogated, the let go. However, Gorath tells him to lock the gate behind when he (Gorath) leaves secretly to hunt the Sea Raiders.\n\nHe is caught sneaking back to the Infirmary, where he was being held. They take him back to the sickbay, but on the way the vole notices Martin's sword. He escapes the Infirmary and steals the sword, killing Sister Atrata in the process. He runs off into the woodlands. Orkwil, along with a squirrel called Rangval the Rogue and a hare called Mad Mugsberry (the Hon.) Thropple (Maudie), (who was sent to find Lord Asheye's successor Gorath) go out in pursuit of the vole and Gorath. The vole is killed by Magger and Vizka kills Magger when he returns to camp and claims the sword for his own. Vizka captures Orkwil and company, and when Vizka, hearing of Gorath's coming to the plateau, rushes off to slay Gorath once and for all, leaving Ruglat, Saltear, and Undril behind to guard the captives. Maudie gets free and frees Rangval and Orkwil, and they easily overpower the three Sea Raiders. Disguising themselves as Sea Raiders, they pursue Vizka.\n\nWhen they finally catch up to Vizka and his crew at the plateau, Orkwil vanishes. Maudie and Rangval assume him to be dead and carry on to meet up with Gorath. What really happened was that when they were climbing the plateau, Orkwil slipped and hit his head, and blacked out. When he woke up, he heard the battle going on above, and rushed to Redwall, where he persuaded Abbot Daucus to bring some Redwallers to the plateau. They arrive just in time, saving Gorath and his friends. Orkwil followed Gorath to the \"Bludgullet\", and watches him slay Vizka Longtooth. He is named captain of the newly dubbed \"Eulalia\". He is named Abbey Warrior at the end of the book.\n\nRangval the Rogue was a resident of Mossflower Woods. He is a loyal and resourceful small squirrel and self-proclaimed rogue. He lived in a small cavern hollowed out by a river that he called \"Rogue's Retreat\". Rangval was an expert at making traps and his favorite trap was Owch Mansions, a dead willow containing several hives of wasps and hornets. The squirrel seemed to have a gift for communicating with these insects. If vermin blundered into the branches, which he would tie across the stream, the stinging insects would often kill or badly hurt with several stings.\n\nRangval carried four daggers as weapons, which he could readily use. The daggers were his pride and joy, and he dreaded the thought of any other beast stealing or using them.\n\nHe met Maudie Mugsberry Thropple on the River Moss while she sailed with the Guosim as they were pursued by Brownrats. He saved them by tricking the vermin into Owch Mansions and lead the vermin off of their trail. He fought at the Battle of the Plateau, after the battle was won he followed Gorath to his confrontation with Vizka Longtooth.\n\nLater, when he was sailing on the Eulalia, he was the only one of the crew to get seasick. He also became known as \"Uncle Rangval\" to Rowanbloom, and became the \"unofficial Scout in Charge to the Long Patrol\".\n\nVizka Longtooth is an anthropomorphic golden fox with overgrown fangs. Vizka was the Sea Raider captain of his ship, the Bludgullet, and his crew was a motley array of vermin including his brother Codj. He had a cruel personality, as shown when he puts a bowl of soup barely out of Gorath's reach. His weapon of choice was a mace and chain.\n\nHe took the badger called Gorath prisoner when he found where Gorath and his grandparents lived on the Northern Isles. He killed Gorath's grandparents and wounded Gorath. When Gorath learned he had slain his grandparents, he swore a blood oath against Vizka. Later on, he captured a hedgehog named Orkwil Prink (who was a thief), who was from Redwall Abbey. Orkwil and Gorath escaped to Redwall, with Vizka hard on their heels. Vizka attacked Redwall, and although he failed, he managed to steal Martin's sword. He eventually joined forces with a Brownrat horde, and went to fight the Redwallers at a plateau. Vizka and five other vermin escaped, but the vermin subsequently deserted Vizka. Vizka met Gorath on board his ship, and Gorath broke his spine, killing him. His ship was then renamed \"Eulalia\" and is captained by Orkwil.\n\nThe Sea Raiders were a group of vermin corsairs that regularly attacked the Northern Isles, among other places. Vizka Longtooth was the captain of the Bludgullet. The only other known Sea Raider vessel was the Sharkfin with Boljan as its captain. It was said that there were over eight score (160) of them. Among its members are\n\n\nBisky is an anthropomorphic mouse and the main character of \"Doomwyte\". He is portrayed as being young, possibly in his teenage years, and is a descendant of Gonff the Mousethief. Bisky relates the story of how Gonff stole four jewels from the Doomwytes, and later becomes one of a group of Redwallers who initiate a treasure hunt to find the four jewels, which they believe from riddles left by Gonff to be hidden around Redwall.\n\nWhen Bisky and friends explore some tunnels leading from the Abbey cellars far into Mossflower woodlands, Bisky is kidnapped by the Painted Ones, a tribe of primitive tree rats. He eventually escapes with a fellow prisoner, a young Guosim shrew named Dubble. The two meet the Gonfelins, a tribe of thieving mice descended from one branch of Gonff's family; Bisky is smitten with Spingo, the daughter of Gonfelin chieftain Nokko.\n\nBisky, Dubble and Spingo later meet the black otter Zaran, and assist her in her campaign to collapse the roof of the Doomwytes' subterranean lair. The three also fought during the battle between the Doomwytes and the Redwallers, before collapsing the roof of the cave, killing the remaining Doomwytes.\n\nIn the epilogue, Bisky had married Spingo, and they have a daughter named Andio.\n\nBaliss is an anthropomorphic adder in \"Doomwyte\". Descended from the infamous adder Asmodeus Poisonteeth, Baliss lives in the old sandstone quarry where Asmodeus lived. Although now blind due to advanced age, Baliss adapted to use his other senses to detect prey, making him more dangerous. Following initial attempts to terrorise the Redwallers, Korvus Skurr hired Baliss to terrorise the Abbey.\n\nDuring his first visit to Redwall, Baliss attempted to attack Cellarhog Corksnout Spikkle; Baliss rammed Corksnout, resulting in a number of Corksnout's bottom spikes lodging in his snout. Maddened by his injuries, Baliss slowly returned to Skurr's underground hideout, led by the Doomwyte Vugri. Having reached the underground cavern, Baliss killed Skurr's pet catfish Welzz, but was trapped underground when the Redwallers set a fire inside the cavern to contain him. When the cavern collapsed, Baliss was trapped inside and fatally crushed.\n"

                "List of pizza varieties by country\n\nDuring the latter half of the 20th century, pizza became a globally accessible dish, mainly due to Italian immigrants that had brought their dishes to new people with resounding success, often in racially and culturally resistive environments.\n\nA survey from 2004 showed that Norwegians eat the most frozen pizza (5.4 kg/person*year), followed by Germans.\n\nPizza became a popular fast food in Bangladeshi urban areas. Since the introduction of various pizza brands such as Domino's and Pizza Hut in the early to mid-2000s, it has reached almost all classes of urban peoples.\n\nPizza is an emerging fast food in Indian urban areas. American pizza chains Domino's Pizza and Pizza Hut opened their first outlets in India in 1996. Domestic pizza brands include U.S.Pizza, Smokin' Joes and Pizza Corner. Branded pizza is available in most cities in India.\n\nPizzas served in India by foreign pizza brands feature greater \"recipe localization\" from pizza makers than many other markets such as Latin America and Europe, but similar to other Asian pizza markets. Indian pizzas are generally spicier and more vegetable-oriented than those in other countries. For instance, oregano spice packs are included with a typical pizza order in India instead of Parmesan cheese. In addition to spicier and more vegetable-oriented ingredients, Indian pizza also utilized unique toppings. For example, a pizza topping unique to India would be pickled ginger.\n\nPizza outlets serve pizzas with several Indian-style toppings, such as tandoori chicken and paneer. More conventional pizzas are also eaten. Pizzas available in India range from localized basic variants, available in neighborhood bakeries, to gourmet pizzas with exotic and imported ingredients available at specialty restaurants.\n\nIn Indonesia, Pizza Hut is the largest pizza chain restaurant who entered Indonesia in 1984, followed by Domino Pizza and Papa Ron's Pizza. Popular pizza recipes such as meat lover with pepperoni, tuna with melt cheese, and beef blackpepper exist in Indonesia. Those recipes are originated either from United States or Italy, thus derived from western counterpart. \n\nHowever, there are also Asian eastern pizza which includes Indonesian fusion pizza that combine Indonesian favourite as pizza toppings — such as satay, balado and rendang.\nOther than Indonesian fusion, other Asian fusion pizza are also known in Indonesia, including:\n\nAmerican pizza chains entered Japan in the 1970s (e.g. Shakey's Pizza and Pizza Hut 1973, Domino's pizza in 1985). The largest Japanese pizza chain is Pizza-La. Local types of pizza are popular, with many using mayonnaise sauces, and sometimes other ingredients such as corn, potatoes, avocado, eel, or even honey or chocolate (as in dessert). \"Side orders\" also often include items such as french fries, fried chicken, baked pasta, as well as vegetable soups, green salads, desserts, and soda or Japanese tea. There is also a strong tradition of using Tabasco sauce on cooked pizzas.\n\nPizza toppings in Japan also differ from that found in the United States. One of the unique pizza toppings found in Japan is squid. Seafood may be found on pizza everywhere, but having squid as the focal ingredient is unique to Japan.\n\nLocal crust variants also exist, for instance mochi pizza (crust made with Japanese mochi cakes). Traditional pizza served in Italian-style restaurants are also popular, and the most popular pizza chain promoting Italian style artisanal pizza is Salvatore Cuomo. The Italian association Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana also has an independent branch in Japan.\n\nPizza is a popular snack food in South Korea, especially among younger people. Major American brands such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's Pizza compete against domestic brands such as Mr. Pizza and Pizza Etang, offering traditional as well as local varieties which may include toppings such as bulgogi and dak galbi. Korean-style pizza tends to be complicated, and often has nontraditional toppings such as corn, potato wedges, sweet potato, shrimp, or crab. Traditional Italian-style thin-crust pizza is served in the many Italian restaurants in Seoul and other major cities. \nNorth Korea's first pizzeria opened in its capital Pyongyang in 2009.\n\nPizza restaurants in Malaysia include Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Jom Pizza, and Sure Pizza.\n\nPizza is becoming more popular as a fast food in the urban areas of Nepal, particularly in the capital city, Kathmandu. There are a number of restaurants that serve pizzas in Kathmandu. With the opening of number of international pizza restaurants, the popularity as well as consumption has markedly increased in recent times.They are many types of pizza are there. Some are listed below\n1.mushroom pizza\n2.chicken pizza\n3. pane-er pizza\n\nThe first pizzerias opened in Karachi and Islamabad in the late 1980s, with Pappasallis serving pizza in Islamabad since 1990. Pizza has gained a measure of popularity in the eastern regions of Pakistan—namely, the provinces of Sindh, Punjab, and P.O.K, as well as the autonomous territory of Gilgit-Baltistan. Pizza has not penetrated into western Pakistan; of the remaining provinces and territories of Pakistan, only one (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) has seen much of the dish, in the form of a single Pizza Hut in Peshawar. Chicken Tikka and achari chicken pizzas are popular. In the regions where pizza is known, spicy chicken and sausage-based pizzas are also very popular, as they cater to the local palate.\n\nAuthentic Neapolitan pizzas (\"pizza napoletana\") are typically made with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. They can be made with ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius, and mozzarella di bufala Campana, made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild state (this mozzarella is protected with its own European protected designation of origin).\n\nAccording to the rules proposed by the \"Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana\", the genuine Neapolitan pizza dough consists of wheat flour (type \"0\" or \"00\", or a mixture of both), natural Neapolitan yeast or brewer's yeast, salt and water. For proper results, strong flour with high protein content (as used for bread-making rather than cakes) must be used. The dough must be kneaded by hand or with a low-speed mixer. After the rising process, the dough must be formed by hand without the help of a rolling pin or other machine, and may be no more than thick. The pizza must be baked for 60–90 seconds in a stone oven with an oak-wood fire. When cooked, it should be crispy, tender and fragrant. There are three official variants: \"pizza marinara\", which is made with tomato, garlic, oregano and extra virgin olive oil, \"pizza Margherita\", made with tomato, sliced mozzarella, basil and extra-virgin olive oil, and \"pizza Margherita extra\" made with tomato, mozzarella from Campania in fillets, basil and extra virgin olive oil. The pizza napoletana is a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (\"Specialità Tradizionale Garantita\", STG) product in Europe.\n\nPizza in Lazio (Rome), as well as in many other parts of Italy, is available in two different styles. Take-away shops sell \"pizza rustica\" or \"pizza al taglio\". This pizza is cooked in long, rectangular baking pans and relatively thick (1–2 cm). The pizza is often cooked in an electric oven. It is usually cut with scissors or a knife and sold by weight. In pizzerias, pizza is served in a dish in its traditional round shape. It has a thin, crisp base quite different from the thicker and softer Neapolitan style base. It is usually cooked in a wood-fired oven, giving the pizza its unique flavor and texture. In Rome, a \"pizza napoletana\" is topped with tomato, mozzarella, anchovies and oil (thus, what in Naples is called \"pizza romana\", in Rome is called \"pizza napoletana\"). Other types of Lazio-style pizza include\n\nPizza quattro stagioni is a popular style prepared with various ingredients in four sections, with each section representing a season of the year.\n\nPizza pugliese is prepared with tomato, mozzarella and onion.\n\nPizzetta a small pizza that can range in size from around three inches in diameter to the size of a small personal-sized pizza. It may be served as an hors d'oeuvre.\n\nSicilian pizza is prepared in a manner originating in Sicily, Italy. Just in the US, the phrase \"Sicilian pizza\" is often synonymous with thick-crust or deep-dish pizza derived from the Sicilian \"Sfincione\". In Sicily, there is a variety of pizza called \"Sfincione\". It is that believed Sicilian pizza, Sfincione, or focaccia with toppings, was popular on the western portion of the island as far back as the 1860s.\n\nThere was a bill before the Italian Parliament in 2002 to safeguard the \"traditional Italian pizza\", specifying permissible ingredients and methods of processing (e.g., excluding frozen pizzas). Only pizzas which followed these guidelines could be called \"traditional Italian pizzas\" in Italy. On 9 December 2009, the European Union, upon Italian request, granted Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) safeguard to traditional Neapolitan pizza, in particular to \"Margherita\" and \"Marinara\". The European Union enacted a protected designation of origin system in the 1990s.\n\nThe Maltese enjoy eating Italian style pizza and fast-food pizzas, as well as experimenting with various toppings, including local produce. One style of fast-food pizza is the typical \"pizza kwadra\" (square pizza), which is found in Pastizzi shops (\"pastizzeriji\"), a deep-pan pizza cut into squares, generally topped with either green olives (\"taż-żebbuġ\"), hard boiled egg and cocktail sausage (\"bajd u zalzett\"), or chicken and barbecue sauce (\"tat-tiġieġ\"). A typical \"Pizzerija\" restaurant will offer a vast number of different pizza recipes, mostly based on the Italian style ones. A typical menu would include:\n\n\nPizza has become a household dish. Nevertheless, the traditional Maltese pizza consists of a typical Maltese ftira covered in cheese (mainly local gbejna), onions and potatoes. In fact, it is most often known simply as \"ftira\" and is mainly sold on the island of Gozo. Different toppings can be added, including tuna, olives, anchovies, sundried tomatoes, and even traditional Maltese sausage.\n\nNorwegians eat the most pizza in the world according to a 2004 survey by ACNielsen 2004, 5,4 kg/year per capita. 50 million frozen pizzas were sold that year, with consumption being 22,000 tons of frozen pizza, 15,000 tons of home-baked and 13,000 tons of restaurant-made pizzas. By far the most popular is the frozen pizza Grandiosa, every other pizza sold, frozen or fresh is a Pizza Grandiosa. Since its start in 1980 the Grandiosa has been part of Norwegian modern culture and trends, going so far to be unofficial called \"The national dish of Norway\".\n\nNorway also has a traditional home-made pizza called \"lørdagspizza\" (literally translates to \"Saturday pizza\"). The dough is shaped to the pan (usually rectangular), then a mix of minced meat and tomato sauce follows. Finally it is gratinated with a generous amount of cheese.\n\nPizza arrived in Sweden with Italian guest workers and became popular around 1970. Swedish pizza is mainly of the Neapolitan type and most pizzerias in Sweden have Margherita, Capricciosa and Quattro Stagioni pizzas at the top of the menu, although with altered recipes. For example, a Swedish Margherita uses Swedish hard cheese instead of mozzarella and dried oregano instead of fresh basil. The Swedish pizza has been developed with lots of innovations and styles, creating a tradition distinct from the Italian one, although some names may overlap. Occasionally pizzerias offer \"Italian pizza\" imitating Italian recipes in addition to the Swedish ones.\n\nA typical Swedish pizzeria offers 40-50 different named varieties on the menu, even up to 100, and personal modifications are allowed. Also, many pizzerias also serve salads, lasagne, kebab and hamburgers, especially if there is a facility to sit and eat. Italian style restaurants often combine a restaurant menu with a pizza menu.\n\nSome popular varieties common in most of Sweden, mostly with the same name, all having tomato sauce and cheese to start with and additional toppings:\n\nPerhaps the most extreme pizza sort heard of in Sweden is the Calskrove or Calzskrove (a portmanteau of calzone and \"skrovmål\" meaning \"big meal\" but also Northern slang for \"hamburger meal\"), sold at some pizzerias in northern Sweden, a complete meal of a 150 or 250 grams hamburger with bread and all regular toppings, and chips (french fries), baked into a regular Calzone with ham as well.\n\nOne of the most popular types of pizza in Sweden since the 1990s is kebab-pizza, and a song in the Swedish Melodifestivalen 2008 was \"Kebabpizza slivovitza\". The invention is most likely the result of the common tendency of pizza bakers to create their own flagship compositions and novel flavors, using whatever might be available in their kitchen. In recent years one can find pizza with fresh lettuce or chips (French fries) put on top after baking. The amount of topping compared to the crust is rather high by international standards.\n\nThe typical side order with Swedish pizza is a free \"pizza salad\". 1969 Giuseppe \"Peppino\" Sperandio opened \"Pizzeria Piazza Opera\", one of the first restaurants only serving pizza in Stockholm, Sweden. Sperandio was born in northeast Italy where a cabbage salad called \"kupus salata\" was a very common dish, from bordering country Croatia. This salad from his childhood, was offered as a free side dish. Eaten, while waiting for the pizza to be baked. Sperandio became Stockholm's pizza king and had during his hey day more than 30 pizza restaurants. Today this Balkan salad (renamed to pizza salad), is as Swedish as the Dala horse.\nThe pizza salad is made with shredded cabbage, coarse pepper and sometimes red bell pepper, slightly pickled (fermented) in vinaigrette for a few days.\n\nIn general, Swedish pizzerias are private enterprises and not franchise, often owned as a family business by immigrants, but very seldom Italians. Of international restaurant chains only Pizza Hut is well established, although Vapiano has a few restaurants in Stockholm and Domino's have been trying to establish itself in southern Sweden since 2008. Many pizzerias offer affordable (about 1-2 € total, or free with large order) home delivery in less than 30 minutes and many are connected to an on-line ordering service. The take-away price of one standard size (30 cm) pizza is 5 to 8 € depending on topping, about the double for a \"family pizza\" of double size (weight), and about the half for a \"children's pizza\" (mostly served in restaurants). Pizza has become a staple food in Sweden (1,1 kg/year), although most people prepare their own food, as home cooking skills generally are good, and is largely considered as an acceptable occasional fast food alternative to a proper meal.\n\nSince the 1980s, a wide variety of pizzas ranging from fairly authentic Italian to American style to the mass-processed varieties are widely available and pizzas are also commonly made at home with children using local substitutions such as bacon for prosciutto and cheddar for mozzarella. Dough bases vary widely from homemade scone doughs to thin Roman-style and thick American stuffed-crust types. The typical British high-street now has a variety of international Italian- and American-style pizza chains, including homegrown chains PizzaExpress, Strada and Prezzo as well as Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's alongside much more authentic independent Italian-run restaurants with wood-fired ovens particularly in large cities such as London. Unique spicy varieties enjoy some popularity, including Chicken tikka masala or other curry toppings, chilli pizzas and a typical mid-range restaurant or takeaway will usually have versions of such standard \"Italian-American\" combinations as 'Hawaiian' (ham and pineapple); 'Peperroni' (spicy salami) and 'Meat Feast' (a mix of meats and salami) and a 'Vegeteriana' options. Non-Italian varieties are common too, for example, lahmacun called 'Turkish pizzas', or Alsatian 'Flammkuchen'. In some parts of Scotland you can get a deep-fried pizza from Fish and Chip shops. A frozen pizza, whole or half, dipped in batter and deep fried. It is usually served with in the same manner as any other fried item from these shops.\n\nIceland has all of the typical pizza toppings you would expect like pepperoni and sausage but also have some unique ones. A pizza topping that is found in Iceland that may not be found elsewhere, except Sweden, would be bananas. Bananas are used as toppings across the country showing how they have created their own version of an Italian classic.\n\nMany Israeli and American pizza stores and chains, including Pizza Hut and Sbarro, have both kosher and non-kosher locations. Kosher locations either have no meat or use imitation meat because of the Jewish religious dietary prohibition against mixing meat with dairy products, such as cheese. Kosher pizza locations must also close during the holiday of Passover, when no leavened bread is allowed in kosher locations. Some Israeli pizza differs from pizza in other countries because of the very large portions of vegetable toppings such as mushrooms or onions, and some unusual toppings, like corn or labane, and middle-Eastern spices, such as za'atar. Like most foods in Israel, pizza choices reflect multiple cultures.\n\nPizza establishments in Turkey are a mixture of local restaurants, local chains (e.g. Pizza Max), and international chains like Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza, Little Caesars, and Sbarro. While most combinations of toppings reflect common ingredients found in the US and Italy, there are additional ingredients available that cater to traditional tastes as well, such as minced beef, spicy Sucuk sausage, cured meats like Pastırma, cheeses like Kaşar and Beyaz, and local olives and herbs. With the exception of some restaurants, pork products like ham and bacon are not available, which are substituted with beef, chicken, or lamb equivalents.\n\nPizza has several equivalent or similar dishes in traditional Turkish cuisine, such as Black-Sea-style or Bafra-style Pide and Lahmacun, which adds to the popularity of the dish across Turkey.\n\nMexican pizza is a pizza made with ingredients typical of Mexican cuisine. The usual toppings that can be found throughout Mexico are chorizo, jalapeño pepper slices, grilled or fried onions, tomato, chile, shrimp, avocado, and sometimes beef, bell peppers, tripas or scallop. This pizza has the usual marinara sauce or white sauce and mozzarella cheese. Variations, substituting pepper jack cheese or Oaxaca cheese for mozzarella, are also popular.\n\nIn 1905, the first pizza establishment in the United States was opened in New York's Little Italy. Due to the influx of Italian immigrants, the U.S. has developed regional forms of pizza, some bearing only a casual resemblance to the Italian original. Chicago has its own style of a deep-dish pizza and New York City's style of pizza are well-known. New York-style pizza refers to the thin crust pizza popular in the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Philadelphia provides sauce on top of the cheese; St. Louis and other Midwest pizzas use thin crusts and rectangular slices in its local pizzas. Detroit-style pizza is a square pizza that has a thick deep-dish crisp crust, and is generally served with the sauce on top of the cheese. The square shape is the result of an early tradition of using metal trays originally meant to hold small parts in factories. The jumbo slice is an oversized New York-style pizza sold by the slice to go, especially in the Adams Morgan neighborhood in Washington, D.C. The white clam pie is a pizza variety that originated at the Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nCanada features many of the large pizza chains found in the United States, but with regional variations resulting from influences of local Canadian cuisine.\n\nThe \"Canadian pizza\" toppings typically include tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, bacon, pepperoni, and mushrooms; variations exist.); this recipe is also known internationally by that name. The typical preparation of the same recipe is often referred to in Québécois as \"pizza québécoise\".\n\nPoutine pizza is one variety that can be found sporadically across the country, and adaptations of this item have even been featured in upscale restaurants.\n\nAtlantic Canada has several unique varieties, which have spread to other parts of the country as people migrate for work. Donair pizza is inspired by the Halifax fast food of the same name, and is topped with mozzarella cheese, spiced & roasted ground beef, tomatoes, onions, and a sweetened condensed milk-based donair sauce. Garlic fingers is an Atlantic Canadian pizza garnished with melted butter, garlic, cheese, and sometimes bacon, with the round sliced into fingers and served with donair sauce. Pictou County Pizza is a variant of pizza unique to Pictou County in Nova Scotia; this pizza has a \"brown sauce\" made from vegetables and spices instead of red tomato sauce. \n\nToronto-style pizza, is a medium-thick crust margarita pizza topped with garlic and basil oil topping, a fusion of an Italian-type pizza and the Vietnamese traditions of using herbed oil toppings.\n\nThe predominantly francophone Canadian province of Quebec has its specialties. One is the \"all dressed\": tomato sauce (a little spicy), pepperoni, onions, green pepper slices, and mushrooms.\nThe poutine pizza variety is topped with French fries, light gravy, and fresh mozarella curds.\n\nAccording to a number of news outlets, the Hawaiian-style (tomato sauce, ham and pineapple) is a Canadian invention, originating at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario. Sam Panopoulos, owner of Satellite, first concocted the Hawaiian pizza in 1962 . By that time Satellite had already started serving Chinese food and Panopoulos thought people would like a similar sweet and savoury flavours together so he took a can of pineapple and tossed the fruit onto a pizza.\n\nThe usual Italian varieties are available, though more common is the style popular in the U.S., with more and richer toppings than Italian style. A common unique type is the Aussie, Australian or Australiana, which has the usual tomato base or a seasoned base and mozzarella cheese with options of chicken, ham, bacon and egg (seen as quintessentially Australian breakfast fare). Pizzas with seafood such as prawns are also popular. In the 1980s some Australian pizza shops and restaurants began selling \"gourmet pizzas\", that is, pizzas with more expensive ingredients such as salmon, dill, bocconcini, tiger prawns, or unconventional toppings such as kangaroo meat, emu and crocodile. \"Wood-fired pizzas\", that is, those cooked in a ceramic oven heated by wood fuel, are well-regarded.\n\nFranchised chains coexists with independent pizzerias, Middle-Eastern bakeries and kebabs shops.\n\nNew Zealand's first dedicated pizza outlet was opened by Pizza Hut in New Lynn in 1974, with Dominos following. One notable indigenous chain is Hell Pizza established in 1996 - which now has outlets worldwide - distinguishing itself by often-controversial marketing and using only free-range ingredients. Independent restaurants are common.\n\nNew Zealand has no rules for pizza construction, leading to an eclectic and varied approach to toppings. Gourmet and \"wild\" ingredients are often used, and New Zealanders are apt to push the boundaries of what a pizza can be.\n\nStandard Argentine pizza has a thicker crust than traditional Italian style pizza and includes more cheese. Pizza is made with very thin, and sometimes thick, high-rising doughs, with or without cheese, cooked in the oven or \"a la piedra\" (on a stone oven), and stuffed with numerous ingredients -— is a dish which can be found in nearly every corner of the country. Buenos Aires, Rosario, and Córdoba also serve it with fainá, which is a chick pea-flour dough placed over the piece of pizza. People say that what makes the Argentine pizza unique is the blending of Italian and Spanish cultures. At the turn of the 19th century, immigrants from Naples and Genoa opened the first pizza bars, though Spanish residents subsequently owned most of the pizza businesses.\nAnother very popular kind is the fugazza, which consists in a regular pizza crust topped with onions, ground black pepper, olive oil and mozzarella cheese (in this case it is called fugazzeta).\n\nSão Paulo has 6,000 pizza establishments and 1.4 million pizzas are consumed daily. It is said that the first Brazilian pizzas were baked in the Brás district of São Paulo in the late part of the 19th century. Until the 1940s, almost only found in the Italian communities around the country. Since then, pizza became increasingly popular among the rest of the population. The most traditional pizzerias are still found in the Italian neighborhoods, such as Bexiga (official name: Bela Vista). Both Neapolitan (thick crust) and Roman (thin crust) varieties are common in Brazil, with traditional versions using tomato sauce and mozzarella as a base. Brazilian pizza in general, though, tends to have less tomato sauce than the authentic (Italian) pizza, or uses slices of tomato in place of sauce. Brazilian pizzerias offer also Brazilian variants such as \"pizza com catupiry\". July 10 is \"Pizza Day\" in São Paulo, marking the final day of an annual competition among \"pizzaiolos\". In Brazil, pizza quatro queijos (\"pizza quattro formaggi\") uses mozzarella, provolone, parmesan and gorgonzola, and there is also a variety with five cheeses, which adds catupiry.\n\n\"Hawaiian pizza\" is popular in Colombia. The pizza is topped with ham and pineapple.\n\n",
                "Italian cuisine\n\nItalian cuisine is food typical from Italy. It has developed through centuries of social and economic changes, with roots stretching to antiquity.\n\nSignificant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, maize and sugar beet, this last introduced in quantity in the 18th century. Italian cuisine is known for its regional diversity, especially between the north and the south of the Italian peninsula. It offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied in the world. It influenced several cuisines around the world chiefly that of the United States.\n\nItalian cuisine is characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation. Ingredients and dishes vary by region. Many dishes that were once regional, have proliferated with variations throughout the country.\n\nPasta, vegetables, olive oil and fish are a major part of the Italian cuisine. Italian cuisine is probably the most important expression of the Mediterranean diet.\n\nItalian cuisine has developed over the centuries. Although the country known as Italy did not unite until the 19th century, the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BCE. Food and culture was very important at that time as we can see from the cookbook (Apicius) which dates back to first century BC. Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval and the discovery of the New World have influenced its development. Italian food started to form after the fall of the Roman Empire, when different cities began to separate and form their own traditions. Many different types of bread and pasta were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. For example, the north of Italy (Milan) is known for its risottos, the central/middle of the country (Bologna) is known for its tortellini and the south (Naples) is famous for its pizzas and spaghettis.\n\nThe first known Italian food writer was a Greek Sicilian named Archestratus from Syracuse in the 4th century BCE. He wrote a poem that spoke of using \"top quality and seasonal\" ingredients. He said that flavors should not be masked by spices, herbs or other seasonings. He placed importance on simple preparation of fish.\n\nSimplicity was abandoned and replaced by a culture of gastronomy as the Roman Empire developed. By the time \"De re coquinaria\" was published in the 1st century CE, it contained 470 recipes calling for heavy use of spices and herbs. The Romans employed Greek bakers to produce breads and imported cheeses from Sicily as the Sicilians had a reputation as the best cheesemakers. The Romans reared goats for butchering, and grew artichokes and leeks.\n\nWith culinary traditions from Rome and Athens, a cuisine developed in Sicily that some consider the first real Italian cuisine. Arabs invaded Sicily in the 9th century, introducing spinach, almonds, and rice. During the 12th century, a Norman king surveyed Sicily and saw people making long strings made from flour and water called \"atriya\", which eventually became \"trii\", a term still used for spaghetti in southern Italy. Normans also introduced casseroles, salt cod (baccalà) and stockfish, which remain popular.\n\nFood preservation was either chemical or physical, as refrigeration did not exist. Meats and fish would be smoked, dried or kept on ice. Brine and salt were used to pickle items such as herring, and to cure pork. Root vegetables were preserved in brine after they had been parboiled. Other means of preservation included oil, vinegar or immersing meat in congealed, rendered fat. For preserving fruits, liquor, honey and sugar were used.\n\nThe northern Italian regions show a mix of Germanic and Roman culture while the south reflects Arab influence, as much Mediterranean cuisine was spread by Arab trade. The oldest Italian book on cuisine is the 13th century \"Liber de coquina\" written in Naples. Dishes include \"Roman-style\" cabbage (\"ad usum romanorum\"), \"ad usum campanie\" which were \"small leaves\" prepared in the \"Campanian manner\", a bean dish from the Marca di Trevisio, a \"torta\", \"compositum londardicum\" which are similar to dishes prepared today. Two other books from the 14th century include recipes for Roman \"pastello\", Lasagna pie, and call for the use of salt from Sardinia or Chioggia.\nIn the 15th century, Maestro Martino was chef to the Patriarch of Aquileia at the Vatican. His \"Libro de arte coquinaria\" describes a more refined and elegant cuisine. His book contains a recipe for \"Maccaroni Siciliani\", made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod to dry in the sun. The macaroni was cooked in capon stock flavored with saffron, displaying Persian influences. Of particular note is Martino's avoidance of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs. The Roman recipes include \"coppiette\" (air-dried salami) and cabbage dishes. His Florentine dishes include eggs with \"Bolognese torta\", \"Sienese torta\" and Genoese recipes such as \"piperata\" (sweets), macaroni, squash, mushrooms, and spinach pie with onions.\n\nMartino's text was included in a 1475 book by Bartolomeo Platina printed in Venice entitled \"De honesta voluptate et valetudine\" (\"On Honest Pleasure and Good Health\"). Platina puts Martino's \"Libro\" in regional context, writing about perch from Lake Maggiore, sardines from Lake Garda, grayling from Adda, hens from Padua, olives from Bologna and Piceno, turbot from Ravenna, rudd from Lake Trasimeno, carrots from Viterbo, bass from the Tiber, \"roviglioni\" and shad from Lake Albano, snails from Rieti, figs from Tuscolo, grapes from Narni, oil from Cassino, oranges from Naples and eels from Campania. Grains from Lombardy and Campania are mentioned as is honey from Sicily and Taranto. Wine from the Ligurian coast, Greco from Tuscany and San Severino and Trebbiano from Tuscany and Piceno are also in the book.\n\nThe courts of Florence, Rome, Venice and Ferrara were central to the cuisine. Cristoforo di Messisbugo, steward to Ippolito d'Este, published \"Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande\" in 1549. Messisbugo gives recipes for pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work emphasizes the use of Eastern spices and sugar.\nIn 1570, Bartolomeo Scappi, personal chef to Pope Pius V, wrote his \"Opera\" in five volumes, giving a comprehensive view of Italian cooking of that period. It contains over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. This book differs from most books written for the royal courts in its preference for domestic animals and courtyard birds rather than game.\n\nRecipes include lesser cuts of meats such as tongue, head and shoulder. The third volume has recipes for fish in Lent. These fish recipes are simple, including poaching, broiling, grilling and frying after marination.\n\nParticular attention is given to seasons and places where fish should be caught. The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters and a recipe for a sweet Neapolitan pizza (not the current savory version, as tomatoes had not been introduced to Italy). However, such items from the New World as corn (maize) and turkey are included.\n\nIn the first decade of the 17th century, Giangiacomo Castelvetro wrote \"Breve Racconto di Tutte le Radici di Tutte l'Herbe et di Tutti i Frutti\" (\"A Brief Account of All Roots, Herbs and Fruit\"), translated into English by Gillian Riley. Originally from Modena, Castelvetro moved to England because he was a Protestant. The book has a list of Italian vegetables and fruits and their preparation. He featured vegetables as a central part of the meal, not just accompaniments.\n\nHe favored simmering vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, lemon juice or verjus or orange juice. He also suggests roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with hop shoots in the spring and truffles in the winter, detailing the use of pigs in the search for truffles.\nIn 1662, Bartolomeo Stefani, chef to the Duchy of Mantua, published \"L'Arte di Ben Cucinare\". He was the first to offer a section on \"vitto ordinario\" (\"ordinary food\"). The book described a banquet given by Duke Charles for Queen Christina of Sweden, with details of the food and table settings for each guest, including a knife, fork, spoon, glass, a plate (instead of the bowls more often used) and a napkin.\n\nOther books from this time, such as \"Galatheo\" by Giovanni della Casa, tell how \"scalci\" (\"waiters\") should manage themselves while serving their guests. Waiters should not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, or spit, sniff, cough or sneeze while serving diners. The book also told diners not to use their fingers while eating and not to wipe sweat with their napkin.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Italian culinary books began to emphasize the regionalism of Italian cuisine rather than French cuisine. Books written then were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to bourgeois housewives. Periodicals in booklet form such as \"La cuoca cremonese\" (\"The Cook of Cremona\") in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity and frequency.\n\nIn the 18th century, medical texts warned peasants against eating refined foods as it was believed that these were poor for their digestion and their bodies required heavy meals. It was believed by some that peasants ate poorly because they preferred eating poorly. However, many peasants had to eat rotten food and moldy bread because that was all they could afford.\n\nIn 1779, Antonio Nebbia from Macerata in the Marche region, wrote \"Il Cuoco Maceratese\" (\"The Cook of Macerata\"). Nebbia addressed the importance of local vegetables and pasta, rice and gnocchi. For stock, he preferred vegetables and chicken over other meats.\n\nIn 1773, the Neapolitan Vincenzo Corrado's \"Il Cuoco Galante\" (\"The Courteous Cook\") gave particular emphasis to \"Vitto Pitagorico\" (vegetarian food). \"Pythagorean food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because Pythagoras, as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious.\" This book was the first to give the tomato a central role with thirteen recipes.\n\"Zuppa alli Pomidoro\" in Corrado's book is a dish similar to today's Tuscan pappa al pomodoro. Corrado's 1798 edition introduced a \"Treatise on the Potato\" after the French Antoine-Augustin Parmentier's successful promotion of it. In 1790, Francesco Leonardi in his book \"L'Apicio moderno\" (\"Modern Apicius\") sketches a history of the Italian Cuisine from the Roman Age and gives as first a recipe of a tomato based sauce.\n\nIn the 19th century, Giovanni Vialardi, chef to King Victor Emmanuel, wrote \"A Treatise of Modern Cookery and Patisserie\" with recipes \"suitable for a modest household\". Many of his recipes are for regional dishes from Turin including twelve for potatoes such as \"Genoese Cappon Magro\". In 1829, \"Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico\" by Giovanni Felice Luraschi features Milanese dishes such as Kidney with Anchovies and Lemon and Gnocchi alla Romana. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto's \"La Cucina Genovese\" in 1871 addressed the cuisine of Liguria. This book contained the first recipe for pesto. \"La Cucina Teorico-Pratica\" written by Ippolito Cavalcanti has the first recipe for pasta with tomatoes.\n\n\"La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiare bene\" (\"The Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well\"), by Pellegrino Artusi, first published in 1891, is widely regarded as the canon of classic modern Italian cuisine, and it is still in print. Its recipes come mainly from Romagna and Tuscany, where he lived.\n\nItalian cuisine has a great variety of different ingredients which are commonly used, ranging from fruits, vegetables, sauces, meats, etc. In the North of Italy, fish (such as cod, or baccalà), potatoes, rice, corn (maize), sausages, pork, and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients. Pasta dishes with use of tomato are spread in all Italy. Italians like their ingredients fresh and subtly seasoned and spiced.\n\nIn Northern Italy though there are many kinds of stuffed pasta, polenta and risotto are equally popular if not more so. Ligurian ingredients include several types of fish and seafood dishes; basil (found in pesto), nuts and olive oil are very common. In Emilia-Romagna, common ingredients include ham (prosciutto), sausage (cotechino), different sorts of salami, truffles, grana, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and tomatoes (Bolognese sauce or ragù).\nTraditional Central Italian cuisine uses ingredients such as tomatoes, all kinds of meat, fish, and pecorino cheese. In Tuscany pasta (especially pappardelle) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat). Finally, in Southern Italy, tomatoes – fresh or cooked into tomato sauce – peppers, olives and olive oil, garlic, artichokes, oranges, ricotta cheese, eggplants, zucchini, certain types of fish (anchovies, sardines and tuna), and capers are important components to the local cuisine.\n\nItalian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths and shapes. Distinguished on shapes they are named—penne, maccheroni, spaghetti, linguine, fusilli, lasagne and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like ravioli and tortellini.\n\nThe word pasta is also used to refer to dishes in which pasta products are a primary ingredient. It is usually served with sauce. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names.\n\nExamples include spaghetti (thin rods), rigatoni (tubes or cylinders), fusilli (swirls), and lasagne (sheets). Dumplings, like gnocchi (made with potatoes or pumpkin) and noodles like spätzle, are sometimes considered pasta. They are both traditional in parts of Italy.\n\nPasta is categorized in two basic styles: dried and fresh. Dried pasta made without eggs can be stored for up to two years under ideal conditions, while fresh pasta will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Pasta is generally cooked by boiling. Under Italian law, dry pasta (pasta secca) can only be made from durum wheat flour or durum wheat semolina, and is more commonly used in Southern Italy compared to their Northern counterparts, who traditionally prefer the fresh egg variety.\n\nDurum flour and durum semolina have a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked \"al dente\" (Italian: \"firm to the bite\", meaning not too soft). Outside Italy, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour, but this yields a softer product that cannot be cooked al dente. There are many types of wheat flour with varying gluten and protein levels depending on variety of grain used.\n\nParticular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and milling methods to make the flour, as specified by law. Some pasta varieties, such as pizzoccheri, are made from buckwheat flour. Fresh pasta may include eggs (pasta all'uovo 'egg pasta'). Whole wheat pasta has become increasingly popular because of its supposed health benefits over pasta made from refined flour.\n\nEach area has its own specialties, primarily at a regional level, but also at provincial level. The differences can come from a bordering country (such as France or Austria), whether a region is close to the sea or the mountains, and economics. Italian cuisine is also seasonal with priority placed on the use of fresh produce.\n\nPasta, meat and vegetables are central to the cuisine of Abruzzo and Molise. Chili peppers (\"peperoncini\") are typical of Abruzzo, where they are called \"diavoletti\" (\"little devils\") for their spicy heat. Due to the long history of shepherding in Abruzzo and Molise, lamb dishes are common. Lamb is often used with pasta. Mushrooms (usually wild mushrooms), rosemary, and garlic are also extensively used in Abruzzese cuisine.\n\nBest-known is the extra virgin olive oil produced in the local farms on the hills of the region, marked by the quality level DOP and considered one of the best in the country. Renowned wines like Montepulciano DOCG and Trebbiano d'Abruzzo DOC are considered amongst the world’s finest wines. In 2012 a bottle of Trebbiano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane ranked #1 in the top 50 Italian wine award. \"Centerbe\" (\"Hundred Herbs\") is a strong (72% alcohol), spicy herbal liqueur drunk by the locals. Another liqueur is \"genziana\", a soft distillate of gentian roots.\n\nThe best-known dish from Abruzzo is \"arrosticini\", little pieces of castrated lamb on a wooden stick and cooked on coals. The \"\" (literally \"guitar\") is a fine stringed tool that pasta dough is pressed through for cutting. In the province of Teramo, famous local dishes include the \"virtù\" soup (made with legumes, vegetables and pork meat); the \"timballo\" (pasta sheets filled with meat, vegetables or rice); and the \"\" (lamb intestines filled with garlic, marjoram, lettuce, and various spices). The popularity of saffron, grown in the province of L'Aquila, has waned in recent years. The most famous dish of Molise is \"cavatelli\", a long shaped, handmade \"maccheroni\"-type pasta made of flour, semolina and water, often served with meat sauce, broccoli or mushrooms. Pizzelle cookies are a common dessert, especially around Christmas.\n\nThe cuisine of Basilicata is mostly based on inexpensive ingredients and deeply anchored in rural traditions.\n\nPork is an integral part of the regional cuisine, often made into sausages or roasted on a spit. Famous dry sausages from the region are lucanica and soppressata. Wild boar, mutton and lamb are also popular. Pasta sauces are generally based on meats or vegetables. Spicy peperoncini is largely used, as well as the so-called \"peperoni cruschi\" (crunchy peppers). The region produces cheeses like the Pecorino di Filiano PDO, Canestrato di Moliterno PGI, Pallone di Gravina and Paddraccio and olive oils like the Vulture PDO.\n\nBasilicata is known for spaghetti-like pasta \"troccoli\" and \"capunti\", a thick and short oval pasta whose shape is often compared to that of an open empty pea pod. \"Capunti\" are usually served with a hearty vegetable tomato sauce or various meat sauces.\n\nAmong the traditional dishes are \"lagane e ceci\", also known as \"piatto del brigante\" (brigand's dish), pasta prepared with chick peas and peeled tomatoes; \"rafanata\", a type of omelette with horseradish; \"ciaudedda\", a vegetable stew with artichokes, potatoes, broad beans and pancetta; and the \"baccalà alla lucana\", one of the few recipes made with fish. Desserts include \"taralli dolci\", made with sugar glaze and scented with anise; and \"calzoncelli\", fried pastries filled with a cream of chestnuts and chocolate.\n\nThe most famous wine of the region is the Aglianico del Vulture DOCG, others include Matera DOC, Terre dell'Alta Val d'Agri and Grottino di Roccanova.\n\nBasilicata is also known for its mineral waters which are sold widely in Italy. The springs are mostly located in the volcanic basin of the Vulture area.\n\nIn Calabria, a history of French rule under the House of Anjou and Napoleon, along with Spanish influence, affected the language and culinary skills as seen in the naming of things such as cake, \"gatò\", from the French \"gateau\". Seafood includes swordfish, shrimp, lobster, sea urchin and squid. Macaroni-type pasta is widely used in regional dishes, often served with goat, beef or pork sauce and salty \"ricotta\".\n\nMain courses include \"Frìttuli\" (prepared by boiling pork rind, meat and trimmings in pork fat), different varieties of spicy sausages (like Nduja and Capicola), goat and land snails. Melon and watermelon are traditionally served in a chilled fruit salad or wrapped in ham. Calabrian wines include Greco di Bianco, Bivongi, Cirò, Dominici, Lamezia, Melissa, Pollino, Sant'Anna di Isola Capo Rizzuto, San Vito di Luzzi, Savuto, Scavigna, Verbicaro.\n\nAnother famous dish that has a Calabrese background is its famous Calabrese pizza. This pizza has a Neapolitan-based structure with fresh tomato sauce and a cheese base. However, what makes this type of pizza unique from others is its spicy, but rather tasty flavor. Some of the ingredients included in a Calabrese pizza are: thinly sliced hot soppressata, hot capicola, hot peppers and fresh mozzarella. A Calabrese style pizza has become a well known menu item in many Italian restaurants around the world.\n\nCampania extensively produces tomatoes, peppers, spring onions, potatoes, artichokes, fennel, lemons and oranges which all take on the flavor of volcanic soil. The Gulf of Naples offers fish and seafood. Campania is one of the largest producers and consumers of pasta in Italy, especially spaghetti. In the regional cuisine, pasta is prepared in various styles that can feature tomato sauce, cheese, clams and shellfish.\n\n\"Spaghetti alla puttanesca\" is a popular dish made with olives, tomatoes, anchovies, capers, chili peppers and garlic. The region is well-known also for its \"mozzarella\" production (especially from the milk of water buffalo) that's used in a variety of dishes, including \"parmigiana\" (shallow fried eggplant slices layered with cheese and tomato sauce, then baked). Desserts include \"struffoli\" (deep fried balls of dough) \"ricotta\"-based \"pastiera\" and \"sfogliatelle\", and rum-dipped \"babà\".\n\nOriginating in Neapolitan cuisine, pizza has become popular in many different parts of the world. Pizza is an oven-baked, flat, disc-shaped bread typically topped with a tomato sauce, cheese (usually mozzarella) and various toppings depending on the culture. Since the original pizza, several other types of pizzas have evolved.\n\nSince Naples was the capital of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, its cuisine took much from the culinary traditions of all the Campania region, reaching a balance between dishes based on rural ingredients (pasta, vegetables, cheese) and seafood dishes (fish, crustaceans, mollusks). A vast variety of recipes is influenced by the local aristocratic cuisine, like \"timballo\" and the \"\", pasta or rice dishes with very elaborate preparation, while the dishes coming from the popular traditions contain inexpensive but nutritionally healthy ingredients, like pasta with beans and other pasta dishes with vegetables.\n\nFamous regional wines are Aglianico (Taurasi), Fiano, Falanghina, and Greco di Tufo.\n\nEmilia-Romagna is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour. The Romagna subregion is known as well for pasta dishes like \"cappelletti\", \"garganelli\", \"strozzapreti\", \"sfoglia lorda\" and \"tortelli alla lastra\" or very peculiar cheese like , piada snacks are famous worldwide.\n\nIn the Emilia subregion, except Piacenza which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of Lombardy, rice is eaten to a lesser extent. \"Polenta\", a maize-based dish, is common both in Emilia and Romagna.\nBologna and Modena are notable for pasta dishes like \"tortellini\", \"lasagne\", gramigna and \"tagliatelle\" which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations. The celebrated balsamic vinegar is made only in the Emilian cities of Modena and Reggio Emilia, following legally binding traditional procedures. Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while Grana Padano variety is produced in Piacenza.\n\nAlthough the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area (well known for its eels and clams), the region is more famous for its meat products, especially pork-based, that include: Parma's \"prosciutto\", \"culatello\" and \"Felino salami\", Piacenza's \"pancetta\", \"coppa\" and salami, Bologna's \"mortadella\" and \"salame rosa\", Modena's \"zampone\", \"cotechino\" and \"\" and Ferrara's \"\". Piacenza is also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include \"zuppa inglese\" (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and Alchermes liqueur) and \"panpepato\" (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds).\n\nFriuli-Venezia Giulia conserved, in its cuisine, the historical links with Austria-Hungary. Udine and Pordenone, in the western part of Friuli, are known for their traditional San Daniele del Friuli ham, Montasio cheese, and Frico cheese. Other typical dishes are \"pitina\" (meatballs made of smoked meats), game, and various types of \"gnocchi\" and \"polenta\".\n\nThe majority of the eastern regional dishes are heavily influenced by Austrian, Hungarian, Slovene and Croatian cuisines: typical dishes include Istrian Stew (soup of beans, sauerkraut, potatoes, bacon and spare ribs), Vienna sausages, \"goulash\", \"ćevapi\", apple strudel, \"gugelhupf\". Pork can be spicy and is often prepared over an open hearth called a \"fogolar\". Collio Goriziano, Friuli Isonzo, Colli Orientali del Friuli and Ramandolo are well-known DOC regional wines.\n\nLiguria is known for herbs and vegetables (as well as seafood) in its cuisine. Savory pies are popular, mixing greens and artichokes along with cheeses, milk curds and eggs. Onions and olive oil are used. Because of a lack of land suitable for wheat, the Ligurians use chickpeas in \"farinata\" and polenta-like \"panissa\". The former is served plain or topped with onions, artichokes, sausage, cheese or young anchovies.\n\nHilly districts use chestnuts as a source of carbohydrates. Ligurian pastas include \"corzetti\" from the Polcevera valley, \"pansoti\", a triangular shaped ravioli filled with vegetables, \"piccagge\", pasta ribbons made with a small amount of egg and served with artichoke sauce or \"pesto\" sauce, \"trenette\", made from whole wheat flour cut into long strips and served with pesto, boiled beans and potatoes, and \"trofie\", a Ligurian \"gnocchi\" made from whole grain flour and boiled potatoes, made into a spiral shape and often tossed in \"pesto\". Many Ligurians emigrated to Argentina in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influencing the cuisine of this country (which otherwise dominated by meat and dairy products which the narrow Ligurian hinterland would have not allowed).\n\nPasta dishes based on the use of \"guanciale\" (unsmoked bacon prepared with pig's jowl or cheeks) are often found in Lazio, such as pasta \"alla carbonara\", and pasta \"all'amatriciana\". Another pasta dish of the region is \"arrabbiata\", with spicy tomato sauce. The regional cuisine widely use offal, resulting in dishes like the entrail-based \"rigatoni\" with \"pajata\" sauce and \"coda alla vaccinara\".\n\nIconic of Lazio is cheese made from ewes' milk (Pecorino Romano), \"porchetta\" (savory, fatty, and moist boneless pork roast) and Frascati white wine. The influence of the ancient Jewish community can be noticed in the Roman cuisine's traditional \"carciofi alla giudia\".\n\nThe regional cuisine of Lombardy is heavily based upon ingredients like maize, rice, beef, pork, butter, and lard. Rice dishes are very popular in this region, often found in soups as well as \"risotto\". The best-known version is \"risotto alla milanese\", flavoured with saffron and typically served with many typical Milanese main courses, such as \"ossobuco alla milanese\" (cross-cut veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth) and \"cotoletta alla milanese\" (a fried cutlet similar to Wiener schnitzel, but cooked \"bone-in\").\n\nOther regional specialities include \"cassoeula\" (a typical winter dish prepared with cabbage and pork), Cremona's Mostarda (rich condiment made with candied fruit and a mustard flavoured syrup), Valtellina's Bresaola (air-dried salted beef) and Pizzoccheri (a flat ribbon pasta, made with 80% buckwheat flour and 20% wheat flour cooked along with greens, cubed potatoes and layered with pieces of Valtellina Casera cheese) and Mantua's \"tortelli di zucca\" (\"ravioli\" with pumpkin filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by turkey stuffed with chicken or other stewed meats.\nRegional cheeses include Robiola, Crescenza, Taleggio, Gorgonzola and Grana Padano (the plains of central and southern Lombardy allow intensive cattle-raising). \"Polenta\" is generally common across the region. Regional desserts include the famous \"panettone\" Christmas cake (sweet bread with candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as raisins, which are added dry and not soaked).\n\nOn the coast of Marche, fish and seafood are produced. Inland, wild and domestic pigs are used for sausages and hams. These hams are not thinly sliced, but cut into bite-sized chunks. Suckling pig, chicken and fish are often stuffed with rosemary or fennel fronds and garlic before being roasted or placed on the spit.\n\nAscoli, Marche's southernmost province, is well known for \"Olive all'ascolana\", (stoned olives stuffed with several minced meats, egg and Parmesan, then fried). Another well-known Marche product are the \"\", from little town of Campofilone, a kind of hand-made pasta made only of hard grain flour and eggs, cut so thin that melts in the mouth.\n\nBetween the Alps and the Po valley, with a large number of different ecosystems, this region offers the most refined and varied cuisine of the Italian peninsula. Point of union of traditional Italian and French cuisine, Piedmont is the Italian region with the largest number of cheeses Protected Geographical Status and wines Denominazione di origine controllata. It is also the region where both Slow Food association and the most prestigious school of Italian cooking, the University of Gastronomic Sciences, were founded.\n\nPiedmont is a region where gathering nuts, mushrooms, cardoons and hunting and fishing takes place. Truffles, garlic, seasonal vegetables, cheese and rice are all used. Wines from the Nebbiolo grape such as Barolo and Barbaresco are produced as well as wines from the Barbera grape, fine sparkling wines, and the sweet, lightly sparkling, Moscato d'Asti. The region is also famous for its Vermouth and Ratafia production.\n\nCastelmagno is a prized cheese of the region. Piedmont is also famous for the quality of its Carrù beef (particularly famous for its fair of the \"Bue Grasso\", Fat Ox), hence the tradition of eating raw meat seasoned with garlic oil, lemon and salt the famous Carpaccio, the famous Brasato al vino, wine stew made from marinated beef, and boiled beef served with various sauces.\n\nThe food most typical of the Piedmont tradition are its traditional \"agnolotti\" (pasta folded over with a roast beef meat and vegetable stuffing), \"Panissa\" (a typical dish of Vercelli, a kind of risotto with Arborio rice or Maratelli rice, the typical kind of Saluggia beans, onion, Barbera wine, lard, salami, salt and pepper), \"taglierini\" (thinner version of tagliatelle), \"bagna cauda\" (sauce of garlic, anchovies, olive oil and butter) and \"bicerin\" (hot drink made of coffee, chocolate and whole milk). Finally Piedmont is one of the Italian capitals of pastry and chocolate in particular, with products like Nutella, \"gianduiotto\" and \"marron glacé\" that are famous worldwide.\n\nApulia is a massive food producer: major production includes wheat, tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli, bell peppers, potatoes, spinach, eggplants, cauliflower, fennel, endive, chickpeas, lentils, beans and cheese (like the traditional \"caciocavallo\" cheese). Apulia is also the largest producer of olive oil in Italy. The sea offers abundant fish and seafood that are extensively used in the regional cuisine, especially oysters, and mussels.\n\nGoat and lamb are occasionally used. The region is known for pasta made from durum wheat and traditional pasta dishes featuring \"orecchiette\"-type pasta, often served with tomato sauce, potatoes, mussels or cime di rapa. Pasta with cherry tomatoes and arugula is also popular.\n\nRegional desserts include \"zeppola\", doughnuts usually topped with powdered sugar and filled with custard, jelly, cannoli-style pastry cream or a butter-and-honey mixture. For Christmas, Apulians make a very traditional rose shape pastry called Cartellate. These are fried and dipped in Vin Cotto which is a reduction of wine or in some cases of fig juice.\n\nSuckling pig and wild boar are roasted on the spit or boiled in stews of beans and vegetables, thickened with bread. Herbs such as mint and myrtle are widely used in the regional cuisine. Sardinia also has many special types of bread, made dry, which keeps longer than high-moisture breads.\nAlso baked are \"carasau\" bread \"\", \"\", a highly decorative bread, and \"\" made with flour and water only, originally meant for herders, but often served at home with tomatoes, basil, oregano, garlic and a strong cheese. Rock lobster, scampi, squid, tuna, sardines are the predominant seafoods.\n\nCasu marzu is a very strong cheese produced in Sardinia, but is of questionable legality due to hygiene concerns.\n\nSicily shows traces of all the cultures which established themselves on the island over the last two millennia. Although its cuisine undoubtably has a predominantly Italian base, Sicilian food also has Spanish, Greek and Arab influences. Dionysus is said to have introduced wine to the region: a trace of historical influence from Ancient Greece.\nThe ancient Romans introduced lavish dishes based on goose. The Byzantines favored sweet and sour flavors and the Arabs brought sugar, citrus, rice, spinach, and saffron. The Normans and Hohenstaufens had a fondness for meat dishes. The Spanish introduced items from the New World including chocolate, maize, turkey and tomatoes.\n\nMuch of the island's cuisine encourages the use of fresh vegetables such as eggplant, peppers, and tomatoes, and fish such as tuna, sea bream, sea bass, cuttlefish, and swordfish. In Trapani, in the extreme western corner of the island, North African influences are clear in the use of various \"couscous\" based dishes, usually combined with fish. mint is used extensively in cooking unlike the rest of Italy.\n\nTraditional specialties from Sicily include \"arancini\" (a form of deep-fried rice croquettes), pasta \"alla Norma\", \"caponata\", \"pani ca meusa\", and a host of desserts and sweets such as cannoli, granita, and cassata).\n\nTypical of Sicily is Marsala, a red, fortified wine similar to Port and largely exported.\n\nBefore the Council of Trent in the middle of the 16th century, the region was known for the simplicity of its peasant cuisine. When the prelates of the Catholic Church established there, they brought the art of fine cooking with them. Later, also influences from Venice and the Austrian Habsburg Empire came in.\n\nThe Trentino subregion produces various types of sausages, \"polenta\", yogurt, cheese, potato cake, funnel cake and freshwater fish. In the Südtirol (Alto Adige) subregion, due to the German-speaking majority population, strong Austrian and Slavic influences prevail. The most renowned local product is traditional \"speck\" juniper-flavored ham which, as Speck Alto Adige PGI, is regulated by the European Union under the protected geographical indication (PGI) status. \"Goulash\", \"knödel\", apple strudel, \"kaiserschmarrn\", \"krapfen\", \"rösti\", \"spätzle\" and rye bread are regular dishes, along with potatoes, dumpling, homemade \"sauerkraut\", and lard. The territory of Bolzano is also reputed for its Müller-Thurgau white wines.\n\nSimplicity is central to the Tuscan cuisine. Legumes, bread, cheese, vegetables, mushrooms and fresh fruit are used. A good example would be \"ribollita\", a notable Tuscan soup whose name literally means \"reboiled\". Like most Tuscan cuisine, the soup has peasant origins.\n\nIt was originally made by reheating (i.e. reboiling) the leftover \"minestrone\" or vegetable soup from the previous day. There are many variations but the main ingredients always include leftover bread, cannellini beans and inexpensive vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, beans, silverbeet, \"cavolo nero\" (Tuscan kale), onion and olive oil.\n\nA regional Tuscan pasta known as \"pici\" resembles thick, grainy-surfaced spaghetti, and is often rolled by hand. White truffles from San Miniato appear in October and November. High-quality beef, used for the traditional Florentine steak, come from the Chianina cattle breed of the Chiana Valley and the Maremmana from Maremma.\n\nPork is also produced. The region is well-known also for its rich game, especially wild boar, hare, fallow deer, roe deer and pheasant that often are used to prepare \"pappardelle\" dishes. Regional desserts include \"panforte\" (prepared with honey, fruits and nuts), \"ricciarelli\" (biscuits made using an almond base with sugar, honey and egg white), and \"cavallucci\" (cookies made with almonds, candied fruits, coriander, flour, honey). Well-known regional wines include Brunello di Montalcino, Carmignano, Chianti, Morellino di Scansano, Parrina, Sassicaia, Vernaccia di San Gimignano.\n\nMany Umbrian dishes are prepared by boiling or roasting with local olive oil and herbs. Vegetable dishes are popular in the spring and summer, while fall and winter sees meat from hunting and black truffles from Norcia. Meat dishes include the traditional wild boar sausages, pheasants, geese, pigeons, frogs, snails. Castelluccio is known for its lentils, Spoleto and Monteleone are known for spelt. Freshwater fish include lasca, trout, freshwater perch, grayling, eel, barbel, whitefish, and tench. Orvieto and Sagrantino di Montefalco are important regional wines.\n\nIn the Aosta Valley, bread-thickened soups are customary as well as cheese fondue, chestnuts, potatoes, rice. \"Polenta\" is a staple along with rye bread, smoked bacon, Motsetta (cured chamois meat) and game from the mountains and forests. Butter and cream are important in stewed, roasted and braised dishes. Typical regional products include Fontina cheese, Vallée d'Aoste Lard d'Arnad, red wines and Génépi Artemisia-based liqueur.\n\nVenice and many surrounding parts of Veneto are known for \"risotto\", a dish whose ingredients can highly vary upon different areas, as fish and seafood being added closer to the coast and pumpkin, asparagus, radicchio and frogs' legs appearing further away from the Adriatic. Made from finely ground maize meal, \"polenta\" is a traditional, rural food typical of Veneto and most of Northern Italy. It may find its way into stirred dishes and baked dishes and can be served with various cheese, stockfish or meat dishes.\nSome polenta dishes includes porcini, rapini, or other vegetables or meats, such as small song-birds in the case of the Venetian and Lombard dish \"polenta e osei\", or sausages. In some areas of Veneto it can be also made of a particular variety of cornmeal, named \"biancoperla\", so that the colour of polenta is white and not yellow (the so-called \"polenta bianca\").\n\nBeans, peas and other legumes are seen in these areas with \"pasta e fagioli\" (beans and pasta) and \"risi e bisi\" (rice and peas). Veneto features heavy dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients such as stockfish or simple marinated anchovies are found here as well.\n\nLess fish and more meat is eaten away from the coast. Other typical products are sausages such as Soppressa Vicentina, garlic salami, Piave cheese and Asiago cheese. High quality vegetables are prized, such as red radicchio from Treviso and white asparagus from Bassano del Grappa. Perhaps the most popular dish of Venice is \"fegato alla veneziana\", thinly-sliced veal liver sauteed with onions.\n\nSquid and cuttlefish are common ingredients, as is squid ink, called \"nero di seppia\". Regional desserts include \"tiramisu\" (made of biscuits dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of egg yolks and \"mascarpone\", and flavored with liquor and cocoa), \"baicoli\" (biscuits made with butter and vanilla) and nougat.\n\nThe most celebrated Veneto wines include Bardolino, Prosecco, Soave, Amarone and Valpolicella DOC wines.\n\nTraditionally, meals in Italy usually contain four or five courses. Especially on weekends, meals are often seen as a time to spend with family and friends rather than simply for sustenance; thus, meals tend to be longer than in other cultures. During holidays such as Christmas and New Year's Eve, feasts can last for hours.\n\nToday, the traditional Italian menu is kept mainly for special events (such as weddings) while an everyday menu includes only the first and/or second course, the side dish, and coffee. A notable aspect of Italian meals is that the \"primo\" or first course is usually a more filling dish such as risotto or pasta. Italian cuisine also includes single courses (all-in-one courses), providing carbohydrates and proteins at the same time (e.g. pasta and legumes).\n\nEach type of establishment has a defined role and traditionally sticks to it.\n\nItalian style coffee (\"caffè\"), also known as espresso, is made from a blend of coffee beans. Espresso beans are roasted medium to medium dark in the north, and darker as you move south.\n\nA common misconception is that espresso has more caffeine than other coffee; in fact the opposite is true. The longer roasting period extracts more caffeine. The modern espresso machine, invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia, uses a pump and pressure system with water heated to and forced at high pressure through a few grams of finely ground coffee in 25–30 seconds, resulting in about 25 milliliters (0.85 fl oz, two tablespoons) of liquid.\n\nHome coffee makers are simpler but work under the same principle. \"La Napoletana\" is a four-part stove-top unit with grounds loosely placed inside a filter; the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds. The \"Moka per il caffè\" is a three-part stove-top unit that is placed on the stovetop with loosely packed grounds in a strainer; the water rises from steam pressure and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. In both cases, the water passes through the grounds just once.\n\nEspresso is usually served in a demitasse cup. Caffè macchiato is topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; ristretto is made with less water, and is stronger; cappuccino is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage, and usually is not taken after a meal; caffelatte is equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to café au lait, and is typically served in a large cup. Latte macchiato (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee and caffè corretto is \"corrected\" with a few drops of an alcoholic beverage such as grappa or brandy.\n\nThe bicerin is also an Italian coffee, from Turin. It is a mixture of cappuccino and traditional hot chocolate, as it consists of a mix of coffee and drinking chocolate, and with a small addition of milk. It is quite thick, and often whipped cream/foam with chocolate powder and sugar is added on top.\n\nItaly produces the largest amount of wine in the world and is both the largest exporter and consumer of wine. Only about a quarter of this wine is put into bottles for individual sale. Two-thirds is bulk wine used for blending in France and Germany. The wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the New World. There are twenty separate wine regions.\n\nThose vineyards producing great wines are trying to do away with the old image of jug wines so often associated with Italian wine. To promote this, the Italian government passed the \"Denominazione di origine controllata\" (DOC) law in 1963 to regulate place of origin, quality, production method and type of grape. The designation \"Indicazione Geografica Tipica\" (IGT) is a less restrictive designation to help a wine maker graduate to the DOC level. In 1980, the government created the \"Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita\" (DOCG), reserved for only the best wines.\n\nIn Italy wine is commonly consumed (alongside water) in meals, which are rarely served without it, though it's extremely uncommon for meals to be served with any other drink, alcoholic or otherwise.\n\nItaly hosts a wide variety of different beers, which are usually pale lager. Beer is not as popular and widespread as wine (even though this is changing, and beer is becoming more and more popular), and average beer consumption in Italy is less than in some other neighbouring European nations, such as the United Kingdom, Germany and Austria. Among many popular brands, the most notable Italian breweries are Peroni and Moretti. Beer in Italy is often drunk in pizzerias, and South Tyrol (German-speaking region) is the area where beer is made and consumed the most.\n\nThere are also several other popular alcoholic drinks in Italy. Limoncello, a traditional lemon liqueur from Sicily and Southern Italy (Sorrento, Amalfi and the Gulf of Naples) in general, is one of the most common. Made from lemon, it is an extremely strong drink which is usually consumed in very small proportions, in small glasses or cups.\n\nAmaro Sicilianos are common Sicilian digestifs, made with herbs, which are usually drunk after heavy meals. Mirto, an herbal distillate made from the berries (red mirto) and leaves (white mirto) of the myrtle bush, is popular in Sardinia and other regions. Another well-known digestif is Amaro Lucano from Basilicata.\n\nGrappa is the typical alcoholic drink of northern Italy, generally associated with the culture of the Alps and of the Po Valley. The most famous grappas are distilled in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto, Piedmont and Trentino. The three most notable and recognizable Italian aperitifs are Martini, Vermouth and Campari. A sparkling drink which is becoming internationally popular as a less expensive substitute for French champagne is prosecco, from the Veneto region.\n\nFrom the Italian perspective, cookies and candy belong to the same category of sweets. Traditional candies include candied fruits, torrone, and nut brittles, all of which are still popular in the modern era. In medieval times, northern Italy became so famous for the quality of its stiff fruit pastes (similar to marmalade or conserves, except stiff enough to mold into shapes) that \"Paste of Genoa\" became a generic name for high-quality fruit conserves.\n\nSilver-coated almond dragées, which are called \"confetti\", are thrown at weddings. The idea of including a romantic note with candy may have begun with Italian dragées, no later than the early 19th century, and is carried on with the multilingual love notes included in boxes of Italy's most famous chocolate, Baci by Perugina in Milan. The most significant chocolate style is a combination of hazelnuts and milk chocolate, which is featured in gianduja pastes like Nutella, which is made by Ferrero SpA in Alba, Piedmont, as well as Perugnia's Baci and many other chocolate confections.\nEvery region has its own holiday recipes. During La Festa di San Giuseppe (St. Joseph's Day) on 19 March, Sicilians give thanks to St. Joseph for preventing a famine during the Middle Ages. The fava bean saved the population from starvation, and is a traditional part of St. Joseph's Day altars and traditions. Other customs celebrating this festival include wearing red clothing, eating Sicilian pastries known as zeppole and giving food to the poor.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, lamb is served throughout Italy. A typical Easter Sunday breakfast in Umbria and Tuscany includes salami, boiled eggs, wine, Easter Cakes and pizza. The common cake for Easter Day is the Colomba Pasquale (literally, Easter dove), which is often simply known as \"Italian Easter cake\" abroad. It is supposed to represent the dove, and is topped with almonds and pearl sugar.\n\nOn Christmas Eve a symbolic fast is observed with the \"cena di magro\" (\"light dinner\"), a meatless meal. Typical cakes of the Christmas season are panettone and pandoro.\n\nDue to several Italian colonies being set up in Africa, mainly in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Libya and Somalia (except the northern part, which was under British rule), there is a considerable amount of Italian influence on the cuisines of these nations.\n\nItaly's legacy from the days when Libya was invaded by Italy can be seen in the popularity of pasta on its menus, particularly Sharba, a highly spiced Libyan soup. Bazin, a local specialty, is a hard paste, made from barley, salt and water, and one of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine is Batata mubatana (filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.\n\nAll major cities and towns in South Africa have substantial populations of Italians. There are \"Italian Clubs\" in all main cities and they have had a significant influence on the cuisine of this country. Italian foods, like ham and cheeses, are imported and some also made locally, and every city has a popular Italian restaurant or two, as well as Pizzerias. Pastas are popular and is eaten more and more by South Africans. The production of good quality olive oil is on the rise in South Africa, especially in the drier south-western parts where there is a more Mediterranean-type of rainfall pattern. Some oils have even won top international awards.\n\nSpaghetti arrived during the time of the American occupation of the country in the early 1900s. It has since evolved into a distinctly Philippine version of the dish. Filipino spaghetti is characterized by a sauce based on banana ketchup and the presence of sliced hot dogs (sometimes substituted with sausage). Aside from the ketchup-based sauce, garlic, oregano, and bay leaf and some sugar are also used to flavour the sauce.\n\nGround beef or pork as well as ham may also be added. Baked macaroni (with a red sauce) is also present in the country's cuisine. Both can be found in authentic style or modified to suit the local palate and budget and can be found on restaurant menus as well as at Filipino parties and gatherings.\n\nLasagne is another Italian dish that made its way into Philippine cuisine. Unlike spaghetti, lasagne remains largely unchanged and Filipinos usually consume it with garlic bread.\n\nThe fast food chain Jollibee serves spaghetti with some meals, in contrast with other chains which serve rice or noodles.\n\nIn France, the cuisine of Corsica has much in common with the Italian cuisine, since the island was from the Early Middle Ages until 1768 first of a Pisan and then a Genoese possession. This is above all relevant by the first courses and by the \"charcuterie\".\n\nPizza and pasta dishes such as spaghetti bolognese and lasagne with bolognese \"ragù\" and Béchamel sauce are the most popular forms of Italian food in British, notably, English, cuisine.\n\nItalian cuisine has had a strong influence on Slovenian cuisine. For centuries, north-eastern Italy and western Slovenia have formed part of the same cultural-historical and geographical space. Between 1918 and 1945, western Slovenia (the Slovenian Littoral and part of Inner Carniola) were part of Italy. In addition, an autochthonous Italian minority live in Slovenian Istria.\n\nFor these reasons Italian dishes have penetrated the local Slovenian cuisine. Furthermore, there are numerous typical dishes that are shared between the Slovenian cuisines and the cuisine of the neighboring Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia: these include the \"gubana\" nut roll of Friuli (known as \"guban'ca\" or \"potica\" in Slovenia) and the \"jota\" stew.\n\nAmong the Slovenian dishes that come directly from Italian cuisine, the gnocchi and some types of pasta are especially popular, as well as dishes like the minestrone (known as mineštra in Slovene) or the frittata (known as frtalja in Slovene).\n\nProsciutto (pršut in Slovenian) and polenta are also popular.\n\nMuch of Italian-American cuisine is based on that found in Campania and Sicily, heavily Americanized to reflect ingredients and conditions found in the United States. Most pizza eaten around the world derives ultimately from the Neapolitan style, if somewhat thicker and usually with more toppings in terms of quantity.\n\nThroughout the country the \"torta de milanesa\" is a common item offered at food carts and stalls. It is a sandwich made from locally baked bread and contains a breaded, pan-fried cutlet of pork or beef. \"Pescado Veracruzano\" is a dish that originates from the port city of Veracruz and features a fillet of fresh fish (usually Gulf Red Snapper) covered in a distinctly Mediterranean influenced sauce containing stewed tomatoes, garlic, green olives, and capers. Also, \"espagueti\" (spaghetti) and other pastas are popular in a variety of soups.\n\nDue to large Italian immigration to Argentina, Italian food and drink is heavily featured in Argentine cuisine. An example could be \"milanesas\" (The name comes from the original cotoletta alla milanese from Milan, Italy) or breaded cutlets. Pizza (locally pronounced \"pisa or pitsa\"), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian calzones than it does its Italian ancestor. There are several other Italian-Argentine dishes, such as \"Sorrentinos\" and Argentine gnocchi.\n\nItalian cuisine is popular in Brazil, due to great immigration there in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Due to the huge Italian community, São Paulo is the place where this cuisine is most appreciated. Several types of pasta and meat, including milanesa steaks, have made their way into both daily home and street kitchens and fancy restaurants. The city has also developed its particular variety of pizza, different from both Neapolitan and American varieties, and it is largely popular on weekend dinners. In Rio de Janeiro Italian cuisine is also popular, and pizza has developed as a typical botequim counter snack.\n\nThere is considerable Italian influence in Venezuelan cuisine. \"Pan chabata\", or Venezuelan ciabatta, \"Pan Siciliano\", Sicilian bread, \"Cannoli siciliano\", Sicilian cannoli, and the drink chinotto are examples of the Italian influence in Venezuelan food and beverages.\n\n\n",
                "Pizza\n\nPizza is a traditional Italian dish consisting of a yeasted flatbread typically topped with tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven. It can also be topped with additional vegetables, meats, and condiments, and can be made without cheese. \n\nThe term \"pizza\" was first recorded in the 10th century, in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italy town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular and common in many areas of the world. In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish. \n\"Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana\" (True Neapolitan Pizza Association), a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples, aims to \"promote and protect... the true Neapolitan pizza\".\n\nPizza is one of the most popular foods in the world and common fast food item in Europe and North America. Many independent or chain restaurants, cafes, and fast food outlets offer pizza. Restaurants or chains specializing in pizza are pizzerias. Pizza delivery is common in some parts of the world.\n\nPizza is sold fresh or frozen, either whole or in portions. Various types of ovens are used to cook them and many varieties exist. Several similar dishes are prepared from ingredients commonly used in pizza preparation, such as calzone and stromboli. In the United States, pizza is usually eaten out of hand after dividing into slices from a large pizza or small pizzetta as a whole. In Italy, pizza is eaten with a fork and knife in restaurants, but is also sold to take away and eaten out of hand. Frozen pizza became popular in the late 20th century.\n\nThe word \"pizza\" () first appeared in a Latin text from the southern Italy town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta \"duodecim pizze\" (\"twelve pizzas\") every Christmas Day, and another twelve every Easter Sunday\".\n\nSuggested etymologies include:\n\nFoods similar to pizza have been made since the neolithic age. Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. The ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese, and in the 6th century BC, the soldiers in Persian King Darius I's armies baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields. An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the \"tables\" prophesied by Celaeno.\n\nModern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples in the 18th or early 19th century. Prior to that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, cheese, and basil. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims. Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries, and pizzerias keep this old tradition alive today. \n\nA popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, \"pizza Margherita\", was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen, although recent research casts doubt on this legend.\n\nPizza was brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century, and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in 1905. Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign after being introduced to Italy's native cuisine proved a ready market for pizza in particular. Since then pizza consumption has exploded in the U.S. Pizza chains such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's, pizzas from take and bake pizzerias, and chilled or frozen pizzas from supermarkets make pizza readily available nationwide. It is so ubiquitous, thirteen percent of the U.S. population consumes pizza on any given day.\n\nPizza is prepared fresh, frozen, and as portion-size slices or pieces. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.\n\nAnother form of uncooked pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to complete at home before baking in an oven.\n\nIn restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven or, in the case of more expensive restaurants, a wood- or coal-fired brick oven. On deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum). Prior to use, a peel may be sprinkled with cornmeal to allow pizza to easily slide onto and off of it. When made at home, it can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce the effect of a brick oven. Another option is grilled pizza, in which the crust is baked directly on a barbecue grill. Greek pizza, like Chicago-style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.\n\nWhen it comes to preparation, the dough and ingredients can be combined on any kind of table. With mass production of pizzas the process can be completely automated. Most restaurants still use standard and purpose built pizza preparation tables. Pizzerias nowadays can even opt for hi tech pizza preparation tables that combine mass production elements with traditional techniques.\n\nThe bottom of the pizza, called the \"crust\", may vary widely according to style—thin as in a typical hand-tossed Neapolitan pizza, or thick as in a deep-dish Chicago-style. It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the \"cornicione\". Often pizza dough contains sugar, both to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.\nDipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by American pizza chain Papa John's Pizza in 1984, and has since become popular when eating pizza, especially the crust.\n\nMozzarella is commonly used on pizza, with the highest quality buffalo mozzarella produced in the surroundings of Naples. Today, other cheeses have been used as pizza ingredients (particularly Italian cheeses), including provolone, pecorino romano, ricotta, and scamorza. Less expensive processed cheeses or cheese analogues have been developed for mass-market pizzas to produce desirable qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and stable shelf life. This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins and other changes in manufacture. In 1997 it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was in the U.S. and in Europe.\n\nAuthentic Neapolitan pizza (\"pizza napoletana\") is typically made with San Marzano tomatoes, grown on the volcanic plains south of Mount Vesuvius, and mozzarella di bufala Campana, made with milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio. This mozzarella is protected with its own European protected designation of origin. Other traditional pizzas include \"pizza alla marinara\", which is topped with marinara sauce and is allegedly the most ancient tomato-topped pizza,\npizza capricciosa, which is prepared with mozzarella cheese, baked ham, mushroom, artichoke and tomato, and pizza pugliese, prepared with tomato, mozzarella and onions.\n\nA popular variant of pizza in Italy is Sicilian pizza (locally called \"sfincione\" or \"sfinciuni\"), a thick-crust or deep-dish pizza originating during the 17th century in Sicily: it is essentially a focaccia that is typically topped with tomato sauce and other ingredients. Until the 1860s, \"sfincione\" was the type of pizza usually consumed in Sicily, especially in the Western portion of the island. Other variations of pizzas are also found in other regions of Italy, for example \"pizza al padellino\" or \"pizza al tegamino\", a small-sized, thick-crust and deep-dish pizza typically served in Turin, Piedmont.\n\nCommon toppings for pizza in the United States include ground beef, mushrooms, onions, pepperoni, pineapple, garlic, olives, peppers, carrots, tomatoes, spinach, anchovies, chicken, bacon, ham and sausage. Distinct regional types developed in the twentieth century, including California, Chicago, Greek, New Haven, Detroit, St. Louis, and New York styles. The first pizzeria in the U.S. was opened in New York's Little Italy in 1905 and since then regions throughout the U.S. offer variations, including deep-dish, stuffed, pockets, turnovers, rolled and pizza-on-a-stick, each with seemingly limitless combinations of sauce and toppings.\n\nAnother variation is grilled pizza, created by taking a fairly thin, round (more typically, irregularly shaped) sheet of yeasted pizza dough, placing it directly over the fire of a grill and then turning it over once the bottom has baked and placing a thin layer of toppings on the baked side. Toppings may be sliced thin to ensure that they heat through, and chunkier toppings such as sausage or peppers may be precooked before being placed on the pizza. Garlic, herbs, or other ingredients are sometimes added to the pizza or the crust to maximize the flavor of the dish.\n\nGrilled pizza was offered in the United States at the Al Forno restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island by owners Johanne Killeen and George Germon in 1980. Although it was inspired by a misunderstanding that confused a wood-fired brick oven with a grill, grilled pizza did exist prior to 1980, both in Italy, and in Argentina where it is known as \"pizza a la parrilla\". It has become a popular cookout dish, and there are even some pizza restaurants that specialize in the style. The traditional style of grilled pizza employed at Al Forno restaurant uses a dough coated with olive oil, strained tomato sauce, thin slices of fresh mozzarella, and a garnish made from shaved scallions, and is served uncut. The final product can be likened to flatbread with pizza toppings. Another Providence establishment, Bob & Timmy's Grilled Pizza, was featured in a Providence-themed episode of the Travel Channel's \"Man v. Food Nation\" in 2011.\n\nThe world's largest pizza was prepared in Rome in December 2012, and measured . The pizza was named \"Ottavia\" in homage to the first Roman emperor Octavian Augustus, and was made with a gluten-free base. The world's longest pizza was made in Naples in 2016. It was baked using a series of wheeled ovens which moved along its length, and measured .\n\nThe world's most expensive pizza listed by \"Guinness World Records\" is a commercially available thin-crust pizza at Maze restaurant in London, United Kingdom, which costs . The pizza is wood fire-baked, and is topped with onion puree, white truffle paste, fontina cheese, baby mozzarella, pancetta, cep mushrooms, freshly picked wild mizuna lettuce, and fresh shavings of a rare Italian white truffle.\n\nThere are several instances of more expensive pizzas, such as the \"Pizza Royale 007\" at Haggis restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland, which has caviar, lobster and is topped with 24-carat gold dust, and the caviar pizza made by Nino's Bellissima pizzeria in New York City, New York. However, these are not officially recognized by \"Guinness World Records\". Additionally, a pizza was made by the restaurateur Domenico Crolla that included toppings such as sunblush-tomato sauce, Scottish smoked salmon, medallions of venison, edible gold, lobster marinated in cognac, and champagne-soaked caviar. The pizza was auctioned for charity in 2007, raising .\n\nIn 2017, the world pizza market was $128 billion and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias. Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over, consumed pizza on any given day.\n\nSome mass-produced pizzas by fast food chains have been criticized as having an unhealthy balance of ingredients. Pizza can be high in salt, fat and calories (food energy). The USDA reports an average sodium content of 5,101 mg per pizza in fast food chains. There are concerns about negative health effects. Food chains have come under criticism at various times for the high salt content of some of their meals.\n\nFrequent pizza eaters in Italy have been found to have a relatively low incidence of cardiovascular disease and digestive tract cancers relative to infrequent pizza eaters, although the nature of the correlation between pizza and such perceived benefits is unclear. Pizza consumption in Italy might only indicate adherence to traditional Mediterranean dietary patterns, which have been shown to have various health benefits.\n\nSome attribute the apparent health benefits of pizza to the lycopene content in pizza sauce, which research indicates likely plays a role in protecting against cardiovascular disease and various cancers.\n\nNational Pizza Month is an annual observance that occurs for the month of October in the United States and some areas of Canada. This observance began in October 1984, and was created by Gerry Durnell, the publisher of \"Pizza Today\" magazine. During this time, some people observe National Pizza Month by consuming various types of pizzas or pizza slices, or going to various pizzerias.\n\n\n"

                "Yes (band)\n\nYes are an English rock band formed in London in 1968 by singer Jon Anderson, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Peter Banks, keyboardist Tony Kaye, and drummer Bill Bruford. The band have undergone numerous formations throughout their history; nineteen musicians have been full-time members. Since June 2015, it has consisted of guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White, keyboardist Geoff Downes, singer Jon Davison, and bassist Billy Sherwood, with no remaining founding members. Yes have explored several musical styles over the years, and are most notably regarded as progressive rock pioneers.\n\nYes began in 1968, performing original songs and rearranged covers of rock, pop, blues and jazz songs, as evident on their first two albums. A change of direction in 1970 led to a series of successful progressive rock albums until their disbanding in 1981, their most successful being \"The Yes Album\" (1971), \"Fragile\" (1971) and \"Close to the Edge\" (1972). Yes toured as a major rock act that earned the band a reputation for their elaborate stage sets, light displays, and album covers designed by Roger Dean. The success of \"Roundabout\", the single from \"Fragile\", cemented their popularity across the decade and beyond.\n\nIn 1983, Yes reformed with a new line-up that included Trevor Rabin and a more commercial and pop-oriented musical direction. The result was \"90125\" (1983), their highest-selling album which contained the U.S. number-one single, \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\". From 1990 to 1992, Yes were an eight-member formation after they merged with Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe for \"Union\" (1991) and its tour. Since 1994, Yes have released albums with varied levels of success and completed tours from 1994 to 2004. After a four-year hiatus, they resumed touring in 2009 and continue to release albums; their most recent is \"Heaven & Earth\" (2014). A separate group composed of former Yes members began touring under the name Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman in 2016, adopting the name Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, Rick Wakeman following the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017. \n\nYes are one of the most successful, influential, and longest-lasting progressive rock bands. They have sold 13.5 million RIAA-certified albums in the US. In 1985, they won a Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance with \"Cinema\", and received five Grammy nominations between 1985 and 1992. They were ranked No. 94 on VH1's \"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\". Yes have headlined annual progressive rock-themed cruises since 2013 named Cruise to the Edge. Their discography spans 21 studio albums. \n\nIn April 2017, Yes were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which chose to specifically bestow the honour upon current and former members Anderson, Squire, Bruford, Kaye, Howe, Rick Wakeman, White and Rabin.\n\nIn 1967, bassist Chris Squire joined the rock band Mabel Greer's Toyshop, with singer and guitarist Clive Bayley, drummer Bob Hagger, and guitarist Peter Banks. They played at the Marquee Club in Soho, London where Jack Barrie, owner of the nearby La Chasse club, saw them perform. \"There was nothing outstanding about them\", he recalled, \"the musicianship was very good but it was obvious they weren't going anywhere\". Barrie introduced Squire to singer Jon Anderson, a worker at the bar in La Chasse, who found they shared interests in Simon & Garfunkel and harmony singing. That evening at Squire's house they wrote \"Sweetness,\" which was included on the first Yes album. Meanwhile, Banks had left Mabel Greer's Toyshop to join Neat Change, but he was dismissed by this group on 7 April 1968. In June 1968, Hagger was replaced in the nascent Yes by Bill Bruford, who had placed an advertisement in \"Melody Maker\", and Banks was recalled by Squire, replacing Bayley as guitarist. Finally, the classically trained organist and pianist Tony Kaye, of Johnny Taylor's Star Combo and the Federals, became the keyboardist and the fifth member. The newborn band rehearsed in the basement of The Lucky Horseshoe cafe on Shaftesbury Avenue between 10 June and 9 July 1968.\n\nAnderson suggested that they call the new band Life while Squire suggested that it be called World. After renaming themselves \"Yes!\" at Banks' suggestion, the first gig under the new brand followed at a youth camp in East Mersea, Essex on 4 August 1968. Early sets were formed of cover songs from artists such as the Beatles, the 5th Dimension and Traffic. On 16 September, Yes performed at Blaise's club in London as a substitute for Sly and the Family Stone, who failed to turn up. They were well received by the audience, including the host Roy Flynn, who became the band's manager that night. That month, Bruford decided to quit performing to study at the University of Leeds. His replacement, Tony O'Reilly of the Koobas, struggled to perform with the rest of the group on-stage. After Bruford was refused a year's sabbatical leave from Leeds, Anderson and Squire convinced him to return for Yes's supporting slot for Cream's farewell concert at the Royal Albert Hall on 26 November.\n\nAfter seeing an early King Crimson gig in 1969, Yes realised that there was suddenly stiff competition on the London gigging circuit, and they needed to be much more technically proficient, starting regular rehearsals. They subsequently signed a deal with Atlantic Records, and, that August, released their debut album \"Yes\". Compiled of mostly original material, the record includes renditions of \"Every Little Thing\" by the Beatles and \"I See You\" by the Byrds. Although the album failed to break into the UK album charts, \"Rolling Stone\" critic Lester Bangs complimented the album's \"sense of style, taste, and subtlety\". \"Melody Maker\" columnist Tony Wilson chose Yes and Led Zeppelin as the two bands \"most likely to succeed\".\n\nFollowing a tour of Scandinavia with the Small Faces, Yes performed a solo concert at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on 21 March 1970. The second half consisted of excerpts from their second album \"Time and a Word\", accompanied by a 20-piece youth orchestra. Banks left the group in May, two months before the album's release. Having expressed dissatisfaction with the idea of recording with an orchestra as well as the sacking of Flynn earlier in the year, Banks later indicated that he was fired by Anderson and Squire, and that Kaye and Bruford had no prior knowledge that it would be happening. Similar to the first album, \"Time and a Word\" features original songs and two new covers–\"Everydays\" by Buffalo Springfield and \"No Opportunity Necessary, No Experience Needed\" by Richie Havens. The album broke into the UK charts, peaking at number 45. Banks' replacement was Tomorrow guitarist Steve Howe, who appears in the photograph of the group on the American issue despite not having played on it.\n\nThe band retreated to a rented farmhouse in Devon to write and rehearse new songs for their following album. Howe established himself as an integral part of the group's sound with his Gibson ES-175 and variety of acoustic guitars. With producer and engineer Eddy Offord, recording sessions lasted as long as 12 hours with each track being assembled from small sections at a time, which were pieced together to form a complete track. The band would then learn to play the song through after the final mix was complete. Released in February 1971, \"The Yes Album\" peaked at number 4 in the UK and number 40 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 charts.\n\nYes embarked on a 28-day tour of Europe with Iron Butterfly in January 1971. The band purchased Iron Butterfly's entire public address system, which improved their on-stage performance and sound. Their first date in North America followed on 24 June in Edmonton, Canada supporting Jethro Tull. Kaye performed his final show with Yes at the Crystal Palace Bowl that August and was fired shortly thereafter. The decision was made after friction arising between Howe and himself on tour, and his reported reluctance to play the Mellotron and the Minimoog synthesizer, preferring to stick exclusively to piano and Hammond organ.\n\nAt the time of Kaye's departure, Yes had already found their new keyboardist – Rick Wakeman, a classically trained player who had left the folk rock group Strawbs earlier in the year. He was already a noted studio musician, with credits including T. Rex, David Bowie, Cat Stevens and Elton John. Squire commented that he could play \"a grand piano for three bars, a Mellotron for two bars and a Moog for the next one absolutely spot on\", which gave Yes the orchestral and choral textures that befitted their new material.\n\nReleased on 26 November 1971, the band's fourth album \"Fragile\" showcased their growing interest in the structures of classical music, with an excerpt of \"The Firebird\" by Igor Stravinsky being played at the start of their concerts since the album's 1971–1972 tour. Each member performed a solo track on the album, and it marked the start of their long collaboration with artist Roger Dean, who designed the group's logo, album art, and stage sets. \"Fragile\" peaked at number 7 in the UK and number 4 in the US after it was released there in January 1972, and was their first record to reach the top ten in North America. A shorter version of the opening track, \"Roundabout\", was released as a single that peaked at number 13 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart.\n\nIn February 1972, Yes recorded a cover version of \"America\" by Paul Simon. The single reached number 46 on the US singles chart. The track subsequently appeared on \"The New Age of Atlantic\", a 1972 compilation album of several bands signed to Atlantic Records, and again in the 1975 compilation \"Yesterdays\".\n\nReleased in September 1972, \"Close to the Edge\", the band's fifth album, was their most ambitious work so far. At 19 minutes, the title track took up an entire side on the vinyl record and combined elements of classical music, psychedelic rock, pop, and jazz. The album reached number 3 in the US and number 4 on the UK charts. \"And You and I\" was released as a single that peaked at number 42 in the US. The growing critical and commercial success of the band was not enough to retain Bruford, who left Yes in the summer of 1972, before the album's release, to join King Crimson. The band considered several possible replacements, including Aynsley Dunbar (who was playing with Frank Zappa at the time), and decided on former Plastic Ono Band drummer Alan White, a friend of Anderson and Offord who had once sat in with the band weeks before Bruford's departure. White learned the band's repertoire in three days before embarking on their 1972–1973 tour. By this point, Yes were beginning to enjoy worldwide commercial and critical success. Their early touring with White was featured on \"Yessongs\", a triple live album released in May 1973 that documented shows from 1972. The album reached number 7 in the UK and number 12 in the US. A concert film of the same name premiered in 1975 that documented their shows at London's Rainbow Theatre in December 1972, with added psychedelic visual images and effects.\n\n\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\" was the band's sixth studio album, released on 14 December 1973. It marked a change in their fortunes and polarised fans and critics alike. The double vinyl set was based on Anderson's interpretation of the Shastric scriptures from a footnote within Paramahansa Yogananda's book \"Autobiography of a Yogi\". The album became the first LP in the UK to ship gold before the record arrived at retailers. It went on to top the UK charts for two weeks while reaching number 6 in the US, and became the band's fourth consecutive gold album. Wakeman was not pleased with the record and is critical of much of its material. He felt sections were \"bled to death\" and contained too much musical padding. Wakeman left the band after the 1973–1974 tour; his solo album \"Journey to the Centre of the Earth\" topped the UK charts in May 1974. The tour included five consecutive sold-out shows at the Rainbow Theatre, the first time a rock band achieved this.\n\nSeveral musicians were approached to replace Wakeman, including Vangelis Papathanassiou, Eddie Jobson of Roxy Music and former Atlantis/Cat Stevens keyboardist Jean Roussel. Yes ultimately chose Swiss keyboardist Patrick Moraz of Refugee, who arrived in August 1974 during the recording sessions for \"Relayer\", which took place at Squire's home in Virginia Water, Surrey. Released in November that year, \"Relayer\" showcased a jazz fusion-influenced direction the band were pursuing. The album features the 22-minute track titled \"The Gates of Delirium\", which highlights a battle initially inspired by \"War and Peace\" by Leo Tolstoy. Its closing section, \"Soon\", was subsequently released as a single. The album reached number 4 in the UK and number 5 in the US. Yes embarked on their 1974–1975 tour to support \"Relayer\". The compilation album \"Yesterdays\", released in 1975, contained tracks from Yes's first two albums, the B-side track from their \"Sweet Dreams\" single from 1970 titled \"Dear Father\", and the original ten-minute version of their cover of \"America\".\n\nBetween 1975 and 1976, each member of the band released a solo album. Their subsequent 1976 tour of North America with Peter Frampton featured some of the band's most-attended shows. The show of 12 June, also supported by Gary Wright and Pousette-Dart Band at John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia, attracted over 100,000 people. Roger Dean's brother Martyn was the main designer behind the tour's \"Crab Nebula\" stage set, while Roger and fabric designer Felicity Youette provided the backgrounds.\n\nIn late 1976, the band travelled to Switzerland and started recording for their album \"Going for the One\" at Mountain Studios, Montreux. It was then that Anderson sent early versions of \"Going for the One\" and \"Wonderous Stories\" to Wakeman, who felt he could contribute to such material better than the band's past releases. Moraz was let go, after Wakeman was booked on a session musician basis. Upon its release in July 1977, \"Going for the One\" topped the UK album charts for two weeks and reached number 8 in the US. \"Wonderous Stories\" and \"Going for the One\" were released as singles in the UK and reached numbers 7 and 25, respectively. Although the album's cover was designed by Hipgnosis, it still features their Roger Dean \"bubble\" logotype. The band's 1977 tour spanned across six months.\n\n\"Tormato\" was released in September 1978 at the height of punk rock in England, during which the music press criticised Yes as representing the bloated excesses of early-1970s progressive rock. The album saw the band continuing their movement towards shorter songs; no track runs longer than eight minutes. Wakeman replaced his Mellotrons with the Birotron, a tape replay keyboard, and Squire experimented with harmonisers and Mu-tron pedals with his bass. Production was handled collectively by the band and saw disagreements at the mixing stage among the members. With heavy commercial rock-radio airplay, the album reached number 8 in the UK and number 10 in the US charts, and was also certified platinum (1 million copies sold) by the RIAA. Despite internal and external criticisms of the album, the band's 1978–1979 tour was a commercial success. Concerts were performed in the round with a £50,000-central revolving stage and a 360-degree sound system fitted above it. Yes earned a \"Golden Ticket Award\" for grossing over $1 million in box office receipts.\n\nIn October 1979, the band convened in Paris with producer Roy Thomas Baker. Their diverse approach was now succumbing to division, as Anderson and Wakeman favoured the more fantastical and delicate approach while the rest preferred a heavier rock sound. Howe, Squire and White liked none of the music Anderson was offering at the time as it was too lightweight and lacking in the heaviness that they were generating in their own writing sessions. The Paris sessions abruptly ended in December after White broke his foot while rollerskating in a roller disco. When the band, minus Wakeman (who had only committed to recording keyboard overdubs once new material would be ready to record), reconvened in February to resume work on the project, their growing musical differences, combined with internal dissension, obstructed progress. Journalist Chris Welch, after attending a rehearsal, noted that Anderson \"was singing without his usual conviction and seemed disinclined to talk\". By late March, Howe, Squire and White had begun demoing material as an instrumental trio, increasingly uncertain about Anderson's future involvement. Eventually, a serious band dispute over finance saw Anderson leave Yes, with a dispirited Wakeman departing at around the same time.\n\nIn 1980, pop duo the Buggles (keyboardist Geoff Downes and singer Trevor Horn) acquired Brian Lane as a manager. \n\nAt this point, the departure of Anderson and Wakeman had been kept secret from everyone outside the Yes inner circle. Seeing an option of continuing the band with new creative input and expertise, Squire revealed the situation to Horn and Downes and suggested that they join Yes as full-time members. Horn and Downes accepted the invitation and the reconfigured band recorded the \"Drama\" album, which was released in August 1980. The record displayed a heavier, harder sound than the material Yes recorded with Anderson in 1979, opening with the lengthy hard rocker \"Machine Messiah\". The album received substantial radio airplay in the late summer-fall of 1980, and peaked at number 2 in the UK and number 18 in the US, though it was the first Yes album to not be certified Gold by the RIAA since 1971. Their 1980 tour of North America and the UK received a mixed reaction from audiences. They were well received in the United States, and were awarded with a commemorative certificate after they performed a record 16 consecutive sold out concerts at Madison Square Garden since 1974.\n\nAfter the \"Drama\" tour, Yes reconvened in England to decide the band's next step, beginning by dismissing Lane as their manager. Horn chose to leave Yes to pursue a career in music production, with White and Squire next to depart. Left as the sole remaining members, Downes and Howe opted not to continue with the group and went their own separate ways in December 1980. A live compilation album of Yes performances from 1976 to 1978, mixed in mid-1979 and originally intended for release in late 1979, was released as \"Yesshows\", peaking at number 22 in the UK charts and number 43 in the US. An announcement came from the group's management in March 1981 confirming that Yes no longer existed.\n\nDownes and Howe later reunited to form Asia with former King Crimson bassist and vocalist John Wetton, and drummer Carl Palmer from Emerson, Lake, and Palmer. Squire and White continued to work together, initially recording sessions with Jimmy Page for a proposed band called XYZ (short for \"ex-Yes-and-Zeppelin\") in the spring of 1981. Page's former bandmate Robert Plant was also to be involved as the vocalist but he lost enthusiasm, citing his ongoing grieving for recently deceased Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham. The short-lived group produced a few demo tracks, elements of which would appear in Page's band the Firm and on future Yes tracks \"Mind Drive\" and \"Can You Imagine?\". In late 1981, Squire and White released \"Run with the Fox\", a Christmas single with Squire on vocals which received radio airplay through the 1980s and early 1990s during the Christmas periods. A second Yes compilation album, \"Classic Yes,\" was released in November 1981.\n\nIn 1982, Phil Carson of Atlantic Records introduced Squire and White to guitarist and singer Trevor Rabin, who had initially made his name with the South African supergroup Rabbitt, subsequently releasing three solo albums, working as a record producer and even briefly considered being a member of Asia. The three teamed up in a new band called Cinema, for which Squire also recruited the original Yes keyboard player Tony Kaye. Despite the presence of three Yes musicians, Cinema was not originally intended to be a continuation of Yes, and entered the studio to record a debut album as a brand new group. Although Rabin and Squire initially shared lead vocals for the project, Trevor Horn was briefly brought into Cinema as a potential singer, but soon opted to become the band's producer instead.\n\nHorn worked well with the band. However, his clashes with Tony Kaye (complicated by the fact that Rabin was playing most of the keyboards during the recording sessions) led to Kaye's departure after around six months of rehearsing. Meanwhile, Squire encountered Jon Anderson (who, since leaving Yes, had released two solo albums and had success with the Jon and Vangelis project) at a Los Angeles party and played him the Cinema demo tracks. Anderson was invited into the project as lead singer and joined in April 1983 during the last few weeks of the sessions, having comparatively little creative input beyond adding his lead vocals and re-writing some lyrics.\n\nAt the suggestion of record company executives, Cinema then changed their name to Yes in June 1983. Rabin initially objected to this, as he now found that he had inadvertently joined a reunited band with a history and expectations, rather than help launch a new group. However, the presence of four former Yes members in the band (three of whom were founding members, including the distinctive lead singer) suggested that the name change was sound commercial strategy. The new album marked a radical change in style as the revived Yes had adopted a pop rock sound that showed little of their progressive roots. This incarnation of the band has sometimes been informally referred to as \"Yes-West\", reflecting the band's new base in Los Angeles rather than London.\n\nYes released their comeback album \"90125\" (named after its catalogue serial number on Atco Records) in November 1983. It became their biggest-selling album, certified by the RIAA at triple-platinum (3 million copies) in sales in the US, and introduced the band to younger fans. \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" topped the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart for four weeks, and went on to reach the number one spot on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart, the only single from Yes to do so, for two weeks in January 1984. Kaye's short-term replacement on keyboards, Eddie Jobson, appeared briefly in the original video but was edited out as much as possible once Kaye had been persuaded to return to the band.\n\nIn 1984, the singles \"Leave It\" and \"It Can Happen\" reached number 24 and 57 respectively. Yes also earned their only Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1985 for the two-minute track \"Cinema\". They were also nominated for an award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group With Vocals with \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", and a Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal award with \"90125\". The band's 1984–1985 tour was the most lucrative in their history and spawned \"9012Live\", a concert film directed by Steven Soderbergh with added special effects from Charlex that cost $1 million. Yes' mini-LP released in 1985, \"\", earned Yes a nomination for a second Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for Squire's solo track, a rendition of \"Amazing Grace\".\n\nYes began recording for their twelfth album, \"Big Generator\", in 1986. The sessions underwent many starts and stops due to the use of multiple recording locations in Italy, London, and Los Angeles as well as interpersonal problems between Rabin and Horn, which kept the album from timely completion. Eventually, Rabin took over final production, and the album was released in September 1987, and immediately began receiving heavy radio airplay, with sales reaching number 17 in the UK and number 15 in the US. \"Big Generator\" earned Yes a nomination for a second Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal in 1988, and was also certified platinum (with 1 million plus in sales) by the RIAA. The single \"Love Will Find a Way\" topped the Mainstream Rock chart, while \"Rhythm of Love\" reached number 2 and \"Shoot High Aim Low\" number 11. The 1987–1988 tour ended with an appearance at Madison Square Garden on 14 May 1988 as part of Atlantic Records' 40th anniversary.\n\nBy the end of 1988, Anderson felt creatively sidelined by Rabin and Squire and had grown tired of the musical direction of the \"Yes-West\" line-up. He took leave of the band, asserting that he would never stay in Yes purely for the money, and started work in Montserrat on a solo project that eventually involved Wakeman, Howe, and Bruford. This collaboration led to suggestions that there would be some kind of reformation of the \"classic\" Yes, although from the start the project had included bass player Tony Levin, whom Bruford had worked with in King Crimson. The project, rather than taking over or otherwise using the Yes name, was called Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe (ABWH).\n\nTheir eponymous album released in 1989 featured \"Brother of Mine\", which became an MTV hit, and went gold in the United States. It later emerged that the four band members had not all recorded together; Anderson and producer Chris Kimsey slotted their parts into place. Howe has stated publicly that he was unhappy with the mix of his guitars on the album, though a version of \"Fist of Fire\" with more of Howe's guitars left intact appeared on the \"\" box set in 2002. ABWH toured in 1989 and 1990 as \"An Evening of Yes Music\" which featured Levin, keyboardist Julian Colbeck, and guitarist Milton McDonald as support musicians. A live album was recorded and released in 1993 titled \"An Evening of Yes Music Plus\" that featured Jeff Berlin on bass due to Levin suffering from illness. The tour was also dogged by legal battles sparked by Atlantic Records due to the band's references to Yes in promotional materials and the tour title.\n\nFollowing the tour the group returned to the recording studio to produce their second album, tentatively called \"Dialogue\". After hearing the tracks, Arista Records refused to release the album as they felt the initial mixes were weak. They encouraged the group to seek outside songwriters, preferably ones who could help them deliver hit singles. Anderson approached Rabin about the situation, and Rabin sent Anderson a demo tape with four songs, indicating that ABWH could have one but had to send the others back. Arista listened to all four and wanted all of them, but Rabin would not agree to the request. The \"Yes-West\" group were working on a follow-up to \"Big Generator\" and had been shopping around for a new singer. Ex-Supertramp vocalist Roger Hodgson had already rejected the post; while he enjoyed working and writing with the group, he thought it unwise to attempt to pass off the resulting music as \"Yes.\" The band had also been working with Kansas singer Steve Walsh and with Billy Sherwood of World Trade. Walsh only spent one day with them, but Sherwood and the band worked well enough together and continued with writing sessions. Arista suggested that the \"Yes-West\" group, with Anderson on vocals, record the four songs to add to the new album which would then be released under the Yes name.\n\n\"Union\" was released in April 1991 and is the thirteenth studio album from Yes. Each group played their own songs, with Anderson singing on all tracks. Squire sang background vocals on a few of the ABWH tracks, with Tony Levin playing all the bass on those songs. The album does not feature all eight members playing at once. The track \"Masquerade\" earned Yes a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in 1992. \"Union\" sold approximately 1.5 million copies worldwide, and peaked at number 7 in the UK and number 15 in the US charts. Two singles from the album were released. \"Lift Me Up\" topped the Mainstream Rock charts in May 1991 for six weeks, while \"Saving My Heart\" peaked at number 9.\n\nAlmost the entire band have openly stated their dislike of \"Union\". Bruford has disowned the album entirely, and Wakeman was reportedly unable to recognise any of his keyboard work in the final edit and threw his copy of the album out of his limousine. He has since referred to the album as \"Onion\" because it makes him cry when he thinks about it. \"Union\" Co-producer Jonathan Elias later stated publicly in an interview that Anderson, as the associate producer, knew of the session musicians' involvement. He added that he and Anderson had even initiated their contributions, because hostility between some of the band members at the time was preventing work from being accomplished. The 1991–1992 Union tour united all eight members on a revolving circular stage. Following its conclusion, Bruford chose not to remain involved with Yes and returned to his jazz project \"Earthworks\".\n\nIn 1993, the album \"Symphonic Music of Yes\" was released and features orchestrated Yes tracks arranged by David Palmer. Howe, Bruford and Anderson perform on the record, joined by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the English Chamber Orchestra, and the London Community Gospel Choir. The following Yes studio album, as with \"Union\", was masterminded by a record company, rather than by the band itself. Victory Music approached Rabin with a proposal to produce an album solely with the \"90125\" line-up. Rabin initially countered by requesting that Wakeman also be included. Rabin began assembling the album at his home, using the then-pioneering concept of a digital home studio, and used material written by himself and Anderson. The new album was well into production in 1993, but Wakeman's involvement had finally been cancelled, as his refusal to leave his long-serving management created insuperable legal problems.\n\n\"Talk\" was released in March 1994 and is the band's fourteenth studio release. Its cover was designed by pop artist Peter Max. The record was largely composed and performed by Rabin, with the other band members following Rabin's tracks for their respective instrumentation. It was digitally recorded and produced by Rabin with engineer Michael Jay, using 3.4 GB of hard disk storage split among four networked Apple Macintosh computers running Digital Performer, the first album ever recorded with such software. The album blended elements of radio-friendly rock with a more structurally ambitious approach taken from the band's progressive blueprint, with the fifteen-minute track \"Endless Dream\". The album reached number 20 in the UK and number 33 in the US. The track \"The Calling\" reached number 2 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart and \"Walls\", which Rabin had written with former Supertramp songwriter and co-founder Roger Hodgson, peaked at number 24. It also became Yes’s second-to-last charting single. Rabin and Hodgson wrote a lot of material together and became close friends. Yes performed \"Walls\" on \"Late Show with David Letterman\" on 20 June 1994.\n\nThe 1994 tour (for which the band included side man Billy Sherwood on additional guitar and keyboards) used a sound system developed by Rabin named Concertsonics which allowed the audience located in certain seating areas to tune portable FM radios to a specific frequency, so they could hear the concert with headphones. In early 1995, following the tour, Rabin, feeling that he had achieved his highest ambitions with \"Talk\", lamented its disappointing reception as being \"just wasn’t what people wanted to hear at the time\" and noted at the conclusion of the tour that \"I think I’m done\" and returned to LA where he shifted his focus to composing for films. Kaye also left Yes to pursue other projects.\n\nIn November 1995, Anderson, Squire, and White resurrected the \"classic\" 1970s line-up of Yes by inviting Wakeman and Howe back to the band, recording two new lengthy tracks called \"Be the One\" and \"That, That Is\". In March 1996, Yes performed three live shows at the Fremont Theater in San Luis Obispo, California which were recorded and released, along with the new studio tracks, that October on CMC International Records as the \"Keys to Ascension\" album, which peaked at number 48 in the UK and number 99 in the US. A same-titled live video of the shows was also released that year.\n\nYes continued to record new tracks in the studio, drawing some material written around the time of the XYZ project. At one point the new songs were to be released as a studio album, but commercial considerations meant that the new tracks were eventually packaged with the remainder of the 1996 San Luis Obispo shows in November 1997 on \"Keys to Ascension 2\". The record managed to reach number 62 in the UK, but failed to chart in the US. Disgruntled at the way a potential studio album had been sacrificed in favour of the \"Keys to Ascension\" releases (as well as the way in which a Yes tour was being arranged without his input or agreement), Wakeman left the group again. (The studio material from both albums would eventually be compiled and re-released without the live tracks onto a single CD, 2001's \"Keystudio\".)\nWith Yes in disarray again, Squire turned to Billy Sherwood (by now the band's engineer) for help. Both men had been working on a side project called Conspiracy and reworked existing demos and recordings from there to turn them into Yes songs, and also worked on new material with Anderson and White. (Howe's involvement at this stage was minimal, mainly taking place towards the end of the sessions.) Sherwood's integral involvement with the writing, production, and performance of the music led to his finally joining Yes as a full member (taking on the role of harmony singer, keyboardist and second guitarist).\n\nThe results of the sessions were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, \"Open Your Eyes\" (on the Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood's urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s. (Sherwood: \"My goal was to try to break down those partisan walls—because all of the music was so good. There are people who won't listen to Genesis, say, after 1978, but I can't imagine that. I love all music. That was the one thing I tried to do, to bring unity. During the time I was with Yes, you heard new things, and classic things. For that, I am proud — to have aligned planets for a moment in time.\") However, \"Open Your Eyes\" was not a chart success; the record peaked at number 151 on the \"Billboard\" 200 but failed to enter the charts in the UK. The title single managed to reach number 33 on the Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nFor the 1997/1998 \"Open Your Eyes\" tour, Yes hired Russian keyboard player Igor Khoroshev, who had played on some of the album tracks. Significantly, the tour setlist featured only a few pieces from the new album, and mostly concentrated on earlier material. Anderson and Howe, who had been less involved with the writing and production on \"Open Your Eyes\" than they'd wished, would express dissatisfaction about the album later.\n\nBy the time the band came to record their eighteenth studio album \"The Ladder\" with producer Bruce Fairbairn, Khoroshev had become a full-time member (with Sherwood now concentrating on songwriting, vocal arrangements, and second guitar). With Khoroshev's classically influenced keyboard style, and with all members now making more or less equal writing contributions, the band's sound returned to its eclectic and integrated 1970s progressive rock style. \"The Ladder\" also featured Latin music ingredients and clear world music influences, mostly brought in by Alan White (although Fairbairn's multi-instrumentalist colleague Randy Raine-Reusch made a strong contribution to the album's textures). One of the album tracks, \"Homeworld (The Ladder)\", was written for Relic Entertainment's Homeworld, a real-time strategy computer game, and was used as the credits and outro theme.\n\n\"The Ladder\" was released in September 1999, peaking at number 36 in the UK and number 99 in the US. While on tour in 1999 and early 2000, Yes recorded their performance at the House of Blues in Las Vegas, releasing it in September 2000 as a DVD and live album called \"\". This would be the last album to feature Billy Sherwood, who saw his role in Yes as creating and performing new music. Realising that the rest of the band now wished to concentrate on performing the back catalogue, he amicably resigned from Yes at the end of the tour.\n\nLater in the year, Yes embarked on the three-month Masterworks tour of the United States, on which they performed only material which had been released between 1970 and 1974 (\"The Yes Album\" through to \"Relayer\"). While on tour, Khoroshev was involved in a backstage incident of sexual assault and parted company with the band at the end of the tour.\n\nIn 2001, Yes released their nineteenth studio album \"Magnification\". Recorded without a keyboardist, the album features a 60-piece orchestra conducted by Larry Groupé; the first time the band used an orchestra since \"Time and a Word\" in 1970. The record was not a chart success; it peaked at number 71 in the UK and number 186 in the US. The Yes Symphonic Tour ran from July to December 2001 and had the band performing on stage with an orchestra and American keyboardist Tom Brislin. Their two shows in Amsterdam were recorded for their 2002 DVD and 2009 CD release \"Symphonic Live\". The band invited Wakeman to play with them for the filming, but he was on a solo tour at the time.\n\nFollowing Wakeman's announcement of his return in April 2002, Yes embarked on their Full Circle Tour in 2002–2003 that included their first performances in Australia since 1973. The triple compilation album \"\" was released in July 2003, reaching number 10 in the UK charts, their highest-charting album since 1991, and number 131 in the US. On 26 January 2004, the film \"Yesspeak\" premiered in a number of select theatres, followed by a closed-circuit live acoustic performance of the group that was released as \"\" later on. A 35th anniversary tour followed in 2004 which was documented on the live DVD \"Songs from Tsongas\".\n\nIn 2004, Squire, Howe, and White reunited for one night only with former members Trevor Horn, Trevor Rabin and Geoff Downes during a show celebrating Horn's career, performing three Yes songs. The show video was released in DVD in 2008 under the name \"Trevor Horn and Friends: Slaves to the Rhythm\".\n\nOn 18 March 2003 minor planet (7707) Yes was named in honour of the band.\n\nAfter the 35th-anniversary tour in September 2004, Yes described themselves as \"on hiatus\", yet remained active through overseeing archival releases. Meanwhile, Anderson toured extensively, including a joint tour with Wakeman focused largely on Yes material; while Squire released his long-awaited second solo album, Wakeman released a solo album, and White launched his own eponymous band White and subsequently joined fellow Yes-men Tony Kaye and Billy Sherwood in CIRCA; all touring to support their respective projects. Meanwhile, Howe released three solo albums and reunited with once-and-future Yes bandmate Geoff Downes in the reunion of the original Asia line-up, releasing a new album and touring extensively. \n\nIn May 2008, a scheduled 40th-anniversary \"Close to the Edge and Back\" tour—which was to feature Oliver Wakeman on keyboards—was abruptly cancelled prior to rehearsals, after Anderson suffered an asthma attack and was diagnosed with acute respiratory failure, and was advised by doctors to avoid touring for six months. Anderson has said that they had been preparing four new \"lengthy, multi-movement compositions\" for the tour, but he had expressed disinterest in producing a new studio album after the low sales of \"Magnification\", suggesting that recording one was not \"logical anymore.\" \n\nIn September 2008, the remaining band members, eager to resume touring regardless of Anderson's availability, announced a series of concerts under the name Steve Howe, Chris Squire and Alan White of Yes, with new lead singer Benoît David, a Canadian musician and member of Mystery and of the Yes tribute band Close to the Edge. Anderson expressed his disappointment that his former bandmates had not waited for his recovery, nor handled the situation \"in a more gentlemanly fashion,\" and while he wished them well, he referred to their ongoing endeavors as \"solo work\" and emphasized his view that their band \"is not Yes.\" The same line-up began touring under the Yes name in June 2009, following a number of February dates which were cancelled when Squire required emergency surgery on an aneurysm in his leg. In October 2009, Squire said \"this is now Yes\" and their In the Present Tour continued through 2010, with Asia and Peter Frampton supporting the band on certain legs.\n\nIn August 2010, it was announced that new material had been written for \"Fly from Here\", Yes' twentieth studio album. Howe dispelled rumours that Anderson was invited back to sing on the record, asserting that all studio recording was to be carried out by \"the line-up that actually...does the work.\"\n\nYes then signed a deal with Frontiers Records and began recording in Los Angeles with Trevor Horn serving as producer. Much of the album material was extrapolated from a pair of songs written by Horn and Geoff Downes around the time that they had been Yes members during 1980 and the \"Drama\" album. During the recording sessions, the band thought it would be wise to bring Downes back to replace Oliver Wakeman on keyboards, reasoning that he was closer to the material. Upon completion of recording in March 2011, and post-production a month later, the album was released worldwide that July. \"Fly from Here\" peaked at number 30 in the UK and 36 in the US.\n\nIn March 2011, Yes embarked on their Rite of Spring and Fly from Here tours to support \"Fly from Here\", with Styx and Procol Harum supporting on select dates. 2011 saw the release of the live Yes album and DVD, \"In the Present – Live from Lyon\", taken from the band's previous tour. Trevor Rabin joined the band in playing \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" at one show in Los Angeles, CA. \n\nIn February 2012, after David contracted a respiratory illness, he was replaced by Glass Hammer singer Jon Davison. Davison was recommended to Squire by their common friend Taylor Hawkins, drummer for the Foo Fighters. Davison would join Yes to complete the band's scheduled dates across the year.\n\nIn August 2013, the fan campaign Voices for Yes was launched to get the band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The campaign was headed by two U.S. political operators: John Brabender, senior strategist for Republican Rick Santorum's 2012 U.S. presidential campaign, and Tad Devine, who worked on Democrat John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign and Al Gore's 2000 campaign. Also involved were former NBC president Steve Capus and former Director of the White House Office of Political Affairs Sara Taylor. On 16 October 2013, Yes failed to be inducted. In November 2013, Anderson expressed a wish to return to Yes in the future for a \"tour everybody dreams of\", and cited Yes's nomination for inclusion into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a motive for a possible reunion. Howe, however, has stated his opinion of Anderson returning, asserting \"I'm not sure our mutual desire to achieve the same thing exists any more ... I think there has to be some element of moving on.\"\n\nFrom March 2013 to June 2014, Yes completed their Three Album Tour where they performed \"The Yes Album\", \"Close to the Edge\" and \"Going for the One\" in their entirety. During the tour, they led a progressive-rock themed cruise titled \"Cruise to the Edge\". A second cruise happened in April 2014, and the band headlined the November 2015 edition. The show on 11 May 2014 in Bristol was released as \"\" in 2014, featuring performances of \"Going for the One\" and \"The Yes Album\".\n\n\"Heaven & Earth\", the band's twenty-first studio album and first with Davison, was recorded between January–March 2014, at Neptune Studios in Los Angeles with Roy Thomas Baker as producer and former band member Billy Sherwood as engineer on backing vocals and mixer. Squire described the recording process as \"a very enjoyable experience\" and Baker someone \"really good to work with\", and indicated that the writing process for the album involved Davison traveling to Howe and Squire's homes to write and develop the new music. Howe reflected that he \"tried to slow down\" the album production in hopes that \"maybe we could refine it…\" and compared it to the success of the band's classic works in which they \"arranged the hell out of\" the material.\n\nTo promote \"Heaven & Earth\", Yes resumed touring between July–November 2014 with a world tour covering North America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, playing \"Fragile\" and \"Close to the Edge\" in their entirety with select songs from \"Heaven & Earth\" and encores. The show in Mesa, Arizona was released in 2015 as \"\" which features the performances of \"Close to the Edge\" and \"Fragile\".\n\nIn May 2015, news of Squire's diagnosis with acute erythroid leukaemia was made public. This resulted in former guitarist Billy Sherwood replacing him for their 2015 summer North American tour with Toto between August–September, and their third annual Cruise to the Edge voyage in November, while Squire was receiving treatment. His condition deteriorated soon after, and he died on 27 June at his home in Phoenix, Arizona. Downes first announced Squire's death on Twitter. Squire asked White and Sherwood to continue the legacy of the band, which Sherwood recalled \"was paramount in his mind ... so I'm happy to be doing that.\" Yes performed without Squire for the first time in their 47-year history, on 7 August 2015 in Mashantucket, Connecticut. In November 2015, they completed their annual Cruise to the Edge voyage.\n\nIn 2010, Anderson, Rabin, and Wakeman had announced they were working together, and had begun writing new material. In January 2016, that group was launched as Anderson, Rabin and Wakeman (ARW). Their tour, An Evening of Yes Music and More, began in October 2016 with a set of Yes songs from several eras. In 2017, they changed their name to Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin and Rick Wakeman, calling themselves \"the definitive line-up of the greatest band in the history of progressive rock\". In April 2017, following their aforementioned name change, Yes Featuring Jon Anderson, Trevor Rabin, and Rick Wakeman announced they would tour North America from late August–mid October 2017. While the two acts move forward with their respective tours, a unified tour under the Yes banner is decidedly not on the horizon. In response to questions regarding a possible reunion to celebrate Yes' 50th anniversary, members of each group have responded in the negative, with Howe stating that no plans exist for a joint tour and that he and his band are \"most probably not really interested\" in a reunion, while Wakeman cites his \"100%\" certainty that there will be no such reunion.\n\nWhile acknowledging Anderson's partial ownership of the Yes trademark, Yes warned of potential confusion for ticket-buyers created by the concurrent promotion of their newly named line-up through its use of the Yes name. Anderson has said of the name-change: \"The fans want it, we want it and it's our right to use the name\". Of Yes, Anderson said, \"we don't like them\", while Wakeman said, \"we have no interest in what they do.\" The forewarned confusion is highlighted in recent press references to the two groups as \"two versions\", \"two factions\" or \"two incarnations of Yes,\" and in one local media outlet, where their tours overlap, who states that \"Yes is coming... Twice.\"\n\nIn 2016, Yes performed \"Fragile\" and \"Drama\" in their entirety on their April–June European tour. Trevor Horn sang \"Tempus Fugit\" with the band for two UK shows. This was followed by \"Drama\" and sides one and four of \"Tales from Topographic Oceans\" performed across North America between July–September. White missed the latter tour after he underwent back surgery and needed time to recover which led to American drummer Jay Schellen taking his place. White returned to the group on a part-time basis on their 2016 Japanese tour that November; until February 2017 Schellen continued to sit in for White on most shows, with White playing on some songs. A live album from the tour, titled \"Topographic Drama – Live Across America\", was released in November 2017 and is Yes's first release not to feature Squire.\n\nHaving failed to pass the nomination stage twice, Yes was confirmed to be inducted into the 2017 class of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 20 December 2016; the musicians inducted were Anderson, Howe, Rabin, Squire, Rick Wakeman, Kaye, Bruford and White, incidentally the same line-up featured in the \"Union\" album and tour. They were inducted by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson of Rush in a ceremony held in New York City on 7 April 2017, where Anderson, Howe, Rabin, Wakeman, and White performed \"Roundabout\" (Rabin's second performance with the \"main\" Yes band since 1994, and since 2004 for Anderson and Wakeman) together with Lee on bass, and then \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", with Howe on bass. Bruford attended the ceremony, but did not perform, with Kaye as the only absent among the inductees.\n\nIn February 2017, Yes toured the US which included their headline spot at the 2017 edition of Cruise to the Edge, continuing to play \"Drama\" and half of \"Tales from Topographic Oceans\". They toured the US and Canada with the Yestival Tour from August to September 2017, performing at least one song from each album from \"Yes\" to \"Drama\". Howe's son Dylan has joined the band as a second drummer, the first time since the Union Tour that Yes had two drummers playing simultaneously. The last seven shows were cancelled following the unexpected death of Howe's son and Dylan's brother Virgil.\n\nYes will headline Cruise to the Edge between 3–9 February 2018. This is followed by a European tour in March in celebration of their fiftieth anniversary, playing half of \"Tales from Topographic Oceans\" and a selection of songs from their history. The two London dates will include an anniversary fan convention, which will include the release of a new version of \"Fly from Here\" with new lead vocals and mixes by Horn. Kaye will join the band as a guest second keyboardist for both events, marking his first performances with Yes since the Talk Tour in 1994.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the release of \"90125\", Yes released an extended single disco remix of \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\" called \"The Red and Blue Mix\" on cassette tape. A version of \"Leave It\" using scratching was on the b-side. This version was filmed and was an introduction video on a subsequent tour.\n\nVirgil Howe (son of Steve Howe) re-imagined Yes's music into a techno context album, \"Yes Remixes\" in 2003.\n\nIn 2005, Canadian DJ Max Graham released a remix of \"Owner of a Lonely Heart\", credited to Max Graham vs Yes. The song reached No. 9 in the UK.\n\nThere are several releases involving multiple members of Yes working outside of the band context. Those including at least three (current or former) Yes members are:\n\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n",
                "YES Network\n\nThe Yankees Entertainment and Sports Network (YES) is an American cable and satellite television regional sports network that is owned by 21st Century Fox (which owns a controlling 80% interest and serves as managing partner) and Yankee Global Enterprises (which owns the remaining 20%). Primarily serving New York City, New York and the surrounding metropolitan area, it broadcasts a variety of sports events, as well as magazine, documentary and discussion programs; however, its main emphasis is focused on games and team-related programs involving the New York Yankees of Major League Baseball (owned by minority partner Yankee Global), the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and New York City FC of Major League Soccer.\n\nYES Network's offices are based at the Chrysler Building in Midtown Manhattan. YES programs, including Yankees and Nets pre- and post-game shows, are produced in studios that are located in Stamford, Connecticut. The channel is available on cable and IPTV providers in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and parts of Pennsylvania; it is available nationally on some cable systems (as part of a designated sports tier), via satellite on DirecTV, and regionally on Frontier U-verse and Verizon FiOS and Cox Communications.\n\nYES is the product of a holding company founded in 1999 called YankeeNets, created out of a merger of the business operations of the Yankees and the then-New Jersey Nets. One of the reasons behind the operational merger was to allow both teams to gain better leverage over their own broadcast rights; each party believed that it would obtain better individual deals, if they negotiated the rights collectively.\n\nTwo years earlier in 1997, Cablevision – which at the time had owned the Nets' television broadcaster, SportsChannel New York (later known as Fox Sports Net New York, and now known as MSG Plus) – became the sole owner to the television rights of all seven Major League Baseball, NBA and NHL teams in the New York City market when it acquired the competing MSG Network (previously owned by Viacom through its 1994 purchase of the network's former parent Paramount Communications), which had held the broadcast rights to the Yankees since 1989. This led to monopoly-like tactics, including the shift of some games to the cable-exclusive MSG Metro Channels, which had very limited distribution as Cablevision, Comcast and Time Warner Cable routinely fought over carriage agreements. Cablevision attempted to buy the Yankees outright, but could not agree to acceptable terms with George Steinbrenner and his partners.\n\nYankeeNets discussed multiple options with potential partners to either stay with Cablevision or start its own network. The ultimate decision was to start its own network, ending the five-year monopoly that Cablevision had held on local New York sports. The Yankees' success in the late 1990s was a key factor in the decision, as it had become a much more valuable brand than ever before.\n\nYES launched on March 19, 2002, under the ownership of YankeeNets and Goldman Sachs, the latter of which served as minority partner. At that time, the network's current website domain, YesNetwork.com, was registered by a seminar training company called the \"Yes! Network.\" As a result, the YES cable channel temporarily used the domain \"yesnetworktv.com\" for its website, before negotiating a deal with the Yes! Network (which reassigned its domain to YesMidwest.com) to purchase the YesNetwork.com domain.\n\nIn late 2003, the Yankees and Nets decided to part ways, with the Nets being sold to a group led by real estate developer Bruce Ratner. The sale did not include the Nets' ownership stake in YES (NJ Holdings), which remained with the pre-merger owners of the team. As part of the sale, the Nets signed a long-term deal to keep the team's game telecasts on YES. In 2004, YankeeNets was renamed Yankee Global Enterprises LLC, which owns the Yankees and YES as separate companies. Therefore, the Yankees technically do not own YES. The Yankees, however, receive a rights fee from YES that is somewhat higher than MSG previously paid.\n\nIn early 2006, the design and maintenance of YesNetwork.com was taken over by Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM), the interactive unit of Major League Baseball which has operated the websites of other team-owned regional sports networks including the Mets' SportsNet New York, and (while that network was under the ownership of the Cleveland Indians) SportsTime Ohio. As a result, YES gained the streaming rights to carry a limited number of game highlights on its website, in addition to post-game interviews. In 2007, Goldman Sachs' share in the network was put up for sale for estate taxes reasons.\n\nIn November 2012, News Corporation agreed to terms on acquiring a 49% stake in YES. As a consequence, each of the network's previous owners had their ownership stakes reduced. As a result of the sale to Fox, the Yankees agreed to keep their games on the network through 2041, which would be the network's 40th year of existence. News Corporation's interest in YES was transferred to 21st Century Fox (owned by Rupert Murdoch, who also remained the owner of News Corporation), when the former company spun off its U.S. entertainment holdings into a separate company in July 2013.\n\nIn September 2013, YES began carrying national programming primarily intended for distribution to the Fox Sports regional networks, assuming the regional television rights to those programs from MSG Plus. On January 25, 2014, 21st Century Fox became the network's majority owner by purchasing an additional 31% share of YES Network, increasing the company's ownership interest from 49% to 80%.\n\nIn 2014, the YES Network announced an average 223,000 households in Yankees game broadcasts.\n\nOn May 14, 2017, YES Network aired Derek Jeter's number retirement ceremony. It got an average 724,000 viewers and a 5.79 rating in the New York City area, the highest non-game program for the network.\n\nOn December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company announced plans to acquire all 22 regional Fox Sports networks from 21st Century Fox, including the company's 80% stake in YES. Once the deal is approved, the networks will be rebranded under ESPN. YES would also become a corporate sibling to WABC-TV, and WEPN-AM/FM.\n\nIn addition to live coverage of Yankees and Nets games, their respective pre-game and post-game shows and (as circumstances warrant) live press conferences, YES has produced various original programs, some of which have won local New York Emmy Awards. Other original programming featured on YES includes: \n\nSince the network's debut, YES has aired select telecasts of the Yankees' minor league farm teams, primarily the Class-A (short season) Staten Island Yankees of the New York–Penn League. Those games are produced by YES, utilizing the same graphics and announcers as seen during game telecasts of the major league Yankees.\n\nFrom 2002 to 2006, YES also broadcast games from the Yankees' former Class-AAA team, the Columbus Clippers of the International League. Those games were produced locally in Columbus, Ohio. After the 2006 season, the Yankees ended their affiliation with the Clippers, and became affiliated with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Railriders (formerly the Yankees and Red Barons). YES has only televised one Railriders game, Masahiro Tanaka's minor league rehab start, the team also has local coverage within its Scranton/Wilkes-Barre market.\n\nThe network has also broadcast various college sports events including football and basketball games from the Ivy League, basketball games from the Big 12 Conference (through ESPN Plus) and rebroadcasts of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football games. It also carries the coaches' shows of Notre Dame and the Penn State Nittany Lions. In 2011, YES began airing live broadcasts of college basketball games involving the Fordham University. As part of the formation of its programming deal with Fox Sports Networks, in September 2013, YES began broadcasting select FSN-produced college sports events intended for national broadcast on its regional sports networks, including football and basketball games from the Atlantic Coast Conference.\n\nIn 2000, YankeeNets entered into a marketing agreement with the New York Giants; this included awarding YES the exclusive rights to the NFL franchise's magazine programs (including \"Giants Online\" and \"Giants on Deck\", which continued to air on the network after the YankeeNets breakup). The Giants' relationship with YES Network ended in 2007, at which time its team-related programming moved to Fox owned-and-operated station WNYW (channel 5) and MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated station WWOR-TV (channel 9), a duopoly owned by Fox Television Stations (whose sister company, the Fox network, owns broadcast rights to most games from the Giants home conference, the National Football Conference).\n\nYankeeNets also maintained a similar relationship with English football club Manchester United. YES broadcast tape-delayed and classic United games produced by the team-owned Manchester United TV in the network's earlier days.\n\nThe YES Network also produces Yankees game broadcasts shown over-the-air on WPIX-TV, using the same on-air talent seen on the cable network. From 2002 to 2004, WCBS-TV (channel 2) carried the Yankees broadcasts, while WLNY-TV (channel 55) held the local broadcast television rights to the Nets. The Yankees package is also simulcast on other television stations in the team's designated market region. YES also offers a Spanish-language feed of all of its Yankees game telecasts through the second audio program incorporated into most television sets, and cable and satellite converter boxes; this feed can also be heard on New York radio station WNSW ( AM), which holds the contract to carry the Yankees' Spanish-language broadcasts.\n\nThe network attempted to secure television rights to the New Jersey Devils, formerly owned by an affiliate of YankeeNets; after the team was sold to a different ownership group, the Devils opted to renew their contract with MSG Network and FSN New York in 2005, under a long-term agreement.\n\nYES broadcasts NBA TV's daily news and fantasy basketball shows (usually in the form of rebroadcasts, but occasionally showing live telecasts in the early morning drive time hours) and \"The Marv Albert Show\". For a couple of years during the early 2000s, YES and NBA TV also both aired reruns of the basketball-centered drama series \"The White Shadow\". The network also previously aired \"This Week in Baseball\" during the week throughout the Major League Baseball regular season, following each episode's original Saturday broadcast on Fox.\n\nAs part of a multi-year agreement with MP & Silva, YES aired tape delayed broadcasts of Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League matches involving Arsenal F.C.. In addition to airing Arsenal matches, the network aired select archived match telecasts, as well as the team's magazine shows, \"Arsenal World\" and \"Arsenal 360\". This agreement ended at the start of the 2012–13 Premier League season. Arsenal would get picked up by ONE World Sports while YES would gain partnership with Manchester City FC.\n\nIn December 2014, YES announced it had acquired local broadcast rights to New York City FC of Major League Soccer, a subsidiary of Manchester City FC; Yankee Global Enterprises owns a 20% minority stake in the club, which is majority-owned by City Football Group.\n\n\nSince the network's launch in 2002, longtime Yankee Stadium public address announcer Bob Sheppard has served as a continuity announcer for YES' network identifications and programming schedules. Recordings of Sheppard are still used occasionally even though Sheppard died in 2010. Ian Eagle also sometimes provides continuity for on-air promotions during the Nets season.\n\n\nYES2 is a gametime-only overflow feed of YES Network, which broadcasts select Nets games on rare occasions when the Nets and Yankees are scheduled to play at the same time. The feed is carried in both standard and high definition on most cable providers in the New York metropolitan area and nationwide on DirecTV.\n\nYES Network HD is a 1080i high definition simulcast feed of the network, which is carried on select cable providers (including Time Warner Cable, Comcast, Cablevision, DirecTV, RCN and Verizon FiOS). , YES is currently one of only three networks owned by YES majority owner 21st Century Fox (alongside regional sports networks Fox Sports Ohio and SportsTime Ohio; all three were acquisitions rather than Fox-launched networks) that transmit their HD simulcasts in 1080i, rather than the company's preferred 720p format.\n\nWhen it launched in mid-July 2004, YES HD initially only televised all Yankees home games, as well as away games involving the New York Mets and Boston Red Sox, in high definition. In 2005, YES began televising all Yankees games played east of the Mississippi River in high definition, with the network's HD telecasts expanding to encompass virtually all of the Yankees and Nets games in 2006. In addition to game telecasts, the network now also broadcasts all of its studio shows in HD. All YES-produced Yankees and Nets game telecasts aired on WWOR-TV began broadcasting in HD in September 2006; however while the HD feed of the games is available to these outlets, the HD telecasts were not necessarily distributed to television stations outside of the New York City area that simulcast WWOR's game broadcasts.\n\nIn April 2007, YES converted the aspect ratio of its primary standard definition feed from full-screen to a letterboxed format, which is a downconversion from the high definition feed. The network's use of the AFD #10 broadcast flag to transmit its HD feed in this manner for broadcast in SD predates its use by other national cable networks such as Fox News Channel, ESPN and CNN.\n\nYES Network borrowed time on Cablevision's \"iO TV 1300\" service and on DirecTV to carry the first baseball game ever transmitted in 3D on July 10 and 11, 2010, when the Yankees faced the Seattle Mariners; the 3D telecast of the game was also distributed to other cable providers.\n\nYES Network maintains a national feed available to select cable providers outside of the New York City market – including Time Warner Cable, Verizon FiOS (in certain markets) and Bright House Networks (on its systems in Tampa and Orlando). The feed does not include the network's live game telecasts (with alternate programming airing in their place), however it does carry the pre-game and post-game shows that bookend Yankees and Nets games aired by YES within the market. This feed differs from the satellite feed of the network available on DirecTV, in which Yankees and/or Nets games can be viewed outside of the teams' markets through a subscription to MLB Extra Innings and/or NBA League Pass.\n\nThe original graphics package used for the network's game telecasts consisted of a blue diamond, outlined in white in the upper left-handed corner of the screen. Red arrows, outlined in white, were placed around the diamond to indicate base-runners positioned at their respective bases. The team's initials were placed in a box next to their number of runs scored in the center of the diamond. The inning was placed above the score while the number of outs and current pitch count were placed below the score. The YES logo was placed at the bottom of the diamond, disappearing temporarily after incoming pitch speeds.\n\nFor the 2005 season, the on-screen scoreboard was modified slightly to remove the white outline around the blue diamond, which was given a darker more royal-blue shading; the arrows signifying the baserunners were now rendered in bright yellow. The team initials remained in the middle of the score bug, now only in silver boxes with the respective number of runs scored placed directly to the right in white-on-black backgrounds. The pitch count and number of outs became rendered in white on a black background. A small red capsule was incorporated as well, appearing next to the team currently at bat. In addition to being removed when the speed of a pitch was indicated, the YES logo at the bottom of the bug was replaced with a yellow rectangle with the banner title \"HOME RUN\" in bold capital letters whenever a home run was scored.\n\nThe network's score bug received a dramatic overhaul beginning with the 2006 Spring training period. The left-corner diamond design was replaced with a thin horizontal white-on-chrome banner placed across the top third of the screen. At far left, the banner featured a diamond indicating the runners at each base, which were outlined in blue and would feature a yellow glowing effect whenever a runner was positioned on that specific base. The game scores appeared to the right, with team initials placed in black boxes encased in a large rectangle featuring the team's colors. while number of runs scored by the respective team were displayed in black on a white background. The inning, number of outs and pitch count, in left to right order, were placed in small black rectangles. The YES logo, at far right, would slide to rightwards to display the most recent pitch speed. After each pitch, or after an out or run was scored, the appropriate box would flash blue to the appropriate statistic. After a home run was hit, the diamond would turn blue and display the abbreviation \"HR\" in the center.\n\nThe only subtle change to the score banner occurred in the 2007 season, as the bases within the diamond were now rendered in black; after a home run was scored, the diamond would turn black before displaying the \"HR\" abbreviation.\n\nThe network adopted a new graphics package in April 2010, on Opening Day of the 2010 Yankees season. The scoreboard graphic reverted to a bug encompassing only the top left portion of the screen. The team names (in their respective colors) and their corresponding score were now overlaid on white-to-black shaded bar, with the base diamond placed at far right. The inning count, outs, and pitching count (balls and strikes) was placed in a black graphical bar under the main banner; while the current pitcher's pitch count (in black text over a white background) was placed separately to the right. The latter area also is used to show the last pitch speed (displayed in black-over-yellow) for a few moments after each pitch. When a home run is hit, a \"HOME RUN\" text message along with the player's name scrolls to the left on a background corresponding to the respective team's colors, under which the player's home run count for the season (for example, \"7th HR of the season\") is denoted.\n\nBrooklyn Nets broadcasts use a variation of this package, with the YES logo rendered in black. Prior to the Nets' relocation from New Jersey to Brooklyn in 2012, the YES logo was displayed in red.\n\nAt its launch, YES became embroiled in a carriage dispute with Cablevision (which attempted to purchase the Yankees in 1998 and carried the team's games on MSG Network at the time of the channel's launch), leaving the Yankees' game telecasts not available to the provider's game telecasts for an entire year; this led the New York state government to intervene and serve as negotiator for a temporary carriage agreement between YES and Cablevision. In 2004, the two sides eventually signed a long-term contract to carry the network on Cablevision's New York area systems. This situation was very similar to another lengthy dispute that Cablevision entered into with MSG Network, after that network assumed the regional cable television rights to the Yankees in 1989 from Cablevision-owned SportsChannel New York.\n\nDish Network remains the only pay television provider available in the New York City area that does not carry YES Network. The satellite provider has indicated that it would not offer the network unless it negotiates a lower per-channel subscriber fee due to concerns that the rates the network offered could force the provider to increase the pricing of its programming packages. YES, however, has a most favored nation clause with all of its cable and satellite providers, in which all of the network's other carriage agreements would be voided if it lowered its subscriber rate for a single provider. Former YES minority owner Goldman Sachs also maintains an ownership stake in Dish Network parent Echostar.\n\nTime Warner Cable relocated YES from channel 30 to channel 53 on its New York City area systems in March 2008, soon after the New York City Council approved a measure to provide the Yankees public funding to build a new stadium. Simultaneously, Time Warner Cable moved business news channel Bloomberg Television to YES' former channel 30 slot, all while renegotiating its ten-year contract with Mayor Michael Bloomberg (owner of Bloomberg Television parent Bloomberg L.P.) and the city of New York.\n\nIn 2016, Comcast (who are part owners of Sportsnet New York) dropped the YES Network. The blackout ended on March 31, 2017, just in time for the start of the 2017 New York Yankees season.\n\nIn 2003, Don Zimmer (then employed with the Yankees as a bench coach) expressed criticism of team owner George Steinbrenner in interviews with certain local media outlets. After this came to light, it was later rumored that, in response, Steinbrenner ordered YES not to show Zimmer on-camera during its Yankee telecasts.\n\nIn April 2005, YES declined to broadcast pre-game Opening Day festivities celebrating the Boston Red Sox' 2004 World Series championship win prior to its telecast of a Red Sox home game against the Yankees at Fenway Park. YES was roundly criticized for this move, including its decision to use a fixed camera shot focused tightly on correspondent Kimberly Jones as she described the events surrounding her in general terms. Yankees players not only witnessed the ceremonies, but graciously applauded them from the top steps of their dugout. Perhaps due to this incident, YES broadcast the majority of the ceremonies honoring the Red Sox' celebration of the 100th Anniversary of Fenway Park in 2012.\n\nDuring the 2005 season, New York City area newspapers reported that the post-game questions asked to Yankees manager Joe Torre by Kimberly Jones were being sent to her by top-level team executives (quite possibly on directives from George Steinbrenner), and that Torre did not feel comfortable answering them. For the 2006 and 2007 seasons, Torre, who had been paid a fee by YES to give exclusive interviews after each Yankees game, ended his agreement with the network. YES now sends its reporter to the regular pre-game and post-game media sessions with other broadcast outlets.\n\n",
                "Yes and no\n\nYes and no, or word pairs with a similar usage\n, are expressions of the affirmative and the negative, respectively, in several languages including English. Some languages make distinction between answers to affirmative versus negative questions, thus may have triplet or quadruplets of words instead. English originally used a four-form system up to and including Early Middle English but Modern English has reduced this to a two-form system consisting of just 'yes' and 'no'. It exists in eye blink communication, Morse Code, sign language, and maybe in color coded flag communication. \n\nSome languages do not answer yes–no questions with single words meaning 'yes' or 'no'. Welsh and Finnish are among several languages that typically employ echo answers (repeating the verb with either an affirmative or negative form) rather than using words for 'yes' and 'no', though both languages do also have words broadly similar to 'yes' and 'no'. Other languages have systems named two-form, three-form, and four-form systems, depending on how many words for yes and no they employ. Some languages, such as Latin, do not have yes-no word systems.\n\nThe words \"yes\" and \"no\" are not easily classified into any of the eight conventional parts of speech. Although sometimes classified as interjections, they do not qualify as such, and they are not adverbs. They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right, sentence words, word sentences, or pro-sentences, although that category contains more than \"yes\" and \"no\" and not all linguists include them in their lists of sentence words. Sentences consisting solely of one of these two words are classified as minor sentences.\n\nThe differences among languages, the fact that in different languages the various words for \"yes\" and \"no\" have different parts of speech and different usages, and that some languages lack a 'yes-no' word system, makes idiomatic translation difficult.\n\nAlthough sometimes classified as interjections, these words do not always express emotion or act as calls for attention; they are not adverbs because they do not qualify any verb, adjective, or adverb. They are sometimes classified as a part of speech in their own right: sentence words or word sentences.\n\nThis is the position of Otto Jespersen, who states that \"'Yes' and 'No' [...] are to all intents and purposes sentences just as much as the most delicately balanced sentences ever uttered by Demosthenes or penned by Samuel Johnson.\"\n\nGeorg von der Gabelentz, Henry Sweet, and Philipp Wegener have all written on the subject of sentence words. Both Sweet and Wegener include \"yes\" and \"no\" in this category, with Sweet treating them separately from both imperatives and interjections, although Gabelentz does not.\n\nWatts classifies \"yes\" and \"no\" as grammatical particles, in particular \"response particles\". He also notes their relationship to the interjections \"oh\" and \"ah\", which is that the interjections can precede \"yes\" and \"no\" but not follow them. \"Oh\" as an interjection expresses surprise, but in the combined forms \"oh yes\" and \"oh no\" merely acts as an intensifier; but \"ah\" in the combined forms \"ah yes\" and \"ah no\" retains its standalone meaning, of focusing upon the previous speaker's or writer's last statement. The forms \"*yes oh\", \"*yes ah\", \"*no oh\", and \"*no ah\" are grammatically ill-formed. Aijmer similarly categorizes the \"yes\" and \"no\" as \"response signals\" or \"reaction signals\".\n\nAmeka classifies these two words in different ways according to context. When used as back-channel items, he classifies them as interjections; but when they are used as the responses to a yes-no question, he classifies them as formulaic words. The distinction between an interjection and a formula is, in Ameka's view, that the former does not have an addressee (although it may be directed at a person), whereas the latter does. The \"yes\" or \"no\" in response to the question is addressed at the interrogator, whereas \"yes\" or \"no\" used as a back-channel item is a \"feedback usage\", an utterance that is said to oneself. However, Sorjonen criticizes this analysis as lacking empirical work on the other usages of these words, in addition to interjections and feedback uses.\n\nBloomfield and Hockett classify the words, when used to answer yes-no questions, as \"special completive interjections\". They classify sentences comprising solely one of these two words as minor sentences.\n\nSweet classifies the words in several ways. They are sentence-modifying adverbs, adverbs that act as modifiers to an entire sentence. They are also sentence words, when standing alone. They may, as question responses, also be absolute forms that correspond to what would otherwise be the \"not\" in a negated echo response. For example, a \"No.\" in response to the question \"Is he here?\" is equivalent to the echo response \"He is not here.\" Sweet observes that there is no correspondence with a simple \"yes\" in the latter situation, although the sentence-word \"Certainly.\" provides an absolute form of an emphatic echo response \"He is certainly here.\" Many other adverbs can also be used as sentence words in this way.\n\nUnlike \"yes\", \"no\" can also be an adverb of degree, applying to adjectives solely in the comparative (e.g. \"no greater\", \"no sooner\", but not \"no soon\" or \"no soonest\"), and an adjective when applied to nouns (e.g. \"He is no fool.\" and Dyer's \"No clouds, no vapours intervene.\").\n\nGrammarians of other languages have created further, similar, special classifications for these types of words. Tesnière classifies the French \"oui\" and \"non\" as \"phrasillons logiques\" (along with \"voici\"). Fonagy observes that such a classification may be partly justified for the former two, but suggests that \"pragmatic holophrases\" is more appropriate.\n\nWhile Modern English has a \"two-form system\" of \"yes\" and \"no\" for affirmatives and negatives, earlier forms of English had a \"four-form system\", comprising the words \"yea\", \"nay\", \"yes\", and \"no\". In essence, \"yes\" and \"no\" were the responses to a question posed in the negative, whereas \"yea\" and \"nay\" were the responses to positively framed questions.\n\nThis is exemplified by the following passage from Much Ado about Nothing:\nBenedick's answer of \"yea\" is a correct application of the rule, but as observed by W. A. Wright \"Shakespeare does not always observe this rule, and even in the earliest times the usage appears not to have been consistent.\" Furness gives as an example the following, where Hermia's answer should, in following the rule, have been \"yes\":\nThis subtle grammatical feature of Early Modern English is recorded by Sir Thomas More in his critique of William Tyndale's translation of the New Testament into Early Modern English, which was then quoted as an authority by later scholars:\n\nIn fact, More's exemplification of the rule actually contradicts his statement of what the rule is. This went unnoticed by scholars such as Horne Tooke, Robert Gordon Latham, and Trench, and was first pointed out by George Perkins Marsh in his \"Century Dictionary\", where he corrects More's incorrect statement of the first rule, \"\"No\" aunswereth the question framed by the affirmative.\", to read \"nay\". That even More got the rule wrong, even while himself dressing down Tyndale for getting it wrong, is seen by Furness as evidence that the four word system was \"too subtle a distinction for practice\".\n\nMarsh found no evidence of a four-form system in Mœso-Gothic, although he reported finding \"traces\" in Old English. He observed that in the Anglo-Saxon Gospels,\n\nMarsh calls this four-form system of Early Modern English a \"needless subtlety\". Tooke called it a \"ridiculous distinction\", with Marsh concluding that Tooke believed Thomas More to have simply made this rule up and observing that Tooke is not alone in his disbelief of More. Marsh, however, points out (having himself analyzed the works of John Wycliffe, Geoffrey Chaucer, John Gower, John Skelton, and Robert of Gloucester, and \"Piers Ploughman\" and \"Le Morte d'Arthur\") that the distinction both existed and was generally and fairly uniformly observed in Early Modern English from the time of Chaucer to the time of Tyndale. But after the time of Tyndale, the four-form system was rapidly replaced by the modern two-form system.\n\nSeveral languages have a \"three-form system\", with two affirmative words and one negative. In a three-form system, the affirmative response to a positively phrased question is the unmarked affirmative, the affirmative response to a negatively phrased question is the marked affirmative, and the negative response to both forms of question is the (single) negative. For example, in Norwegian the affirmative answer to \"Snakker du norsk?\" (\"Do you speak Norwegian?\") is \"Ja\", and the affirmative answer to \"Snakker du ikke norsk?\" (\"Do you not speak Norwegian?\") is \"Jo\", while the negative answer to \"both\" questions is \"Nei\".\n\nDanish, Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroese, Hungarian, German, Dutch, and French all have three-form systems. Swedish and Danish have \"ja\", \"jo\", and \"nej\". Norwegian has \"ja\", \"jo\"/\"jau\", and \"nei\". Icelandic has \"já\", \"jú\" and \"nei\". Faroese has \"ja\", \"jú\" and \"nei\". Hungarian has \"igen\", \"de\", and \"nem\". German has \"ja\", \"doch\", and \"nein\". Dutch has \"ja\", \"jawel\", and \"nee\". French has \"oui\", \"si\", and \"non\".\n\nSwedish, and to some extent Danish and Norwegian, also has additional forms \"javisst\" and \"jovisst\", analogous to \"ja\" and \"jo\", to indicate a strong affirmative response. Swedish (and Danish slang) also have the forms \"joho\" and \"nehej\", which both indicate stronger response than \"jo\" or \"nej\". \"Jo\" can also be used as an emphatic contradiction of a negative statement.\n\nLike Early Modern English, the Romanian language has a four-form system. The affirmative and negative responses to positively phrased questions are \"da\" and \"nu\", respectively. But in responses to negatively phrased questions they are prefixed with \"ba\" (i.e. \"ba da\" and \"ba nu\"). \"nu\" is also used as a negation adverb, infixed between subject and verb. Thus, for example, the affirmative response to the negatively phrased question \"N-ai plătit?\" (\"Didn't you pay?\") is \"Ba da.\" (\"Yes.\"—i.e. \"I did pay.\"), and the negative response to a positively phrased question beginning \"Se poate să ...?\" (\"Is it possible to ...?\") is \"Nu, nu se poate.\" (\"No, it is not possible.\"—note the use of \"nu\" for both \"no\" and negation of the verb.)\n\nBloomfield and Hockett observe that not all languages have \"special completive interjections\". Finnish does not generally answer yes-no questions with either adverbs or interjections but answers them with a repetition of the verb in the question, negating it if the answer is the negative. (This is an echo response.) The answer to \"Tuletteko kaupungista?\" (\"Are you coming from town?\") is the verb form itself, \"Tulemme.\" (\"We are coming.\")\n\nNegative questions are answered similarly. Negative answers are just the negated verb form. The answer to \"Tunnetteko herra Lehdon?\" (\"Do you know Mr Lehto?\") is \"En tunne\" (\"I don't know.\") or simply \"En.\" (\"I don't.\"). However, Finnish also has particle words for \"yes\": \"Kyllä\" (formal) and \"joo\" (very colloquial). A yes-no question can be answered \"yes\" with either \"kyllä\" or \"joo\", which are not conjugated according to the person and plurality of the verb. \"Ei\", however, is always conjugated and means \"no\".\n\nUp until the 16th century Latvian also didn't have a word for \"yes\" and the common way of responding affirmatively to a question was by repeating the question's verb, just like in Finnish. The modern day \"jā\" was borrowed from Middle High German \"ja\" and first appeared in 16th-century religious texts, especially catechisms, in answers to questions about faith. At that time such works were usually translated from German by non-Latvians that had learned Latvian as a foreign language. By the 17th century \"jā\" was being used by some Latvian speakers that lived near the cities, and more frequently when speaking to non-Latvians, but they would revert back to agreeing by repeating the question verb when talking among themselves. By the 18th century the use of \"jā\" was still of low frequency, and in Northern Vidzeme the word was almost non-existant till the 18th and early 19th century. Only in the mid-19th century did \"jā\" really become usual eveywhere.\n\nIt is often said falsely that Welsh has no words at all for \"yes\" and \"no\". It has \"ie\" and \"nage\". However, these are used only in specialized circumstances and are but some of the \"many\" ways in Welsh of saying yes or no. As in Finnish, the main way to state yes or no, in answer to yes-no questions, is to echo the verb of the question. So the answers to \"'\" (\"Is Ffred coming?\") are either \"'\" (\"He is (coming).\") or \"'\" (\"He is not (coming)\"). In general, the negative answer is the positive answer combined with \"nag\". As in Finnish, this avoids the issue of what an unadorned \"yes\" means in response to a negative question. While a \"yes\" response to the question \"You don't like strawberries?\" is ambiguous in English, the Welsh response ' has no ambiguity. The same would apply for Finnish, where the question would be answered with \"\" (I don't). For more information on \"yes\" and \"no\" answers to yes-no questions in Welsh, see Jones, listed in further reading.\n\nThe Goidelic languages (Irish, Scottish Gaelic and Manx) do not have words for \"yes\" or \"no\" at all. Instead, an echo response of the main verb used to ask the question is used. Sometimes, one of the words meaning \"to be\" (Irish ' or ', see Irish syntax § The forms meaning \"to be\"; Scottish Gaelic ' or ' see Scottish Gaelic grammar § verbs; Manx ' or ') is used. For example, the Irish question \"'\" (\"Is he coming?\") may be answered \"\"\"\" (\"Is\") or \"\"\"\" (\"Is not\"). More frequently, another verb will be used. For example, to respond to \"'\" (\"Did he hear?\"), \"'\" (\"Heard\") or \"'\" (\"Did not hear\") are used. Irish people frequently give echo answers in English as well, e.g. \"Did you hear?\" Answer \"I heard/I did\". This also happens in the Galician language.\n\nLatin has no single words for \"yes\" and \"no\". Their functions as intensifiers and interjections are taken up by using the vocative case. Their functions as word sentence responses to yes-no questions are taken up by \"sentence adverbs\", single adverbs that are sentence modifiers and also used as word sentences. There are several such adverbs classed as truth-value adverbs—including \"certe\", \"fortasse\", \"nimirum\", \"plane\", \"vero\", \"etiam\", \"sane\", \"minime\", and \"videlicet\". They express the speaker's/writer's feelings about the truth value of a proposition. They, in conjunction with the negator \"non\", are used as responses to yes-no questions. For example:\n\nLatin also employs echo responses.\n\nSpeakers of Chinese use echo responses as well. In all languages, yes-no questions are often posed in A-not-A form, and the replies to such questions are echo answers that echo either \"A\" or \"not A\". In Mandarin Chinese, the closest equivalents to \"yes\" and \"no\" are to state \"是\" (\"shì\"; lit. \"is\") and \"不是\" (\"búshì\"; lit. \"not is\"). (In Cantonese, the preceding are 係 \"hai6\" and 唔係 \"m4 hai6\", respectively.) The phrase 不要 (buyào; lit. \"(I) do not want\") may also be used for the interjection \"no\".\n\nJapanese also lacks words for \"yes\" and \"no\". The words \"はい\" (\"hai\") and \"いいえ\" (\"iie\") are mistaken by English speakers for equivalents to \"yes\" and \"no\", but they actually signify agreement or disagreement with the proposition put by the question: \"That's right.\" or \"That's not right.\" For example: If asked, \"行かないのですか\" (\"ikanai no desu ka\" / \"Are you not going?\"), answering with the affirmative \"はい\" would mean \"Right, I am \"not\" going\"; whereas in English, answering \"yes\" would be to contradict the negative question. Echo responses are not uncommon in Japanese.\n\nThe words for \"yes\" and \"no\" in some languages originate from a process of devaluation and semantic erosion. The Hungarian strong affirmative \"persze\" was originally the Latin phrase \"per se intelligitur\" (\"it stands to reason\"), for example. German \"nein\" similarly is derived from the Old High German \"ni ein\", which means \"not a single one\". (In Latin, \"non\" similarly devolved from \"noenum\", which also means \"not one\".) The French \"oui\" was formerly \"oïl\" (after which Langue d'oïl is named), which, in turn, came from the Vulgar Latin \"hoc ille\", meaning \"this one\" (\"it is\" this one).\n\nIn Spanish, the words \"sí\" (yes) and \"no\" (no) are unambiguously classified as adverbs: not only do they serve as answers to questions; they also modify verbs. The affirmative \"sí\" can replace the verb after a negation (\"Yo no tengo carro, pero él sí = \"I don't own a car, but he does) or intensify it (\"I don't believe he owns a car. / He does own one!\" = \"No creo que él tenga carro. / ¡Sí lo tiene!\"). The word \"no\" is the standard adverb placed next to a verb to negate it (\"Yo no tengo carro\" = \"I don't own a car\"). Double negation is normal and valid in Spanish, and it is interpreted as reinforcing the negation (\"No tengo ningún carro\" = \"I own no car\").\n\nThese differences between languages make translation difficult. No two languages are isomorphic, even at the elementary level of words for \"yes\" and \"no\". Translation from two-form to three-form systems is something that English-speaking schoolchildren learning French or German soon encounter. But the mapping is not even as simple as converting two forms into three. There are many idioms, such as reduplication (in French, German, and Italian) of affirmatives for emphasis (the German \"ja ja ja\").\n\nFurthermore, the mappings are one-to-many in both directions. The German \"ja\" has no fewer than 13 English equivalents that vary according to context and usage (\"yes\", \"yeah\", and \"no\" when used as an answer; \"well\", \"all right\", \"so\", and \"now\", when used for segmentation; \"oh\", \"ah\", \"uh\", and \"eh\" when used an interjection; and \"do you\", \"will you\", and their various inflections when used as a marker for tag questions) for example. Moreover, both \"ja\" and \"doch\" are frequently used as additional particles for conveying nuanced meaning where, in English, no such particle exists. Straightforward, non-idiomatic, translations from German to English and then back to German can often result in the loss of all of the modal particles such as \"ja\" and \"doch\" from a text.\n\nTranslation from languages that have word systems to those that do not, such as Latin, is similarly problematic. As Calvert says, \"Saying yes or no takes a little thought in Latin\".\n\nThere are many variants of \"yes\" and \"no\" in English. Two such spoken forms are transcribed into writing as \"uh-huh\" or \"mm-hmm\" (\"yes\", with a rise in pitch on the second syllable) and \"uh-uh\" or \"mm-mm\" (\"no\", with a fall in pitch on the second syllable). Their sounds are a nasal or non-nasal sound interrupted by a voiceless breathy interval for \"yes\", and by a glottal stop for \"no\". These forms are particularly useful for speakers who are at a given time unable to articulate the actual words \"yes\" and \"no\".\n\nThe word \"\"aye\"\" (pronounced , like \"eye\") is a frequent synonym for \"yes\", particularly in Scotland, Ireland, and Northern England, although not always officially acknowledged as such. In December 1993, a witness in a Scottish court who had answered \"aye\" to confirm he was the person summoned was told by the Sheriff that he must answer either \"yes\" or \"no\". When his name was read again and he was asked to confirm it, he answered \"aye\" again, and was imprisoned for 90 minutes for contempt of court. On his release he said, \"I genuinely thought I was answering him.\"\n\n\"Aye\" is also a common word in parliamentary procedure. In the House of Commons and House of Lords of the British parliament, MPs or Lords vote orally on debates or legislations by saying \"aye\" or \"no\" to indicate they approve or disapprove of the measure. In the Parliament of Canada, the terms \"yea\" and \"nay\" are used instead. These and other Westminster system parliaments including those of Australia and New Zealand generally use the same or similar terms to designate positions during a formal division of the assembly that generally follows a challenged vote.\n\nIn naval language, the phrase Aye aye, sir is used to acknowledge a direct order, and indicates the speaker both understands the order and will comply with it; a single \"aye\" is a synonym for \"yes\" and simply indicates agreement.\n\nAnother affirmative phrase is \"why-aye man\" (alternatively \"whey-aye\" or \"wey-aye\") which is commonly found in Tyne and Wear, but can be heard well up into the north of Northumberland, south as far as Bishop Auckland and west into the Tyne Valley. It is an informal phrase used to express affirmation in situations where a simple \"\"aye\"\" would not be enough.\n\n\"Aye\" is not to be confused with the archaic term \"\"ay\"\" (pronounced , as in \"hay\"), which is used poetically to mean \"for ever\" or \"eternally\". \nIt is also sometimes also spelled \"aye\"; the spelling of \"aye\" and \"ay\" for the two meanings \"yes\" or \"for ever\" varies according to different authorities, and may be interchangeable in common usage.\n\n\n"

                "Veganism\n\nVeganism is both the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals. A follower of either the diet or the philosophy is known as a vegan ( ). Distinctions are sometimes made between several categories of veganism. \"Dietary vegans\" (or strict vegetarians) refrain from consuming animal products, not only meat but also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived substances. The term \"ethical vegan\" is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of animals for any purpose. Another term is \"environmental veganism\", which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.\n\nWell-planned vegan diets can reduce the risk of some types of chronic disease, including heart disease. They are regarded as appropriate for all stages of life including during infancy and pregnancy by the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the British Dietetic Association. The German Society for Nutrition does not recommend vegan diets for children, adolescents nor during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron and phytochemicals; and lower in dietary energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc and vitamin B. Unbalanced vegan diets may lead to nutritional deficiencies that nullify any beneficial effects and may cause serious health issues. Some of these deficiencies can only be prevented through the choice of fortified foods or the regular intake of dietary supplements. Vitamin B supplementation is especially important because its deficiency causes blood disorders and potentially irreversible neurological damage.\n\nDonald Watson coined the term \"vegan\" in 1944 when he co-founded the Vegan Society in England. At first he used it to mean \"non-dairy vegetarian\", but from 1951 the Society defined it as \"the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals\". Interest in veganism increased in the 2010s. More vegan stores opened and vegan options became increasingly available in supermarkets and restaurants in many countries.\n\nThe origin of the English term \"vegetarian\" is unknown. The earliest-known use is attributed to the actress Fanny Kemble, writing around 1839 in Georgia in the United States. The practice can be traced to Indus valley civilization in 3300–1300 BCE Ancient India. Early vegetarians included Indian philosophers such as Mahavira and Acharya Kundakunda, the Indian poet Valluvar, the Indian emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Ashoka; Greek philosophers such as Empedocles, Theophrastus, Plutarch, Plotinus, and Porphyry; and the Roman poet Ovid, the playwright Seneca the Younger. The Greek sage Pythagoras may have advocated an early form of strict vegetarianism, but his life is so obscure that it is disputed whether he ever advocated any form of vegetarianism at all. He almost certainly prohibited his followers from eating beans and from wearing woolen garments and Eudoxus of Cnidus, a student of Archytas, writes that \"Pythagoras was distinguished by such purity and so avoided killing and killers that he not only abstained from animal foods, but even kept his distance from cooks and hunters.\" The earliest known vegan was the Arab poet Al-Maʿarri (). Their arguments were based on health, the transmigration of souls, animal welfare, and the view—espoused by Porphyry in \"De Abstinentia ab Esu Animalium\" (\"On Abstinence from Animal Food\", )—that if humans deserve justice, so do animals.\n\nVegetarianism established itself as a significant movement in 19th-century England and the United States. A minority of vegetarians avoided animal food entirely. In 1813 the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley published \"A Vindication of Natural Diet\", advocating \"abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors\", and in 1815 William Lambe, a London physician, claimed that his \"water and vegetable diet\" could cure anything from tuberculosis to acne. Lambe called animal food an \"habitual irritation\", and argued that \"milk eating and flesh eating are but branches of a common system, and they must stand or fall together\". Sylvester Graham's meatless Graham diet—mostly fruit, vegetables, water and bread made at home with stoneground flour—became popular as a health remedy in the 1830s in the United States. Several vegan communities were established around this time. In Massachusetts Amos Bronson Alcott, father of the novelist Louisa May Alcott, opened the Temple School in 1834 and Fruitlands in 1844, and in England James Pierrepont Greaves founded the Concordium, a vegan community at Alcott House on Ham Common, in 1838.\n\nIn 1843 members of Alcott House created the British and Foreign Society for the Promotion of Humanity and Abstinence from Animal Food, led by Sophia Chichester, a wealthy benefactor of Alcott House. Alcott House also helped to establish the UK Vegetarian Society, which held its first meeting in 1847 in Ramsgate, Kent. \"The Medical Times and Gazette\" in London reported in 1884:\n\nThere are two kinds of Vegetarians—one an extreme form, the members of which eat no animal food whatever; and a less extreme sect, who do not object to eggs, milk, or fish. The Vegetarian Society ... belongs to the latter more moderate division.\n\nAn article in the Society's magazine, the \"Vegetarian Messenger\", in 1851 discussed alternatives to shoe leather, which suggests the presence of vegans within the membership who rejected animal use entirely, not only in diet. The first known vegan cookbook, Rupert H. Wheldon's \"No Animal Food: Two Essays and 100 Recipes\", was published in London in 1910. The consumption of milk and eggs became a battleground over the following decades. There were regular discussions about it in the \"Vegetarian Messenger\"; it appears from the correspondence pages that many opponents of veganism came from vegetarians.\n\nDuring a visit to London in 1931, Mahatma Gandhi—who had joined the Vegetarian Society's executive committee when he lived in London from 1888 to 1891—gave a speech to the Society arguing that it ought to promote a meat-free diet as a matter of morality, not health. Lacto-vegetarians acknowledged the ethical consistency of the vegan position but regarded a vegan diet as impracticable and were concerned that it might be an impediment to spreading vegetarianism if vegans found themselves unable to participate in social circles where no non-animal food was available. This became the predominant view of the Vegetarian Society, which in 1935 stated: \"The lacto-vegetarians, on the whole, do not defend the practice of consuming the dairy products except on the ground of expediency.\"\n\nIn August 1944 several members of the Vegetarian Society asked that a section of its newsletter be devoted to non-dairy vegetarianism. When the request was turned down, Donald Watson, secretary of the Leicester branch, set up a new quarterly newsletter in November 1944, priced tuppence. He called it \"The Vegan News\". He chose the word \"vegan\" himself, based on \"the first three and last two letters of 'vegetarian [..] because it marked, in Mr Watson's words, \"the beginning and end of vegetarian\", but asked his readers if they could think of anything better than \"vegan\" to stand for \"non-dairy vegetarian\". They suggested \"allvega\", \"neo-vegetarian\", \"dairyban\", \"vitan\", \"benevore\", \"sanivores\" and \"beaumangeur\".\n\nThe first edition attracted more than 100 letters, including from George Bernard Shaw, who resolved to give up eggs and dairy. The new Vegan Society held its first meeting in early November at the Attic Club, 144 High Holborn, London. Those in attendance were Donald Watson, Elsie B. Shrigley, Fay K. Henderson, Alfred Hy Haffenden, Paul Spencer and Bernard Drake, with Mme Pataleewa (Barbara Moore, a Russian-British engineer) observing. World Vegan Day is held every 1 November to mark the founding of the Society.\n\"The Vegan News\" changed its name to \"The Vegan\" in November 1945, by which time it had 500 subscribers. It published recipes and a \"vegan trade list\" of animal-free products, such as Colgate toothpaste, Kiwi shoe polish, Dawson & Owen stationery and Gloy glue. Vegan books appeared, including \"Vegan Recipes\" by Fay K. Henderson and \"Aids to a Vegan Diet for Children\" by Kathleen V. Mayo.\n\nThe Vegan Society soon made clear that it rejected the use of animals for any purpose, not only in diet. In 1947 Watson wrote: \"The vegan renounces it as superstitious that human life depends upon the exploitation of these creatures whose feelings are much the same as our own ...\". From 1948 \"The Vegan\"'s front page read: \"Advocating living without exploitation\", and in 1951 the Society published its definition of \"veganism\" as \"the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals.\" In 1956 its vice-president, Leslie Cross, founded the Plantmilk Society, and in 1965, as Plantmilk Ltd and later Plamil Foods, it began production of one of the first widely distributed soy milks in the Western world.\n\nThe first vegan society in the United States was founded in 1948 by Catherine Nimmo and Rubin Abramowitz in California, who distributed Watson's newsletter. In 1960 H. Jay Dinshah founded the American Vegan Society (AVS), linking veganism to the concept of \"ahimsa\", \"non-harming\" in Sanskrit. According to Joanne Stepaniak, the word \"vegan\" was first published independently in 1962 by the \"Oxford Illustrated Dictionary\", defined as \"a vegetarian who eats no butter, eggs, cheese or milk\".\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s a vegetarian food movement emerged as part of the counterculture in the United States that focused on concerns about diet, the environment and a distrust of food producers, leading to increasing interest in organic gardening. One of the most influential vegetarian books of that time was Frances Moore Lappé's 1971 text, \"Diet for a Small Planet\". It sold more than three million copies and suggested \"getting off the top of the food chain\".\n\nThe following decades saw research by a group of scientists and doctors in the United States, including physicians Dean Ornish, Caldwell Esselstyn, Neal D. Barnard, John A. McDougall, Michael Greger and biochemist T. Colin Campbell, who argued that diets based on animal fat and animal protein, such as the Western pattern diet, were detrimental to health. They produced a series of books that recommend vegan or vegetarian diets, including McDougall's \"The McDougall Plan\" (1983), John Robbins's \"Diet for a New America\" (1987), which associated meat eating with environmental damage, and \"Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease\" (1990). In 2003 two major North American dietitians' associations indicated that well-planned vegan diets were suitable for all life stages. This was followed by the film \"Earthlings\" (2005), Campbell's \"The China Study\" (2005), Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin's \"Skinny Bitch\" (2005), Jonathan Safran Foer's \"Eating Animals\" (2009), and the film \"Forks over Knives\" (2011).\n\nIn the 1980s veganism became associated with punk subculture and ideologies, particularly straight edge hardcore punk in the United States and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom. This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe.\n\nThe vegan diet became increasingly mainstream in the 2010s. The European Parliament defined the meaning of \"vegan\" for food labels in 2010, in force as of 2015. Chain restaurants began marking vegan items on their menus and supermarkets improved their selection of vegan processed food. The English Wikipedia article on veganism was viewed 73,000 times in August 2009 but 145,000 times in August 2013. Articles on veganism were viewed more during this period than articles on vegetarianism in the English, French, German, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish Wikipedias.\n\nThe global mock-meats market increased by eighteen percent between 2005 and 2010, and in the United States by eight percent between 2012 and 2015, to $553 million a year. \"De Vegetarische Slager\", the first known vegetarian butcher shop, selling mock meats, opened in the Netherlands in 2010, while America's first vegan butcher, the Herbivorous Butcher, opened in Minneapolis in 2016. By 2016, forty-nine percent of Americans were drinking plant milk, although 91 percent still drank dairy milk. In the United Kingdom the plant milk market increased by 155 percent in two years, from 36 million litres in 2011 to 92 million in 2013. In 2011 Europe's first vegan supermarkets appeared in Germany: Vegilicious in Dortmund and Veganz in Berlin.\nCountering the image of self-deprivation projected by vegan straight edges and animal rights activists, veganism was promoted as glamorous; in 2015 the editor of Yahoo! Food declared that it had become \"a thing\". Celebrities, athletes and politicians adopted vegan diets, some seriously, some part-time. The idea of the \"flexi-vegan\" gained currency: \"New York Times\" food columnist Mark Bittman, in \"VB6\" (2013), recommended eating vegan food until 6 pm. In 2013, the Oktoberfest in Munich, traditionally a meat-heavy affair, offered vegan dishes for the first time in its 200-year history.\n\nCritics of veganism questioned the evolutionary legitimacy and health effects of a vegan diet, and pointed to longstanding philosophical traditions which held that humans are superior to other animals. Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain wrote in 2000 that \"Vegetarians, and their Hezbollah-like splinter-faction, the vegans, are a persistent irritant to any chef worth a damn.\" Several vegetarian writers argued that the restrictions of a vegan lifestyle are impractical, and that vegetarianism is a better goal.\n\n\nVegans do not eat beef, pork, poultry, fowl, game, seafood, eggs, dairy, or any other animal products. Dietary vegans might use animal products in clothing (as leather, wool, and silk), toiletries and similar. Ethical veganism extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or use of animal products. Vegans reject the commodification of animals. The British Vegan Society will certify a product only if it is free of animal involvement as far as possible and practical, including animal testing, but \"recognises that it is not always possible to make a choice that avoids the use of animals\".\n\nAn important concern is the case of medications, which are routinely tested on animals to ensure they are effective and safe, and may also contain animal ingredients, such as lactose, gelatine, or stearates. There may be no alternatives to prescribed medication or these alternatives may be unsuitable, less effective, or have more adverse side effects. Experimentation with laboratory animals is also used for evaluating the safety of vaccines, food additives, cosmetics, household products, workplace chemicals, and many other substances.\n\nPhilosopher Gary Steiner argues that it is not possible to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are \"deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society\". Animal products in common use include albumen, allantoin, beeswax, blood, bone char, bone china, carmine, casein, castoreum, cochineal, elastin, emu oil, gelatin, honey, isinglass, keratin, lactic acid, lanolin, lard, rennet, retinol, shellac, squalene, tallow/sodium tallowate, whey and yellow grease. Some of these are chemical compounds that can be derived from animal products, plants, or petrochemicals. Allantoin, lactic acid, retinol and squalene, for example, can be vegan. These products and their origins are not always included in the list of ingredients.\n\nSome vegans will not buy woollen jumpers, silk scarves, leather shoes, bedding that contains goose down or duck feathers, pearl jewellery, seashells, ordinary soap (usually made of animal fat), or cosmetics that contain animal products. They avoid certain vaccines; the flu vaccine, for example, is usually grown in hens' eggs, although an effective alternative, Flublok, is widely available in the United States. Non-vegan items acquired before they became vegan might be donated to charity or used until worn out. Some vegan clothes, in particular leather alternatives, are made of petroleum-based products, which has triggered criticism because of the environmental damage involved in their production.\n\nThe main difference between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude dairy products. Ethical vegans avoid them on the premise that their production causes animal suffering and premature death. In egg production, most male chicks are culled because they do not lay eggs. To obtain milk from dairy cattle, cows are made pregnant to induce lactation; they are kept lactating for three to seven years, then slaughtered. Female calves are separated from their mothers within 24 hours of birth, and fed milk replacer to retain the cow's milk for human consumption. Male calves are slaughtered at birth, sent for veal production, or reared for beef.\n\nVegan groups disagree about insect products. Neither the Vegan Society nor the American Vegan Society considers honey, silk, and other insect products as suitable for vegans, while Vegan Outreach view it as a matter of personal choice. The Vegan Society recommend date syrup, maple syrup, molasses, butterscotch syrup, golden syrup and agave nectar as alternatives to honey. Insect products can be defined much more widely, as commercial bees are used to pollinate about 100 different food crops, including almonds, avocado, broccoli, cucumbers, peaches, pears, sunflowers and tomatoes.\n\nVegan diets are based on grains and other seeds, legumes (particularly beans), fruits, vegetables, edible mushrooms, and nuts. Meatless products based on soybeans (tofu), or wheat-based seitan are sources of plant protein, commonly in the form of vegetarian sausage, mince, and veggie burgers.\n\nDishes based on soybeans are a staple of vegan diets because soybeans are a complete protein; this means they contain all the essential amino acids for humans and can be relied upon entirely for protein intake. They are consumed most often in the form of soy milk and tofu (bean curd), which is soy milk mixed with a coagulant. Tofu comes in a variety of textures, depending on water content, from firm, medium firm and extra firm for stews and stir-fries to soft or silken for salad dressings, desserts and shakes. Soy is also eaten in the form of tempeh and texturized vegetable protein (TVP); also known as textured soy protein (TSP), the latter is often used in pasta sauces.\n\nPlant milks—such as soy milk, almond milk, grain milks (oat milk and rice milk), hemp milk and coconut milk—are used in place of cows' or goats' milk. Soy milk provides around 7 g of protein per cup (240 mL or 8 fl oz), compared with 8 g of protein per cup of cow's milk. Almond milk is lower in dietary energy, carbohydrates and protein. Soy milk should not be used as a replacement for breast milk for babies. Babies who are not breastfed may be fed commercial infant formula, normally based on cows' milk or soy. The latter is known as soy-based infant formula or SBIF.\n\nButter can be replaced with a vegan alternative such as Earth Balance's. Vegan (egg-free) mayonnaise brands include Vegenaise, Nayonaise, Mindful Mayo, and Plamil's Egg-Free Mayonnaise. Vegan cheeses, such as Chreese and Daiya, are made from soy, nuts and tapioca, and can replace the meltability of dairy cheese. Nutritional yeast is a common substitute for the taste of cheese in vegan recipes. Cheese substitutes can be made at home.\n\nCommercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg replacer and Ener-G egg replacer, are available for cooking and baking. The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a tablespoon of baking powder can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a tablespoon of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water, and half a tablespoon of baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, it can even be whipped up like egg whites.\n\nRaw veganism, combining veganism and raw foodism, excludes all animal products and food cooked above 48 °C (118 °F). A raw vegan diet includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, grain and legume sprouts, seeds and sea vegetables. There are many variations of the diet, including fruitarianism.\n\nProteins are composed of amino acids. Vegans obtain all their protein from plants, omnivores usually a third, and ovo-lacto vegetarians half. Sources of plant protein include legumes such as soy beans (consumed as tofu, tempeh, texturized vegetable protein, soy milk and edamame), peas, peanuts, black beans and chickpeas (the latter often eaten as hummus); grains such as quinoa (pronounced \"keenwa\"), brown rice, corn, barley, bulgur and wheat (the latter eaten as bread and seitan); and nuts and seeds. Combinations that contain high amounts of all the essential amino acids include rice and beans, corn and beans, and hummus and whole-wheat pita.\n\nSoy beans and quinoa are known as complete proteins because they each contain all the essential amino acids in amounts that meet or exceed human requirements. Mangels et al. write that consuming the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of protein (0.8 g/kg body weight) in the form of soy will meet the biologic requirement for amino acids. In 2012 the United States Department of Agriculture ruled that soy protein (tofu) may replace meat protein in the National School Lunch Program.\n\nThe American Dietetic Association said in 2009 that a variety of plant foods consumed over the course of a day can provide all the essential amino acids for healthy adults, which means that protein combining in the same meal may not be necessary. Mangels et al. write that there is little reason to advise vegans to increase their protein intake, but erring on the side of caution, they recommend a 25 percent increase over the RDA for adults, to 1.0 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight.\n\nVitamin B is a bacterial product needed for cell division, the formation and maturation of red blood cells, the synthesis of DNA, and normal nerve function. A deficiency may cause megaloblastic anaemia and neurological damage, and, if untreated, may lead to death. The high content of folacin in vegetarian diets may mask the hematological symptoms of vitamin B deficiency, so it may go undetected until neurological signs in the late stages are evident, which can be irreversible, such as neuropsychiatric abnormalities, neuropathy, dementia and, occasionally, atrophy of optic nerves. Vegans sometimes fail to obtain enough B from their diet because among non-fortified foods, only those of animal origin contain sufficient amounts. The best source is ruminant food. Vegetarians are also at risk, as are older people and those with certain medical conditions. A 2013 study found that \"vegetarians develop B depletion or deficiency regardless of demographic characteristics, place of residency, age, or type of vegetarian diet. Vegans should take preventive measures to ensure adequate intake of this vitamin, including regular consumption of supplements containing B.\"\n\nB is produced in nature only by certain bacteria and archaea; it is not made by any animal, fungus, or plant. It is synthesized by some gut bacteria in humans and other animals, but humans cannot absorb the B made in their guts, as it is made in the colon which is too far from the small intestine, where absorption of B occurs. Ruminants, such as cows and sheep, absorb B produced by bacteria in their guts.\n\nAnimals store vitamin B in liver and muscle and some pass the vitamin into their eggs and milk; meat, liver, eggs and milk are therefore sources of B.\n\nIt has been suggested that nori (an edible seaweed), tempeh (a fermented soybean food), and nutritional yeast may be sources of vitamin B. In 2016, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics established that nori, fermented foods (such as tempeh), spirulina, chlorella algae, and unfortified nutritional yeast are not adequate sources of vitamin B and that vegans need to consume regularly fortified foods or supplements containing B. Otherwise, vitamin B12 deficiency may develop, as has been demonstrated in case studies of vegan infants, children, and adults.\n\nVitamin B is mostly manufactured by industrial fermentation of various kinds of bacteria, which make forms of cyanocobalamin, which are further processed to generate the ingredient included in supplements and fortified foods. The \"Pseudomonas denitrificans\" strain was most commonly used as of 2017. It is grown in a medium containing sucrose, yeast extract, and several metallic salts. To increase vitamin production, it is supplemented with sugar beet molasses, or, less frequently, with choline. Certain brands of B supplements are vegan.\n\nCalcium is needed to maintain bone health and for several metabolic functions, including muscle function, vascular contraction and vasodilation, nerve transmission, intracellular signalling and hormonal secretion. Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth.\n\nHigh-calcium foods may include fortified plant milk or fortified tofu. Plant sources include broccoli, turnip, bok choy and kale; the bioavailability of calcium in spinach is poor. Vegans should make sure they consume enough vitamin D, which is needed for calcium absorption.\n\nA 2007 report based on the Oxford cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which began in 1993, suggested that vegans have an increased risk of bone fractures over meat eaters and vegetarians, likely because of lower dietary calcium intake. The study found that vegans consuming at least 525 mg of calcium daily have a risk of fractures similar to that of other groups. A 2009 study found the bone mineral density (BMD) of vegans was 94 percent that of omnivores, but deemed the difference clinically insignificant.\n\nVitamin D (calciferol) is needed for several functions, including calcium absorption, enabling mineralization of bone, and bone growth. Without it bones can become thin and brittle; together with calcium it offers protection against osteoporosis. Vitamin D is produced in the body when ultraviolet rays from the sun hit the skin; outdoor exposure is needed because UVB radiation does not penetrate glass. It is present in salmon, tuna, mackerel and cod liver oil, with small amounts in cheese, egg yolks and beef liver, and in some mushrooms.\n\nMost vegan diets contain little or no vitamin D without fortified food. People with little sun exposure may need supplements. The extent to which sun exposure is sufficient depends on the season, time of day, cloud and smog cover, skin melanin content, and whether sunscreen is worn. According to the National Institutes of Health, most people can obtain and store sufficient vitamin D from sunlight in the spring, summer and fall, even in the far north. They report that some researchers recommend 5–30 minutes of sun exposure without sunscreen between 10 am and 3 pm, at least twice a week. Tanning beds emitting 2–6% UVB radiation have a similar effect, though tanning is inadvisable.\n\nVitamin D comes in two forms. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D) is synthesized in the skin after exposure to the sun, or consumed in the form of animal products; when produced industrially it is taken from lanolin in sheep's wool. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D) is derived from ergosterol from UV-exposed mushrooms or yeast and is suitable for vegans. Conflicting studies have suggested that the two forms may or may not be bioequivalent. According to researchers from the Institute of Medicine, the differences between vitamins D and D do not affect metabolism, both function as prohormones, and when activated exhibit identical responses in the body.\n\nIn some cases iron and the zinc status of vegans may also be of concern because of the limited bioavailability of these minerals. There are concerns about the bioavailability of iron from plant foods, assumed by some researchers to be 5–15 percent compared to 18 percent from a nonvegetarian diet. Iron deficiency anemia is found as often in nonvegetarians as in vegetarians, though studies have shown vegetarians' iron stores to be lower.\n\nMangels et al. write that, because of the lower bioavailability of iron from plant sources, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences established a separate RDA for vegetarians and vegans of 14 mg for vegetarian men and postmenopausal women, and 33 mg for premenopausal women not using oral contraceptives. Supplements should be used with caution after consulting a physician, because iron can accumulate in the body and cause damage to organs. This is particularly true of anyone with hemochromatosis, a relatively common condition that can remain undiagnosed.\n\nHigh-iron vegan foods include soybeans, black-strap molasses, black beans, lentils, chickpeas, spinach, tempeh, tofu and lima beans. Iron absorption can be enhanced by eating a source of vitamin C at the same time, such as half a cup of cauliflower or five fluid ounces of orange juice. Coffee and some herbal teas can inhibit iron absorption, as can spices that contain tannins such as turmeric, coriander, chiles, and tamarind.\n\nAlpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is found in leafy green vegetables and nuts, and in vegetable oils such as canola and flaxseed oil. EPA and DHA, the other primary omega-3 fatty acids, are found only in animal products and algae. Iodine supplementation may be necessary for vegans in countries where salt is not typically iodized, where it is iodized at low levels, or where, as in Britain and Ireland, dairy products are relied upon for iodine delivery because of low levels in the soil. Iodine can be obtained from most vegan multivitamins or regular consumption of seaweeds, such as kelp.\n\nAs of 2014 very few studies were rigorous in their comparison of omnivore, vegetarian and vegan diets, making it difficult to discern whether health benefits attributed to the vegan diet might also apply to vegetarian diets or diets that include a moderate meat intake.\n\nVeganism appears to provide a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and ischemic heart disease. A 2016 systematic review found that a vegan diet was associated with a reduction in cancer risk, although only in a small number of studies. The review concluded that there was no effect of vegan diets overall on all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, cerebrovascular disease or cardiovascular-disease-related mortality. The effects also disappeared when specific cancers were analysed. Some studies of vegan diets in diabetes have been criticized for poorly controlling for factors such as medication status; the effect of vegan diets on diabetes and glycemic control is inconclusive.\n\nAccording to nutritionist Winston Craig, writing in \"The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\" in 2009, vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron and phytochemicals, and lower in dietary energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc and vitamin B. Vegans tend to be thinner, with lower serum cholesterol and lower blood pressure.\n\nEliminating all animal products increases the risk of deficiencies of vitamins B and D, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids. Vitamin B-12 deficiency occurs in up to 80% of vegans that do not supplement with vitamin B. Craig advises vegans to eat fortified foods or take supplements, and warns that iron and zinc may be problematic because of limited bioavailability. Vegans might be at risk of low bone mineral density without supplements.\n\nThe American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada state that properly planned vegan diets are appropriate for all life stages, including pregnancy and lactation. They indicate that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders, but that its adoption may serve to camouflage a disorder rather than cause one. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council similarly recognizes a well-planned vegan diet as viable for any age. The British National Health Service's Eatwell Plate allows for an entirely plant-based diet, as does the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) MyPlate. The USDA allows tofu to replace meat in the National School Lunch Program. The German Society for Nutrition does not recommend a vegan diet for babies, children and adolescents, and for those pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada consider well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets \"appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes\". The German Society for Nutrition cautioned against a vegan diet for pregnant women, babies, and children as of 2011. The position of the Canadian Pediatric Society is that \"well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets with appropriate attention to specific nutrient components can provide a healthy alternative lifestyle at all stages of fetal, infant, child and adolescent growth. Attention should be given to nutrient intake, particularly protein, vitamins B12 and D, essential fatty acids, iron, zinc and calcium.\n\nAccording to a 2015 systematic review, there is little evidence available about vegetarian and vegan diets during pregnancy, and a lack of randomized studies meant that the effects of diet could not be distinguished from confounding factors. It concluded: \"Within these limits, vegan-vegetarian diets may be considered safe in pregnancy, provided that attention is paid to vitamin and trace element requirements.\" A daily source of vitamin B is important for pregnant and lactating vegans, as is vitamin D if there are concerns about low sun exposure. Researchers have reported cases of vitamin B12 deficiency in lactating vegetarian mothers that were linked to deficiencies and neurological disorders in their children. A doctor or registered dietitian should be consulted about taking supplements during pregnancy.\n\nVegan diets have attracted negative attention from the media because of cases of nutritional deficiencies that have come to the attention of the courts, including the death of a baby in New Zealand in 2002 due to hypocobalaminemia, i.e. Vitamin B deficiency.\n\nVegans do not use personal care products or household cleaners that contain animal products. Animal ingredients are ubiquitous because they are cheap. After animals are slaughtered for meat, the leftovers are put through the rendering process, and some of that material, particularly the fat, ends up in toiletries. Common ingredients include tallow in soap and collagen-derived glycerine, used as a lubricant and humectant in many haircare products, moisturizers, shaving foams, soaps and toothpastes.\n\nLanolin from sheep's wool is often found in lip balm and moisturizers. Stearic acid is a common ingredient in face creams, shaving foam and shampoos; as with glycerine, it can be plant-based but is usually animal-derived. Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid derived from animal milk, is used in moisturizers, as is allantoin, from the comfrey plant or cows' urine, in shampoos, moisturizers and toothpaste. Carmine from scale insects, such as the female cochineal, is used in food and cosmetics to produce red and pink shades.\n\n\"Animal Ingredients A to Z\" (2004) and \"Veganissimo A to Z\" (2013) list which ingredients might be animal-derived. The British Vegan Society's sunflower logo and PETA's bunny logo mean the product is certified vegan, which includes no animal testing. The leaping-bunny logo signals no animal testing, but it might not be vegan. The Vegan Society criteria for vegan certification are that the product contain no animal products, and that neither the finished item nor its ingredients have been tested on animals by, or on behalf of, the manufacturer or by anyone over whom the manufacturer has control. Its website contains a list of certified products, as does Australia's \"Choose Cruelty Free\" website.\n\nBeauty Without Cruelty, founded as a charity in 1959, was one of the earliest manufacturers and certifiers of animal-free personal care products. Several international companies produce animal-free products, including clothes, shoes, fashion items and candles.\n\nVegans avoid clothing that incorporates silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, mohair and a number of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, leather, snakeskin and any other kind of skin or animal product. Most leather clothing is made from cow skins. Vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials such as hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, synthetic leather (pleather), rubber and vinyl. Leather alternatives can come from materials such as cork, piña (from pineapples) and mushroom leather.\n\nEthical veganism is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of species membership alone. Divisions within animal rights theory include the utilitarian, protectionist approach, which pursues improved conditions for animals, and rights-based abolitionism, which seeks to end human ownership of non-humans. Abolitionists argue that protectionism serves only to make the public feel that animal use can be morally unproblematic (the \"happy meat\" position).\n\nLaw professor Gary Francione, an abolitionist, argues that all sentient beings should have the right not to be treated as property, and that adopting veganism must be the baseline for anyone who believes that non-humans have intrinsic moral value. Pursuing improved welfare conditions is like campaigning for \"conscientious rapists\" who will rape without beating, he argues. Philosopher Tom Regan, also a rights theorist, argues that animals possess value as \"subjects-of-a-life\", because they have beliefs, desires, memory and the ability to initiate action in pursuit of goals. The right of subjects-of-a-life not to be harmed can be overridden by other moral principles, but Regan argues that pleasure, convenience and the economic interests of farmers are not weighty enough.\n\nPhilosopher Peter Singer, a protectionist and utilitarian, argues that there is no moral or logical justification for failing to count animal suffering as a consequence when making decisions, and that killing animals should be rejected unless necessary for survival. Despite this, he writes that \"ethical thinking can be sensitive to circumstances\", and that he is \"not too concerned about trivial infractions\".\n\nAn argument proposed by Bruce Friedrich, also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because it focuses on personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever animal products they can. For Francione, this is similar to arguing that, because human-rights abuses can never be eliminated, we should not defend human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, we reinforce that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience, he argues. He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own consequentialist terms.\n\nPhilosopher Val Plumwood maintained that ethical veganism is \"subtly human-centred\", an example of what she called \"human/nature dualism\" because it views humanity as separate from the rest of nature. Ethical vegans want to admit non-humans into the category that deserves special protection, rather than recognize the \"ecological embeddedness\" of all. Plumwood wrote that animal food may be an \"unnecessary evil\" from the perspective of the consumer who \"draws on the whole planet for nutritional needs\"—and she strongly opposed factory farming—but for anyone relying on a much smaller ecosystem, it is very difficult or impossible to be vegan.\n\nBen Mepham, bioethicist and fellow of the Royal Society of Biology, in his review of Francione and Garner's book \"The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation?\", concludes about the vegan philosophy that \"if the aim of ethics is to choose the right, or best, course of action in specific circumstances ‘all things considered’, it is arguable that adherence to such an absolutist agenda is simplistic and open to serious self-contradictions. Or, as Farlie puts it, with characteristic panache: ‘to conclude that veganism is the ‘only ethical response’ is to take a big leap into a very muddy pond’.\" He cites as examples the adverse effects on animal wildlife derived from the agricultural practices necessary to sustain most vegan diets and the ethical contradiction of favoring the welfare of domesticated animals but not that of wild animals; the imbalance between the resources that are used to promote the welfare of animals as opposed to those destined to alleviate the suffering of the approximately one billion human beings who undergo malnutrition, abuse and exploitation; the focus on attitudes and conditions in western developed countries, leaving out the rights and interests of societies whose economy, culture and, in some cases, survival rely on a symbiotic relationship with animals.\n\nEnvironmental vegans focus on conservation, rejecting the use of animal products on the premise that fishing, hunting, trapping and farming, particularly factory farming, are environmentally unsustainable. In 2010 Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society called pigs and chicken \"major aquatic predators\", because livestock eat 40 percent of the fish that are caught. All Sea Shepherd ships have been vegan, for environmental reasons, since 2002.\n\nAccording to a 2006 United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report, \"Livestock's Long Shadow\", 222 million tonnes of meat were produced globally in 1999. The report posits that around 26 percent of the planet's terrestrial surface is devoted to livestock grazing. In the United States ten billion land animals are killed every year for human consumption, and in 2005 48 billion birds were killed globally. \n\nThe UN report also concluded that livestock farming (mostly of cows, chickens and pigs) affects the air, land, soil, water, biodiversity and climate change. Livestock consumed 1,174 million tonnes of food in 2002—including 7.6 million tonnes of fishmeal and 670 million tonnes of cereals, one-third of the global cereal harvest— and in 2001 consumed 45 million tonnes of roots and vegetables and 17 million tonnes of pulses. As of 2006 the livestock industry accounted for nine percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, 37 percent of methane, 65 percent of nitrous oxide, and 68 percent of ammonia. Livestock waste emitted 30 million tonnes of ammonia a year, which is involved in the production of acid rain. A 2017 study published in the journal \"Carbon Balance and Management\" found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nA 2010 UN report, \"Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production\", argued that animal products \"in general require more resources and cause higher emissions than plant-based alternatives\". It proposed a move away from animal products to reduce environmental damage. A 2007 Cornell University study concluded that vegetarian diets use the least land \"per capita\", but require higher quality land than is needed to feed animals. A 2015 study published in \"Science of the Total Environment\" determined that significant biodiversity loss can be attributed to the growing demand for meat, which is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction, with species-rich habitats being converted to agriculture for livestock production. A 2017 study by the World Wildlife Fund found that 60% of biodiversity loss can be attributed to the vast scale of feed crop cultivation needed to rear tens of billions of farm animals, which puts an enormous strain on natural resources resulting in an extensive loss of lands and species. In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a warning to humanity calling for, among other things, \"promoting dietary shifts towards mostly plant-based foods.\"\n\nOne of the leading activists and scholars of feminist animal rights is Carol J. Adams. Her premier work, \"The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory\" (1990), sparked what was to become a movement in animal rights as she noted the relationship between feminism and meat consumption. Since the release of \"The Sexual Politics of Meat\", Adams has published several other works including essays, books, and keynote addresses. Adams ideals are carried out thoroughly, and in one of her speeches, “Why feminist-vegan now?”—adapted from her original address at the “Minding Animals” conference in Newcastle, Australia (2009)--Adams states that “the idea that there was a connection between feminism and vegetarianism came to [her] in October 1974,” illustrating that the concept of feminist veganism has been around for nearly half a century. Other authors have also paralleled Adams’ ideas while expanding on them. Angella Duvnjak states in “Joining the dots: some reflections on feminist-Vegan political practice and choice” that she was met with opposition to the connection of feminist and veganism ideals, although the connection seemed more than obvious to her and other scholars (2011). Other scholars elaborate on the connections between feminism, such as Carrie Hamilton who makes the connection to sex workers and animal reproductive rights. Many other scholars of feminist vegan philosophy continue to add to the arguments that Adams, Duvnjak, and Hamilton have brought forth.\n\nSome of the main concepts of feminist veganism is that is the connection between the violence and oppression of animals. For example, Marjorie Spiegal compares the consumption or servitude of animals for human gain to slavery. Animals are purchased from a breeder, used for personal gain—either for further breeding, or manual labor—and then discarded—most frequently as food. This capitalist use of animals for personal gain has held strong, despite the work of animal rights activists and ecofriendly feminists.\n\nSimilar notions that suggest animals—like fish, for example—feel less pain are brought forth today as a justification for animal cruelty. The feminist side of the argument, however, suggests that there is no rationalization for treating animal lives with lesser reverence than human lives, even if the theory that animals are less capable of pain is verifiable.\n\nAnother connection between feminism and veganism is the parallel of violence against women or other minority members and the violence against animals. Animal rights activists closely relates animal cruelty to feminist issues. This connection is even further mirrored as animals that are used for breeding practices are compared to human trafficking victims and migrant sex workers. Hamilton points out that violent “rapists sometimes exhibit behavior that seems to be patterned on the mutilation of animals” suggesting there is a trend between the violence towards rape victims and animal cruelty previously exhibited by the rapist.\n\nThe violence connection is not limited to sexual acts, however. It is a common fact the prevalence of violence against animals are more defined in those with psychopathic disorders. This mirroring of violence against animals and violence against weaker animals lead the pioneers of feminist veganism to suggest that there is a correspondence between violence against humans and animals, supporting feminist veganism.\n\nAnother way that feminist veganism relates to feminist thoughts is through the capitalist means of the production itself. Carol J. Adams, mentions Barbara Noske talking about “meat eating as the ultimate capitalist product, because it takes so much to make the product, it uses up so many resources”. The capitalization of resources for meat production is argued to be better used for production of other food products that have a less detrimental impact on the environment.\n\nMultiple symbols have been developed to represent veganism. Several are used on consumer packaging, including the Vegan Society trademark and Vegan Action logo, to indicate products without animal-derived ingredients. Various symbols may also be used by members of the vegan community to represent their identity and in the course of animal rights activism, for example a vegan flag.\n",
                "Vegetarianism\n\nVegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.\n\nVegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life. Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as animal rights advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal preference. There are variations of the diet as well: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs. A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including eggs and dairy. Some vegans also avoid other animal products such as beeswax, leather or silk clothing, and goose-fat shoe polish.\n\nPackaged and processed foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, so may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions. Often, prior to purchase or consumption, vegetarians will scrutinize products for animal-derived ingredients. Vegetarians' feelings vary with regard to these ingredients. For example, while some vegetarians may be unaware of animal-derived rennet's role in the production of cheese, and may therefore unknowingly consume the product, other vegetarians may not take issue with its consumption.\n\nSemi-vegetarian diets consist largely of vegetarian foods but may include fish or poultry, or sometimes other meats, on an infrequent basis. Those with diets containing fish or poultry may define \"meat\" only as mammalian flesh and may identify with vegetarianism. A pescetarian diet has been described as \"fish but no other meat\". The common use association between such diets and vegetarianism has led vegetarian groups such as the Vegetarian Society to state that diets containing these ingredients are not vegetarian, because fish and birds are also animals.\nThe term 'vegetarian' has been in use since 1839 to refer to what was previously described as a \"vegetable diet\". The word is commonly believed to be a compound of \"vegetable\" and the suffix \"-arian\" (as in \"agrarian\"). (John Davis shows that it was probably not derived from the Latin word \"vegetus\".)\nThe term was popularized with the foundation of the Vegetarian Society in Manchester, UK in 1847. The earliest occurrences of the term seem to be related to Alcott House, a school on the north side of Ham Common, London, opened in July 1838 by James Pierrepont Greaves. From 1841, it was known as \"A Concordium, or Industry Harmony College\", from which time the institution began to publish its own pamphlet, \"The Healthian\", which provides some of the earliest appearances of the term \"vegetarian\".\n\nThe earliest record of vegetarianism comes from Indus Valley Civilization as early as the 7th century BCE, inculcating tolerance towards all living beings. Vegetarianism was also practiced in ancient Greece and the earliest reliable evidence for vegetarian theory and practice in Greece dates from the 6th century BC. The Orphics, a religious movement spreading in Greece at that time. It is unclear whether the Greek religious teacher Pythagoras actually advocated vegetarianism, but later writers presented him as doing so. A fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Book XV of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", in which he advocates a form of strict vegetarianism. It was through this portrayal that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period and, prior to the coinage of the word \"vegetarianism\", vegetarians were referred to in English as \"Pythagoreans\".\n\nVegetarianism was also practiced about six centuries later in another instance (between 30 BCE–50 CE) in northern Thracian region, the Moesi tribe who inhabited present day Serbia and Bulgaria, feeding themselves on honey, milk and cheese.\n\nIn the Indian culture, the diet was closely connected with the attitude of nonviolence towards animals (called \"ahimsa\" in India) and was promoted by religious groups and philosophers. The ancient Indian work of Tirukkural explicitly and unambiguously emphasizes vegetarianism and non-killing. Chapter 26 of the Tirukkural, through couplets 251 to 260, deals exclusively on vegetarianism or veganism. Among the Hellenes, Egyptians and others, it had medical or ritual purification purposes.\nFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire in late antiquity, vegetarianism practically disappeared from Europe, as it did on other continents, except India. Several orders of monks in medieval Europe restricted or banned the consumption of meat for ascetic reasons, but none of them eschewed fish. (The medieval definition of \"fish\" included such animals as seals, porpoises, dolphins, barnacle geese, puffins, and beavers.) It re-emerged during the Renaissance, becoming more widespread in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1847, the first Vegetarian Society was founded in the United Kingdom; Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries followed. In 1886, the vegetarian colony Nueva Germania was founded in Paraguay, though its vegetarian aspect would prove short-lived. The International Vegetarian Union, an association of the national societies, was founded in 1908. In the Western world, the popularity of vegetarianism grew during the twentieth century as a result of nutritional, ethical, and more recently, environmental and economic concerns.\n\nThere are a number of vegetarian diets that exclude or include various foods:\n\nWithin the \"ovo-\" groups, there are many who refuse to consume fertilized eggs (with balut being an extreme example); however, such distinction is typically not specifically addressed.\n\nSome vegetarians also avoid products that may use animal ingredients not included in their labels or which use animal products in their manufacturing; for example, sugars that are whitened with bone char, cheeses that use animal rennet (enzymes from animal stomach lining), gelatin (derived from the collagen inside animals' skin, bones and connective tissue), some cane sugar (but not beet sugar) and apple juice/alcohol clarified with gelatin or crushed shellfish and sturgeon, while other vegetarians are unaware of or do not mind such ingredients.\n\nIndividuals sometimes label themselves \"vegetarian\" while practicing a semi-vegetarian diet, as some dictionary definitions describe vegetarianism as sometimes including the consumption of fish, or only include mammalian flesh as part of their definition of meat, while other definitions exclude fish and all animal flesh. In other cases, individuals may describe themselves as \"flexitarian\".\nThese diets may be followed by those who reduce animal flesh consumed as a way of transitioning to a complete vegetarian diet or for health, ethical, environmental, or other reasons. Semi-vegetarian diets include:\n\nSemi-vegetarianism is contested by vegetarian groups, such as the Vegetarian Society, which states that vegetarianism excludes all animal flesh.\n\nStudies on the health effects of vegetarian diets observe heterogeneous effects on mortality. One review found a decreased overall risk of all cause mortality, cancer (except breast) and cardiovascular disease; however, a meta-analysis found lower risk for ischemic heart disease and cancer but no effect on overall mortality or cerebrovascular disease. Possible limitations include varying definitions used of vegetarianism, and the observation of increased risk of lung cancer mortality in those on a vegetarian diet for less than five years. An analysis pooling two large studies found vegetarians in the UK have similar all cause mortality as meat eaters. An older meta analysis found similar results, only finding decreased mortality in vegetarians, pescatarians, and irregular meat eaters in ischemic heart disease, but not from any other cause.\n\nA vegetarian diet which is poorly planned can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia and platelet disorders; this risk may be offset by ensuring sufficient consumption of vitamin B 12 and polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada have stated that at all stages of life, a properly planned vegetarian diet is \"healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provides health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases\". Large-scale studies have shown that mortality from ischemic heart disease was 30% lower among vegetarian men and 20% lower among vegetarian women than in non-vegetarians. Vegetarian diets offer lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and animal protein, and higher levels of carbohydrates, fibre, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and phytochemicals.\n\n\"Vegetarian diets can meet guidelines for the treatment of diabetes and some research suggests that diets that are more plant-based reduce risk of type-2 diabetes. Rates of self-reported Seventh-day Adventists (SDA) were less than half of those of the general population, and, among SDA, vegetarians had lower rates of diabetes than non-vegetarians. Among possible explanations for a protective effect of vegetarian diet are the Lower BMI of vegetarians and higher fiber intake, both of which improve insulin sensitivity.\"\n\nThe relationship between vegetarian diet and bone health remains unclear. According to some studies, a vegetarian lifestyle can be associated with vitamin B 12 deficiency and low bone mineral density. However, a study of vegetarian and non-vegetarian adults in Taiwan found no significant difference in bone mineral density between the two groups. Other studies, exploring animal protein's negative effects on bone health, suggest that vegetarians may be less prone to osteoporosis than omnivores, as vegetarian subjects had greater bone mineral density and more bone formation.\n\nThe China-Cornell-Oxford Project, a 20-year study conducted by Cornell University, the University of Oxford, and the government of China has established a correlation between the consumption of animal products and a variety of chronic illnesses, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancers of the breast, prostate and bowel (see \"The China Study\").\n\nA British study of almost 10,000 men found that those who gave up meat were almost twice as likely to suffer from depression as people on a conventional balanced diet. The study found that the 350 committed vegetarians studied had a higher average depression score compared to others.\n\nWestern vegetarian diets are typically high in carotenoids, but relatively low in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B. Vegans can have particularly low intake of vitamin B and calcium if they do not eat enough items such as collard greens, leafy greens, tempeh and tofu (soy). High levels of dietary fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, and low consumption of saturated fat are all considered to be beneficial aspects of a vegetarian diet. A well planned vegetarian diet will provide all nutrients in a meat-eater's diet to the same level for all stages of life.\n\nProtein intake in vegetarian diets is lower than in meat diets but can meet the daily requirements for most people. Studies at Harvard University as well as other studies conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and various European countries,\nconfirmed vegetarian diets provide sufficient protein intake as long as a variety of plant sources are available and consumed. Pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, hemp seed, almonds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, tofu, oats, soybeans, walnuts, are great sources of protein for vegetarians. Proteins are composed of amino acids, and a common concern with protein acquired from vegetable sources is an adequate intake of the essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesised by the human body. While dairy and egg products provide complete sources for ovo-lacto vegetarian, several vegetable sources have significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids, including lupin beans, soy, hempseed, chia seed, amaranth, buckwheat, pumpkin seeds spirulina, pistachios, and quinoa. However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. brown rice and beans, or hummus and pita, though protein combining in the same meal is not necessary). A 1994 study found a varied intake of such sources can be adequate.\n\nVegetarian diets typically contain similar levels of iron to non-vegetarian diets, but this has lower bioavailability than iron from meat sources, and its absorption can sometimes be inhibited by other dietary constituents. According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, consuming food that contains vitamin C, such as citrus fruit or juices, tomatoes, or broccoli, is a good way to increase the amount of iron absorbed at a meal. Vegetarian foods rich in iron include black beans, cashews, hempseed, kidney beans, broccoli, lentils, oatmeal, raisins, spinach, cabbage, lettuce, black-eyed peas, soybeans, many breakfast cereals, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato juice, tempeh, molasses, thyme, and whole-wheat bread. The related vegan diets can often be higher in iron than vegetarian diets, because dairy products are low in iron. Iron stores often tend to be lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians, and a few small studies report very high rates of iron deficiency (up to 40%, and 58% of the respective vegetarian or vegan groups). However, the American Dietetic Association states that iron deficiency is no more common in vegetarians than non-vegetarians (adult males are rarely iron deficient); iron deficiency anaemia is rare no matter the diet.\n\nAccording to the United States National Institutes of Health, vitamin B is not generally present in plants and is naturally found in foods of animal origin. Lacto-ovo vegetarians can obtain B from dairy products and eggs, and vegans can obtain it from fortified foods (including some soy products and some breakfast cereals) and dietary supplements. Vitamin B can also be obtained from fortified yeast extract products.\n\nThe recommended dietary allowance of B in the United States is, per day, 0.4 mcg (0–6 months), rising to 1.8 mcg (9–13 years), 2.4 mcg (14+ years), and 2.8 mcg (lactating female). While the body's daily requirement for vitamin B is very small, deficiency of the vitamin is very serious leading to anemia and irreversible nerve damage.\n\nPlant-based, or vegetarian, sources of Omega 3 fatty acids include soy, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, canola oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane. Purslane contains more Omega 3 than any other known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While the health effects of low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels. Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Similar supplements providing both DHA and EPA have also begun to appear. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain algae such as spirulina are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).\n\nCalcium intake in vegetarians and vegans can be similar to non-vegetarians, as long as the diet is properly planned. Lacto-ovo vegetarians that include dairy products can still obtain calcium from dairy sources like milk, yogurt, and cheese.\n\nNon-dairy milks that are fortified with calcium, such as soymilk and almond milk can also contribute a significant amount of calcium in the diet. The calcium found in broccoli, bok choy, and kale have also been found to have calcium that is well absorbed in the body. Though the calcium content per serving is lower in these vegetables than a glass of milk, the absorption of the calcium into the body is higher. Other foods that contain calcium include calcium-set tofu, blackstrap molasses, turnip greens, mustard greens, soybeans, tempeh, almonds, okra, dried figs, and tahini. Though calcium can be found in Spinach, swiss chard, beans and beet greens, they are generally not considered to be a good source since the calcium binds to oxalic acid and is poorly absorbed into the body. Phytic acid found in nuts, seeds, and beans may also impact calcium absorption rates. See the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements for calcium needs for various ages, the Vegetarian Resource Group and the Vegetarian Nutrition Calcium Fact Sheet from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics for more specifics on how to obtain adequate calcium intake on a vegetarian or vegan diet.\n\nVitamin D needs can be met via the human body's own generation upon sufficient and sensible exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight. Products including milk, soy milk and cereal grains may be fortified to provide a source of Vitamin D. For those who do not get adequate sun exposure or food sources, Vitamin D supplementation may be necessary.\n\n\nVitamin D, or ergocalciferol is found in fungus (except alfalfa which is a plantae) and created from viosterol, which in turn is created when ultraviolet light activates ergosterol (which is found in fungi and named as a sterol from ergot). Any UV-irradiated fungus including yeast form vitamin D. Human bioavailability of vitamin D from vitamin D-enhanced button mushrooms via UV-B irradiation is effective in improving vitamin D status and not different from a vitamin D supplement according to study. For example, Vitamin D from UV-irradiated yeast baked into bread is bioavailable.\nBy visual assessment or using a chromometer, no significant discoloration of irradiated mushrooms, as measured by the degree of \"whiteness\", was observed making it hard to discover if they have been treated without labeling. Claims have been made that a normal serving (approx. 3 oz or 1/2 cup, or 60 grams) of mushrooms treated with ultraviolet light increase their vitamin D content to levels up to 80 micrograms, or 2700 IU if exposed to just 5 minutes of UV light after being harvested.\n\nThere have been many comparative and statistical studies of the relationship between diet and longevity, including vegetarianism and longevity.\n\nA 1999 metastudy combined data from five studies from western countries. The metastudy reported mortality ratios, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for fish eaters to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters (eat meat less than once per week) to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters had the base mortality rate of 1.0, while the number for vegans was very uncertain (anywhere between 0.7 and 1.44) due to too few data points. The study reported the numbers of deaths in each category, and expected error ranges for each ratio, and adjustments made to the data. However, the \"lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these [vegetarian] cohorts\". Out of the major causes of death studied, only one difference in mortality rate was attributed to the difference in diet, as the conclusion states: \"...vegetarians had a 24% lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease than non-vegetarians, but no associations of a vegetarian diet with other major causes of death were established\".\n\nIn \"Mortality in British vegetarians\", a similar conclusion is drawn:\n\nBritish vegetarians have low mortality compared with the general population. Their death rates are similar to those of comparable non-vegetarians, suggesting that much of this benefit may be attributed to non-dietary lifestyle factors such as a low prevalence of smoking and a generally high socio-economic status, or to aspects of the diet other than the avoidance of meat and fish.\"\n\nThe Adventist Health Studies is ongoing research that documents the life expectancy in Seventh-day Adventists. This is the only study among others with similar methodology which had favourable indication for vegetarianism. The researchers found that a combination of different lifestyle choices could influence life expectancy by as much as 10 years. Among the lifestyle choices investigated, a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1–1/2 to 2 years of life. The researchers concluded that \"the life expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population\" at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women. The life expectancy of California Adventists surviving to age 30 was 83.3 years for men and 85.7 years for women.\n\nThe Adventist health study is again incorporated into a metastudy titled \"Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans?\" published in \"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\", which concluded that low meat eating (less than once per week) and other lifestyle choices significantly increase life expectancy, relative to a group with high meat intake. The study concluded that \"The findings from one cohort of healthy adults raises the possibility that long-term (≥ 2 decades) adherence to a vegetarian diet can further produce a significant 3.6-y increase in life expectancy.\" However, the study also concluded that \"Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians.\" It further states that \"This raises the possibility that a low-meat, high plant-food dietary pattern may be the true causal protective factor rather than simply elimination of meat from the diet.\" In a recent review of studies relating low-meat diet patterns to all-cause mortality, Singh noted that \"5 out of 5 studies indicated that adults who followed a low meat, high plant-food diet pattern experienced significant or marginally significant decreases in mortality risk relative to other patterns of intake.\"\n\nStatistical studies, such as comparing life expectancy with regional areas and local diets in Europe also have found life expectancy considerably greater in southern France, where a low meat, high plant Mediterranean diet is common, than northern France, where a diet with high meat content is more common.\n\nA study by the Institute of Preventive and Clinical Medicine, and Institute of Physiological Chemistry looked at a group of 19 vegetarians (lacto-ovo) and used as a comparison a group of 19 omnivorous subjects recruited from the same region. The study found that this group of vegetarians (lacto-ovo) have a significantly higher amount of plasma carboxymethyllysine and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) compared to this group of non-vegetarians. Carboxymethyllysine is a glycation product which represents \"a general marker of oxidative stress and long-term damage of proteins in aging, atherosclerosis and diabetes\" and \"[a]dvanced glycation end products (AGEs) may play an important adverse role in process of atherosclerosis, diabetes, aging and chronic renal failure\".\n\nIn Western medicine, patients are sometimes advised to adhere to a vegetarian diet. According to studies by the Permanente Journal and the National Institute for Health (NIH), vegetarian diets are affordable and can help reduce health risks like high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and cholesterol levels. A plant based diet has the potential to lower the risk of heart disease as well as reducing the amount of medications prescribed in instances of chronic illness. A change to a plant based diet, or vegetarianism, has had dramatic positive effects on the health of patients with chronic illnesses, significantly more than exercise alone \nVegetarian diets have been used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, but the evidence is inconclusive whether this is effective.\nCertain alternative medicines, such as Ayurveda and Siddha, prescribe a vegetarian diet as a normal procedure. Maya Tiwari notes that Ayurveda recommends small portions of meat for some people, though \"the rules of hunting and killing the animal, practiced by the native peoples, were very specific and detailed\". Now that such methods of hunting and killing are not observed, she does not recommend the use of \"any animal meat as food, not even for the Vata types\".\n\nThe human digestive system is omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material. Some nutritional experts believe that early hominids evolved into eating meat as a result of huge climatic changes that took place three to four million years ago, when forests and jungles dried up and became open grasslands and opened hunting and scavenging opportunities.\n\nThe American Dietetic Association has presented evidence that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders. At the same time the association cautions however, that the adoption of a vegetarian diet may not necessarily lead to eating disorders, rather that \"vegetarian diets may be selected to camouflage an existing eating disorder\". Other studies and statements by dietitians and counselors support this conclusion.\n\nVegetarianism is associated with increased risk of depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorder, although causality cannot be established.\n\nVarious ethical reasons have been suggested for choosing vegetarianism, usually predicated on the interests of non-human animals. In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural taboo, such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as factory farms, or avoid certain meats, such as veal or foie gras. Some people follow vegetarian or vegan diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practises involved in the raising and slaughter of animals, i.e. factory farming and the industrialisation of animal slaughter. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant protein.\n\nEthical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain agricultural practices surrounding the production of meat.\n\nPrinceton University professor and animal rights activist Peter Singer believes that if alternative means of survival exist, one ought to choose the option that does not cause unnecessary harm to animals. Most ethical vegetarians argue that the same reasons exist against killing animals in the flesh to eat as against killing humans to eat. Singer, in his book \"Animal Liberation,\" listed possible qualities of sentience in non-human creatures that gave such creatures the scope to be considered under utilitarian ethics, and this has been widely referenced by animal rights campaigners and vegetarians. Ethical vegetarians also believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or nutrition value is not a sufficient cause. Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behaviour in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards.\n\nOpponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not moral equals to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious. This view does not excuse cruelty, but maintains that animals do not possess the rights a human has.\n\nOne of the main differences between a vegan and a typical vegetarian diet is the avoidance of both eggs and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter and yogurt. Ethical vegans do not consume dairy or eggs because they state that their production causes the animal suffering or a premature death.\n\nTo produce milk from dairy cattle, calves are separated from their mothers soon after birth and slaughtered or fed milk replacer in order to retain the cows milk for human consumption. Vegans state that this breaks the natural mother and calf bond. Unwanted male calves are either slaughtered at birth or sent for veal production. To prolong lactation, dairy cows are almost permanently kept pregnant through artificial insemination. After about five years, once the cows milk production has dropped, they are considered \"spent\" and sent to slaughter for beef and their hides. A dairy cow's natural life expectancy is about twenty years.\n\nIn battery cage and free-range egg production, unwanted male chicks are culled or discarded at birth during the process of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens.\n\nEthical vegetarianism has become popular in developed countries particularly because of the spread of factory farming, faster communications, and environmental consciousness. Some believe that the current mass demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a mass-production system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-ranging and consumption of game, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could substantially alleviate the demand for mass-produced meat.\n\nAncient Greek philosophy has a long tradition of vegetarianism. Pythagoras was reportedly vegetarian (and studied at Mt. Carmel, where some historians say there was a vegetarian community), as his followers were expected to be.\n\nRoman writer Ovid concluded his magnum opus Metamorphoses, in part, with the impassioned argument (uttered by the character of Pythagoras) that in order for humanity to change, or metamorphose, into a better, more harmonious species, it must strive towards more humane tendencies. He cited vegetarianism as the crucial decision in this metamorphosis, explaining his belief that human life and animal life are so entwined that to kill an animal is virtually the same as killing a fellow human.\n\nJainism teaches vegetarianism as moral conduct as do some major sects of Hinduism. Buddhism in general does not prohibit meat eating, while Mahayana Buddhism encourages vegetarianism as beneficial for developing compassion. Other denominations that advocate a vegetarian diet include the Seventh-day Adventists, the Rastafari movement, the Ananda Marga movement and the Hare Krishnas. Sikhism does not equate spirituality with diet and does not specify a vegetarian or meat diet.\n\nWhile there are no dietary restrictions in the Bahá'í Faith, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the religion's founder, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick. He stated that there are no requirements that Bahá'ís become vegetarian, but that a future society should gradually become vegetarian. `Abdu'l-Bahá also stated that killing animals was contrary to compassion. While Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals, both he and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Bahá'ís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bahá'í practice and that Bahá'ís can choose to eat whatever they wish but should be respectful of others' beliefs.\n\nTheravadins in general eat meat. If Buddhist monks \"see, hear or know\" a living animal was killed specifically for them to eat, they must refuse it or else incur an offense. However, this does not include eating meat which was given as alms or commercially purchased. In the Theravada canon, Buddha did not make any comment discouraging them from eating meat (except specific types, such as human, elephant meat, horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, and hyena flesh) but he specifically refused to institute vegetarianism in his monastic code when a suggestion had been made.\n\nIn several Sanskrit texts of Mahayana Buddhism, Buddha instructs his followers to avoid meat. However, each branch of Mahayana Buddhism selects which sutra to follow, and some branches, including the majority of Tibetan and Japanese Buddhists, do eat meat, while many Chinese Buddhist branches do not.\n\nChristians have always been free to make their own decisions about what to eat; however, there are groups within Christianity that practice specific dietary restrictions for various reasons. The early sect known as the Ebionites are considered to have practiced vegetarianism. Surviving fragments from their Gospel indicate their belief that – as Christ is the Passover sacrifice and eating the Passover lamb is no longer required – a vegetarian diet may (or should) be observed. However, orthodox Christianity does not accept their teaching as authentic. Indeed, their specific injunction to strict vegetarianism was cited as one of the Ebionites' \"errors\".\n\nAt a much later time, the Bible Christian Church founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet. Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society. Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance.\n\nSeventh-day Adventists are encouraged to engage in healthy eating practices, and ova-lacto-vegetarian diets are recommended by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Nutrition Council (GCNC). They have also sponsored and participated in many scientific studies exploring the impact of dietary decisions upon health outcomes. The GCNC has in addition adapted the USDA's food pyramid for a vegetarian dietary approach. However, the only kinds of meat specifically frowned upon by the SDA health message are unclean meats, or those forbidden in scripture.\n\nAdditionally, some monastic orders follow a vegetarian diet, and members of the Orthodox Church follow a vegan diet during fasts. There is also a strong association between the Quakers and vegetarianism dating back at least to the 18th century. The association grew in prominence during the 19th century, coupled with growing Quaker concerns in connection with alcohol consumption, anti-vivisection and social purity. The association between the Quaker tradition and vegetarianism, however, becomes most significant with the founding of the Friends' Vegetarian Society in 1902 \"to spread a kindlier way of living amongst the Society of Friends.\"\n\nAccording to Canon Law, Roman Catholics are required to abstain from meat (defined as all animal flesh excluding water animals) on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays of Lent including Good Friday. Canon Law also obliges Catholics to abstain from meat on the Fridays of the year outside of Lent (excluding certain holy days) unless, with the permission of the local conference of bishops, another penitential act is substituted. The restrictions on eating meat on these days is solely as an act of penance and not because of a religious objection to eating meat.\n\nSince the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the 1860s when the church began, wholeness and health have been an emphasis of the Adventist church, and has been known as the \"health message\" belief of the church. Adventists are well known for presenting a health message that recommends vegetarianism and expects adherence to the kosher laws in . Obedience to these laws means abstinence from pork, shellfish, and other animals proscribed as \"unclean\". The church discourages its members from consuming alcoholic beverages, tobacco or illegal drugs (compare Christianity and alcohol). In addition, some Adventists avoid coffee, tea, cola, and other beverages containing caffeine.\nThe pioneers of the Adventist Church had much to do with the common acceptance of breakfast cereals into the Western diet, and the \"modern commercial concept of cereal food\" originated among Adventists. John Harvey Kellogg was one of the early founders of Adventist health work. His development of breakfast cereals as a health food led to the founding of Kellogg's by his brother William. In both Australia and New Zealand, the church-owned Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company is a leading manufacturer of health and vegetarian-related products, most prominently Weet-Bix.\n\nResearch funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health has shown that the average Adventist in California lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian. The research, as cited by the cover story of the November 2005 issue of \"National Geographic\", asserts that Adventists live longer because they do not smoke or drink alcohol, have a day of rest every week, and maintain a healthy, low-fat vegetarian diet that is rich in nuts and beans. The cohesiveness of Adventists' social networks has also been put forward as an explanation for their extended lifespan.\nSince Dan Buettner's 2005 \"National Geographic\" story about Adventist longevity, his book, \"The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest\", named Loma Linda, California a \"blue zone\" because of the large concentration of Seventh-day Adventists. He cites the Adventist emphasis on health, diet, and Sabbath-keeping as primary factors for Adventist longevity.\n\nAn estimated 35% of Adventists practice vegetarianism or veganism, according to a 2002 worldwide survey of local church leaders.\n\nThough there is no strict rule on what to consume and what not to, paths of Hinduism hold vegetarianism as an ideal. Some reasons are: the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) applied to animals; the intention to offer only \"pure\" (vegetarian) food to a deity and then to receive it back as prasad; and the conviction that a sentient diet is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is not recommended for a better mind and for spiritual development.\n\nHowever, the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community, location, custom and varying traditions. Historically and currently, those Hindus who eat meat prescribe Jhatka meat, while some Hindus believe that the cow is a holy animal whose slaughter for meat is forbidden. This belief varies according to region.\n\nSome followers of Islam, or Muslims, chose to be vegetarian for health, ethical, or personal reasons. However, the choice to become vegetarian for non-medical reasons can sometimes be controversial due to conflicting fatwas and differing interpretations of the Quran. Though some more traditional Muslims may keep quiet about their vegetarian diet, the number of vegetarian Muslims is increasing.\n\nVegetarianism has been practiced by some influential Muslims including the Iraqi theologian, female mystic and poet Râbi‘ah al-‘Adawîyah of Basrah, who died in the year 801, and the Sri Lankan Sufi master Bawa Muhaiyaddeen who established The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship of North America in Philadelphia. The former Indian president Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was also famously a vegetarian.\n\nIn January 1996, The International Vegetarian Union announced the formation of the Muslim Vegetarian/Vegan Society.\n\nMany non-vegetarian Muslims will select vegetarian (or seafood) options when dining in non-halal restaurants. However, this is a matter of not having the right kind of meat rather than preferring not to eat meat on the whole.\n\nFollowers of Jainism believe that all living organisms whether they are micro-organism are living and have a soul, and have one or more senses out of five senses and they go to great lengths to minimise any harm to any living organism. Most Jains are lacto-vegetarians but more devout Jains do not eat root vegetables because they believe that root vegetables contain a lot more micro-organisms as compared to other vegetables, and that, by eating them, violence of these micro-organisms is inevitable. So they focus on eating beans and fruits, whose cultivation do not involve killing of a lot of micro-organisms. No products obtained from dead animals are allowed, because when a living beings dies, a lot of micro-organisms (called as decomposers) will reproduce in the body which decomposes the body, and in eating the dead bodies, violence of decomposers is inevitable. Jain monks usually do a lot of fasting, and when they knew through spiritual powers that their life is very little, they start fasting until death. Some particularly dedicated individuals are fruitarians. Honey is forbidden, because honey is the regurgitation of nectar by bees and may also contain eggs, excreta and dead bees. Some Jains do not consume plant parts that grow underground such as roots and bulbs, because the plants themselves and tiny animals may be killed when the plants are pulled up.\n\nWhile it is neither required (required only on special holidays [Pessach, Sukot and Shavuot] according to some traditions, but not on Shabbat [Friday], when just bread and wine/grape juice is required) nor prohibited for Jews to eat meat, a number of medieval scholars of Jewish religion (e.g., Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama) regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal, not just because of a concern for the welfare of animals, but because the slaughter of animals might cause the individual who performs such acts to develop negative character traits. One modern-day scholar who is in favour of vegetarianism is the late Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the Chief Rabbi of Mandate Palestine. In his writings, Rabbi Kook speaks of vegetarianism as an ideal, and points to the fact that Adam did not partake of the flesh of animals, as all humans and animals were originally commanded by God to only eat plants. In context, Rabbi Kook makes those comments in his portrayal of the eschatological (messianic) era. However, he personally refrained from eating meat except on the Sabbath and Festivals, and one of his leading disciples, Rabbi David Cohen, known as the \"Nazirite\" of Jerusalem, was a devout vegetarian. Several other members of Rabbi Kook's circle were also vegetarians.\n\nAccording to some Kabbalists, only a mystic, who is able to sense and elevate the reincarnated human souls and \"divine sparks\", is permitted to consume meat, though eating the flesh of an animal might still cause spiritual damage to the soul. A number of Orthodox Jewish vegetarian groups and activists promote such ideas and believe that the halakhic permission to eat meat is a temporary leniency for those who are not ready yet to accept the vegetarian diet. Jewish law also commands people to ritually slaughter animals when killing them, and goes into precise detail on the rituals of both animal sacrifice and ordinary slaughter (shechita). According to medieval sage Rabbi Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz, author of the Torah commentary Kli Yakar, the complexity of these laws was intended to discourage the consumption of meat and make it less painful for the animals.\n\nAccording to (Genesis 1:29-30), consumption of meat was banned. After the Great Flood, Noah was given permission to consume meat:\n\n\"Behold, I have given to you all herbage-yielding seed that is on the surface of the earth, and every tree that has seed-yielding fruit; it shall be yours for food. And to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the sky, and to everything that moves on the earth, within which there is a living soul, every green herb is for food.\" (Genesis 1:29-30)\n\nWithin the Afro-Caribbean community, a minority are Rastafari and follow the dietary regulations with varying degrees of strictness. The most orthodox eat only \"Ital\" or natural foods, in which the matching of herbs or spices with vegetables is the result of long tradition originating from the African ancestry and cultural heritage of Rastafari. \"Ital\", which is derived from the word vital, means essential to human existence. Ital cooking in its strictest form prohibits the use of salt, meat (especially pork), preservatives, colorings, flavorings and anything artificial. Most Rastafari are vegetarian.\n\nThe tenets of Sikhism do not advocate a particular stance on either vegetarianism or the consumption of meat, but leave the decision of diet to the individual. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, however, prohibited \"Amritdhari\" Sikhs, or those that follow the Sikh Rehat Maryada (the Official Sikh Code of Conduct) from eating Kutha meat, or meat which has been obtained from animals which have been killed in a ritualistic way. This is understood to have been for the political reason of maintaining independence from the then-new Muslim hegemony, as Muslims largely adhere to the ritualistic halal diet.\n\n\"Amritdharis\" that belong to some Sikh sects (e.g. Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal, Namdhari and Rarionwalay, etc.) are vehemently against the consumption of meat and eggs (though they do consume and encourage the consumption of milk, butter and cheese). This vegetarian stance has been traced back to the times of the British Raj, with the advent of many new Vaishnava converts. In response to the varying views on diet throughout the Sikh population, Sikh Gurus have sought to clarify the Sikh view on diet, stressing their preference only for simplicity of diet. Guru Nanak said that over-consumption of food (Lobh, Greed) involves a drain on the Earth's resources and thus on life. Passages from the \"Guru Granth Sahib\" (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the \"Adi Granth\") say that it is \"foolish\" to argue for the superiority of animal life, because though all life is related, only human life carries more importance: \"Only fools argue whether to eat meat or not. Who can define what is meat and what is not meat? Who knows where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?\" The Sikh langar, or free temple meal, is largely lacto-vegetarian, though this is understood to be a result of efforts to present a meal that is respectful of the diets of any person who would wish to dine, rather than out of dogma.\n\nEnvironmental vegetarianism is based on the concern that the production of meat and animal products for mass consumption, especially through factory farming, is environmentally unsustainable. According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide, and modern practices of raising animals for food contribute on a \"massive scale\" to air and water pollution, land degradation, climate change, and loss of biodiversity. The initiative concluded that \"the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.\"\n\nIn addition, animal agriculture is a large source of greenhouse gases. According to a 2006 report it is responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as estimated in 100-year CO equivalents. Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents. This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents.\n\nMeat produced in a laboratory (called in vitro meat) may be more environmentally sustainable than regularly produced meat. Reactions of vegetarians vary. Rearing a relatively small number of grazing animals can be beneficial, as the Food Climate Research Network at Surrey University reports: \"A little bit of livestock production is probably a good thing for the environment.\n\nIn May 2009, Ghent, Belgium, was reported to be \"the first [city] in the world to go vegetarian at least once a week\" for environmental reasons, when local authorities decided to implement a \"weekly meatless day\". Civil servants would eat vegetarian meals one day per week, in recognition of the United Nations' report. Posters were put up by local authorities to encourage the population to take part on vegetarian days, and \"veggie street maps\" were printed to highlight vegetarian restaurants. In September 2009, schools in Ghent are due to have a weekly \"veggiedag\" (\"vegetarian day\") too.\n\nSome groups, such as PETA, promote vegetarianism as a way to offset poor treatment and working conditions of workers in the contemporary meat industry. These groups cite studies showing the psychological damage caused by working in the meat industry, especially in factory and industrialised settings, and argue that the meat industry violates its labourers' human rights by assigning difficult and distressing tasks without adequate counselling, training and debriefing. However, the working conditions of agricultural workers as a whole, particularly non-permanent workers, remain poor and well below conditions prevailing in other economic sectors. Accidents, including pesticide poisoning, among farmers and plantation workers contribute to increased health risks, including increased mortality. According to the International Labour Organization, agriculture is one of the three most dangerous jobs in the world.\n\nSimilar to environmental vegetarianism is the concept of economic vegetarianism. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism from either the philosophical viewpoint concerning issues such as public health and curbing world starvation, the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound, part of a conscious simple living strategy or just out of necessity. According to the Worldwatch Institute, \"Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease their health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate. As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable to the world's chronically hungry.\"\n\nPrejudice researcher Gordon Hodson observes that vegetarians and vegans frequently face discrimination where eating meat is held as a cultural norm.\n\nA 1992 market research study conducted by the Yankelovich research organisation concluded that \"of the 12.4 million people [in the US] who call themselves vegetarian, 68% are female, while only 32% are male\".\n\nAt least one study indicates that vegetarian women are more likely to have female babies. A study of 6,000 pregnant women in 1998 \"found that while the national average in Britain is 106 boys born to every 100 girls, for vegetarian mothers the ratio was just 85 boys to 100 girls\". Catherine Collins of the British Dietetic Association has dismissed this as a \"statistical fluke\" given that it is actually the male's genetic contribution which determines the sex of a baby.\n\n\n\n",
                "Vegetarianism and religion\n\nVegetarianism is strongly linked with a number of religions that originated in ancient India (Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism). In Jainism, vegetarianism is mandatory for everyone; in Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism, it is advocated by some influential scriptures and religious authorities. Comparatively, in the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), the Bahá'í Faith and Dharmic religions such as Sikhism, vegetarianism is not promoted by mainstream authorities, although in all these faiths there are small groups actively promoting vegetarianism on religious grounds.\n\nMost Indian religions have philosophical schools that forbid consumption of meat and Jainism institutes an outright ban on the same. Consequently, India is home to more vegetarians than any other country. About 30% of India's 1.2 billion population practices lacto vegetarianism, with overall meat consumption increasing. The per capita meat consumption in India in 2002 was 5.2 kg, while it was 24 times more in the United States at 124.8 kg. Meat consumption in the United States and India grew at about 40% over the last 50 years. In 1961 Indian per capita meat consumption was 3.7 kg, while the US consumption was 89.2 kg.\n\nVegetarianism in Jainism is based on the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa, literally \"non-injuring\"). Vegetarianism is considered mandatory for everyone. Jains are either lacto-vegetarians or vegans. No use or consumption of products obtained from dead animals is allowed. Moreover, Jains try to avoid unnecessary injury to plants and \"suksma jiva\" (Sanskrit for \"subtle life forms\"; minuscule organisms). The goal is to cause as little violence to living things as possible, hence they avoid eating roots, tubers such as potatoes, garlic and anything that involves uprooting (and thus eventually killing) a plant to obtain food.\n\nEvery act by which a person directly or indirectly supports killing or injury is seen as violence (\"hinsa\"), which creates harmful karma. The aim of ahimsa is to prevent the accumulation of such karma. Jains consider nonviolence to be the most essential religious duty for everyone (ahinsā paramo dharmaḥ, a statement often inscribed on Jain temples). Their scrupulous and thorough way of applying nonviolence to everyday activities, and especially to food, shapes their entire lives and is the most significant hallmark of Jain identity. A side effect of this strict discipline is the exercise of asceticism, which is strongly encouraged in Jainism for lay people as well as for monks and nuns.\n\nJains do not practice animal sacrifice as they consider all sentient beings to be equal.\n\nVegetarianism is an integral part of most schools of Hinduism although there are a wide variety of practices and beliefs that have changed over time. An estimated 30% of all Hindus are vegetarians. Some sects of Hindus do not observe vegetarianism.\n\nThe principle of nonviolence (Ahimsa) applied to animals is connected with the intention to avoid negative karmic influences which result from violence. The suffering of all beings is believed to arise from craving and desire, conditioned by the karmic effects of both animal and human action. The violence of slaughtering animals for food, and its source in craving, reveal flesh eating as one mode in which humans enslave themselves to suffering. Hinduism holds that such influences affect the person who permits the slaughter of an animal, the person who kills it, the person who cuts it up, the person who buys or sells meat, the person who cooks it, the person who serves it up, and the person who eats it. They must all be considered the slayers of the animal. The question of religious duties towards the animals and of negative Karma incurred from violence (\"himsa\") against them is discussed in detail in Hindu scriptures and religious law books.\n\nHindu scriptures belong or refer to the Vedic period which lasted till about 500 BCE according to the chronological division by modern historians. In the historical Vedic religion, the predecessor of Hinduism, meat eating was not banned in principle, but was restricted by specific rules. Several highly authoritative scriptures bar violence against domestic animals except in the case of ritual sacrifice. This view is clearly expressed in the Mahabharata (3.199.11-12; 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17), the Bhagavata Purana (11.5.13-14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1). For instance, many Hindus point to the Mahabharata's maxim that \"Nonviolence is the highest duty and the highest teaching,\" as advocating a vegetarian diet. The Mahabharata also states that adharma (sin) was born when creatures started to devour one another from want of food and that adharma always destroys every creature \" It is also reflected in the Manu Smriti (5.27-44), a particularly renowned traditional Hindu law book (Dharmaśāstra). These texts strongly condemn the slaughter of animals and meat eating.\n\nThe Mahabharata (12.260; 13.115-116; 14.28) and the Manu Smriti (5.27-55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter and subsequent consumption of the meat. In the Mahabharata both meat eaters and vegetarians present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Apart from the debates about domestic animals, there is also a long discourse by a hunter in defence of hunting and meat eating. These texts show that both ritual slaughter and hunting were challenged by advocates of universal non-violence and their acceptability was doubtful and a matter of dispute.\n\nIn modern India the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community or caste and according to regional traditions. Hindu vegetarians usually eschew eggs but consume milk and dairy products, so they are lacto-vegetarians.\n\nAccording to a survey of 2006, vegetarianism is weak in coastal states and strong in landlocked northern and western states and among Brahmins in general, 55 percent of whom are vegetarians. Many coastal inhabitants are fish eaters. In particular Bengali Hindus have romanticized fishermen and the consumption of fish through poetry, literature and music.\n\nHindus who eat meat are encouraged to eat Jhatka meat.\n\nAnimal sacrifice in Hinduism (sometimes known as Jhatka Bali) is the ritual killing of an animal in Hinduism.\n\nThe ritual sacrifice normally forms part of a festival to honour a Hindu god. For example, in Nepal the Hindu goddess Gadhimai, is honoured every 5 years with the slaughter of 250,000 animals. Bali sacrifice today is common at the Sakta shrines of the Goddess Kali.\n\nThe First Precept prohibits Buddhists from killing people or animals. The matter of whether this forbids Buddhists from eating meat has long been a matter of debate.\n\nThe first Buddhist monks and nuns were forbidden from growing, storing, or cooking their own food. They relied entirely on the generosity of alms to feed themselves, and were not allowed to accept money to buy their own food. They could not make special dietary requests, and had to accept whatever food alms givers had available, including meat. Monks and nuns of the Theravada school of Buddhism, which predominates in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Burma, and Laos, still follow these strictures today.\n\nThese strictures were relaxed in China, Korea, Japan, and other countries that follow Mahayana Buddhism, where monasteries were in remote mountain areas and the distance to the nearest towns made daily alms rounds impractical. There, Buddhist monks and nuns could cultivate their own crops, store their own harvests, cook their own meals, and accept money to buy anything else they needed in terms of food in the market.\n\nAccording to the Vinaya Pitaka, when Devadatta urged him to make complete abstinence from meat compulsory, the Buddha refused, maintaining that \"monks would have to accept whatever they found in their begging bowls, including meat, provided that they had not seen, had not heard, and had no reason to suspect that the animal had been killed so that the meat could be given to them\". There were prohibitions on specific kinds of meat: meat from humans, meat from royal animals such as elephants or horses, meat from dogs, and meat from dangerous animals like snakes, lions, tigers, panthers, bears and hyenas.\n\nOn the other hand, certain Mahayana sutras strongly denounce the eating of meat. According to the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Buddha revoked this permission to eat meat and warned of a dark age when false monks would claim that they were allowed meat. In the Lankavatara Sutra, a disciple of the Buddha named Mahamati asks \"[Y]ou teach a doctrine that is flavoured with compassion. It is the teaching of the perfect Buddhas. And yet we eat meat nonetheless; we have not put an end to it.\" An entire chapter is devoted to the Buddha's response, wherein he lists a litany of spiritual, physical, mental, and emotional reasons why meat eating should be abjured. However, according to , this chapter on meat eating is a \"later addition to the text...It is quite likely that meat-eating was practiced more or less among the earlier Buddhists, which was made a subject of severe criticism by their opponents. The Buddhists at the time of the \"Laṅkāvatāra\" did not like it, hence this addition in which an apologetic tone is noticeable.\" points to a passage in the Surangama Sutra which implies advocacy of \"not just a vegetarian, but a vegan lifestyle\"; however, numerous scholars over the centuries have concluded that the Śūraṅgama Sūtra is a forgery. Moreover, in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the same sutra which records his retraction of permission to eat meat, the Buddha explicitly identifies as \"beautiful foods\" honey, milk, and cream, all of which are eschewed by vegans.\n\nIn the modern Buddhist world, attitudes toward vegetarianism vary by location. In China and Vietnam, monks typically eat no meat, with other restrictions as well. In Japan or Korea some schools do not eat meat, while most do. Theravadins in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia do not practice vegetarianism. All Buddhists however, including monks, are allowed to practice vegetarianism if they wish to do so. states that \"There are no accurate statistics, but I would guess—and it is only a guess—that worldwide about half of all Buddhists are vegetarian\".\n\nFollowers of Sikhism do not have a preference for meat or vegetarian consumption. There are two views on initiated or \"Amritdhari Sikhs\" and meat consumption. \"Amritdhari\" Sikhs (i.e. those that follow the Sikh Rehat Maryada - the Official Sikh Code of Conduct) can eat meat (provided it is not Kutha meat).\"Amritdharis\" that belong to some Sikh sects (e.g. Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal, Namdhari, Rarionwalay, etc.) are vehemently against the consumption of meat and eggs.\n\nIn the case of meat, the Sikh Gurus have indicated their preference for a simple diet, which could include meat or be vegetarian. Passages from the Guru Granth Sahib (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the Adi Granth) say that fools argue over this issue. Guru Nanak said that overconsumption of food (Lobh, Greed) involves a drain on the Earth's resources and thus on life. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, prohibited the Sikhs from the consumption of halal or Kutha (any ritually slaughtered meat) meat because of the Sikh belief that sacrificing an animal in the name of God is mere ritualism (something to be avoided).\n\nOn the views that eating vegetation would be eating flesh, first Sikh Guru Nanak states:\n\nOn Vegetation, the Guru described it as living and experiencing pain:\n\nPage 143 of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji\n\nSikhs who eat meat, eat Jhatka meat.\n\nJudaic, Christian, and Muslim traditions (Abrahamic religions) all have strong connections to the Biblical ideal of the Garden of Eden, which includes references to a herbivore diet. However, only minorities within those populations actually practice and advocate such diets.\n\nRabbinical Judaism discourages \"ascetic\" practices in general, and encourages one to 'enjoy the bounty of this world in a proper fashion'. Several passages in the Hebrew scriptures permit eating animal flesh, such as supposedly , which states \"Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you.\" This verse extends such permission to all \"children of Noah,\" i.e., all humanity. One of the sages of the Talmud asserted, \"Man will have to account for everything he saw but did not eat.\" (This refers to permissible or kosher foods only, not to forbidden animal species such as pork.) On the other hand, the Talmud discourages indulgence and states that it is preferable that one's diet consist mostly of non-meat products. To Jewish vegetarians wishing to remain consistent with this teaching, vegetarianism is not a form of self-deprivation, because the vegetarian does not desire to eat meat and believes it is healthier not to eat meat and is aware of other negative effects of meat production and consumption.\n\nGenerally speaking, Judaism has not promoted vegetarianism. However, some prominent rabbis have promoted vegetarian lifestyle, among them David Cohen (known as \"Ha-Nazir\"), and Chief Rabbi of Israel Shlomo Goren. Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog said:\n\nRabbi Milgrom regards the commandment against blood as a law that permits man to \"indulge in his lust for meat and not be brutalized in the process.\"\n\nSome Orthodox authorities have argued that it is forbidden for an individual to become a vegetarian if they do so because they believe in animal rights; however, they have ruled that vegetarianism is allowed for pragmatic reasons (if kosher meat is expensive or hard to come by in their area), health concerns, or for reasons of personal taste (if someone finds meat unpalatable). Some believe that halakha encourages the eating of meat at the Sabbath and Festival meals; thus some Orthodox Jews who are otherwise vegetarian will nevertheless consume meat at these meals.\n\nThere are several arguments from Judaism used by Jewish vegetarians. For the Jewish vegetarian there are three main components which prove vegetarianism to be an ethical mitzvah: Tza'ar ba'alei hayyim, Pikuach nefesh and Bal tashkhit. Tza'ar ba'alei hayyim is the injunction not to cause ‘pain to living creatures’. Pikuach nefesh is not only the regard for human life which is in immediate danger. Bal Tashchit is the law which prohibits waste. Another argument is that, since Adam and Eve were not allowed to eat meat and that, according to some opinions, in the Messianic era, the whole world will be vegetarian, not eating meat is something that brings the world closer to that ideal. In his booklet summarizing many of Rav Kook’s teachings, Joseph Green, a 20th-century South African Jewish vegetarian writer, concludes that Jewish religious ethical vegetarians are pioneers of the messianic era; they are leading lives that make the coming of the Messiah more likely. The Jewish tradition asserts that one way to speed the coming of the Messiah is to start practicing the ways that will prevail in the messianic time. A second one is that the laws of shechita are meant to prevent the suffering of animals and today, with factory farming and high-speed, mechanized slaughterhouses, even kosher slaughterhouses are considered by some authorities not to fulfill enough of the requirements to render the meat kosher. Also, even if the slaughtering process is carried out perfectly, with a minimum of pain to the animal, the many months of cruel treatment of animals on factory farms should be considered. A third one is that the Sages only mandated eating an olive's bulk of meat during festivals, but even then, this was because in Talmudic times, meat was considered essential for one's diet.\n\nSacrifices were used as an excuse to eat meat, and later denounced by the biblical prophets if carried out in a society that did not practice compassion and justice.\n\nIn Israel there is one vegetarian moshav (village), called Amirim. Its vegetarianism is based on general principles of health and ethics and not on the Jewish religion.\n\nJewish Veg is a grassroots organization promoting veganism as \"God's ideal diet\".\n\nThe Shamayim V'Aretz Institute led by Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz promotes a vegan diet in the Jewish community through animal welfare activism, kosher veganism, and Jewish spirituality.\n\nNotable Jewish vegetarians include David Rosen, She'ar Yashuv Cohen, Franz Kafka, Roberta Kalechofsky, Yonassan Gershom, Shmuly Yanklowitz, Richard H. Schwartz, and Isaac Bashevis Singer. Jonathan Safran Foer narrated the short documentary film \"If This Is Kosher...\", which records what he considers abuses within the kosher meat industry.\n\nSeveral Christian monastic groups, including the Desert Fathers, Trappists, Benedictines, Cistercians and Carthusians, all of the Orthodox monks and also Christian esoteric groups, such as the Rosicrucian Fellowship, have encouraged vegetarianism.\n\nThe Bible Christian Church, a Christian vegetarian sect founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809, were one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society. Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance.\n\nSome Christian groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, the Christian Vegetarian Association and Christian anarchists, take a literal interpretation of the Biblical prophecies of universal veg(etari)anism and encourage veg(etari)anism as preferred lifestyles or as a tool to reject the commodity status of animals and the use of animal products for any purpose, although some of them say it is not required. Other groups point instead to allegedly explicit prophecies of temple sacrifices in the Messianic Kingdom, e.g. , where so-called peace offerings and so-called freewill offerings are said that will be offered, and where it states that such offerings are eaten, what may contradict the very purpose of Jesus' purportedly sufficient atonement.\n\nSome Christian vegetarians, such as Keith Akers, argue that Jesus himself was a vegetarian. Akers argues that Jesus was influenced by the Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect. The present academic consensus is that Jesus was not an Essene. There is no historical record of Jesus’ precise attitudes to animals, but there is a strand in his ethical teaching about the primacy of mercy to the weak, the powerless and the oppressed, which Walters and Portmess argue can also refer to captive animals.\n\nWithin Eastern Christianity, Vegetarianism is practiced as part of fasting during the Great Lent (although shellfish and other non-vertebrate products are generally considered acceptable during some periods of this time); vegan fasting is particularly common in Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodox Churches, such as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which generally fasts 210 days out of the year.\n\nIslam explicitly prohibits eating of some kinds of meat, especially pork. However, one of the most important Islamic celebrations, \"Eid ul-Adha\", involves animal sacrifices. Muslims who can afford to do so sacrifice a domestic animals (usually sheep, but also camels, cows, and goats). According to the Quran, a large portion of the meat has to be given towards the poor and hungry, and every effort is to be made to see that no impoverished Muslim is left without sacrificial food during days of feast like Eid-ul-Adha. Certain Islamic orders are mainly vegetarian; many Sufis maintain a vegetarian diet.\n\nRastafarians generally follow a diet called \"I-tal\", which eschews the eating of food that has been artificially preserved, flavoured, or chemically altered in any way. Some Rastafarians consider it to also forbid the eating of meat but the majority will not eat pork at the very least, considering it unclean.\n\nWhile there are no dietary restrictions in the Bahá'í Faith, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick. He stated that there are no requirements that Bahá'ís become vegetarian, but that a future society would gradually become vegetarian. `Abdu'l-Bahá also stated that killing animals was somewhat contrary to compassion. While Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals, both he and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Bahá'ís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bahá'í practice and that Bahá'ís can choose to eat whatever they wish, but to be respectful of others beliefs.\n\nThe Nation of Islam promotes vegetarianism deeming it the \"most healthful and virtuous way to eat\".\n\nIn Chinese societies, \"simple eating\" (素食 Mandarin: sù shí) refers to a particular restricted diet associated with Taoist monks, and sometimes practiced by members of the general population during Taoist festivals and fasting days. It is similar to Chinese Buddhist vegetarianism. Varying levels of abstinence among Taoists and Taoist-influenced people include veganism, veganism without root vegetables, lacto-ovo vegetarianism, and pescetarianism. Taoist vegetarians also tend to abstain from alcohol and pungent vegetables such as garlic and onions during lenten days. Non-vegetarian Taoists sometimes abstain from beef and water buffalo meat for many cultural reasons.\n\nVegetarianism in the Taoist tradition is similar to that of Lent in the Christian tradition. While highly religious people such as monks may be vegetarian, vegan or pescetarian on a permanent basis, lay practitioners often eat vegetarian on the 1st (new moon), 8th, 14th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, 29th and 30th days of the lunar calendar. In accordance with their Buddhist peers, and because many people are both Taoist and Buddhist, they often also eat lenten on the 15th day (full moon). Taoist vegetarianism is similar to Chinese Buddhist vegetarianism, however, its roots reach to pre-Buddhist times. Believers historically abstained from animal products and alcohol before practicing Confucian, Taoist and Chinese folk religion rites.\n\nIt is referred to by the English word \"vegetarian\"; however, though it rejects meat, eggs, and milk, this diet may include oysters and oyster products or otherwise be pescetarian for some believers. Many lay Taoists who follow modern sects such as that of Yi Guan Dao or Master Ching Hai are vegan or strictly vegetarian. \n\nOne of the main precepts in Zoroastrianism is respect and kindness towards all living things and condemnation of cruelty against animals\n\nThe Shahnameh states that the evil king of Iran, Zohak was first taught eating meat by the evil one who came to him in the guise of a cook. This was the start of an age of great evil for Iran. Prior to this, in the Golden age of mankind in the days of the great Aryan Kings, man did not eat meat.\n\nThe Pahlavi scriptures state that in the final stages of the world, when the final Saviour Saoshyant arrives, man will become more spiritual and gradually give up meat eating.\n\nVegetarianism is stated to be the future state of the world in Pahlavi scriptures - Atrupat-e Emetan in Iran in Denkard Book VI requested all Zoroastrians to be vegetarians:\n\n\"ku.san enez a-on ku urwar xwarishn bawed shmah mardoman ku derziwishn bawed, ud az tan i gospand pahrezed, ce amar was, eg Ohrmaz i xwaday hay.yarih i gospand ray urwar was dad.\"\n\nMeaning: They hold this also: Be plant eaters (urwar xwarishn) (i.e. vegetarian), O you, men, so that you may live long. Keep away from the body of cattle (tan i gospand), and deeply reckon that Ohrmazd, the Lord has created plants in great number for helping cattle (and men).\"\n\nOahspe (Meaning Sky, Earth and Spirit) is the doctrinal book of those who follow Faithism. The precepts for behavior can be found throughout the book which include\" a herbivorous diet (vegan, vegetable food only), peaceful living (no warring or violence; pacifism), living a life of virtue, service to others, angelic assistance, spiritual communion, and communal living when it is feasible to do so. Freedom and responsibility are two themes reiterated throughout the text of Oahspe.\n\nThere is no set teaching on vegetarianism within the diverse neopagan communities, however many do follow a vegetarian diet often connected to ecological concerns as well as the welfare and rights of animals. Vegetarian practitioners of Wicca will often see their standpoint as a natural extension of the Wiccan Rede. Organizations like SERV refer to the historic figures of Porphyry, Pythagoras and Iamblichus as sources for the Pagan view of vegetarianism. During the 1970s the publication Earth Religion News, focused on articles related to neopaganism and vegetarianism, it was edited by the author Herman Slater.\n\nThe spiritual teacher Meher Baba recommended a vegetarian diet for his followers because he held that it helps one to avoid certain impurities: \"Killing an animal for sport, pleasure or food means catching all its bad impressions, since the motive is selfish...Impressions are contagious. Eating meat is prohibited in many spiritual disciplines because therein the person catches the impressions of the animal, thus rendering himself more susceptible to lust and anger.\"\n\nThe Creativity religion promotes a form of raw veganism in its \"Salubrious Living\" doctrine named after the third text of the faith written by Ben Klassen, which encourages the consumption of only raw foods in their \"natural state, basically fruits, vegetables, grains and nuts,\" getting plenty of physical exercise as well as abstinence from alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, sugar, preservatives, insecticides, narcotics and other drugs whether prescription or non-prescription. Salubrious Living is considered mandatory to \"fully practice\" Creativity and a lawsuit is currently in place against the Bureau of Prisons to get it recognized as a religious dietary preference for incarcerated adherents of the religious movement.\n\n\n\n"
