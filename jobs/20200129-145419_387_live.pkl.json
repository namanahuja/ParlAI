                "Nineteen Eighty-Four\n\nNineteen Eighty-Four, often published as 1984, is a dystopian novel published in 1949 by English author George Orwell.\nThe novel is set in Airstrip One, formerly Great Britain, a province of the superstate Oceania, whose residents are victims of perpetual war, omnipresent government surveillance and public manipulation. Oceania's political ideology, euphemistically named English Socialism (shortened to \"Ingsoc\" in Newspeak, the government's invented language) is enforced by the privileged, elite Inner Party. Via the \"Thought Police\", the Inner Party persecutes individualism and independent thinking, which are regarded as \"thoughtcrimes\".\n\nThe tyranny is ostensibly overseen by a mysterious leader known as Big Brother, who enjoys an intense cult of personality. The Party \"seeks power entirely for its own sake. It is not interested in the good of others; it is interested solely in power.\" The protagonist of the novel, Winston Smith, is a member of the Outer Party, who works for the Ministry of Truth, or Minitrue in Newspeak. Minitrue is responsible for propaganda and historical revisionism. Winston's job is to rewrite past newspaper articles, so the historical record always supports the Party's agenda. The workers are told they are correcting misquotations, when they are actually writing false information in the place of fact. Minitrue also destroys all previous editions of revised work. This method ensures there is no proof of government interference. Smith is a diligent and skillful worker, but he secretly hates the Party and dreams of rebellion against Big Brother. Smith begins his acts of rebellion by maintaining a sexual relationship with Julia, an employee from the Fiction Department at Minitrue. He received a book from O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and fellow rebel, that details the truth behind the Party's actions. Smith's attempts at self-education and rebellion are ultimately quashed when he is arrested by O'Brien himself. Smith discovers that O'Brien was truly working for the Ministry of Love (Miniluv), the ministry in charge of torturing dissidents. Smith is subjected to many forms of torture and is forced into the horror chamber known only as Room 101. There he is tortured by his worst fear, rats, and is forced to betray Julia. He is released from Miniluv, and Orwell describes his life after his release for the rest of the book. Smith ends the story observing a military update on the telescreen and feeling an intense love for Big Brother.\n\nAs literary political fiction and dystopian science-fiction, \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" is a classic novel in content, plot, and style. Many of its terms and concepts, such as \"Big Brother\", \"doublethink\", \"thoughtcrime\", \"Newspeak\", \"Room 101\", \"telescreen\", \"2 + 2 = 5\", and \"memory hole\", have entered into common use since its publication in 1949. \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" popularised the adjective \"Orwellian\", which describes official deception, secret surveillance, brazenly misleading terminology, and manipulation of recorded history by a totalitarian or authoritarian state. In 2005, the novel was chosen by \"Time\" magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. It was awarded a place on both lists of Modern Library 100 Best Novels, reaching number 13 on the editor's list, and 6 on the readers' list. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 8 on the BBC's survey The Big Read.\n\nOrwell \"encapsulate[d] the thesis at the heart of his unforgiving novel\" in 1944, the implications of dividing the world up into zones of influence, which had been conjured by the Tehran Conference. Three years later, he wrote most of it on the Scottish island of Jura from 1947 to 1948 despite being seriously ill with tuberculosis. On 4 December 1948, he sent the final manuscript to the publisher Secker and Warburg, and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" was published on 8 June 1949. By 1989, it had been translated into 65 languages, more than any other novel in English until then. The title of the novel, its themes, the \"Newspeak\" language and the author's surname are often invoked against control and intrusion by the state, and the adjective \"Orwellian\" describes a totalitarian dystopia that is characterised by government control and subjugation of the people.\n\nOrwell's invented language, Newspeak, satirises hypocrisy and evasion by the state: the Ministry of Love (Miniluv) oversees torture and brainwashing, the Ministry of Plenty (Miniplenty) oversees shortage and rationing, the Ministry of Peace (Minipax) oversees war and atrocity and the Ministry of Truth (Minitrue) oversees propaganda and historical revisionism.\n\n\"The Last Man in Europe\" was an early title for the novel, but in a letter dated 22 October 1948 to his publisher Fredric Warburg, eight months before publication, Orwell wrote about hesitating between that title and \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". Warburg suggested choosing the main title to be the latter, a more commercial one.\n\nIn the novel \"1985\" (1978), Anthony Burgess suggests that Orwell, disillusioned by the onset of the Cold War (1945–91), intended to call the book \"1948\". The introduction to the Penguin Books Modern Classics edition of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" reports that Orwell originally set the novel in 1980 but that he later shifted the date to 1982 and then to 1984. The introduction to the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt edition of \"Animal Farm and 1984\" (2003) reports that the title \"1984\" was chosen simply as an inversion of the year 1948, the year in which it was being completed, and that the date was meant to give an immediacy and urgency to the menace of totalitarian rule.\n\nThroughout its publication history, \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" has been either banned or legally challenged, as subversive or ideologically corrupting, like Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\" (1932), \"We\" (1924) by Yevgeny Zamyatin, \"Darkness at Noon\" (1940) by Arthur Koestler, \"Kallocain\" (1940) by Karin Boye and \"Fahrenheit 451\" (1951) by Ray Bradbury. Some writers consider the Russian dystopian novel \"We\" by Zamyatin to have influenced \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", and the novel bears significant similarities in its plot and characters to \"Darkness at Noon\", written years before by Arthur Koestler, who was a personal friend of Orwell.\n\nThe novel is in the public domain in Canada, South Africa, Argentina, Australia, and Oman. It will be in the public domain in the United Kingdom, the EU, and Brazil in 2021 (70 years after the author's death), and in the United States in 2044.\n\n\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" is set in Oceania, one of three inter-continental superstates that divided the world after a global war.\n\nSmith's memories and his reading of the proscribed book, \"The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism\" by Emmanuel Goldstein, reveal that after the Second World War, the United Kingdom became involved in a war fought in Europe, western Russia, and North America during the early 1950s. Nuclear weapons were used during the war, leading to the destruction of Colchester. London would also suffer widespread aerial raids, leading Winston's family to take refuge in a London Underground station. Britain fell to civil war, with street fighting in London, before the English Socialist Party, abbreviated as Ingsoc, emerged victorious and formed a totalitarian government in Britain. The British Commonwealth was absorbed by the United States to become Oceania. Eventually Ingsoc emerged to form a totalitarian government in the country.\n\nSimultaneously, the Soviet Union conquered continental Europe and established the second superstate of Eurasia. The third superstate of Eastasia would emerge in the Far East after several decades of fighting. The three superstates wage perpetual war for the remaining unconquered lands of the world in \"a rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong\" through constantly shifting alliances. Although each of the three states are said to have sufficient natural resources, the war continues in order to maintain ideological control over the people.\n\nHowever, due to the fact that Winston barely remembers these events and due to the Party's manipulation of history, the continuity and accuracy of these events are unclear. Winston himself notes that the Party has claimed credit for inventing helicopters, airplanes and trains, while Julia theorizes that the perpetual bombing of London is merely a false-flag operation designed to convince the populace that a war is occurring. If the official account was accurate, Smith's strengthening memories and the story of his family's dissolution suggest that the atomic bombings occurred first, followed by civil war featuring \"confused street fighting in London itself\" and the societal postwar reorganisation, which the Party retrospectively calls \"the Revolution\".\n\nMost of the plot takes place in London, the \"chief city of Airstrip One\", the Oceanic province that \"had once been called England or Britain\". Posters of the Party leader, Big Brother, bearing the caption \"BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU\", dominate the city, while the ubiquitous \"telescreen\" (transceiving television set) monitors the private and public lives of the populace. Military parades, propaganda films, and public executions are said to be commonplace.\n\nThe class hierarchy of Oceania has three levels:\nAs the government, the Party controls the population with four ministries:\n\nThe protagonist Winston Smith, a member of the Outer Party, works in the Records Department of the Ministry of Truth as an editor, revising historical records, to make the past conform to the ever-changing party line and deleting references to \"unpersons\", people who have been \"vaporised\", i.e., not only killed by the state but denied existence even in history or memory.\n\nThe story of Winston Smith begins on 4 April 1984: \"It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.\" Yet he is uncertain of the true date, given the regime's continual rewriting and manipulation of history.\n\nWinston Smith is a man who lives in Airstrip One, the remnants of Britain broken down by war, civil conflict, and revolution in the year 1984. A member of the middle class Outer Party, Winston lives in a one-room London flat in the Victory Mansions. Smith lives on rations consisting of black bread, synthetic meals, and \"Victory\"-branded gin. Telescreens in every building, accompanied by microphones and cameras, allow the Thought Police to identify anyone who might compromise the Party's regime, and threat of surveillance forces citizens to display an obligatory optimism regarding the country, who are afraid for being arrested for thoughtcrime, the infraction of expressing thoughts contradictory to the Party's ideology. Children are encouraged to inform the officials about potential thought criminals, including their parents, and are indoctrinated by Party propaganda from an early age. Winston's neighbor, Mr. Parsons, is deeply involved in patriotic activism, and his children are highly indoctrinated with Party propaganda and desensitized to violence.\n\nWinston works at the Ministry of Truth, or \"Minitrue\", as an editor. He is responsible for historical negationism; he rewrites records and alters photographs to conform to the state's ever-changing version of history itself, rendering the deleted people \"unpersons\"; the original documents are destroyed by fire in a \"memory hole\". At work, he re-writes a \"Times\" article reporting on a government official condemned as a thoughtcriminal by writing a story on a nonexistent war hero named \"Comrade Ogilvy\", and notes the state-sponsored media reporting an increase in the chocolate ration during an actual decrease. Despite his proficiency in his profession, Winston becomes mesmerized by the true past after seeing a photograph of three former high-ranking upper class Inner Party officials in New York, discounting the official government account that they had been collaborating with Eurasian officials. Winston tries to get more information about the true past, and purchases an old journal in an antiques shop in a proletarian neighborhood of London. In a place beside his flat's telescreen where he believes he cannot be seen, he begins writing a journal criticizing the Party and its enigmatic leader, Big Brother. By doing so, he commits a crime that, if discovered by the Thought Police, warrants certain death, and Winston quickly resigns himself to the fact that he will eventually be arrested for thoughtcrime. In the journal, he records his sexual frustration over a young woman maintaining the novel-writing machines at the ministry named Julia, whom Winston is attracted to but suspects is an informant. He also suspects that his superior, an Inner Party official named O'Brien, is a secret agent for an enigmatic underground resistance movement known as the Brotherhood, a group formed by Big Brother's reviled political rival Emmanuel Goldstein.\n\nThe next day, Julia surreptitiously hands Winston a note confessing her love for him. Winston and Julia begin an affair after Winston realizes she shares his loathing of the Party, first meeting in the country, and eventually in a rented room at the top of the antiques shop where Winston purchased the diary, which is owned by the seemingly kindly Mr. Charrington. They believe that the shop is safe, as the room has no telescreen. During his affair with Julia, Winston remembers the death of his family; during the civil war of the 1950s, Winston stole rationed chocolate from his malnourished infant sister and his mother, and would return home to discover that they had disappeared. He also recounts his terse relationship with his ex-wife Katharine, whom he was forced to have sex with and despised to such an extent that he considered pushing her off a cliff during a nature walk. Winston also interacts with his colleague Syme, who is writing a dictionary for a revised version of the English language called Newspeak. After Syme insightfully reveals that the true purpose of Newspeak is to reduce the capacity of human thought, Winston speculates that he will be vaporized. He is later proven correct when Syme disappears without a trace, and no one acknowledges his absence.\n\nWeeks later, Winston is approached by O'Brien. They arrange a meeting at O'Brien's flat where both Winston and Julia swear allegiance to the Brotherhood. A week later, O'Brien clandestinely sends Winston a copy of \"The Book\", \"The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism\" by Emmanuel Goldstein, the publicly reviled leader of the Brotherhood. Through The Book, the author explains the structure and practices of Oceania. In particular, The Book explains the concept of perpetual war, the true meanings of the slogans \"War is peace\", \"Freedom is slavery\", and \"Ignorance is strength\", and how the Party can be overthrown through means of the political awareness of the proles (proletarians).\n\nThe Thought Police capture Winston along with Julia in their rented room. The two are then delivered to the Ministry of Love (Miniluv) for interrogation. Mr. Charrington, the shopkeeper who rented the room to them, reveals himself as a Thought Police agent. O'Brien is also an agent of the Thought Police. He is part of a special sting operation used by the police to find and arrest suspected thoughtcriminals. Winston is placed in a prison cell with Parsons, who had been reported by his children and believes himself to be guilty. O'Brien interrogates and tortures Winston with electroshock, telling Winston that he can \"cure\" himself of his \"insanity\"—his manifest hatred for the Party—through controlled manipulation of perception. Winston is held in the prison for an unspecified length of time, and confesses to crimes that O'Brien tells him to say that he has committed, but O'Brien understands that Winston has not betrayed Julia. After awakening from a nightmare in which he confesses his love for Julia, O'Brien sends him to Room 101 for the final stage of re-education, a room which contains each prisoner's worst fear. Winston shouts \"Do it to Julia!\" as a wire cage holding hungry rats is fitted onto his face, thus betraying her.\n\nAfter being put back into society, Winston meets Julia in a park. She admits that she was also tortured, and both reveal betraying the other. Later, Winston sits alone in the Chestnut Tree Cafe. As he remembers a rare happy memory of his family, he convinces himself that it is false. A raucous celebration begins outside, celebrating Oceania's \"decisive victory\" over Eurasian armies in Africa, and Winston imagines himself as a part of the crowd. As Winston imagines a gun being pointed at his head, he feels that he has at last ended his \"stubborn, self-willed exile\" from the love of Big Brother—a love Winston returns quite happily as he looks up in admiration at a portrait of Big Brother.\n\n\n\nIngsoc (English Socialism) is the predominant ideology and pseudophilosophy of Oceania, and Newspeak is the official language of official documents.\n\nIn London, the capital city of Airstrip One, Oceania's four government ministries are in pyramids (300 m high), the façades of which display the Party's three slogans. The ministries' names are the opposite (doublethink) of their true functions: \"The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation.\" (Part II, Chapter IX – \"The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism\")\n\nThe Ministry of Peace supports Oceania's perpetual war against either of the two other superstates:\nThe primary aim of modern warfare (in accordance with the principles of doublethink, this aim is simultaneously recognized and not recognized by the directing brains of the Inner Party) is to use up the products of the machine without raising the general standard of living. Ever since the end of the nineteenth century, the problem of what to do with the surplus of consumption goods has been latent in industrial society. At present, when few human beings even have enough to eat, this problem is obviously not urgent, and it might not have become so, even if no artificial processes of destruction had been at work.\n\nThe Ministry of Plenty rations and controls food, goods, and domestic production; every fiscal quarter, it publishes false claims of having raised the standard of living, when it has, in fact, reduced rations, availability, and production. The Ministry of Truth substantiates Ministry of Plenty's claims by revising historical records to report numbers supporting the current, \"increased rations\".\n\nThe Ministry of Truth controls information: news, entertainment, education, and the arts. Winston Smith works in the Minitrue RecDep (Records Department), \"rectifying\" historical records to concord with Big Brother's current pronouncements so that everything the Party says is true.\n\nThe Ministry of Love identifies, monitors, arrests, and converts real and imagined dissidents. In Winston's experience, the dissident is beaten and tortured, and, when near-broken, he is sent to Room 101 to face \"the worst thing in the world\"—until love for Big Brother and the Party replaces dissension.\n\nThree perpetually warring totalitarian super-states control the world:\n\nThe perpetual war is fought for control of the \"disputed area\" lying \"between the frontiers of the super-states\", which forms \"a rough parallelogram with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin and Hong Kong\", and Northern Africa, the Middle East, India and Indonesia are where the superstates capture and use slave labour. Fighting also takes place between Eurasia and Eastasia in Manchuria, Mongolia and Central Asia, and all three powers battle one another over various Atlantic and Pacific islands.\n\nGoldstein's book, \"The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism\", explains that the superstates' ideologies are alike and that the public's ignorance of this fact is imperative so that they might continue believing in the detestability of the opposing ideologies. The only references to the exterior world for the Oceanian citizenry (the Outer Party and the Proles) are Ministry of Truth maps and propaganda to ensure their belief in \"the war\".\n\nWinston Smith's memory and Emmanuel Goldstein's book communicate some of the history that precipitated the Revolution. Eurasia was formed when the Soviet Union conquered Continental Europe, creating a single state stretching from Portugal to the Bering Strait. Eurasia does not include the British Isles because the United States annexed them along with the rest of the British Empire and Latin America, thus establishing Oceania and gaining control over a quarter of the planet. Eastasia, the last superstate established, emerged only after \"a decade of confused fighting\". It includes the Asian lands conquered by China and Japan. Although Eastasia is prevented from matching Eurasia's size, its larger populace compensates for that handicap.\n\nThe annexation of Britain occurred about the same time as the atomic war that provoked civil war, but who fought whom in the war is left unclear. Nuclear weapons fell on Britain; an atomic bombing of Colchester is referenced in the text. Exactly how Ingsoc and its rival systems (Neo-Bolshevism and Death Worship) gained power in their respective countries is also unclear.\n\nWhile the precise chronology cannot be traced, most of the global societal reorganization occurred between 1945 and the early 1960s. Winston and Julia once meet in the ruins of a church that was destroyed in a nuclear attack \"thirty years\" earlier, which suggests 1954 as the year of the atomic war that destabilised society and allowed the Party to seize power. It is stated in the novel that the \"fourth quarter of 1983\" was \"also the sixth quarter of the Ninth Three-Year Plan\", which implies that the first quarter of the first three-year plan began in July 1958. By then, the Party was apparently in control of Oceania.\n\nIn 1984, there is a perpetual war between Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia, the superstates that emerged from the global atomic war. \"The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism\", by Emmanuel Goldstein, explains that each state is so strong it cannot be defeated, even with the combined forces of two superstates, despite changing alliances. To hide such contradictions, history is rewritten to explain that the (new) alliance always was so; the populaces are accustomed to doublethink and accept it. The war is not fought in Oceanian, Eurasian or Eastasian territory but in the Arctic wastes and in a disputed zone comprising the sea and land from Tangiers (Northern Africa) to Darwin (Australia). At the start, Oceania and Eastasia are allies fighting Eurasia in northern Africa and the Malabar Coast.\n\nThat alliance ends and Oceania, allied with Eurasia, fights Eastasia, a change occurring on Hate Week, dedicated to creating patriotic fervour for the Party's perpetual war. The public are blind to the change; in mid-sentence, an orator changes the name of the enemy from \"Eurasia\" to \"Eastasia\" without pause. When the public are enraged at noticing that the wrong flags and posters are displayed, they tear them down; the Party later claims to have captured Africa.\n\nGoldstein's book explains that the purpose of the unwinnable, perpetual war is to consume human labour and commodities so that the economy of a superstate cannot support economic equality, with a high standard of life for every citizen. By using up most of the produced objects like boots and rations, the proles are kept poor and uneducated and will neither realise what the government is doing nor rebel. Goldstein also details an Oceanian strategy of attacking enemy cities with atomic rockets before invasion but dismisses it as unfeasible and contrary to the war's purpose; despite the atomic bombing of cities in the 1950s, the superstates stopped it for fear that would imbalance the powers. The military technology in the novel differs little from that of World War II, but strategic bomber aeroplanes are replaced with rocket bombs, helicopters were heavily used as weapons of war (they did not figure in World War II in any form but prototypes) and surface combat units have been all but replaced by immense and unsinkable Floating Fortresses, island-like contraptions concentrating the firepower of a whole naval task force in a single, semi-mobile platform (in the novel, one is said to have been anchored between Iceland and the Faroe Islands, suggesting a preference for sea lane interdiction and denial).\n\nThe society of Airstrip One and, according to \"The Book\", almost the whole world, lives in poverty: hunger, disease and filth are the norms. Ruined cities and towns are common: the consequence of the civil war, the atomic wars and the purportedly enemy (but possibly false flag) rockets. Social decay and wrecked buildings surround Winston; aside from the ministerial pyramids, little of London was rebuilt. Members of the Outer Party consume synthetic foodstuffs and poor-quality \"luxuries\" such as oily gin and loosely-packed cigarettes, distributed under the \"Victory\" brand. (That is a parody of the low-quality Indian-made \"Victory\" cigarettes, widely smoked in Britain and by British soldiers during World War II. They were smoked because it was easier to import them from India than it was to import American cigarettes from across the Atlantic because of the War of the Atlantic.)\n\nWinston describes something as simple as the repair of a broken pane of glass as requiring committee approval that can take several years and so most of those living in one of the blocks usually do the repairs themselves (Winston himself is called in by Mrs. Parsons to repair her blocked sink). All Outer Party residences include telescreens that serve both as outlets for propaganda and to monitor the Party members; they can be turned down, but they cannot be turned off.\n\nIn contrast to their subordinates, the Inner Party upper class of Oceanian society reside in clean and comfortable flats in their own quarter of the city, with pantries well-stocked with foodstuffs such as wine, coffee and sugar, all denied to the general populace. Winston is astonished that the lifts in O'Brien's building work, the telescreens can be switched off and O'Brien has an Asian manservant, Martin. All members of the Inner Party are attended to by slaves captured in the disputed zone, and \"The Book\" suggests that many have their own motorcars or even helicopters. Nonetheless, \"The Book\" makes clear that even the conditions enjoyed by the Inner Party are only \"relatively\" comfortable, and standards would be regarded as austere by those of the prerevolutionary élite.\n\nThe proles live in poverty and are kept sedated with alcohol, pornography and a national lottery whose winnings are never actually paid out; that is obscured by propaganda and the lack of communication within Oceania. At the same time, the proles are freer and less intimidated than the middle-class Outer Party: they are subject to certain levels of monitoring but are not expected to be particularly patriotic. They lack telescreens in their own homes and often jeer at the telescreens that they see. \"The Book\" indicates that is because the middle class, not the lower class, traditionally starts revolutions. The model demands tight control of the middle class, with ambitious Outer-Party members neutralised via promotion to the Inner Party or \"reintegration\" by the Ministry of Love, and proles can be allowed intellectual freedom because they lack intellect. Winston nonetheless believes that \"the future belonged to the proles\".\n\nThe standard of living of the populace is low overall. Consumer goods are scarce, and all those available through official channels are of low quality; for instance, despite the Party regularly reporting increased boot production, more than half of the Oceanian populace goes barefoot. The Party claims that poverty is a necessary sacrifice for the war effort, and \"The Book\" confirms that to be partially correct since the purpose of perpetual war consumes surplus industrial production. Outer Party members and proles occasionally gain access to better items in the market, which deals in goods that were pilfered from the residences of the Inner Party.\n\n\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" expands upon the subjects summarised in Orwell's essay \"Notes on Nationalism\" about the lack of vocabulary needed to explain the unrecognised phenomena behind certain political forces. In \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", the Party's artificial, minimalist language 'Newspeak' addresses the matter.\n\nO'Brien concludes: \"The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power.\"\n\nIn the book, Inner Party member O'Brien describes the Party's vision of the future: \n\nA major theme of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" is censorship, especially in the Ministry of Truth, where photographs are modified and public archives rewritten to rid them of \"unpersons\" (persons who are erased from history by the Party). On the telescreens, figures for all types of production are grossly exaggerated or simply invented to indicate an ever-growing economy, when the reality is the opposite. One small example of the endless censorship is Winston being charged with the task of eliminating a reference to an unperson in a newspaper article. He proceeds to write an article about Comrade Ogilvy, a made-up party member who displayed great heroism by leaping into the sea from a helicopter so that the dispatches he was carrying would not fall into enemy hands.\n\nThe inhabitants of Oceania, particularly the Outer Party members, have no real privacy. Many of them live in apartments equipped with two-way telescreens so that they may be watched or listened to at any time. Similar telescreens are found at workstations and in public places, along with hidden microphones. Written correspondence is routinely opened and read by the government before it is delivered. The Thought Police employ undercover agents, who pose as normal citizens and report any person with subversive tendencies. Children are encouraged to report suspicious persons to the government, and some denounce their parents. Citizens are controlled, and the smallest sign of rebellion, even something so small as a facial expression, can result in immediate arrest and imprisonment. Thus, citizens, particularly party members, are compelled to obedience.\n\n\"The Principles of Newspeak\" is an academic essay appended to the novel. It describes the development of Newspeak, the Party's minimalist artificial language meant to ideologically align thought and action with the principles of Ingsoc by making \"all other modes of thought impossible\". (A linguistic theory about how language may direct thought is the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis.)\n\nWhether or not the Newspeak appendix implies a hopeful end to \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" remains a critical debate, as it is in Standard English and refers to Newspeak, Ingsoc, the Party etc., in the past tense: \"Relative to our own, the Newspeak vocabulary was tiny, and new ways of reducing it were constantly being devised\" p. 422). Some critics (Atwood, Benstead, Milner, Pynchon) claim that for the essay's author, both Newspeak and the totalitarian government are in the past.\n\n\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" uses themes from life in the Soviet Union and wartime life in Great Britain as sources for many of its motifs. American producer Sidney Sheldon wrote to Orwell in the early 1950s, interested in adapting the novel to the Broadway stage. Orwell sold the American stage rights to Sheldon, explaining that his basic goal with \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" was imagining the consequences of Stalinist government ruling British society:\n[\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\"] was based chiefly on communism, because that is the dominant form of totalitarianism, but I was trying chiefly to imagine what communism would be like if it were firmly rooted in the English speaking countries, and was no longer a mere extension of the Russian Foreign Office.\n\nThe statement \"2 + 2 = 5\", used to torment Winston Smith during his interrogation, was a communist party slogan from the second five-year plan, which encouraged fulfillment of the five-year plan in four years. The slogan was seen in electric lights on Moscow house-fronts, billboards and elsewhere.\n\nThe switch of Oceania's allegiance from Eastasia to Eurasia and the subsequent rewriting of history (\"Oceania was at war with Eastasia: Oceania had always been at war with Eastasia. A large part of the political literature of five years was now completely obsolete\"; ch 9) is evocative of the Soviet Union's changing relations with Nazi Germany. The two nations were open and frequently vehement critics of each other until the signing of the 1939 Treaty of Non-Aggression. Thereafter, and continuing until the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, no criticism of Germany was allowed in the Soviet press, and all references to prior party lines stopped—including in the majority of non-Russian communist parties who tended to follow the Russian line. Orwell had criticised the Communist Party of Great Britain for supporting the Treaty in his essays for \"Betrayal of the Left\" (1941). \"The Hitler-Stalin pact of August 1939 reversed the Soviet Union's stated foreign policy. It was too much for many of the fellow-travellers like Gollancz [Orwell's sometime publisher] who had put their faith in a strategy of construction Popular Front governments and the peace bloc between Russia, Britain and France.\"\n\nThe description of Emmanuel Goldstein, with a \"small, goatee beard\", evokes the image of Leon Trotsky. The film of Goldstein during the Two Minutes Hate is described as showing him being transformed into a bleating sheep. This image was used in a propaganda film during the Kino-eye period of Soviet film, which showed Trotsky transforming into a goat. Goldstein's book is similar to Trotsky's highly critical analysis of the USSR, \"The Revolution Betrayed\", published in 1936.\n\nThe omnipresent images of Big Brother, a man described as having a moustache, bears resemblance to the cult of personality built up around Joseph Stalin.\n\nThe news in Oceania emphasised production figures, just as it did in the Soviet Union, where record-setting in factories (by \"Heroes of Socialist Labor\") was especially glorified. The best known of these was Alexey Stakhanov, who purportedly set a record for coal mining in 1935.\n\nThe tortures of the Ministry of Love evoke the procedures used by the NKVD in their interrogations, including the use of rubber truncheons, being forbidden to put your hands in your pockets, remaining in brightly lit rooms for days, torture through the use of provoked rodents, and the victim being shown a mirror after their physical collapse.\n\nThe random bombing of Airstrip One is based on the Buzz bombs and the V-2 rocket, which struck England at random in 1944–1945.\n\nThe Thought Police is based on the NKVD, which arrested people for random \"anti-soviet\" remarks. The Thought Crime motif is drawn from Kempeitai, the Japanese wartime secret police, who arrested people for \"unpatriotic\" thoughts.\n\nThe confessions of the \"Thought Criminals\" Rutherford, Aaronson and Jones are based on the show trials of the 1930s, which included fabricated confessions by prominent Bolsheviks Nikolai Bukharin, Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev to the effect that they were being paid by the Nazi government to undermine the Soviet regime under Leon Trotsky's direction.\n\nThe song \"Under the Spreading Chestnut Tree\" (\"Under the spreading chestnut tree, I sold you, and you sold me\") was based on an old English song called \"Go no more a-rushing\" (\"Under the spreading chestnut tree, Where I knelt upon my knee, We were as happy as could be, 'Neath the spreading chestnut tree.\"). The song was published as early as 1891. The song was a popular camp song in the 1920s, sung with corresponding movements (like touching your chest when you sing \"chest\", and touching your head when you sing \"nut\"). Glenn Miller recorded the song in 1939.\n\nThe \"Hates\" (Two Minutes Hate and Hate Week) were inspired by the constant rallies sponsored by party organs throughout the Stalinist period. These were often short pep-talks given to workers before their shifts began (Two Minutes Hate), but could also last for days, as in the annual celebrations of the anniversary of the October revolution (Hate Week).\n\nOrwell fictionalized \"newspeak\", \"doublethink\", and \"Ministry of Truth\" as evinced by both the Soviet press and that of Nazi Germany. In particular, he adapted Soviet ideological discourse constructed to ensure that public statements could not be questioned.\nWinston Smith's job, \"revising history\" (and the \"unperson\" motif) are based on the Stalinist habit of airbrushing images of 'fallen' people from group photographs and removing references to them in books and newspapers. In one well-known example, the Soviet encyclopaedia had an article about Lavrentiy Beria. When he fell in 1953, and was subsequently executed, institutes that had the encyclopaedia were sent an article about the Bering Strait, with instructions to paste it over the article about Beria.\n\nBig Brother's \"Orders of the Day\" were inspired by Stalin's regular wartime orders, called by the same name. A small collection of the more political of these have been published (together with his wartime speeches) in English as \"On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union\" By Joseph Stalin. Like Big Brother's Orders of the day, Stalin's frequently lauded heroic individuals, like Comrade Ogilvy, the fictitious hero Winston Smith invented to 'rectify' (fabricate) a Big Brother Order of the day.\n\nThe Ingsoc slogan \"Our new, happy life\", repeated from telescreens, evokes Stalin's 1935 statement, which became a CPSU slogan, \"Life has become better, Comrades; life has become more cheerful.\"\n\nIn 1940 Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges published Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius which described the invention by a \"benevolent secret society\" of a world that would seek to remake human language and reality along human-invented lines. The story concludes with an appendix describing the success of the project. Borges' story addresses similar themes of epistemology, language and history to 1984.\n\nDuring World War II, Orwell believed that British democracy as it existed before 1939 would not survive the war. The question being \"Would it end via Fascist \"coup d'état\" from above or via Socialist revolution from below\"? Later, he admitted that events proved him wrong: \"What really matters is that I fell into the trap of assuming that 'the war and the revolution are inseparable'.\"\n\n\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (1949) and \"Animal Farm\" (1945) share themes of the betrayed revolution, the person's subordination to the collective, rigorously enforced class distinctions (Inner Party, Outer Party, Proles), the cult of personality, concentration camps, Thought Police, compulsory regimented daily exercise, and youth leagues. Oceania resulted from the US annexation of the British Empire to counter the Asian peril to Australia and New Zealand. It is a naval power whose militarism venerates the sailors of the floating fortresses, from which battle is given to recapturing India, the \"Jewel in the Crown\" of the British Empire. Much of Oceanic society is based upon the USSR under Joseph Stalin—Big Brother. The televised Two Minutes Hate is ritual demonisation of the enemies of the State, especially Emmanuel Goldstein (\"viz\" Leon Trotsky). Altered photographs and newspaper articles create unpersons deleted from the national historical record, including even founding members of the regime (Jones, Aaronson and Rutherford) in the 1960s purges (\"viz\" the Soviet Purges of the 1930s, in which leaders of the Bolshevik Revolution were similarly treated). A similar thing also happened during the French Revolution in which many of the original leaders of the Revolution were later put to death, for example Danton who was put to death by Robespierre, and then later Robespierre himself met the same fate.\n\nIn his 1946 essay \"Why I Write\", Orwell explains that the serious works he wrote since the Spanish Civil War (1936–39) were \"written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism\". \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" is a cautionary tale about revolution betrayed by totalitarian defenders previously proposed in \"Homage to Catalonia\" (1938) and \"Animal Farm\" (1945), while \"Coming Up for Air\" (1939) celebrates the personal and political freedoms lost in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" (1949). Biographer Michael Shelden notes Orwell's Edwardian childhood at Henley-on-Thames as the golden country; being bullied at St Cyprian's School as his empathy with victims; his life in the Indian Imperial Police in Burma and the techniques of violence and censorship in the BBC as capricious authority.\n\nOther influences include \"Darkness at Noon\" (1940) and \"The Yogi and the Commissar\" (1945) by Arthur Koestler; \"The Iron Heel \"(1908) by Jack London; \"1920: Dips into the Near Future\" by John A. Hobson; \"Brave New World\" (1932) by Aldous Huxley; \"We\" (1921) by Yevgeny Zamyatin which he reviewed in 1946; and \"The Managerial Revolution\" (1940) by James Burnham predicting perpetual war among three totalitarian superstates. Orwell told Jacintha Buddicom that he would write a novel stylistically like \"A Modern Utopia\" (1905) by H. G. Wells. \n\nExtrapolating from World War II, the novel's pastiche parallels the politics and rhetoric at war's end—the changed alliances at the \"Cold War's\" (1945–91) beginning; the Ministry of Truth derives from the BBC's overseas service, controlled by the Ministry of Information; Room 101 derives from a conference room at BBC Broadcasting House; the Senate House of the University of London, containing the Ministry of Information is the architectural inspiration for the Minitrue; the post-war decrepitude derives from the socio-political life of the UK and the US, i.e., the impoverished Britain of 1948 losing its Empire despite newspaper-reported imperial triumph; and war ally but peace-time foe, Soviet Russia became Eurasia.\n\nThe term \"English Socialism\" has precedents in his wartime writings; in the essay \"\" (1941), he said that \"the war and the revolution are inseparable... the fact that we are at war has turned Socialism from a textbook word into a realisable policy\" – because Britain's superannuated social class system hindered the war effort and only a socialist economy would defeat Adolf Hitler. Given the middle class's grasping this, they too would abide socialist revolution and that only reactionary Britons would oppose it, thus limiting the force revolutionaries would need to take power. An English Socialism would come about which \"will never lose touch with the tradition of compromise and the belief in a law that is above the State. It will shoot traitors, but it will give them a solemn trial beforehand and occasionally it will acquit them. It will crush any open revolt promptly and cruelly, but it will interfere very little with the spoken and written word.\"\n\nIn the world of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", \"English Socialism\" (or \"Ingsoc\" in Newspeak) is a totalitarian ideology unlike the English revolution he foresaw. Comparison of the wartime essay \"The Lion and the Unicorn\" with \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" shows that he perceived a Big Brother regime as a perversion of his cherished socialist ideals and English Socialism. Thus Oceania is a corruption of the British Empire he believed would evolve \"into a federation of Socialist states, like a looser and freer version of the Union of Soviet Republics\".\n\nWhen first published, \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" was generally well received by reviewers. V. S. Pritchett, reviewing the novel for the \"New Statesman\" stated: \"I do not think I have ever read a novel more frightening and depressing; and yet, such are the originality, the suspense, the speed of writing and withering indignation that it is impossible to put the book down.\" P. H. Newby, reviewing \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" for \"The Listener\" magazine, described it as \"the most arresting political novel written by an Englishman since Rex Warner's \"The Aerodrome.\"\" \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" was also praised by Bertrand Russell, E. M. Forster and Harold Nicolson. On the other hand, Edward Shanks, reviewing \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" for \"The Sunday Times\", was dismissive; Shanks claimed \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" \"breaks all records for gloomy vaticination\". C. S. Lewis was also critical of the novel, claiming that the relationship of Julia and Winston, and especially the Party's view on sex, lacked credibility, and that the setting was \"odious rather than tragic\".\n\n\"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" has been adapted for the cinema, radio, television and theatre at least twice each, as well as for other art media, such as ballet and opera.\n\nThe effect of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" on the English language is extensive; the concepts of Big Brother, Room 101, the Thought Police, thoughtcrime, unperson, memory hole (oblivion), doublethink (simultaneously holding and believing contradictory beliefs) and Newspeak (ideological language) have become common phrases for denoting totalitarian authority. Doublespeak and groupthink are both deliberate elaborations of \"doublethink\", and the adjective \"Orwellian\" means similar to Orwell's writings, especially \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". The practice of ending words with (such as \"mediaspeak\") is drawn from the novel. Orwell is perpetually associated with 1984; in July 1984, an asteroid was discovered by Antonín Mrkos and named after Orwell.\n\n\nReferences to the themes, concepts and plot of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" have appeared frequently in other works, especially in popular music and video entertainment. An example is the worldwide hit reality television show \"Big Brother\", in which a group of people live together in a large house, isolated from the outside world but continuously watched by television cameras.\n\n\nThe book touches on the invasion of privacy and ubiquitous surveillance. From mid-2013 it was publicized that the NSA has been secretly monitoring and storing global internet traffic, including the bulk data collection of email and phone call data. Sales of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" increased by up to seven times within the first week of the 2013 mass surveillance leaks. The book again topped the Amazon.com sales charts in 2017 after a controversy involving Kellyanne Conway using the phrase \"alternative facts\" to explain discrepancies with the media.\n\nThe book also shows mass media as a catalyst for the intensification of destructive emotions and violence. Since the 20th century, news and other forms of media have been publicizing violence more often. In 2013, the Almeida Theatre and Headlong staged a successful new adaptation (by Robert Icke and Duncan Macmillan), which twice toured the UK and played an extended run in London's West End. The play opened on Broadway in 2017.\n\nIn the decades since the publication of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", there have been numerous comparisons to the Aldous Huxley's novel \"Brave New World\", which had been published 17 years earlier, in 1932. They are both predictions of societies dominated by a central government and are both based on extensions of the trends of their times. However, members of the ruling class of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" use brutal force, torture and mind control to keep individuals in line, but rulers in \"Brave New World\" keep the citizens in line by addictive drugs and pleasurable distractions.\n\nIn October 1949, after reading \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", Huxley sent a letter to Orwell and wrote that it would be more efficient for rulers to stay in power by the softer touch by allowing citizens to self-seek pleasure to control them rather than brute force and to allow a false sense of freedom:\n\nElements of both novels can be seen in modern-day societies, with Huxley's vision being more dominant in the West and Orwell's vision more prevalent with dictators in ex-communist countries and the theocracies and the dictatorships of the Middle East, as is pointed out in essays that compare the two novels, including Huxley's own \"Brave New World Revisited\".\n\nComparisons with other dystopian novels like \"The Handmaid's Tale\", \"Virtual Light\", \"The Private Eye\" and \"Children of Men\" have also been drawn.\n\n\n\n",
                "Nations of Nineteen Eighty-Four\n\nOceania, Eurasia and Eastasia are the three fictional superstates in George Orwell's satirical dystopian novel \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\".\n\nHow the world evolved into the three states is vague. They appear to have emerged from nuclear warfare and civil dissolution over 20 years between 1945, the end of World War II, and 1965. Eurasia was likely formed first, followed closely afterwards by Oceania, with Eastasia emerging a decade later, possibly in the 1960s.\n\nOceania is the superstate in which protagonist Winston Smith dwells. It is believed to be composed of the Americas, the British Isles (called \"Airstrip One\" in the novel), Iceland, Australia, New Zealand, Polynesia, and Southern Africa below the River Congo. It also controls, to different degrees and at various times during the course of its perpetual war with either Eurasia or Eastasia, the polar regions, India, Indonesia, and the islands of the Pacific. Oceania lacks a single capital city, but London and apparently New York City may be regional capitals. In the novel, Emmanuel Goldstein, Oceania's declared public enemy number one, describes it in the fictional book \"The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism\" as a result of the United States having absorbed the British Empire. Goldstein's book also states that Oceania's primary natural barrier is the sea surrounding it.\n\nThe ruling doctrine of Oceania is Ingsoc, the Newspeak neologism for English Socialism. Its nominal leader is Big Brother, believed by the masses to have been the leader of the revolution and still used as an icon by the Party. The cult of personality is maintained through Big Brother's function as a focal point for love, fear, and reverence, more easily felt towards an individual than towards an organization.\n\nThe unofficial language of Oceania is English (officially called Oldspeak), and the official language is Newspeak. The restructuring of the language is intended to eliminate unorthodox political and social thought by eliminating the words needed to express it.\n\nThe society of Oceania is sharply stratified into three groups: the small ruling Inner Party, the more-numerous and highly-indoctrinated Outer Party, and the large body of politically-meaningless Proles. Apart from exceptions such as Hate Week, the proles remain essentially outside Oceania's political control and are placated by trivial sports and other entertainment: the Thought Police manage any Proles who are socially aware enough to be a problem.\n\nOceania's national anthem is \"Oceania, Tis For Thee\", which, in one of the three film versions of the book, takes the form of a crescendo of organ music along with operatic lyrics. The lyrics are sung in English, and the song is reminiscent of \"God Save the Queen\" and \"My Country, 'Tis of Thee\".\n\nEven the names of countries, and their shapes on the map, had been different. Airstrip One, for instance, had not been so called in those days: it had been called England, or Britain, though London, he felt fairly certain, had always been called London.\n\nLike the rest of Europe, Britain was hit by atomic weapons in the conflicts before the revolutions in Oceania and then elsewhere. One British town, Colchester, is referenced specifically as having been destroyed; flashbacks to Smith's childhood also include scenes of Londoners taking refuge in the London Underground tunnels in the midst of the bombing.\n\nIt is stated that Eurasia was formed when the Soviet Union annexed the rest of Continental Europe, creating a single polity stretching from Portugal to the Bering Strait. Orwell frequently describes the face of the standard Eurasian as \"mongolic\" in the novel. The only soldiers other than Oceanians to appear in the novel are the Eurasians. When a large number of captured soldiers are executed in Victory Square, some Slavs are mentioned, but the stereotype of the Eurasian maintained by the Party is Mongoloid, like O'Brien's servant, Martin. This implies that the Party uses racism to avert sympathy towards an enemy.\n\nAccording to Goldstein's book, Eurasia's main natural defence is its vast territorial extent, while the ruling ideology of Eurasia is identified as \"Neo-Bolshevism\", a variation of the Oceanian \"Ingsoc\".\n\nEastasia's borders are not as clearly defined as those of the other two superstates, but it is known that they encompass most of modern-day China, Japan, Taiwan, and Korea. Eastasia repeatedly captures and loses Indonesia, New Guinea, and the various Pacific archipelagos. Its political ideology is, according to the novel, \"called by a Chinese name usually translated as Death-worship, but perhaps better rendered as 'Obliteration of the Self'\". Orwell does not appear to have based this on any existing Chinese word or phrase.\n\nNot much information about Eastasia is given in the book. It is known that it is the newest and smallest of the three superstates. According to Goldstein's book, it emerged a decade after the establishment of the other two superstates, placing it somewhere in the 1960s, after years of \"confused fighting\" among its predecessor nations. (At the time of writing, the victory of Mao Zedong's Communists in the Chinese Civil War was not yet taken as a foregone conclusion. The Korean War had also not yet occurred, but Korea was already being administered by two competing governments. Japan was still under military occupation by several different powers, at least until shortly before Orwell completed the book. Power in the real-life nations that make up the fictional Eastasia was, therefore, very much in flux.) It is also said in the book that the industriousness and the fecundity of the people of Eastasia allow them to overcome their territorial inadequacy in comparison to the other two powers. At the time Orwell wrote the book, East Asians, including the Japanese, all had birth rates higher than those of Europeans.\n\nThe \"disputed area\", which lies \"between the frontiers of the super-states\", is \" rough quadrilateral with its corners at Tangier, Brazzaville, Darwin, and Hong Kong\". This area is fought over during the perpetual war among the three superstates, one of which sometimes controls vast swaths of the disputed territory, only to lose it again. The reason that the three superstates seek to control the area is to harness the large population and the vast resources within the region. Control of the islands in the Pacific and the polar regions is also constantly shifting, but there also, none of the three superpowers ever gains a lasting hold. The inhabitants of the area, having no allegiance to any nation, live in constant slavery under whichever power controls them.\n\nEastasia and Eurasia fight over \"a large but fluctuating portion of Manchuria, Mongolia, and Tibet\".\n\nAt one point during the novel, Julia procures tea to share with Winston and remarks that she thinks Oceania recently captured India (or perhaps parts of India), but such \"control\" is usually transient.\n\nThe world of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" exists in a state of perpetual war among the three major powers. Two of the three states are aligned against the third: Oceania and Eurasia against Eastasia or Eurasia and Eastasia against Oceania. However, as Goldstein's book points out, each superstate is so powerful that even an alliance of the other two cannot destroy it, which results in a continuing stalemate. From time to time, one of the states betrays its ally and sides with its former enemy. In Oceania, when that occurs, the Ministry of Truth rewrites history to make it appear that the current state of affairs is the way it has always been, and documents with contradictory information are destroyed in the memory hole.\n\nGoldstein's book states that the war is not a war in the traditional sense but simply exists to use up resources and keep the population in line. Victory for any side is not attainable or even desirable, but the Inner Party, through an act of doublethink, believes that such victory is possible. Although the war began with the limited use of atomic weapons in a limited atomic war in the 1950s, the combatants all stopped using them for fear of upsetting the balance of power. Relatively few technological advances have been made (the only two mentioned are the replacement of bombers with \"rocket bombs\" and of traditional capital ships with the immense \"floating fortresses\"). Examples of both technologies had been developed in the closing stages of World War II: the V2 rocket, the ice aircraft carrier, and the floating harbour.\n\nAlmost all of the information about the world beyond London is given to the reader through government or Party sources, which, by the very premise of the novel, are unreliable narrators. Specifically, Julia brings up the idea in one page that the war is fictional and that the rocket bombs falling from time to time on London are fired by the government of Oceania itself to maintain the war atmosphere among the population. The protagonists have no means of proving or disproving the theory. However, during preparations for Hate Week, rocket bombs fall at an increasing rate, hitting places such as playgrounds and crowded theatres, causing mass casualties and increased hysteria and hatred for the Party's enemies. War is also a convenient pretext to maintain a huge military–industrial complex in which the state is committed to developing and acquiring large and expensive weapons systems, which almost immediately become obsolete and require replacement. Finally, according to Goldstein's book, war makes handing over power to a small caste easier and gives a pretext to do so.\n",
                "Perpetual war\n\nPerpetual war, endless war, or a forever war, is a lasting state of war with no clear conditions that would lead to its conclusion. These wars are situations of ongoing tension that may escalate at any moment, similar to the Cold War. Today, the concepts are used to critique the United States Armed Forces interventions in foreign nations and the military–industrial complex, or wars with ambiguous enemies such as the War on Terror or the War on Drugs.\n\nThe concept of a Forever War has been used in opposition to United States military involvement since the Vietnam War. James Pinckney Harrison argues in \"The Endless War: Fifty Years of Struggle in Vietnam\" (1981) that the Vietnam War was \"endless\" due to the success of the communist revolution in nationalizing the people. The concept was used by Trần Văn Đôn, a general in the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, in his book \"Our Endless War: Inside Vietnam (1978)\" \".\"\n\nAmerican historian James Chace argues in his book \"Endless War: How we got involved in Central America\" (1983) argues that US policy in Central America is based upon the assumption that US hegemony is threatened within the region. According to Chace, US involvement in Central America worked towards resisting the domino effect of the spread of a \"communist take-over,\" largely through establishing the credibility of US military. Though these policies were meant to deter conflict, they themselves created the conditions for instability in the region, which furthered a US response. This resulted in a self-perpetuating, or \"endless,\" loop. He additionally argues US investment in pursuing an expanding military presence in Central America reflects an endless preparation for war.\n\nA key argument of Chace is that much this military involvement stems from a logic of US paranoia in reaction to the Cuban Revolution. A similar argument is put forward by David Keen, political economist and Professor of Complex Emergencies at the London School of Economics. His book \"Endless War? Hidden Function of the 'War on Terror\"' (2006) argues that the United States' strategies and tactics in the War On Terror use a \"militaristic state-cased framework.\" This framework, though \"counterproductive,\" has an \"inner logic\" and a \"psychological function\" of responding to the trauma of 9/11.\n\nNoam Chomsky posits that a state of perpetual war is an aid to (and is promoted by) the powerful members of dominant political and economic classes, helping maintain their positions of economic and political superiority.\n\nBritish journalist Robert Fisk, a critic of Western policies in the Middle East, argues that recent Western conflicts against the Middle East, after the end of the Cold War, have been part of a new perpetual war. He suggests that Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush launched attacks on Iraq, Sudan, and Afghanistan to distract the population from his domestic political problems. In addition, he claims that despite victorious claims after the first Gulf War that Saddam Hussein had been \"defanged,\" he was again the target of Western attacks until his execution in 2006.\n\nSimilarly, Ted Koppel described the War on Terror as \"Our Children's Children's War.\" Critics of Western policies have used the term \"perpetual war\" in reference to non-military \"wars\", such as the \"War on Drugs\", \"War on Poverty\", \"War on Cancer\", Lou Dobbs's \"War on the Middle Class\", or the \"War on Terrorism\", the \"War on Women\", or Bill O'Reilly's \"War on Christmas\".\n\nThe economic make-up of the 5th century BC Athens-led Delian League also bears resemblance to the economic ramifications of \"preparing\" for Perpetual war. Aspects of any given empire, such as the British Empire and its relation to its domestic businesses that were owned by a wealthy minority of individuals, such as the East India Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, and De Beers, manifest an observed relationship between a minority of individuals influencing Empire or State policy, such as the Child's War in India, the Anglo-Mysore Wars in India, the Anglo-French conflicts on Hudson Bay in Canada, and the Second Boer War in South Africa, follow a pattern where the Empire allocates resources pursuing and sustaining policies that financially profit the Empire's domestic business's owners.\n\nThe concept of a military-industrial complex was first suggested by U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower and the idea that military action can be seen as a form of market-creation goes back at least as far as speeches beginning in 1930 prior to the publication of War Is a Racket in 1935. On January 16, 1961, President Eisenhower delivered his farewell speech expressing great concern for the direction of the newfound armaments industry post WWII. While recognizing the boom in economic growth after the war, he reminded the people of America that this was indeed a way of profiting off warfare and that if not regulated enough it could lead to the \"grave\" expansion of the armaments industry. For his warning of the thirst to profit from warfare through weapon production, Eisenhower coined the term \"military industrial complex.\" He says, \"The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.\" Eisenhower feared that the military industrial complex could lead to a state of perpetual war as the big armament industry will continue to profit from warfare. Additionally, NSC 68 can be used as a reference to understand U.S. President Harry S. Truman's reasoning for the continued build up the United State's nuclear arsenal and how this contributed to the Cold War. This concept is still present in today's policies as William D. Hartung states in his article The Doctrine of Armed Exceptionalism.\n\nThe Cold War was a time of extreme tensions between the Soviet Union's interest of expansion of Communism and the NATO countries which operated on a dominantly capitalist economy. The Soviet Union was viewed as a threat to the American national government as well as its citizens. When the Soviet military reached Afghanistan, the United States took action in training the people of the middle eastern nations to combat the Soviet Army. During the Soviet-Afghan War under the Carter administration, the CIA gave a lot of aid and training to the Islamic Jihadists and helped fund Wahhabi Universities in Afghanistan, Pakistan as well as Iraq. In 1979, Osama Bin Laden was assigned to the CIA and received U.S. military training. In 1985, President Reagan met with Islamic Jihadists at the White House. Under Reagan's presidency, these Islamic Jihadists were known as \"freedom fighters,\" but were later relabeled as \"Islamic terrorists\" under President George W. Bush's administration.\n\nThe Global War on Terror was declared in 2001 by President George W. Bush, following the attacks on the world trade center. However, though President Bush's coined term of the \"War on Terror\" is argued to not be the beginning of a war, rather apart of a longer lasting war apart of a wider and deeper issue. This In 1996, Osama Bin Laden, of Al Qaeda, made threat to the United States, by making a declaration of war. The growing tensions of the middle east is suggested by Laurence Andrew Dobrot, to be very wide cultural misunderstandings and faults of the west in not making peace with the middle east. As the Deputy Director for the Missile Defense Agency’s Airborne Laser Program, Dobrot, examines the hostility which has been continuous not only since 2001, but since the birth of Wahhabism.\n\nDobrot proposed that the U.S should recognize the cultural hostility of the tribal Arabs in order to make the first steps towards progression of making peace.\n\nThe Crusades arose as European expansion was growing at the peak of unified Islamic dominance. As the Crusades marked the beginning of conflict between the Christian countries and Islamic countries, some say that the so-called war on terror is a continuation of the Crusades. On September 16, 2001, in a speech, President Bush referred to the War on terror as a crusade. He said: No one could have conceivably imagined suicide bombers burrowing into our society and then emerging all in the same day to fly their aircraft - fly U.S. aircraft into buildings full of innocent people - and show no remorse. This is a new kind of -- a new kind of evil. And we understand. And the American people are beginning to understand. This crusade, this war on terrorism is going to take a while. And the American people must be patient. I'm going to be patient.Andrew Bacevich described Bush's naming of the war on terror as a crusade as something which does not make the war separate, rather something that shows that it is part of an \"eternal war.\"\n\nThe War on Drugs was declared by President Nixon in 1971, during a period where drugs were perceived and used as an act of rebellion by the younger generation. This was just after the 60's counterculture as psychedelic drugs and marijuana were explored amidst large masses of political protests during the Vietnam war. The War on Drugs was later picked up by the Reagan administration as First Lady Nancy Reagan spread the message with her slogan \"Just Say No\" to drugs. Though coined by Ronald Reagan, the policies which his administration implemented existed stretching back to Woodrow Wilson's Presidency. Security measures were taken under Reagan, to ensure restrictions be put on drugs. The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 was passed so that pharmaceutical companies may keep track of the distributions and maintain restrictions on certain types of drugs. In 1988 the Office of National Drug Control Policy was set to pass more regulations and restrictions on drug policies yet the media labeled the agency directors are the \"drug czars.\" Under George Bush's administration, a significant increase of actions were taken toward the war on drugs, including militant force, student drug testing, and drug raids.\n\nThe War on Drugs received lots of critical reception from Political figures as well as political critics, such as President Obama and Pat Robertson. Pat Robertson said that the war on drugs must come to an end as there is a mass incarceration of drug users, who did not commit any violent acts, serving time. He says, “We here in America make up 5 percent of the world’s population, but we make up 25 percent of jailed prisoners,\" in reference to the war on drugs.\n\nWith the advent of perpetual war, communities have begun to construct War Memorials with names of the dead while the wars are ongoing. See the Northwood Community Park's memorial which has space for 8,000 names (approximately 4,500 used at time of construction) and plans to update it yearly.\n\nPolitical Philosopher Thomas Hobbes succinctly wrote in 1651 that a hypothetical State of nature was a condition of perpetual war. The following quotation from chapter 13 of his book \"Leviathan\" explores the causes and effects of perpetual war:\n\nAncient war advisor Sun Tzu expressed views in the 6th century BC about perpetual war. The following quotation from chapter 2, Waging War, of his book \"The Art of War\" suggests the negative impacts of prolonged war:\n\nHistorian Alexis de Tocqueville made predictions in 1840 concerning perpetual war in democratic countries. The following is from Volume 2, chapter 22, \"Why Democratic Nations Naturally Desire Peace and Democratic Armies, War\", 18th paragraph, in his book, Democracy in America:\n\nThe development of a relationship network between people who wield political and economic power as well as those who own capital in companies that financially profit from warfare have a relationship to records influencing public opinion of war through the influence of mass media outlets. These may also include the presentation for the causes of war, the effects of war, and the Censorship of war. The following authors, have suggested that entering a state of perpetual war becomes progressively easier in a modern democratic republic, such as the United States:\n\n\n\n\n"

                "Dystopia\n\nA dystopia (from the Greek δυσ- and τόπος, alternatively, cacotopia, kakotopia, or simply anti-utopia) is a community or society that is undesirable or frightening. It is translated as \"not-good place\" and is an antonym of utopia, a term that was coined by Sir Thomas More and figures as the title of his best known work, \"Utopia\", published 1516, a blueprint for an ideal society with minimal crime, violence and poverty.\n\nDystopian societies appear in many artistic works, particularly in stories set in the future. Some of the most famous examples are George Orwell's \"1984\" and Aldous Huxley's \"Brave New World\". Dystopias are often characterized by dehumanization, totalitarian governments, environmental disaster, or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to real-world issues regarding society, environment, politics, economics, religion, psychology, ethics, science, or technology. However, some authors also use the term to refer to actually-existing societies, many of which are or have been totalitarian states, or societies in an advanced state of collapse and disintegration.\n\nThough several earlier usages are known, \"dystopia\" was deployed as an antonym for \"Utopia\" by J. S. Mill in one of his Parliamentary Speeches 1868 (\"Hansard Commons\") by adding the prefix \"dys\" ( \"bad\"), reinterpreting the initial \"U\" as the prefix \"eu\" ( \"good\") instead of \"ou\" ( \"not\"). It was used to denounce the government's Irish land policy: \"It is, perhaps, too complimentary to call them Utopians, they ought rather to be called dys-topians, or caco-topians. What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable.\"\n\nDecades before the first documented use of the word \"dystopia\" was \"cacotopia\" (using , \"bad, wicked\") originally proposed in 1818 by Jeremy Bentham: \"As a match for utopia (or the imagined seat of the best government) suppose a cacotopia (or the imagined seat of the worst government) discovered and described.\" Though dystopia became the most popular term, cacotopia finds occasional use, for example by Anthony Burgess, author of \"A Clockwork Orange\", who said it was a better fit for Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\" because \"it sounds worse than dystopia\". Some scholars, such as Gregory Claeys and Lyman Tower Sargent, make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias. For example, Claeys and Sargent define literary dystopias as societies imagined as substantially worse than the contemporaneous society in which the author writes, whereas anti-utopias function as criticisms of attempts to implement various concepts of utopia.\n\nIn \"When the Sleeper Wakes\", H. G. Wells depicted the governing class as hedonistic and shallow. George Orwell contrasted Wells's world to that depicted in Jack London's \"The Iron Heel\", where the dystopian rulers are brutal and dedicated to the point of fanaticism, which Orwell considered more plausible.\n\nWhereas the political principles at the root of fictional utopias (or \"perfect worlds\") are idealistic in principle and successfully result in positive consequences for the inhabitants, the political principles on which fictional dystopias are based, while often based on utopian ideals, result in negative consequences for inhabitants because of at least one fatal flaw.\n\nDystopias are often filled with pessimistic views of the ruling class or a government that is brutal or uncaring, ruling with an \"iron hand\" or \"iron fist\". These dystopian government establishments often have protagonists or groups that lead a \"resistance\" to enact change within their society, as is seen in Alan Moore's \"V for Vendetta\".\n\nDystopian political situations are depicted in novels such as \"We\", \"Parable of the Sower\", \"Darkness at Noon\", \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", \"Brave New World\", \"The Hunger Games\" and \"Fahrenheit 451\"; and in such films as \"Metropolis\", \"Brazil\", \"Battle Royale\", \"\", and \"Soylent Green\".\n\nThe economic structures of dystopian societies in literature and other media have many variations, as the economy often relates directly to the elements that the writer is depicting as the source of the oppression. However, there are several archetypes that such societies tend to follow.\n\nA commonly occurring theme is that the state plans the economy, state capitalism versus a free market economy which is also dystopian as shown in such works as Ayn Rand's \"Anthem\" and Henry Kuttner's short story \"The Iron Standard\". A prime example of this is reflected in Norman Jewison's 1975 film \"Rollerball\". Some dystopias, such as that of \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", feature black markets with goods that are dangerous and difficult to obtain, or the characters may be totally at the mercy of the state-controlled economy. Such systems usually have a lack of efficiency, as seen in stories like Philip Jose Farmer's \"Riders of the Purple Wage\", featuring a bloated welfare system in which total freedom from responsibility has encouraged an underclass prone to any form of antisocial behavior. Kurt Vonnegut's \"Player Piano\" depicts a dystopia in which the centrally controlled economic system has indeed made material abundance plentiful, but deprived the mass of humanity of meaningful labor; virtually all work is menial and unsatisfying, and only a small number of the small group that achieves education is admitted to the elite and its work. In Tanith Lee's \"Don't Bite the Sun\", there is no want of any kind – only unabashed consumption and hedonism, leading the protagonist to begin looking for a deeper meaning to existence.\n\nEven in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society's flaws, as in \"Brave New World\", the state often controls the economy. In \"Brave New World\", a character, reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body, cites as a reason that everyone works for everyone else.\n\nOther works feature extensive privatization and corporatism; both byproducts of capitalism, where privately owned and unaccountable large corporations have effectively replaced the government in setting policy and making decisions. They manipulate, infiltrate, control, bribe, are contracted by, or otherwise function as government. This is seen in the novels \"Jennifer Government\" and \"Oryx and Crake\" and the movies \"Alien\", \"Avatar\", \"RoboCop\", \"Visioneers\", \"Idiocracy\", \"Soylent Green\", \"THX 1138\", \"WALL-E\" and \"Rollerball\". Corporate republics common in the cyberpunk genre, as in Neal Stephenson's \"Snow Crash\" and Philip K. Dick's \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" (as well as the film \"Blade Runner\", loosely based on Dick's novel).\n\nDystopian fiction frequently draws stark contrasts between the privileges of the ruling class and the dreary existence of the working classes.\n\nIn the novel \"Brave New World\", written in 1931 by Aldous Huxley, a class system is prenatally designated in terms of Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas, and Epsilons, with the lower classes having reduced brain-function and special conditioning to make them satisfied with their position in life. Outside of this society there also exist several human settlements that still exist in the \"conventional\" way but which the class system describe as \"savages\".\n\nIn \"Ypsilon Minus\" by Herbert W. Franke, people are divided into numerous alphabetically ranked groups.\n\nSome fictional dystopias, such as \"Brave New World\" and \"Fahrenheit 451\", have eradicated the family and deploy continuing efforts to keep it from re-establishing itself as a social institution. In \"Brave New World\", where children are reproduced artificially, the concepts \"mother\" and \"father\" are considered obscene. In some novels, the State is hostile to motherhood: for example, in \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\", children are organized to spy on their parents; and in \"We\", by Yevgeny Zamyatin, the escape of a pregnant woman from One State is a revolt.\n\nReligious groups play the role of the oppressed and oppressors. In \"Brave New World\", for example, the establishment of the state included lopping off the tops of all crosses (as symbols of Christianity) to make them \"T\"s, (as symbols of Henry Ford's Model T). Margaret Atwood's novel \"The Handmaid's Tale\", on the other hand, takes place in a future United States under a Christianity-based theocratic regime. One of the earliest examples of this theme is Robert Hugh Benson's \"Lord of the World\", about a futuristic world where the Freemasons have taken over the world and the only other religion left is a Roman Catholic minority.\n\nIn the Russian novel \"We\" by Yevgeny Zamyatin, first published in 1921, people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are only referred to by numbers instead of names.\n\nIn some dystopian works, such as Kurt Vonnegut's \"Harrison Bergeron\", society forces individuals to conform to radical egalitarian social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment or even competence as forms of inequality.\n\nViolence is prevalent in many dystopias, often in the form of war (e.g. \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\"); urban crimes led by gangs (often of teenagers) (e.g. \"A Clockwork Orange\"); rampant crime met by blood sports (e.g. \"Battle Royale\", \"The Running Man\", \"The Hunger Games\" and \"Divergent\"). Also explained in Suzanne Berne's essay \"Ground Zero\", where she explains her experience with the aftermath of 11 September 2001.\n\nFictional dystopias are commonly urban and frequently isolate their characters from all contact with the natural world. Sometimes they require their characters to avoid nature, as when walks are regarded as dangerously anti-social in Ray Bradbury's \"Fahrenheit 451\", as well as within Bradbury's short story \"The Pedestrian.\" In C. S. Lewis's \"That Hideous Strength\", science coordinated by government is directed toward the control of nature and the elimination of natural human instincts. In \"Brave New World\", the lower classes of society are conditioned to be afraid of nature, but also to visit the countryside and consume transportation and games to promote economic activity. Lois Lowry's \"The Giver\", in a manner similar to Brave New World, shows a society where technology and the desire to create a utopia has led humanity to enforce climate control on the environment, as well as to eliminate many undomesticated species, and to provide psychological and pharmaceutical repellent against basic human instincts. E. M. Forster's \"The Machine Stops\" depicts a highly changed global environment which forces people to live underground due to an atmospheric contamination. As Angel Galdon-Rodriguez points out, this sort of isolation caused by external toxic hazard is later used by Hugh Howey in his series of dystopias of the Silo Series.\n\nExcessive pollution that destroys nature is common in many dystopian films, such as \"The Matrix\", \"RoboCop\", \"WALL-E\", and \"Soylent Green\". A few \"green\" fictional dystopias do exist, such as in Michael Carson's short story \"The Punishment of Luxury\", and Russell Hoban's \"Riddley Walker\". The latter is set in the aftermath of nuclear war, \"a post-nuclear holocaust Kent, where technology has reduced to the level of the Iron Age\".\n\nContrary to the technologically utopian claims, which view technology as a beneficial addition to all aspects of humanity, technological dystopia concerns itself with and focuses largely (but not always) on the negative effects caused by new technology.\n\n1. \"Technologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature.\"\nJaron Lanier, a digital pioneer, has become a technological dystopian. “I think it’s a way of interpreting technology in which people forgot taking responsibility,” he says.\n\n“‘Oh, it’s the computer that did it, not me.’ ‘There’s no more middle class? Oh, it’s not me. The computer did it’” (Lanier). This quote explains that people begin to not only blame the technology for the changes in lifestyle but also believe that technology is an omnipotence. It also points to a technological determinist perspective in terms of reification.\n\n2. \"Technologies harm our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.\"\n\n3. \"Technologies reinforce hierarchies - concentrate knowledge and skills; increase surveillance and erode privacy; widen inequalities of power and wealth; giving up control to machines). \"\nDouglas Rushkoff, a technological utopian, states in his article that the professional designers “re-mystified” the computer so it wasn’t so readable anymore; users had to depend on the special programs built into the software that was incomprehensible for normal users.\n\n4. \"New technologies are sometimes regressive (worse than previous technologies).\"\n\n5. \"The unforeseen impacts of technology are negative.\"\n“ ‘The most common way is that there’s some magic artificial intelligence in the sky or in the cloud or something that knows how to translate, and what a wonderful thing that this is available for free. But there’s another way to look at it, which is the technically true way: You gather a ton of information from real live translators who have translated phrases… It’s huge but very much like Facebook, it’s selling people back to themselves… [With translation] you’re producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime, the original translators aren’t paid for their work… You’re actually shrinking the economy.’”\n\n6. \"More efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life (by causing stress, destroying jobs, making us more materialistic).\"\nIn his article “Prest-o! Change-o!,” technological dystopian James Gleick mentions the remote control being the classic example of technology that does not solve the problem “it is meant to solve.” Gleick quotes Edward Tenner, a historian of technology, that the ability and ease of switching channels by the remote control serves to increase distraction for the viewer. Then it is only expected that people will become more dissatisfied with the channel they are watching.\n\n7. \"New technologies cannot solve problems of old technologies or just create new problems.\"\nThe remote control example explains this claim as well, for the increase in laziness and dissatisfaction levels was clearly not a problem in times without the remote control. He also takes social psychologist Robert Levine’s example of Indonesians “‘whose main entertainment consists of watching the same few plays and dances, month after month, year after year,’ and with Nepalese Sherpas who eat the same meals of potatoes and tea through their entire lives. The Indonesians and Sherpas are perfectly satisfied.” Because of the invention of the remote control, it merely created more problems.\n\n8. \"Technologies destroy nature (harming human health and the environment). \"\nThe need for business replaced community and the “story online” replaced people as the “soul of the Net.” Because information was now able to be bought and sold, there was not as much communication taking place.\n\nDystopias typically reflect contemporary sociopolitical realities and extrapolate worst-case scenarios as warnings for necessary social change or caution. Dystopian fictions invariably reflect the concerns and fears of its contemporaneous culture. Due to this they are a subject of social studies. Syreeta McFadden notes that contemporary dystopian literature and films increasingly pull their inspiration from the worst imaginings of ourselves and present reality, making it often hard to distinguish between entertainment and reality.\n\nIn a 1967 study Frank Kermode suggests that the failure of religious prophecies led to a shift in how society apprehends this ancient mode. Christopher Schmidt notes that while the world goes to waste for future generations we distract ourselves from disaster by passively watching it as entertainment.\n\nIn recent years there has seen a surge of popular dystopian young adult literature and blockbuster films. Theo James, actor in \"Divergent\", notes that \"young people in particular have such a fascination with this kind of story\", saying \"It's becoming part of the consciousness. You grow up in a world where it's part of the conversation all the time – the statistics of our planet warming up. The environment is changing. The weather is different. There are things that are very visceral and very obvious, and they make you question the future and how we will survive. It's so much a part of everyday life that young people inevitably — consciously or not — are questioning their futures and how the Earth will be. I certainly do. I wonder what kind of world my children's kids will live in.\"\n\nSome have commented on this trend, saying that \"it is easier to imagine the end of the world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism\".\n\n\n",
                "South African criminal law\n\nSouth African criminal law is the body of national law relating to crime in South Africa. In the definition of Van der Walt \"et al\", a crime is \"conduct which common or statute law prohibits and expressly or impliedly subjects to punishment remissible by the state alone and which the offender cannot avoid by his own act once he has been convicted.\" Crime involves the infliction of harm against society. The function or object of criminal law is to provide a social mechanism with which to coerce members of society to abstain from conduct that is harmful to the interests of society.\n\nIn South Africa, as in most adversarial legal systems, the standard of evidence required to validate a criminal conviction is proof beyond a reasonable doubt. The sources of South African criminal law are to be found in the common law, in case law and in legislation.\n\nCriminal law (which is to be distinguished from its civil counterpart) forms part of the public law of South Africa, as well as of the substantive law (as opposed to the procedural). The study of “criminal law” generally focuses on the substantive law: namely, the principles of law according to which criminal liability (guilt or innocence) is determined, whereas the law of criminal procedure, together with the law of evidence, generally focuses on the procedures used to decide criminal liability and theories of punishment. A study of the substantive criminal law may be divided into two broad sections:\n\n\nA distinction must be drawn also between national and international criminal law. The term \"criminal law\" usually refers to internal or domestic or national criminal law, which is governed by the legal system of the country concerned. The term \"international criminal law,\" denoting a more recent branch of the law, is viewed by some as a branch of public international law, while others contend that it is, \"at least in the material sense (and to a growing extent also in the institutional and procedural sense), a discipline in its own right.\"\n\nThe criminal justice system in South Africa is aimed at law enforcement, the prosecution of offenders and the punishment of the convicted. It is that part or sub-system of the national legal system which determines the circumstances and the procedures according to which people and legal entities may be punished by the State for criminal conduct.\n\nPunishment is the authoritative infliction by the State of suffering for a criminal offence. The \"essential purpose of criminal law is to provide a mechanism for \"punishing\" the offender.\" There are numerous theories of punishment, whose two main purposes are\n\n\nThe various theories of punishment seek to answer the question: \"Why does the criminal justice system punish individuals? In other words, \"what is the purpose of punishment\"?\"\n\nIn criminal law, a number of theories of punishment have been identified. They are normally grouped or classified under three broad headings:\n\n\nRetributive or absolute theories of punishment, \"perhaps the best known with ancient roots,\" aim to restore the legal balance upset by the crime; they are also known as \"just desert.\" Ancient notions of justice, including the idea of \"an eye for an eye\" (the ancient \"lex talionis\"), \"clearly informed this theory of punishment.\"\n\nIn modern criminal law, \"one should be careful not to confuse retribution with vengeance.\" The focus now is not on vengeance, private or otherwise; it is, rather, \"a more nuanced and enlightened attempt to restore the balance that was disturbed by the criminal conduct.\" It has been argued, accordingly, that it would be more appropriate to refer to this approach as \"restorative justice.\" An important point or premise to keep in mind, when considering the retributive theory of punishment, is the fundamental notion of criminal law that individuals are personally responsible for their own wrongdoing. This is the idea of self-determinism or free will.\n\nRetributive theories generally take proportionality into account and consider the perpetrator's record of previous wrongdoing. They do not seek to justify punishment with reference to some future benefit which it may achieve; it is incorrect, in fact, to describe retribution as a \"purpose of punishment.\" Retribution, according to this theory, is the essential \"characteristic\" of punishment.\n\nThere are three types of utilitarian or relative theories of punishment:\n\n\nThe first two, deterrence and prevention, are connected, in that the goal of deterrence is to prevent recidivism or repeat offending.\n\nAccording to the preventive theory of punishment, the purpose of punishment is the prevention of crime. This theory can overlap with its deterrent and reformative counterparts, since both deterrence and reformation may be seen merely as methods of preventing crime. Among the \"less drastic examples of the preventive approach\" are \"(preventive) imprisonment, and the forfeiture of a driver's license.\"\n\nOn the other hand, there are other forms of punishment (such as capital punishment and life imprisonment, and the castration of sexual offenders) which are in line with the preventive purpose, but which do not necessarily serve also the aims of reformation and deterrence. These forms are \"the most extreme manifestation\" of the preventive theory: \"The criminal offender is permanently incapacitated and can no longer pose a risk to society.\" Capital punishment \"can also be seen as the ultimate form of retribution.\"\n\nOf all the relative theories, the theory that punishment should serve as a deterrent \"is arguably the most popular.\" There is an important distinction to be made between\n\n\nIndividual deterrence may be said to be aimed primarily at the prevention of recidivism, although the rate of recidivism in South Africa is around ninety per cent, which would seem to suggest that it is not meeting with success.\n\nIf the punishment meted out to the individual offender is \"disproportionately harsh\" in its service as a warning to the rest of society, \"the punishment can no longer be described as a 'just desert' (in terms of the retributive theory) and, in the South African context, there might also be a constitutional objection.\" Accordingly, \"the general deterrent approach to punishment is [...] less attractive (at least not as attractive as the retributive theory, which holds out the possibility of better proportionality).\"\n\nThe third of the utilitarian or relative theories of punishment is the reformative theory, which is encapsulated by the judgment in \"S v Shilubane\", where the court found \"abundant empirical evidence\"—it cited none, though—that retributive justice had \"failed to stem the ever-increasing wave of crime\" in South Africa. The courts, it decided, must therefore \"seriously consider\" alternative sentences, like community service, as viable alternatives to direct imprisonment. A reformatory approach, the court found, would \"benefit our society immensely by excluding the possibility of warped sentences being imposed routinely on people who do not deserve them.\"\n\n\"This approach,\" write Kemp \"et al\", \"is, on the face of it, quite attractive, since it purports to be sophisticated and aimed not at retribution, but at \"reform\" (which connotes positive impressions of the betterment of individuals and society).\" There are, however, \"many practical and theoretical objections.\" They all come down, in essence, to the contention that reformation \"does not actually work in practice--the criminal justice system is simply not good at 'reforming' people.\" Furthermore, \"there is also a theoretical/moral objection: if the focus is only on the individual offender that needs to be reformed, then there is no justice in terms of the victims or the broader society. That leaves the very real impression or perception that 'justice was not served.'\"\n\nBecause \"the various theories of punishment all contain positive and negative aspects,\" an \"obvious approach should therefore be a well-balanced combination of the elements that are best suitable in terms of the interests of society, the individual offender and the nature of the crime.\" In criminal law, this is known as \"the combination theory of punishment.\"\n\nThe most-cited and -generally accepted of the combination theories is that laid out in \"S v Zinn\", where Rumpff JA laid out a basic triad of sentencing considerations:\n\n\nThis judgment has been taken as \"confirming the combination theory as the best approach\" in South African law.\n\nIn \"S v Makwanyane\", which eliminated capital punishment in South Africa, Chaskalson P provided a clearer combination of the other theories of punishment, laying emphasis on deterrence, prevention and retribution. \"S v Rabie\", Although recognised as a legitimate object of punishment, retribution should not, according to the court, be given undue weight, given South Africa’s human rights ethos and the role to be played by \"ubuntu\" in society; the primary object of punishment should be prevention and rehabilitation, not revenge. The court held that \"punishment should fit the criminal as well as the crime, be fair to society, and be blended with a measure of mercy according to the circumstances.\"\n\nThe court in \"S v Salzwedel\" held that among the aggravating factors to be considered in sentencing was racial motivation in the commission of a serious offence, because racism subverted the fundamental premises of the ethos of human rights which now, after the negotiated settlement, permeated South Africa's processes of judicial interpretation and discretion. The court decided that a substantial term of imprisonment, for a murder committed out of racism, would give expression to the community's legitimate feelings of outrage. It would also send out a strong message that the courts will not tolerate—they will deal severely with—serious crimes perpetrated in consequence of racist and intolerant values inconsistent with the ethos of the Constitution.\n\nIn \"S v Combrink\" the court held that, given the public ire with sentences which appear to favour a particular group in society, the court must exercise judicial sensitivity in cases which appear to have racial or discriminatory connotations. The public interest against discrimination is not necessarily in discrimination between black and white, but rather between people in general who perceive others, with prejudice, to be different or inferior to them. In order properly to combat hate crimes, decision makers in the criminal justice system should be attuned to the fact that the effects go far beyond the victims, serving to traumatise whole communities and damaging South African society.\n\nAccording to the principle of legality, the State may inflict punishment only for contraventions of a designated crime created by a law that, before the contravention, was in force, valid and applicable. It is a corollary of the rule of law: an idea developed, mainly during the 17th and 18th centuries, by such political philosophers as Montesquieu and Beccaria, \"in reaction to the harshness and arbitrariness of the political systems of their day.\" The doctrine of the rule of law holds that people should be governed by and according to law (a body of established and impartial rules), rather than by \"the arbitrary whims of those in power,\" and that everyone, including those in power, should be subject to the law. No-one should be \"above the law.\"\n\nThe principle of legality is summed up in the dictum \"nullum crimen sine lege\", \"no crime without a law.\" This principle, \"basic to criminal liability in our law,\" as the court put it in \"S v Smit\", is supplemented by that of \"nullum crimen sine poena\", \"no crime without punishment.\" In \"R v Zinn\", although the court did not make the assumption that, if an enactment is to create a crime, it should provide either expressly or by reference for a punishment, it was thought \"improbable that if the lawgiver had intended that the Besluit should create a crime, he would not have taken the precaution of inserting a penalty—more particularly as this is what appears generally to have been done.\" The court in \"R v Carto\" held that \"to render any act criminal in our law, there must be some punishment affixed to the commission of the act,\" and that \"where no law exists affixing such punishment there is no crime in law.\"\n\nAnother important principle is \"nulla poena sine lege\": \"no punishment without a law.\" To apply the principle of legality, it is important that the definitions both of common-law and of statutory crimes be reasonably precise and settled. Penal statutes should be strictly construed; the law should be accessible. Finally, there is the dictum \"nullum crimen, nulla poena sine praevia lege poenali\": \"laws and punishments do not operate retrospectively.\"\n\nThe South African Constitution entrenches the principle of legality. Its preamble states that South Africa is founded on the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law. The Bill of Rights, meanwhile, provides that \"every accused person has a right to a fair trial, which includes the right\n\n\nIn terms of the \"ius certum\" principle (the principle of certainty), the crime must not, as formulated, be vague or unclear. The subject must understand exactly what is expected of him. The definition of a crime should be reasonably precise and settled, so that people need not live in fear of breaking the law inadvertently. Although the Constitution does not expressly provide that vague or unclear penal provisions may be struck down, it is \"quite possible and even probable,\" according to Snyman, that the first provision above will be interpreted in such a way that vaguely defined statutory crimes may be declared null and void. This \"void-for-vagueness\" rule may be based either on the right to a fair trial in general or on the principle that, if a criminal norm in legislation is vague and uncertain, it cannot be stated that the act or omission in question actually constituted an offence prior to a court's interpretation of the legislation.\n\nIt is also possible to base the operation of the \"ius certum\" provision on section 35(3)(a) of the Constitution, which provides that the right to a fair trial includes the right to be informed of the charge with sufficient detail to answer it. In \"S v Lavhengwa\" it was held that the right created in section 35(3)(a) implies that the charge itself must be clear and unambiguous. This, according to the court, would only be the case if the nature of the crime were sufficiently clear and unambiguous to comply with the constitutional right to be sufficiently informed of the charge. It was held further that, to comply with the requirement of sufficient clarity, one should bear in mind\n\n\nIt is not only statutory criminal provisions that may, on the ground of vagueness, be declared null and void in terms of the Constitution, but also provisions of the common law that are vague and uncertain. In \"S v Friedman\" it was argued on behalf of the accused that the rule in regard to the crime of fraud (that the prejudice need be neither actual nor of a patrimonial nature) was unconstitutional on the ground of vagueness. Although the court rejected the argument, it is noteworthy that nowhere in its judgment did it call into question the principle that rules of common law may be declared null and void on the ground of vagueness.\n\nProbably the most important principle of criminal liability is captured in the dictum \"actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea\", or \"an act is not unlawful unless there is a guilty mind.\" To establish criminal liability, the State must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused has committed\n\n\nAlthough in theory one could begin to study the general principles of criminal liability with any one of these three elements, the usual starting point is to consider the accused's conduct. If the State is unable to prove unlawful conduct on the part of the accused, the accused cannot be criminally liable, and the enquiries into criminal capacity and fault become redundant. Criminal capacity and fault are never determined in isolation; they must be determined in relation to the relevant accused's particular unlawful conduct. For these reasons, a trial court will normally begin its judgment by considering whether the State has proved the \"actus reus\", before going on to consider the other two elements of liability.\n\nSince each crime has its own definition, the \"actus reus\" varies according to the crime concerned. There are, however, certain essential requirements which must invariably be met in order to satisfy the unlawful-conduct part of the enquiry. Burchell lists the elements of unlawful conduct as\n\n\nFor Snyman, it is the following:\n\n\nThe law violated by the conduct could be common law or statute. Where, however, the conduct with which the accused is charged does not fit the definition of a crime, or where that crime did not exist at the time the conduct occurred, the principle of legality has not been satisfied, and the accused cannot be held liable. He is entitled to object to the charge on the basis that it does not disclose an offence.\n\nThe conduct must\n\n\nCriminal law is concerned with punishing the acts of human beings. The act, therefore, must be a human act; it must be committed or carried out by a human being. This is self-explanatory. The criminal justice system is not used to punish animals for their misconduct. If, however, a human uses an animal to carry out a criminal act—for example, if he incites a dog to bite someone—this does not exonerate the perpetrator: It is the human act, the incitement of the dog, which is punishable.\n\nCriminal law is concerned with punishing only such conduct as the accused has the power to prevent or avoid if he wants to. In order, therefore, to attract criminal liability, the accused's conduct must in the first instance be voluntary. The term \"voluntary,\" as it is used in this part of the enquiry, has a special and restricted meaning. It has nothing to do with what the accused intended or desired or wanted to do; it is concerned merely with whether or not the accused's actions were controlled by his conscious will, in the sense that the accused was physically able to direct them, prevent them or stop them, if he chose to do so. If the relevant act or omission is involuntary, the general rule is that the accused is not criminally liable.\n\nThe State bears the onus of proving that the accused’s conduct was voluntary. If, however, the accused alleges that he acted involuntarily, he must lay an evidential foundation for that defence. It is not sufficient for him simply to place the issue in dispute and leave it at that. Furthermore, even if the accused’s act or omission was involuntary, he may yet be held criminally liable if the involuntary conduct was made possible by some prior voluntary conduct on his part.\n\nInvoluntary actions are not regarded as conduct for the purposes of criminal liability. The same applies to involuntary omissions, which are cases in which the accused failed to act as required by law, because he lacked the physical ability to control his actions at the relevant time. The following are therefore not usually regarded as examples of voluntary conduct for the purposes of criminal law:\n\n\nAs described in the English case of \"Bratty v A-G for Northern Ireland\", automatism is any act which is performed by the muscles without any control of the mind. Examples include a spasm, reflex or convulsion, or an act by a person who is unconscious because he is a sleep. Bratty, \"in casu\", had strangled a passenger in his car. His defence was that he had suffered a blackout and could not remember the critical events. Lord Denning, on appeal, dismissed this defence as “the first refuge of a guilty mind.” He added, “An act is not involuntary merely because it is not remembered; amnesia does not equal automatism.”\n\nThe word “automatism” is derived from \"automaton,\" which refers to a mechanical device with no thought or will of its own. A person might to perform what appears to be a conscious and goal-directed action, but he might actually not be in conscious control of that action, or even aware of what he is doing. In some cases, such a person commits acts which, if committed voluntarily, would amount to crimes. Because his conduct is involuntary, however, he cannot be held criminally liable for those acts or their consequences.\n\nCases of genuine automatism are uncommon and may be difficult to prove. Automatism is sometimes classified according to whether or not it is\n\n\nFormerly the courts would draw a distinction between \"sane\" and \"insane\" automatism. Where the automatism is due to a mental illness or defect (whether psychogenic or organic), it is termed insane automatism. In such cases, the accused must raise the defence of mental illness or defect. This defence excludes criminal capacity rather than unlawful conduct. It has two significant consequences for the accused:\n\n\nIn \"S v Stellmacher\", a case which illustrates the difference between sane and insane automatism, Stellmacher was an epileptic who, while in a state of automatism, shot and killed someone. Before the incident, he had been on a severe diet for some weeks. On the day in question, he ate nothing and did hard physical labour. At about 18:00, he went to the bar of the local hotel and drank half a bottle of brandy. He had a gun with him. There, in the bar, according to his evidence, he \"lapsed into a state of automatism, as a result of the strong reflection in his eyes of the setting sun through an empty bottle.\" He then became involved in an altercation with someone in the bar, took out his gun, let off a few shots, and then, for no apparent reason, proceeded to shoot the deceased, who had just entered the bar to ask if he could order a drink.\n\nAt the trial, expert evidence was led that Stellmacher was suffering from \"amnesia and automatism\" due to hypoglycaemia and/or epilepsy, possibly triggered by his fasting and drinking. The central issue was not whether or not he should be convicted of murder—it was accepted that he was not liable—but rather whether or not he had suffered from a temporary mental disorder, necessitating a special verdict. The court held that Stellmacher's automatism, in this case, was due to physical factors, not any physical abnormality, so a special verdict was not required. He was found not guilty and acquitted outright.\n\nAmong the more common forms and causes of sane automatism are the following:\n\n\nThere has in recent years been a move away from the distinction between sane and insane automatism, because of the confusion it causes, given that the defence of \"insane automatism\" is actually nothing more or less than the defence of mental illness.\n\nOne example of automatism may be found in cases of epilepsy, the main symptom of which is repeated seizures, usually with convulsions. The exact causes of epilepsy are not fully known or understood, but it is thought to be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, resulting in some of the nerve cells becoming overactive and firing off random, uncontrolled signals. This results in seizures.\n\nMovements performed during an epileptic seizure are involuntary. Generally, therefore, they cannot result in criminal liability. Because, however, the cause of epilepsy is centred in the brain, there was doubt for some time as to whether or not it should perhaps be regarded as a mental illness or defect. If so, this would mean that the defence of insanity would have to be raised, relying on the Criminal Procedure Act of 1977. It was ultimately settled, though, that epilepsy in South African law is not a mental illness or defect. A special verdict, therefore, is not required.\n\nA case in which a defence relying on epilepsy succeeded is \"R v Mkize\". Mkize was an epileptic. One day, while cutting meat with a sharp knife, he experienced an episode that the testifying expert described at trial as an \"epileptic equivalent\"--\"an attack where the ordinary fit is replaced by a period of confusion.\" During this episode, for no apparent reason, he suddenly stabbed and killed his sister, standing next to him. He was charged with her murder. His defence was that his conduct was involuntary. The court found, on a balance of probabilities, that he had indeed suffered an \"epileptic equivalent.\" He had been unconscious, with \"neither judgment, will, purpose nor reasoning.\" The stabbing was a result of \"blind reflex activity.\" There was no intention to kill. His actions, therefore, could not constitute unlawful conduct for the purposes of criminal liability. The verdict was \"not guilty.\"\n\nAlthough involuntary acts and omissions cannot, in themselves, give rise to criminal liability, a situation that requires special consideration is when the accused is liable not on the basis of his final involuntary act or omission, but on the basis rather of some prior voluntary conduct, coupled with the required form of fault (usually negligence), where such conduct is causally connected to the later involuntary act or omission.\n\nIn \"R v Victor\", the appellant knew that he was prone to epileptic fits—he had been since the age of fourteen or fifteen—but nevertheless drove a motor car, against medical advice. One day, he suffered a fit while driving and collided with a pedestrian and another car. Someone was badly hurt. He was charged with and convicted of reckless or negligent driving—not because he was epileptic, but because he had chosen to drive when a reasonable person would have foreseen the likelihood of a fit and its consequences. He should not in the circumstances have driven at all. Even though his conduct was involuntary at the time of the accident, he could not use his disability to escape liability. He was convicted on the basis of his negligent prior voluntary conduct.\n\nThe driver in \"R v Schoonwinkel\", also an epileptic, was charged with culpable homicide, having collided with and killed the driver of another car. The accused had suffered an epileptic fit at the time of the accident, rendering his mind a blank and leaving him with no time to take evasive action. Unlike Victor, Schoonwinkel had had only two previous and minor attacks, the last a long time before the accident. The court accepted that the nature of his epilepsy was such that he would not normally have realised or foreseen the dangers of driving. This evidence, distinguishing this case from \"Victor\", exonerated him from criminal responsibility. His prior conduct had not been negligent.\n\nAnother example of automatism may be found in cases of intoxication. When a person is extremely drunk, or otherwise intoxicated, this may lead to temporary loss of consciousness, and sometimes to automatic behaviour. South African law, as a general principle of criminal liability, does not distinguish between automatism as a result of intoxication and other forms of sane automatism, regardless of whether the intoxication is voluntary or involuntary. The Appellate Division reiterated in \"S v Johnson\" that only voluntary conduct is punishable. This includes voluntary drunkenness which does not result in a mental disease: It is no defence in respect of an offence committed during such drunkenness.\n\nIn \"S v Chretien\" the leading authority on the defence of intoxication, the Appellate Division held that voluntary intoxication may constitute an absolute defence, leading to a total acquittal, where, \"inter alia\", the accused drinks so much that he lacks criminal capacity. In particular, the court distinguished between three different stages of intoxication and their effect on criminal liability:\n\n\nThe case of \"Chetrien\" explains why intoxication features as a defence under unlawful conduct, again under criminal capacity, and again under fault. For present purposes, however, it ought to be noted that it is only extreme intoxication that will lead to involuntary conduct.\n\nThe general principles that relate to voluntary intoxication have been modified, firstly by a long-standing principle of Roman-Dutch law, known as the \"actio libera in causa\" rule, and more recently by the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act.\n\nIf a person deliberately gets drunk in order to commit a crime “that he might otherwise not have had the courage to commit,” the \"actio libera in causa\" rule provides that he will be guilty of that crime, even if his conduct was not voluntary at the time of its commission, because the original cause of that conduct (getting drunk) was within his conscious control at the time he did so.\n\n\"Chetrien\" led to “a public outcry,” which resulted, seven years later, in the legislature’s intervening to limit the destructive consequences of the decision. Parliament enacted section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, in \"a vain attempt to reflect public sentiment on intoxication.\" In so doing, \"the Legislature simply compounded the problems.\" Modelled on the German penal code, this provision created the special statutory offence of committing a prohibited act while in a state of criminal incapacity induced by the voluntary consumption of alcohol. In other words, it is a criminal offence in itself to commit a criminal act while one’s criminal capacity is impaired by the voluntary use of an intoxicating substance, if one \"knows\" that the substance is one which tends to have an intoxicating effect, and if one is then found not liable for the crime in question due to one’s lack of criminal capacity. This requires the prosecution to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused is \"not\" liable for a common-law offence (although he may be subjected to the same punishment) because of the lack of capacity resulting from this self-induced intoxication, \"so requiring the prosecution to engage in an unfamiliar \"volte face\".\" As Burchell explains,\n\nIf the intoxication, leading to an acquittal of the common-law offence, is only sufficient to impair intention (as on the facts of \"Chretien\"), rather than sufficient to impair capacity, then no liability can result under s 1(1), as lack of \"capacity\" resulting from intoxication has to be proved for a conviction under s 1(1). The section is in dire need of reform or replacement with a more appropriately worded section.\n\nAnother defence is force, which may take the form either of \"vis absoluta\" (absolute force) or \"vis compulsiva\" (relative force). In \"S v Goliath\", the Appellate Division found that, on a charge of murder, compulsion can constitute a complete defence. When an acquittal may occur on this basis will depend on the particular circumstances of each case. The whole factual complex must be carefully examined and adjudicated upon with the greatest of care.\n\nUnlawful conduct most often takes the form of an act, or positive conduct, but there are occasions when an omission will be regarded as unlawful, and so will give rise to criminal liability.\n\nIn many cases, the accused’s conduct will take the form of actually committing an act that has been prohibited by law. This type of unlawful conduct “probably corresponds most closely with the popular conception of a crime.” Most common-law crimes fall into this category. For example,\n\n\nThis form of unlawful conduct is “generally easy to identify and understand.”\n\nUnlawful conduct may also take the form of an omission, a failure to act. The position here is less straightforward. The general rule is that a person will not be criminally liable for failing to protect or rescue another person, because there is no general duty on any person to prevent harm from coming to another, even if it could be done easily, and even if it would be the morally correct thing to do. This rule is based on the recognition\n\n\nThere are, however, certain situations where such a duty does exist, because the legal convictions of the community demand that, in these situations, the failure to protect or rescue should be regarded as unlawful.\n\nAn omission is punishable only if there is a legal duty upon someone to perform a certain type of active conduct. \"Minister of Police v Ewels\", although a delictual case, expresses the general rule, with its broad and flexible test for liability arising out of omissions: An omission is to be regarded as unlawful conduct when the circumstances of the case are of such a nature\n\n\nTo make a determination as to whether or not there is unlawfulness, the question is not whether there was the usual \"negligence\" of the \"bonus paterfamilias\"; the question is whether, regard being had to all the facts, there was a duty in law to act reasonably. In \"Ewels\", a citizen was assaulted in a police station by an off-duty officer in the presence of other officers. It was held by the court, on the facts of this case, that a policeman on duty, if he witnesses an assault, has a duty to come to the assistance of the person being assaulted. The failure of the police to do so made the Minister of Police liable for damages.\n\nThe flexible test in \"Ewels\" was adopted into criminal law in \"S v Gaba\".\n\nIn deference to the principle of legality, authors and commentators on criminal law usually rely on those established categories of liability which have emerged from the case law over the years. These categories of liability may be regarded as the crystallised legal convictions of the community referred to in \"Ewels\". A legal duty to act may exist\n\n\nIn \"S v Russell\", Russell was an employee of the Department of Water Affairs. Together with his supervisor and co-workers, he was unloading pipes onto a lorry at a railway station. The workers were using an overhead crane, parked under the railway’s electric power lines. Because of the danger, the power had been switched off. While Russell’s supervisor and co-workers were away having lunch, the power was turned on again. A railway employee told Russell to warn the crane operator about this—that is, about the danger of operating a crane under a live electric wire—when the workers returned. Russell accepted this instruction without pointing out that he was not the supervisor, and failed to pass on the warning when loading resumed. This omission, constituting negligence, led to one death, as the crane touched the power line and the operator was electrocuted. Russell was convicted of culpable homicide and appealed to the High Court (then the Supreme Court), which held that the way in which Russell had apparently accepted the warning had created a potentially dangerous situation. That being the case, he had attracted a legal duty to pass on the warning. By failing culpably in this duty, he was clearly negligent. His conviction of culpable homicide was confirmed.\n\nIn \"S v Fernandez\", the court held that the appellant had been negligent in mending a cage from which a vicious baboon had subsequently escaped, which subsequently bit a child, who subsequently died. The appellant must have foreseen the likelihood of an attack in the event of the baboon's escaping; he was, the court held, rightly convicted of culpable homicide for failing take steps to prevent this: that is to say, for failing to keep the cage door in good repair.\n\nIn \"Minister of Police v Skosana, there was a negligent delay in furnishing medical aid to the deceased, whose widow established, on a balance of probabilities, that he would not otherwise have died. She was granted damages. The duty to protect detainees, the court held, extends further than merely preventing them from being assaulted. There is also, for example, the duty to obtain medical treatment for them when necessary.\n\nThe police in \"Minister of Law & Order v Kadir\" failed to collect information which would have enabled the seriously injured respondent to pursue a civil claim against the driver of the other vehicle. The Minister raised an exception, contending that there was no legal duty on the police to collect such information. The court \"a quo\" dismissed this argument, finding that the community would consider otherwise. On appeal, however, the SCA held that society understood police functions to relate principally to criminal matters, maintaining law and order, and preventing and detecting and investigating crime. The police are not designed to assist civil litigants. Society would baulk at the idea of holding policemen personally liable for damages arising out of a relatively insignificant dereliction. The respondent had not proved the existence of a legal duty.\n\nAs for the State's duty to protect persons from violent crime, there are a number of suggestive delictual cases.\n\nThe Constitutional Court, in \"Carmichele v Minister of Safety & Security\", found that the State could be held delictually liable for damages arising out of the unlawful omissions of its servants. \"In casu\", the conduct of the police and a prosecutor had resulted in the release of a person, charged with rape, on his own recognisance. This person had subsequently assaulted the complainant. Snyman, for one, has noted the court's emphasis on section 39(2) of the Constitution, which provides that \"every court [...] must promote the spirit, purport and objects of the Bill of Rights.\" This, he argues, \"may perhaps one day open the way for holding an individual police officer liable for a crime such as culpable homicide flowing from her negligent omission to protect a person from the real possibility of harm.\"\n\nIn \"Minister of Safety & Security v Van Duivenboden\", the Supreme Court of Appeal held that, while private citizens may be entitled to remain passive when the constitutional rights of other citizens are threatened, the State has a positive constitutional duty, imposed by section 7 of the Constitution, to act in protection of the rights in the Bill of Rights. The existence of this duty necessarily implies accountability. Where the State, represented by persons who perform its functions, acts in conflict with section 7, the norm of accountability must of necessity assume an important role in determining whether or not a legal duty ought to be recognised in any particular case. This norm need not always translate constitutional duties into private-law duties, enforceable by an action for damages; there are other remedies available for holding the State to account. Where, however, the State's failure to fulfil its constitutional duties occurs in circumstances that offer no effective remedy other than an action for damages, the norm of accountability will ordinarily demand the recognition of a legal duty, unless there are other considerations affecting the public interest which outweigh that norm.\n\nThe police in \"Minister of Safety & Security v Hamilton\" were negligent in their consideration and approval of an application for a firearm licence, accepting the correctness of information supplied by the applicant. They had a legal duty to \"exercise reasonable care in considering, investigating, recommending and ultimately granting\" such applications. Their failure properly to exercise this duty had resulted in the issuing of a firearm licence to an unfit person, who subsequently shot the respondent. The State was held to be delictually liable for the resultant damages.\n\nIn \"Van Eeden v Minister of Safety and Security\", the appellant was assaulted, raped and robbed by a known dangerous criminal who had escaped from police custody. The court held that the State was obliged to protect individuals by taking active steps to prevent violations of the constitutional right to freedom and security of the person: \"inter alia\", by protecting everyone from violent crime. It was also obliged under international law to protect women specifically from violent crime. In light of these imperatives, the court could no longer support the requirement of a special relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant for the imposition of a legal duty: The police have a duty to protect the public in general from known dangerous criminals in their custody.\n\nOnce it has been established that the accused had a legal duty to prevent the harm, he will be liable for his failure to do so only if he had the necessary means and opportunity to prevent it from occurring, and if the harm that did occur is directly attributable to his unlawful omission.\n\nCrimes of consequence should be distinguished from crimes of circumstance:\n\n\nCausation is not a general element of liability. Causation describes the way in which the definitional elements of some crimes are met.\n\nIn all consequence crimes, the State bears the onus of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that there is a sufficient link between the accused’s initial conduct and the prohibited consequence. If there is no causal link, or if the link is too tenuous, the accused will not be guilty of the crime, although he may perhaps be guilty of an attempt to commit that crime, or of some other offence.\n\nThere are two forms of causation which have to be proven. They form part of a two-stage causation enquiry:\n\n\nThe two-stage enquiry may be broken down into two elements: a factual element (the first stage) and a legal or policy element (the second).\n\nThe first stage of the enquiry is aimed at determining whether the accused’s conduct was the actual or “scientific” cause of the consequence, in that the consequence would not have occurred, either at all or when it did, had not it been for the accused’s conduct. To decide this, the court will apply the \"condictio sine qua non\" test, also known as the \"but-for\" theory. A \"condictio sine qua non\" is a condition without which something—that is to say, the prohibited situation—would not have materialised: literally, “the condition without which ... not.”\n\nIn the case of a positive act, the but-for test holds that, if not for that act, the unlawful consequence would not have ensued. The question to be asked is this: Can the act be notionally or hypothetically eliminated, without the disappearance of the consequence (at the time of the consequence), from the sequence of events which led to the consequence?\n\n\nIn the case of an omission, the \"conditio sine qua non\" theory considers whether, but for the omission, the consequence would not have ensued. In other words, we notionally or hypothetically insert the requited positive act into the sequence of events, in place of the accused’s inaction, and then consider whether or not the consequence in question would have occurred when it did:\n\n\nIn \"S v Van As\", Van As was a police officer. One night, he and a number of other policemen arrested a man for drunken driving and took him into custody. While the police were locking the suspect in a patrol van, the five young children in his company disappeared. The detainee begged the police to look for them. The police made a cursory search, but failed to find them. Three of the children managed to make their way home, but the following morning two of them were found dead from exposure. The police, including Van As, were charged with and convicted of culpable homicide. On appeal, however, the Appellate Division reversed the trial court’s decision. It held that, although it would have been reasonable to continue the search and make further enquiries, it had not been proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that the children would have been found by a proper search had one been undertaken. It had also not been so proven that the failure to institute such a search was responsible for the children's deaths. The State, then, was unable to show that the deaths had been factually caused by the omission of the police.\n\nIn \"Minister of Police v Skosana\" (noted earlier), there was a negligent delay in furnishing medical treatment to a prisoner who had been injured in a car accident and was then arrested for drunken driving. He ultimately died of his wounds. His widow brought a claim for damages arising out of his wrongful death, and was able to establish, on a balance of probabilities, that he would not have died \"but for\" that delay. There was adequate proof, in other words, that the deceased would probably have survived had he received medical treatment sooner. Having thus proved that the delay was a \"conditio sine qua non\" of her husband's demise, the widow was found to be entitled to damages.\n\nThe steps to take or questions to ask, in seeking to establish causation, are the following:\n\n\nOn the one hand, the law does not want individuals to escape liability for the natural and probable consequences of their conduct. On the other hand, the law does not seek to hold individuals liable for consequences that are too remote from their original conduct; otherwise the net of criminal liability would be spread too wide.\n\nTo determine whether or not it would be reasonable and fair to regard Andrew’s act as the cause of Susy’s death, for example, the court may invoke the aid of one or more specific theories of legal causation:\n\n\nIn terms of the proximate-cause criterion, the act of the accused may be seen to be the legal cause of a particular result only if the result arose directly from the accused’s conduct. The conduct will not be regarded as such if some new act or event intervened, between the accused’s conduct and the consequence in question, to alter the natural and probable course of events in such a way that the accused’s conduct, even though it may have been the original (and thus the factual) cause of the consequence, can no longer be regarded as its direct or proximate—that is, its closest—cause. If this happens, we say that the “chain” of causation has been broken. The accused, accordingly, is absolved from liability.\n\n\"S v Daniels\" provides what Synman describes as \"the clearest\" rejection of the theory of proximate cause in South African law. Two judges of appeal expressly refused to accept that only an act which is a proximate cause of death may qualify as its cause.\n\nIn \"S v Tembani\", however, it seemed to the Witwatersrand Local Division to be \"of overriding importance that the original wound inflicted by the accused was an operating and substantial cause of the death of the deceased.\"\n\nThe idea of a proximate cause was expressed negatively in \"R v Mubila\", with the statement that there must be no \"novus actus interveniens\" between X's conduct and Y's death, as well as positively, in the contention that Y's death must follow directly from X's conduct.\n\nSnyman, endorsing \"Daniels\", describes proximate cause as \"too vague and arbitrary to serve as a satisfactory criterion\" for legal causation.\n\nIn terms of the theory of adequate causation, an act is the legal cause of a situation if, according to human experience, in the normal course of events, the act has the tendency to bring about that type of situation. This theory, as noted above, was invoked in \"Daniels\".\n\nThere are a number of knowledge-based considerations:\n\n\nIn \"R v Loubser\", Rumpff J declared that, in the eyes of the law, an act is the cause of a situation if, according to human experience, the situation will flow from the act.\n\nA \"novus actus interveniens\" (or \"nova causa interveniens\") is a new intervening act, or a new intervening cause: that is to say, an abnormal interposition or event which breaks the chain of causation. A number of factors are important, according to Burchell, in determining what kind of intervening act or event breaks the causal chain. It is important to bear in mind that this stage of the enquiry involves strong policy considerations. It is not an enquiry merely into whether or not there was some kind of additional or external factor that contributed towards the consequence in question; the enquiry is into whether that factor is of such a nature and magnitude that it should exonerate the accused from liability for the actual consequences of his conduct.\n\nIf an act or event is unlikely, in light of human experience, to follow the accused's act, it is more probable that it will be found to be a \"novus actus interveniens\".\n\nIf the act of the accused is of a kind which is unlikely to cause death, the intervening act or event is considerably more likely to be regarded as a \"novus actus interveniens\".\n\nThe accused need not be the sole cause of the consequence.\n\nVoluntary conduct—conduct which is free and informed—is more likely to be regarded as a \"novus actus interveniens\" than involuntary conduct.\n\nAn abnormal event, otherwise amounting to a \"novus actus interveniens\", will not be so counted if it was foreseen by the accused (or, in cases of negligence, if it ought reasonably to have been foreseen), or if it was planned by him.\n\nThe victim's pre-existing physical susceptibilities are, by logical definition, never an intervening cause. Where, therefore, the victim was suffering from a physical condition, such as a weak heart, haemophilia, a cerebral aneurism or an earlier injury, rendering him particularly susceptible to harm, and thereby contributing to his death, the maxim in South African law is that “you take your victim as you find him,” with all his weaknesses and susceptibilities. This rule, commonly known as the “thin skull” or “eggshell skull” rule, comes from a number of early English cases in which the victims were found to have had abnormally thin skulls, which rendered them especially vulnerable to harm in cases of relatively minor injury.\n\nIn determining whether or not medical intervention ranks as a \"novus actus interveniens\", it is important to determine whether or not the intervention was negligent or in some other way improper. Where the deceased died as a result of (possibly risky) medical treatment, necessitated by the injury inflicted by the accused, and which was administered in good faith, it is not a \"novus actus interveniens\". The same applies if the accused died as a result of complications, such as an infection, which arose directly from such an injury.\n\nIt is also clear that a doctor’s inability to save the life of a victim who is already moribund or dying is not a \"novus actus interveniens\". Whether the withdrawal of a life-support system by a medical practitioner may be regarded as a \"novus actus\" arose in \"S v Williams\", where it was held that such medical conduct did not break the causal sequence set in motion by Williams, who had shot the deceased, thereby inflicting those initial wounds on the deceased which had necessitated her being put on the respirator in the first place. Within 48 hours, she had been pronounced brain-dead, and the respirator duly disconnected. When Williams was tried for her murder, he claimed that he had not been the cause of her death; it was, rather, the conduct of the doctors in disconnecting the respirator. On being convicted, he appealed to the Appellate Division, where the court distinguished between \"ending a fruitless attempt to save life\" and a positive act causing death, and held that, since the injury inflicted by Williams had been a mortal or life-threatening one, and since the deceased was being kept alive only by artificial means, the doctors did not cause her death when they disconnected the respirator. They were merely ending a fruitless attempt to save her life. Williams’s conviction was therefore upheld.\n\nIn \"S v Counter\", the appellant had shot the deceased, lodging a bullet in her buttock. Unbeknownst either to her or to her doctors, the bullet had penetrated her anal canal, causing virulent septicaemia and leading to the pneumonia from which, two weeks later, she died. It fell to the SCA to decide whether it was the shot fired or rather medical negligence which had caused her death:\n\nThe sequence of events from the time of the deceased's admission until her death was not interrupted by any causal factor which affected or changed the natural order of events, more particularly there was no intervention or omission by the persons responsible for her care [...]. It is inconceivable in these circumstances that the appellant should not be held responsible for the consequences of his actions, which led directly to his wife's death by stages entirely predictable and in accordance with human experience.\n\nFinally, it has been held in various decisions that, where X encourages Y to commit suicide—suicide, in itself, is not punishable in South African law—or where X provides Y with the means to commit suicide, the subsequent voluntary conduct of Y in committing suicide does not necessarily break the causal chain of events set in motion by X. Y's conduct, in other words, does not amount to a \"novus actus interveniens\". If Y's suicide was foreseen, X may be guilty of murder; if her suicide was unforeseen, but reasonably foreseeable, X will be guilty of culpable homicide.\n\nIn \"R v Motomane\" (of which Snyman disapproves), the accused, charged with murder, had knifed a woman, thereby injuring a vein. The bleeding stopped, but a clot formed. The woman would probably have recovered in the ordinary course of events, but this course was interrupted when a medical practitioner decided to operate: a prudent decision but not a strictly necessary one. The clot was disturbed during the operation; the woman bled to death. The court held that the causal chain had been broken, and that the Crown had failed to prove that the accused was responsible for the death.\n\nThe court in \"S v Tembani\", endorsed the approach of English law: If, at the time of death, the original wound is still an operating and substantial cause of death, the death is a result of the wound, even if another cause was also operating. Death is not the result of the original wound if it is just the setting in which another cause operates. Only if the second cause is so overwhelming as to make the original wound merely part of the history may it be said that death does not flow from the wound.\n\nIn \"S v Tembani\", it was held that the deliberate infliction of an intrinsically dangerous wound, from which the victim was likely to die without medical intervention, must generally lead to liability for an ensuing death, whether or not the wound was readily treatable, and even if the medical treatment given later was substandard or negligent—unless the victim had so recovered that at the time of the negligent treatment the original injury no longer posed a danger to his life.\n\nThere is one situation in which an intervening act or event that would ordinarily qualify as a \"novus actus interveniens\" will not be regarded as such. This occurs when the intervening act or event was actually planned, intended or foreseen by the accused, in the sense that it was a calculated part of the causal sequence. As some authorities put it, intended consequences can never (almost by definition) be “too remote” to found liability. The relevant principle has been explained by the Appellate Division, which ruled in \"\" that, where the act is a calculated part of the chain of causation which the perpetrator started, and is an eventuality which the perpetrator foresees as a possibility, and which he desires to employ to obtain his object, it would be contrary to accepted principles of law, and to all sense of justice, to allow him to take shelter behind the act as a \"novus actus interveniens\".\n\nIn \"S v Daniels\", X shot Y twice in the back with a firearm, whereupon Y fell to the ground. Still alive, he would nonetheless certainly have died unless he had received medical treatment within about half an hour. This was highly unlikely, since the incident had occurred on a lonely road in the countryside. X then threw the firearm to the ground near Y. Shortly thereafter Z appeared, picked up the firearm and killed Y with a shot through the ear.\n\nOf the five judges of appeal, two held that X and Z had acted with a common purpose, and that their joint purpose was therefore the cause of death. According, however, to the interpretation of the evidence by the other three judges, X and Z had acted independently. None of the judges doubted that Z's act was a cause of death. The question for the three judges to decide was whether, assuming independence, X's act also amounted to a cause of death.\n\nTwo of the three held that there was indeed causal link, and that policy considerations did not demand that Z's act qualify as a \"novus actus interveniens\", breaking the chain of causation between X's act and Y's death. This judgment is preferred by Snyman, since the two shots X fired into Y's back would in any event have caused his death, even had not Z also fired a shot into Y. Human experience showed that X's shots would have the tendency, in the ordinary course of events, to result in death.\n\nAlthough most authorities agree on the need for a second stage to the enquiry into causation, there is no unanimity as to exactly what it should entail. The courts have been reluctant to reduce the enquiry to a simple, mechanistic one. The courts have never, for example, adopted the sole-cause approach; nor have they attached much weight to such simplistic factors as proximity in terms of time and space.\n\nIn \"S v Mokgethi\", the Appellate Division (per Van Heerden JA) discussed the various approaches to legal causation, and held that it is wrong to identify only one of these theories as the correct one, to be applied in all cases, and in so doing to exclude from consideration the other theories of legal causation. All available theories could be used to assist in the main enquiry, which is simply whether or not there is “a sufficiently close nexus” between the accused’s initial conduct and the ensuing consequence, or whether the consequence is “too remote” for the purposes of founding criminal liability. One should apply a flexible criterion: The over-riding consideration is the demands of what is fair and just. In endeavouring to ascertain what is a fair and just conclusion, a court may take into consideration the different theories of legal causation referred to above and use them as guides in reaching a conclusion.\n\nThe problem with a flexible test, however, “is that it provides little guidance to a court, and so it does not help to create the reasonable certainty of outcome that we need in criminal law in order to satisfy the principle of legality.” This is why, for practical reasons, and despite the dictum in \"Mokgethi\", it will be found that the preponderance of South African case law still tends to favour the direct or proximate-cause approach.\n\nSnyman notes that, even once conduct and compliance with the definitional aspects of the crime have been established, there are still two more very important requirements for liability: first unlawfulness and then culpability.\n\nA finding of unlawfulness is based on the standard of objective reasonableness, which is based in turn on \"boni mores\" or the legal convictions of the community.\n\nThe following defences or grounds of justification, among others, will exclude unlawfulness:\n\n\nA person acts in private defence if he uses force to repel an unlawful attack by another upon his person or his property or another recognised legal interest. In these circumstances, any harm or damage inflicted upon the aggressor is not unlawful.\n\nThe following are the requirements relating to the attack. There must be\n\n\nIn \"R v K\", the court held that the assault need not be committed culpably. It is also possible to act in private defence against someone who lacks criminal capacity, such as a mentally disordered person.\n\nMost often one acts in private defence in protection of life or limb, but there is no reason in principle why one cannot act in private defence in protection of other interests, such as one's property, as well. The Appellate Division in \"S v Jackson\" held that a person is justified in killing in self-defence not only when he fears that his life is in danger but also when he fears grievous bodily harm. In \"R v Patel\", the court ruled that a person has the same right to use force in defence of another from a threatened danger as he would have to defend himself, if he were the person threatened.\n\nThe defence must be\n\n\nIn \"R v Zikalala\", where the accused stabbed and killed the deceased in a crowded beer hall, he claimed that the deceased had attacked him with a knife, and that he was acting in self-defence. He was convicted of murder; he appealed. The Appellate Division held,\n\nThe evidence is that the hall was packed and that movement therein was difficult. But the observation places a risk upon the appellant that he was not obliged to bear. He was not called upon to stake his life upon \"a reasonable chance to get away\". If he had done so he may well have figured as the deceased at the trial, instead of as the accused person. Moreover, one must not impute to a person who suddenly becomes the object of a murderous attack that mental calm and ability to reason out \"ex post facto\" ways of avoiding the assault without having recourse to violence.\n\nNo-one, then, is obliged to flee if flight does not offer a safe avenue of escape: for example, if it would merely expose one to a stab in the back. In such circumstances a person is entitled to stand his ground and defend himself. Zikalala’s conviction was overturned.\n\nThe test for private defence is an objective one. If X thinks that he is in danger, but in fact is not, or if he thinks that someone is unlawfully attacking him, but in fact the attack is lawful, his defensive measures do not constitute private defence.\n\nWhere an accused is charged with murder, the court held in \"S v Ntuli\", but he is convicted of culpable homicide for exceeding the bounds of reasonable self-defence, an assault will have been involved if it is found that the accused realised that he was applying more force than was necessary.\n\nAs to the means of defence being commensurate with the danger threatened, the court in \"Ntsomi v Minister of Law & Order\" found that it had to apply an objective test \"ex post facto\". Where a policeman is attacked during the performance of his duty, the criterion of a reasonable policeman, compelled to act in the same circumstances, should be applied. A policeman attempting to effect a lawful arrest is not obliged to flee from an unlawful assault: The victim of such an assault is entitled, if he has no reasonable alternative, to defend himself with whatever weapon he has at hand.\n\nIf the accused believes, erroneously but honestly, that his person or property is in danger, his conduct in defence of it is not private defence. His mistake, however, may remove the element of intention.\n\nThe accused in \"S v De Oliveira\", who lived in a secure and burglar-proofed house in a dangerous area, was awoken one afternoon by the presence of several men outside the house on his driveway. He picked up his pistol, opened window and fired six shots. Two of them hit the men, one killing and the other injuring. There was no indication that an attack on the house was imminent. The accused failed to testify; his defence of putative private defence failed. He was convicted of murder and of two counts of attempted murder.\n\nThis defence is available when a person uses force to defend an interest in property: for example,\n\n\nThe requirements for private defence of property are similar in many respects to those for private defence of persons, but there are certain differences. The following are conditions relating to the attack. There must be evidence that\n\n\nThe defence of property must be\n\n\nIn \"\", the Appellate Division held that the onus is on the State to rebut private defence of property, just as it carries the onus to rebut private defence of person.\n\nThe property should not be of negligible value. In \"S v Mogohlwane\", Mogohlwane had been robbed by the deceased, who had been armed with a tomahawk, of a bag containing his clothing, shoes and food. Mogohlwane then went to his home, nearby, fetched a knife and returned to recover his property. When Mogohlwane tried to take back his bag, the deceased resisted and again threatened him with the tomahawk. Mogohlwane then stabbed him with the knife, causing his death. Mogohlwane was charged with murder. The court held that, in determining whether or not the property is of trivial value, it could be taken into account that the accused (as was the case \"in casu\") might not be richly endowed with earthly possessions. What may be of little value to a wealthy person may be of great value to a poor person. Given Mogohlwane’s financial circumstances, the stolen items were of value to him. Mogohlwane was justified in his conduct, because his attempt to recover his property was close enough in time to the robbery to be part of the same chain of events. The State had not proved that there was a less dangerous and more effective means or method reasonably available to the accused to defend himself against the act of robbery, so it was decided that Mogohlwane had acted in private defence and therefore lawfully.\n\nA person acts out of necessity, and his act is therefore lawful, if he acts in protection of his own or of somebody else's life, bodily integrity, property or some other legally recognised interest, endangered by a threat of harm which has commenced or is imminent, and which cannot be averted in any other way—provided that the person is not legally compelled to endure the danger, and provided that the interest protected is not out of proportion to the interest necessarily infringed by the protective act. It is immaterial whether the threat of harm takes the form of compulsion or emanates from a non-human agency such as force of circumstance.\n\nPrivate defence and necessity are closely related: Both allow a person to protect interests of value to him, such as life, bodily integrity and property, against threatening danger. There are also differences between them:\n\n\nNecessity may arise either from compulsion or from inevitable evil.\n\nAn example of compulsion is where Craig orders Richman to commit a punishable act, such as setting ablaze Helena's motor car, and threatens to kill Richman if he fails to comply. Richman duly complies. The emergency here is the result of unlawful human conduct; the act (of arson) is directed at an innocent third person, namely Helena.\n\nIn the case of inevitable evil, the emergency situation is the result of non-human intervention, such as an act of nature (a flood, for example) or some other chance circumstance like a shipwreck. If a fire breaks out in Y's house, and X, in order to escape, has to break through a window, he may reply to a charge of malicious damage to property with a defence of necessity. If X's baby gets hold of a bottle of pills and swallows all of them, and X in rushing her to hospital exceeds the speed limit, he may also rely on necessity.\n\nIn \"S v Bailey\", the Appellate Division found that a person is guilty of a crime in respect of which intention is a requirement where it is proved that\n\n\nThe mere danger of losing one's job does not give one the right to act out of necessity, held the court in \"S v Canestra\". If one cannot exercise one's profession without contravening the law, one ought to find another profession.\n\nIn \"S v Mtewtwa\", the court held that, for the defence of necessity to be applicable, the threat or danger sought to be averted must still be in existence; it must not yet be over. If it were over, there would be nothing to avert.\n\nIt is a fundamental rule of South African law that one may not profit from one’s own wrongdoing. A person may not use his own prior negligence or misconduct to justify his later actions and escape liability. According to this rule, an accused would not be able to rely on the defence of necessity where he cause the threat or danger himself, through his own culpable conduct.\n\nIt is unclear, however, to what extent this rule holds good—at least when it is expressed in absolutist terms: “A qualified and more nuanced approach seems more appropriate.” Snyman’s view is that the rule only applies to cases in which the accused was actually aware that he was creating a risk of danger through his prior conduct, but persisted in that conduct anyway, but it does not apply to cases in which the accused, although negligent, was oblivious to the risk he was creating.\n\nAs the SCA decided, in \"S v Lungile\", “A person who voluntarily joins a criminal gang or group and participates in the execution of a criminal offence cannot successfully raise the defence of compulsion when, in the course of such execution, he is ordered by one of the members of the gang to do an act in furtherance of such execution.”\n\nIn \"S v Bradbury\", a member of a gang reluctantly played a lesser role in a murder due to fear of reprisals if he refused. The Appellate Division found that there was a need for a deterrent to this kind of gangsterism. The decision of the trial judge to impose the death sentence was therefore not so unreasonable as to warrant the appeal court's intervention. “As a general proposition,” wrote Holmes JA, “a man who voluntarily and deliberately becomes a member of a criminal gang with knowledge of its disciplinary code of vengeance cannot rely on compulsion as a defence or fear as an extenuation.”\n\nIn both Bradbury and Lungile, the accused was aware that he was creating a risk of danger through his prior conduct.\n\nThe course of action taken by the accused must have been necessary in order to avert the threatened harm or danger. This does not mean that there must literally have been no alternative, but merely that there was no other practical way of averting the threatened harm or danger. The test here is objective: whether or not, in light of all the circumstances, a reasonable person could be expected to resist the threat.\n\nThe Appellate Division in \"R v Mahomed\", which cites some of the old authorities on the subject, held that the accused’s actions, and the means used, must be a reasonable response to the threatened danger. This means\n\n\nIn \"S v Malan\", the accused (a farmer) had for many years suffered problems with stray animals causing damage to his land. Having exhausted all remedies, from impounding the animals to sending messages to their owner, to no avail, the accused shot and killed the animals when they yet again strayed on to his land. The court found that such conduct was not unreasonable in the circumstances; therefore, it was lawful.\n\nIn the delictual case of \"Peterson v Minister of Safety & Security\", the court cited Midgley and Van der Walt to the following effect:\n\nThe means used and measures taken to avert the danger of harm must not have been excessive, having regard to all the circumstances of the case.\n\nIn \"S v Pretorius\", in which Pretorius broke the speed limit in rushing to hospital a seriously ill person, the court held that the onus of proof in a defence of necessity rests on the State, which must rule out the reasonable possibility of an act of necessity. It is not for the accused to satisfy the court that he acted from necessity.\n\nIn \"S v Mtewtwa\", as we have seen, the court held that, where an accused's defence is one of compulsion, the onus lies on the State to show that a reasonable man would have resisted the compulsion. There is no onus on the accused to satisfy the court that he acted under compulsion.\n\nThe old authorities took the view that a person was never justified in killing an innocent person to save his own life. It was thought that a person should rather submit to death, although the threat to his own life might be regarded as a mitigating factor. This approach prevailed until relatively recent times, as is illustrated in the leading English criminal case of \"R v Dudley & Stephens\", which established a precedent, throughout the common-law world, that necessity is no defence to a charge of murder. It concerned survival cannibalism following a shipwreck and its purported justification on the basis of a custom of the sea. Dudley and Stephens were involved in a shipwreck and cast adrift in an open boat with two other persons: a man named Brooks and a cabin boy, seventeen years old, called Parker. After seventeen days at sea, eight of them without food and six without water, it became clear that they were unlikely to survive much longer. Dudley and Stephens agreed that Dudley should kill Parker, so that they could eat him, reasoning that he, being younger and weaker, would be the first to die anyway. Brooks did not agree to the plan. Dudley went ahead and killed Parker. All three of them ate his remains for the next four days. They were rescued on the fifth. Dudley and Stephens, on a charge of murder, raised the defence of necessity. The court rejected this defence and convicted them, holding that the law expects the average man to sacrifice his own life for that of an innocent victim.\n\nIn \"R v Werner\" and \"S v Bradbury\", the Appellate Division essentially followed the same approach as in R v Dudley and Stephens. In Werner, a murder had been committed by prisoners of war acting on the orders of a superior officer. The court held that the killing of an innocent person by compulsion is never legally justifiable. As for Bradbury, a member of a dangerous gang, he had reluctantly played a minor role in a planned murder, being influenced thereto by fear of reprisals of a serious nature on himself or his family should he refuse. The trial judge had imposed the death sentence on him. In an appeal against this sentence, the Appellate Division held that, weighing the influence of fear against the need for a deterrent to this kind of gangsterism, there was nothing so unreasonable in the trial judge's decision as to justify a finding that his discretion had not been judicially exercised.\n\nIn \"S v Goliath\", however, the court took a different view from that held in \"S v Bradbury\" and R v Dudley and Stephens. Goliath and another person (the first accused in the trial) came upon the deceased, and the first accused began to rob him. The first accused produced a knife and told Goliath to tie up the deceased. Goliath objected. The first accused said he would stab Goliath if he did not obey. Goliath then tied up the deceased. The first accused then stabbed the deceased to death. The first accused told Goliath to take off the deceased’s shoes and, when Goliath hesitated, again threatened to kill him. Goliath complied. They were both charged with murder, Goliath as an accomplice. The trial court convicted the first accused, but acquitted Goliath on the basis that he had acted under compulsion. The State, however, reserved certain questions of law for decision by the Appellate Division. The most pertinent of these was whether or not the defence of compulsion could ever constitute a defence to murder. In reply, the Appellate Division confirmed that Goliath had been rightly acquitted, that is, it accepted that necessity, in the form of compulsion, can be a complete defence to the killing of an innocent third person. It is not a defence that will be accepted lightly, however; it will depend on all the surrounding circumstances. The whole factual complex must be carefully examined and adjudicated upon with the greatest care. In Goliath’s case, the decisive factor was that the first accused had the means and the will to carry out his threat to kill Goliath there and then if Goliath did not comply with his demands. It also weighed heavily with the court that Goliath was neither the instigator nor the main perpetrator, merely a reluctant accomplice; nor did he profit in any way from the crime.\n\nThe defence of necessity on a murder charge was upheld in \"S v Peterson\", since the State had not proved that a fictional reasonable person in the position of the accused would have offered resistance to the compulsion, including a threat against his life, which had been exerted by a co-accused.\n\nThe maxim \"lex non cogit ad impossibilia\" may be translated to mean that the law does not compel anyone to do the impossible. Impossibility is the appropriate defence (excluding unlawfulness) in cases where the law places a person under a legal duty to perform a positive act, and the person is unable to comply with this duty. The policy rationale for this ground of justification is that it would be unfair to punish an individual who contravened the law under conditions where he could not act otherwise. In this regard, impossibility might be regarded as “the flip-side of necessity,” but the requirements of the two defences do not correspond exactly.\n\nThere must be a positive obligation imposed by law, which with it must be absolutely physically impossible to comply, not merely difficult or inconvenient. In \"R v Jetha\", the appellant had sailed for India on 11 October 1926; his estate was provisionally sequestrated on 13 October 1926. In March 1929, after his return, he was convicted of contravening section 142(a) of the Insolvency Act, in that he had failed to attend the first meeting of his creditors on 11 November 1926. The court, on appeal, held that, as the appellant had not and could not have known of the date of the meeting until after it was held, and as it would have been physically impossible for him to attend even if he had known the date, there was no ground for the conviction.\n\nThe impossibility must not be the fault of the accused. In \"R v Korsten\", an accused person took his cattle to be dipped in a township dip, but was prevented from dipping them by the township foreman, because he had not complied with a by-law which provided that no person should use the dipping tank except upon production of coupons, previously purchased, entitling him to do so. The accused's excuse for not having purchased such coupons was that he did not know that this was necessary. The court held that, inasmuch as the Animal Diseases Act imposed an absolute duty on the accused to dip his cattle, these facts afforded no defence.\n\nThe question here is whether or not an otherwise unlawful act may be justified by the fact that the accused was merely obeying the orders of a superior. The Romans phrased it thus: \"He is free from blame who is bound to obey.\"\n\nTo succeed in a defence of superior orders, it must be shown\n\n\nThese requirements are set out in \"S v Banda\", where the court held that the defence of obedience to superior orders was a form of the defence of compulsion, in that the subordinate was compelled to follow the orders of his superior officer. It is considered unjust, therefore, to hold a soldier criminally liable for merely following orders. The rationale for the defence is that military discipline requires immediate and unquestioning obedience to orders, backed up by stern punishment for disobedience.\n\nIn \"Queen v Albert\", the court held that a child under fourteen years of age, who assists his father in committing a crime, is presumed to do so in obedience to his father's orders, and is not punishable, even if he knew that he was performing a forbidden act—unless, in the case of a child above seven years of age, the crime is \"atrocious,\" or so \"heinous as obviously to absolve the person ordered to commit it from the duty of obedience.\"\n\nIn \"S v Banda\" (a treason trial held after the abortive military coup in Bophuthatswana), Friedman J drew a distinction between an unlawful and a manifestly unlawful order. Where orders are so manifestly and palpably unlawful that a reasonable man in the circumstances of the accused (a soldier \"in casu\") would know them to be so, the duty to obey is absent, and the accused will be liable for acts committed pursuant to such orders. If, therefore, a soldier obeys an order which is unlawful, but not “manifestly and palpably illegal,” he would still be able to rely on the defence of obedience to superior orders. If, however, a soldier is ordered to massacre civilians, or to rape and loot, he would not be able to rely on this defence, since conduct of this nature would be manifestly and palpably illegal.\n\nIn \"S v Mostert\", which dealt with the applicability of the defence to orders by traffic officers, the court held that the order must have emanated from someone lawfully placed in authority over the accused, and that the accused must have been under a duty to obey the given order; finally, the accused must have done no more harm than was necessary to carry out the order. If the accused exceeds the limits of an order, he may not claim that he was acting under the orders of a superior.\n\nWhen officers of the courts, or of the law or the State generally, and in certain circumstances even private persons, as duly authorised instruments of the State, commit crimes in the proper exercise of such authority (including acts of aggression upon life, person and property), they may be immune from punishment.\n\nThis defence is to be found in the Diplomatic Immunities and Privileges Act, which sets out the immunities and privileges of diplomatic missions and consular posts, and of the members of such missions and posts. Section 3 states that the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961 is applicable to diplomatic missions and to the members of such missions; the \"Vienna Convention on Consular Relations\" of 1961 is applicable to consular posts and the members of such posts.\n\nSection 4 provides that heads of state, special envoys or representatives from another state, or another government or organisation, are immune from the criminal and civil jurisdiction of the courts. They enjoy the privileges accorded them by customary international law, which extends their immunity also to their families, and to members of their staff and \"their\" families. The Minister must keep a register of all persons who are protected by such immunity.\n\nConsuls, be they career or honorary, are not diplomatic agents. Nonetheless, they are, according to international law, entitled to immunity from civil and criminal proceedings in respect of official acts.\n\nThe person officially authorised to execute either the civil or the criminal judgment of a court commits no crime in so doing. This exemption does not extend to cases in which the court has no jurisdiction. If officials of the court act beyond their jurisdiction, their actions are unlawful, but they may escape liability if they genuinely believe that they are acting lawfully. In \"S v Madihlaba\", it was held that the court-authority exemption will not apply to a situation in which a court had no jurisdiction.\n\nFor a crime in which negligence is sufficient for liability, and if the official's belief was not only genuinely held, but also reasonable, he will not be liable.\n\nThe fact that a person works as a court official may indicate that he ought to know the law relating to his sphere of activity, and is therefore negligent.\n\nThe test of intention is subjective, so the reasonableness or otherwise of the accused's belief is in principle irrelevant. If, however, that belief is patently unreasonable, especially because the accused's occupation requires him to know better, this could constitute a factor from which the court may reach the conclusion that an inference of knowledge of unlawfulness can be drawn.\n\nThe powers of public officers and private citizens to arrest, either with or without a warrant, are set out in the Criminal Procedure Act (CPA). Provided that arrestors act within the limits of these powers, they are not liable for any assault or other crime necessarily committed to effect, or to attempt to effect, the arrest.\n\nThe old section 49 of the CPA distinguished between\n\n\nNo common-law balance was required; there was no need to consider alternative means. Lethal force was permitted in respect of Schedule 1 offences.\n\nThe old section 49 has been amended by section 7 of the Judicial Matters Second Amendment Act, which came into force in 2003. An important case necessitated the change. In \"Govender v Minister of Safety & Security\", the SCA read down section 49(1), specifically the words \"use such force as may in the circumstances be reasonably necessary [...] to prevent the person concerned from fleeing,\" so as to exclude the use of a firearm or similar weapon, unless the person authorised to arrest a fleeing suspect, or to assist in arresting him, has reasonable grounds for believing\n\n\nWhen applying the reasonableness standard, the nature and degree of force used must be proportionate to the threat posed by the accused to the safety and security of police officers and others.\n\nIn \", the Constitutional Court accepted as constitutionally sound the interpretation of section 49(1)(b) in \"Govender\". This saved section 49(1) from invalidation.\n\nSection 49(2), however, authorised police officers in the performance of their duties to use force where it might not be necessary or reasonably proportionate. This, the court found, was socially undesirable and constitutionally impermissible. The court declared section 49(2) to be inconsistent with the Constitution and therefore invalid, since it infringed the rights to dignity, life and security of person.\n\nThe court went on to state the law relating to the arrest of a suspect:\n\n\nThe new section 49(2) reads as follows:\n\nIf any arrestor attempts to arrest a suspect and the suspect resists the attempt, or flees, or resists the attempt and flees, when it is clear that an attempt to arrest him or her is being made, and the suspect cannot be arrested without the use of force, the arrestor may, in order to effect the arrest, use such force as may be reasonably necessary and proportional in the circumstances to overcome the resistance or to prevent the suspect from fleeing.\n\nThis is a statutory articulation of the reasonable or proportional test. The subsection goes on to say that \"the arrestor is justified in terms of this section in using deadly force that is intended or is likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to a suspect, only if he believes, on reasonable grounds,\n\n\nThese limits are in addition to those discussed above.\n\n\nConsent is only a ground of justification in respect of some crimes. It is not a ground of justification in respect of\n\n\nIt \"is\" a ground of justification in respect of\n\n\nIt is sometimes a ground of justification in respect of assault.\n\nIn \"R v Peverett\", the accused and one \"S,\" at the latter's suggestion, decided to commit suicide by introducing into a closed motor car poisonous fumes from the exhaust pipe of the car. The accused made the necessary arrangements. He and \"S\" then sat in the car; the accused started the engine. They both lost consciousness but were later removed from the car and eventually recovered. The accused was convicted of attempted murder; his appeal was dismissed. The court held that the fact that \"S\" was free to breathe the poisonous gas or not, as she pleased, did not free the accused from criminal responsibility for his acts. The accused had contemplated and expected that, as a consequence of his acts, \"S\" would die; he therefore intended to kill her, however little he may have desired her death.\n\nIn determining legal liability for terminating a patient's life, in \"Clarke v Hurst\", the court held that there is no justification for drawing a distinction between\n\n\nJust as, in the case of an omission to institute life-sustaining procedures, legal liability would depend on whether there was a duty to institute them, so in the case of their discontinuance liability would depend on whether or not there was a duty not to discontinue such procedures once they have been instituted. A duty not to discontinue life-sustaining procedures cannot arise if the procedures instituted have proved to be unsuccessful. The maintenance of life in the form of certain biological functions, such as the heartbeat, respiration, digestion and blood circulation, but unaccompanied by any cortical and cerebral functioning of the brain, cannot be equated with “living” in the human or animal context. If the resuscitative measures were successful in restoring only these biological functions, they were in reality unsuccessful. Artificial measures, such as naso-gastric feeding, could consequently also be discontinued. It is appropriate in cases of this nature, and not in conflict with public policy, to make an evaluation of the quality of life remaining to the patient and to decide on that basis whether life-sustaining measures ought to be taken or continued.\n\nA participant in sport may validly consent only to those injuries which are normally to be expected in that particular sport. Voluntary participation in sport may also imply that the participant consents to injuries sustained as a result of acts which contravene the rules of the game—but only if such incidents are normally to be expected in that particular game.\n\nInjuries inflicted in the course of initiation or religious ceremonies may be justified by consent only if they are of a relatively minor nature and do not conflict with generally accepted concepts of morality.\n\nSexual assault may be committed with or without the use of force or the infliction of injuries. Consent may operate as a justification for the act if no injuries are inflicted. Where injuries are inflicted, it has been held that consent may not be pleaded as a defence. Snyman has averred, however, that in such cases it would \"seem to be more realistic\" to enquire into whether the act is \"contra bonos mores\" or not. If the injury is slight, it is conceivable that the law may recognise consent to the act as a defence.\n\nWhere consent is obtained by means of fraud or deception, it is not genuine consent. Fraud or deception may take the form\n\n\nHowever, not all forms of fraud or deception will necessarily vitiate consent. Essentially, fraud or deception will only vitiate consent if it is material in nature: in other words, if the complainant would not have consented at all if he had known the truth, or would only have consented on substantially different terms.\n\nIn the case of sexual acts, it has long been the accepted rule that consent will only be vitiated by a fraud or deception that induces either error in negotio or error in personae:\n\n\nTo consent to an otherwise unlawful act, the person consenting must have the ability to understand the nature of the act and to appreciate its consequences. This ability may be lacking due to\n\n\nIn \"Du Preez v Conradie\", the court held that a parent has the right and the power to chastise minor children. This includes the right to impose moderate and reasonable corporal punishment. A step-parent (to whom a divorced parent of the children is married) may exercise the same rights if requested to do so by the other parent, subject to the same limitations as on that parent. The parent and step-parent are not entitled to molest their children or to exceed the bounds of moderate and reasonable chastisement.\n\nSection 35(1) of the Interim Constitution provides expressly that the rights entrenched in it, including section 10—\"every person shall have the right to respect for and protection of his or her dignity\"—and section 11(2)—no \"person shall be subject to torture of any kind, whether physical, mental or emotional, nor shall any person be subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\"—shall be interpreted in accordance with the values which underlie an open and democratic society based on freedom and equality. In determining, then, whether punishment is cruel, inhuman or degrading within the meaning of the Constitution, the punishment in question must be assessed in the light of the values which underlie the Constitution. The simple message to be taken from this, according to the Constitutional Court, in \"S v Williams\", is that the State, in imposing punishment, must do so in accordance with certain standards; these will reflect the values which underpin the Constitution. In the present context, this means that punishment must respect human dignity and be consistent with the provisions of the Constitution. The caning of juveniles \"in casu\" was accordingly ruled unconstitutional.\n\nThe Abolition of Corporal Punishment Act abolished judicial corporal punishment. The South African Schools Act abolished corporal punishment in schools. In \"Christian Education v Minister of Education\", a private Christian organisation administered a private school and believed that, in terms of its Christian principles, the physical chastisement of children at school was lawful. The organisation applied for an order exempting the school from section 10 of the Schools Act, arguing that the constitutional right to religious freedom allowed it to be so exempted. The Constitutional Court held that the requested order could not be granted. Even if one assumed that section 10 infringed upon parents' right to religious freedom, such infringement was justified, since even private schools exercise their functions for the benefit of the public interest.\n\nThe requirements for the lawful parental chastisement of children are laid out \"R v Janke & Janke\". It must be\n\n\nRelevant considerations in adjudicating on the chastisement of children were laid out in \"Du Preez v Conradie\":\n\n\nThe test for determining criminal capacity is whether the accused had\n\n\nA defence in this area may relate to\n\n\nThe common-law position is that a minor\n\n\nIn \"R v K\", a charge of murder was brought against a child of thirteen. The presumption, which applies for adults, that he had intended the probable consequences of his actions was not here applicable. The State failed to prove that the child knew that his act (stabbing and thereby killing his mentally ill mother) was unlawful.\n\nIn \"Director of Public Prosecutions, KZN v P\", the respondent, a fourteen-year-old girl, had been convicted of the murder of her grandmother. The passing of sentence was postponed for a period of 36 months, on the condition that the respondent complied with the conditions of a sentence of 36 months' correctional supervision in terms of section 276(1)(h) of the Criminal Procedure Act. On appeal, the State argued that the sentence was too lenient, considering the gravity of the offence. It contended that, despite the young age of the respondent, direct imprisonment should have been imposed.\n\nThe test for interference by an appeal court is whether the sentence imposed by the trial court is vitiated by irregularity or misdirection or is disturbingly inappropriate. The strongest mitigating factor in favour of the respondent \"in casu\" was her youthfulness: She had been twelve years and five months old at the time of the offence. A second factor was that she had no previous conviction. The aggravating factors, however, were overwhelming. The postponement of the passing of sentence was therefore inappropriate in the circumstances, and caused a sense of shock and a feeling that justice was not done.\n\nThe Child Justice Act was assented to on May 7, 2009, and commenced on April 1, 2010. Among the purposes of the Act is\n\n\nPart 2 of the Act deals with the criminal capacity of children under the age of fourteen years.\n\nIn terms of section 7, dealing with the minimum age of criminal capacity,\n\n\nThe common law pertaining to the criminal capacity of children under the age of fourteen years was thereby amended.\n\nIn terms of section 11, dealing with proof of criminal capacity, the State must prove, beyond reasonable doubt, that a child who is ten years or older, but under the age of fourteen years, had the capacity\n\n\nSection 8 provides for review of the minimum age of criminal capacity:\n\nIn order to determine whether or not the minimum age of criminal capacity as set out in section 7(1) should be raised, the Cabinet member responsible for the administration of justice must, not later than five years after the commencement of this section, submit a report to Parliament.\n\nSection 9 deals with the manner of dealing with a child under the age of ten years.\n\nUntil 1977, the “defence of insanity” had its roots in English law, in particular the M’Naghten rules.\n\nThe CPA replaced these, however, with sections 77 to 79, which were implemented largely on the recommendation of the \"Rumpff Commission: Report of the Commission of Inquiry into the Responsibility of Mentally Deranged Persons & Related Matters\".\n\nThere are two questions to consider in respect of mental incapacity:\n\n\nThe meaning or definition of “mental illness” or “mental defect” is provided in \"S v Stellmacher\", discussed above. It is “a pathological disturbance of the accused’s mental capacity, not a mere temporary mental confusion which is [...] attributable to [...] external stimuli such as alcohol, drugs or provocation.”\n\nAn affliction or disturbance is pathological if it is the product of a disease.\n\nThe criterion in Stellmacher identifies as mental illnesses (as opposed to mental defects) only those disorders which are\n\n\nTo be endogenous is to be of internal origin.\n\nSection 78(1) of the CPA provides that a person whose act or omission constitutes an offence, and who suffers at the time from a mental illness or defect which makes him incapable\n\n\nwill not be criminally responsible for that act or omission.\n\nThe difference between the first contingency and the second is between the cognitive and the conative respectively:\n\n\n\"S v Mahlinza\" lays out the general principles relating to criminal capacity and mental illness. One night, the accused \"in casu\", a devoted mother, had taken off her clothing and placed it on a fire. She had then placed her baby and her six-year-old daughter on the fire, and stood at the door of the kitchen to prevent them from escaping. The baby was burnt to death; the six-year-old escaped with burns. The psychiatrist who examined the accused reported that she was laughing and was generally very rowdy, and could not give an account of herself or of her behaviour; she was disorientated and had no insight into her condition. The psychiatrist diagnosed a state of hysterical dissociation. She was charged with murder but found to be insane, and thus not guilty.\n\nRumpff JA (of the eponymous report) held in Mahlinza that, whenever the issue of the accused’s mental faculties is raised (be it in respect of the trial or in respect of her criminal capacity), an investigation into her mental faculties is of primary and decisive importance. Should the investigation show that she did not have criminal capacity, the necessity for an investigation as to fault in the technical sense, and as to the voluntariness with which the offence was committed, falls away. The decision in each case depends on the particular facts and the medical evidence. Rumpff warned that it is both impossible and dangerous to attempt to lay down any general symptoms by which a mental disorder may be recognised as a mental “disease” or “defect.”\n\nBurchell lays out a number of types of mental disorder:\n\n\nThe Interim Report of the Booysen Commission of Enquiry into the Continued Inclusion of Psychopathy as Certifiable Mental Illness and the Dealing with Psychopathic and Other Violent Offenders found that the “retention of psychopathy as a mental illness in the Mental Health Act is not only scientifically untenable, but it is also not effective in practice.”\n\nIn accordance with the recommendations of the Commission, section 286A of the CPA now provides for the declaration of certain persons as dangerous criminals, and section 286B for the imprisonment, for an indefinite period, of such persons.\n\nEven before the Booysen Commission, however, the courts were not prepared to accept psychopathy, in and of itself, as exempting an accused from criminal liability, or even as warranting a lesser sentence on account of diminished responsibility.\n\nIn \"S v Mnyanda\", the accused was convicted of murder. In an appeal, he argued that his psychopathy should have been regarded as a mental illness, and thus as a mitigating factor. The court found that the mere fact that an accused may be regarded as clinically a psychopath is not a basis on which he may be found to have diminished responsibility. Only when, in respect of a particular misdeed, it can be said that the psychopathic tendency was of such a degree as to diminish the capacity for self-control to such a point that, according to a moral judgment, he is less blameworthy, will the law recognise his diminished responsibility.\n\nOriginally, South Africa followed English law, using the “guilty but insane” formula, but in 1977 the verdict was changed to “not guilty by reason of mental illness or mental defect.” Section 78(8)(a) of the CPA allows an appeal against such a finding. Whether or not the verdict in insanity cases is tantamount to an acquittal, from which no appeal is allowed, and whether the State may appeal against a verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness or defect—these conundrums have not yet been answered by the courts.\n\nIn the past, if a court found an accused to be “not guilty but insane,” it had to “direct that the accused be detained in a mental hospital or prison pending the signification of the decision of a Judge in chambers.” These provisions were regarded as peremptory; there was no option but to commit the accused to an institution. It is not difficult to see how the inevitable committal to an institution of a person who was found to be insane at the time of the offence, but who subsequently recovered, could lead to “great injustice.”\n\nIn \"S v McBride\", the accused had been capable of appreciating the wrongfulness of his act, but he was unable, because of “an endogenous depression” resulting in “impaired judgment,” to act in accordance with that appreciation. The court held that he was not criminally responsible for the killing. Although the accused had since recovered from his illness, to the extent of obtaining employment and “performing a function as a useful member of society,” the court considered itself bound to order his detention in a mental hospital.\n\nIn Burchell’s words, then, “we have the curious contradiction that a sane person is detained in a mental institution (or a prison) because he committed a crime for which, in law, he is not responsible and has accordingly been found ‘not guilty.’”\n\nThe South African Law Commission, recognising this injustice, proposed that such a person be committed to an institution only if he has not recovered or continues to pose a danger to himself or to society. The legislature addressed the issue with the Criminal Matters Amendment Act, giving the court a discretion, if “it considers it to be necessary in the public interest,” in cases involving serious crimes, to order either detention in an institution, or release, conditional or unconditional.\n\nSections 46 to 48 of the Mental Health Care Act provide for periodic review of the mental-health status of State patients, application for their discharge and various provisions governing conditional discharge.\n\nThe range of orders that a judge may issue are set out in section 47(6):\n\n\nSouth African law has adopted English law on the onus of proof in these matters: “Every man is presumed to be sane, and to possess a sufficient degree of reason to be responsible for his crimes, until the contrary be proved.” Section 78(1A) of the CPA reiterates that every person is presumed not to suffer from a mental illness or mental defect so as not to be criminally responsible in terms of section 78(1), until the contrary is proved on a balance of probabilities.\n\nIn terms of section 78(1B), whenever the criminal responsibility of an accused is in issue, with reference to a commission or omission which constitutes an offence, the burden of proof will be on the party who raises the issue.\n\nAlmost always, therefore, it will be on the accused.\n\nIn \"S v Kalogoropoulos\", the court held that an accused person who relies on non-pathological causes in support of a defence of criminal incapacity is required in evidence to lay a factual foundation for it, sufficient at least to create a reasonable doubt on that point. It is, ultimately, for the court to decide the issue of the accused’s criminal responsibility for his actions, having regard to the expert evidence and to all the facts of the case, including the nature of the accused’s actions during the relevant period.\n\nSection 78(7) of the CPA provides that, if the court finds that the accused, at the time of the commission of the offence, was criminally responsible, but that his capacity to appreciate the wrongfulness of the act, or to act in accordance with an appreciation of that wrongfulness, was diminished by reason of mental illness or mental defect, the court may take that fact into account when sentencing him.\n\nThe accused acted with diminished responsibility in \"S v Mnisi\". On seeing his wife in an adulterous embrace with the deceased, the accused had lost control of his inhibitions and shot him. On appeal, the SCA held that the trial court had not accorded sufficient weight to the accused’s diminished criminal responsibility. The fact that he had acted with \"dolus indirectus\" had also not been taken into account. Deterrence was of lesser importance in this case, the SCA held, because the evidence did not suggest that the accused had a propensity for violence; he was unlikely to commit such an offence again. In view of the accused’s diminished criminal responsibility, general deterrence was also of lesser importance. His sentence of eight years’ imprisonment was reduced to five.\n\nNon-pathological criminal incapacity must be distinguished from mental illness. A person may suffer from mental illness, and nevertheless be able to appreciate the wrongfulness of certain conduct, and to act in accordance with that appreciation.\n\nIntoxication may affect\n\n\nThere are four types of intoxication:\n\n\nIn \"R v Bourke\", the accused was charged with rape; he was acquitted as a result of intoxication. The court noted three broad propositions in Roman-Dutch law:\n\n\nThe court held that absolute drunkenness is not equivalent to insanity. The essential difference is that the drunk person, as a rule, voluntarily induces his condition, whereas the mentally ill person is the victim of a disease: “It is therefore not unreasonable to consider that the person who voluntarily becomes drunk is responsible for all such acts as flow from his having taken an excess of liquor.”\n\n“To allow drunkenness to be pleaded as an excuse,” wrote Wessels J, “would lead to a state of affairs repulsive to the community. It would follow that the regular drunkard would be more immune from punishment than the sober man.”\n\nIn \"S v Johnson\", the leading decision on intoxication prior to \"S v Chretien\", an accused was found guilty of culpable homicide despite the fact that the court accepted the psychiatric evidence that the accused was so drunk that he did not know what he was doing at the time of the offence. This case therefore reaffirmed the principle in \"Bourke\" that voluntary drunkenness is no excuse.\n\nIn \"Chetrien\", the Appellate Division reconsidered \"Bourke\" and \"Johnson\", and eradicated the traditional approach to voluntary intoxication. It firmly adopted a course based on legal principle. The facts were these: While under the influence of alcohol, Chetrien had driven his car into a crowd of people standing in the street. One was killed; five were injured. On charges of murder and attempted murder, the trial court found the accused guilty of culpable homicide, but acquitted him of attempted murder.\n\nThe issue on appeal was whether, on the facts, the trial judge, Friedman J, had been correct in law to hold that the accused, on a charge of attempted murder, could not be convicted of common assault where the necessary intention for the offence had been influenced by the voluntary consumption of liquor. Friedman J had accepted that, in his drunken state, the accused had expected that the people would move out of his way. There was some doubt, therefore, as to whether he had the requisite intention for common assault. Friedman J found that he was bound by \"Johnson\". By confining that decision to the issue of culpable homicide, however, and by categorising common assault as a crime requiring “specific intent,” he was able to avoid the effect of \"Johnson\" in respect of non-specific-intent crimes. Friedman J thus brought to issue the question of whether, subjectively, the accused had the requisite intention for common assault of the five injured persons.\n\nThe State’s argument was that the trial court should have applied \"Johnson\" and found the accused guilty of common assault, even if he lacked \"mens rea\" on account of his intoxication. The majority of the Appellate Division concluded that even common assault requires intention to assault. If this intention is lacking due to voluntary intoxication, there can be no conviction. It was found that Chetrien had had no such intention. Rumpff CJ held that the rule in \"Johnson\" was juridically impure, and that voluntary intoxication could be a complete defence to criminal liability. Rumpff stressed the importance of the degree of the accused’s intoxication:\n\n\nThe latter would have no defence; the former would be acquitted if he was so drunk that his conduct was involuntary, making him unable to distinguish right from wrong, or unable to act in accordance with that appreciation.\n\nVoluntary intoxication was thus removed from the direct influence of policy considerations, and placed firmly on the basis of legal principle. The result is that it can now affect criminal liability in the same way, and to the same extent, as youth, insanity, involuntary intoxication and provocation. Intoxication of a sufficient degree, therefore, can serve to exclude the voluntariness of conduct, criminal capacity or intention.\n\n“While \"Chetrien\" cannot be faulted on grounds of logic or conformity with general principles,” writes Burchell, “the judgment might well have miscalculated the community’s attitude to intoxication. Should a person who commits a prohibited act while extremely intoxicated escape all criminal liability?” In 1982, the Minister of Justice requested the Law Commission to consider the matter. In January 1986, after receiving extensive comment on a working paper, the Commission published a report and a draft Bill. Eventually the Criminal Law Amendment Bill was tabled in Parliament. After its passage, it came into operation on March 4, 1988. The Act contains two short sections, the first of which provides that\n\nany person who consumes or uses any substance which impairs his or her faculties to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her acts or to act in accordance with that appreciation, while knowing that such substance has that effect, and who [...] thus impaired commits any act prohibited by law [...], but is not criminally liable because his or her faculties were impaired [...], shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to the penalty [...] which may be imposed in respect of the commission of that act.\n\nThe elements of the offence of contravening the Act are as follows:\n\n\nThere are two main components:\n\n\nIn \"S v Vika\", the appellant was convicted in a regional court on two counts of contravening this section. The prohibited acts were murder and attempted murder. Regarding the appropriate punishment, the magistrate applied the provision that such a contravention could attract the same penalty as that which might be imposed for the unlawful act itself. He found that no substantial and compelling circumstances existed to justify a sentence of less than the fifteen years’ imprisonment stipulated in section 51(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act.\n\nWhen the appellant appealed against the sentence, arguing that it was startlingly inappropriate, the High Court held that the magistrate seemed not to have appreciated the difference between the offences of which the appellant had been convicted, and the offences of murder and attempted murder. These amounted to misdirections, and entitled the court to interfere with the sentence. The appeal was thus upheld, the sentence of fifteen years’ imprisonment set aside and a sentence of seven years’ and four years’ imprisonment, running concurrently, imposed.\n\nIt is important to remember, therefore, that to be convicted of an offence in terms of section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act is to be convicted of a unique statutory offence, described in detail above, and not of the ordinary common-law offence.\n\nSection 1(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act provides that, if in any prosecution of any offence it is found that the accused is not criminally liable, on account of the fact that his faculties were impaired by the consumption or use of any substance, he “may be found guilty of a contravention of subsection (1), if the evidence proves the commission of such contravention.” This subsection provides, in essence, that a contravention of section 1(1) will be regarded as a competent verdict on a charge of another offence.\n\nSection 2 of the Act provides that, whenever it is proved that the faculties of a person were impaired by the consumption or use of a substance when he committed an offence, the court may, in determining an appropriate sentence, regard as an aggravating circumstance the fact that his faculties were so impaired. The Law Commission was not in favour of this provision. As Burchell points out, “a court always has a discretion to impose an appropriate punishment and intoxication can be taken into account either as a mitigating or as an aggravating circumstance.” The section does indicate, with the word “may,” that the court retains its discretion, but Burchell thinks this superfluous.\n\nSection 1(1) does not specify voluntary consumption. The Bill drafted by the Law Commission did, however, and therefore would have protected from a liability a person who has his drink “spiked” by another. Under the Act, such a person would escape liability on the basis that he did not know that the substance he was drinking would have the effect it did. The Law Commission’s Bill, however, has “the advantage of also clearly leading to the acquittal of a person who was forced to drink an alcoholic or other concoction, which he knew would have the effect of impairing his faculties, but who had no control over his actions.” Burchell suggests that the courts “interpret the words ‘consumes or uses’ as implying conduct directed by the consumer’s or user’s will and therefore importing voluntary intoxication”.\n\nAnother problem is that the Act refers only to a lack of criminal capacity. What about involuntary conduct and intention? “The wording of the draft bill prepared by the Law Commission,” writes Burchell, “is surely preferable,” since it refers simply to an impairment of “mental faculties,” without any restriction as to the consequence of this impairment. Chetrien had criminal capacity, but he was acquitted on the ground that there was reasonable doubt as to whether he possessed the requisite intention to commit the crimes wherewith he was charged. He would also escape liability under the Act, because his intoxication did not lead to lack of criminal capacity, but rather to lack of \"mens rea\".\n\nThere is, finally, a problem in respect of onus. According to general principles, the burden of proving the presence of all the elements of the crime, beyond reasonable doubt, rests on the State. One of the elements that the State must prove beyond reasonable doubt, for a contravention of section 1(1), is that the accused is not criminally liable for his act, committed while intoxicated, “because his faculties were impaired,” or better say because he lacked capacity at the time he committed the act. “This,” as Snyman points out, “leads to the unusual situation that, in order to secure a conviction of contravening this section, the state must do that which X [the accused] normally does at a trial, namely try and persuade the court that X is not guilty of a crime. The state thus bears the burden of proving the opposite of what it normally has to prove.”\n\nThe problem in practical terms, Snyman observes, is that “it is difficult for the state to prove beyond reasonable doubt that because of incapacity resulting from intoxication, X cannot be held criminally liable for his act.” The courts have warned on multiple occasions that they will not easily conclude that the accused lacked capacity.\n\nThe difficulty arises when the two offences are used in the alternative. Snyman posits the following:\n\nIf X is charged with assault and the evidence shows that he was only slightly drunk at the time of the act, he will not escape the clutches of the criminal law, because he will then be convicted of assault and the only role the intoxication will play will be to serve as a ground for the mitigation of punishment. If the evidence shows that at the time of the act he was very drunk [...], so drunk that he lacked capacity, he would likewise not escape the clutches of criminal law, because he would then be convicted of contravening this section. However, if the evidence reveals that at the time of the act he happened to fall into the grey area between ‘slightly drunk’ and very drunk’, he will completely escape the clutches of criminal law; he will then ‘fall’ between the proverbial ‘two chairs’ and it would then be impossible to convict him of any crime. In this way the section could undoubtedly lose much of its effectiveness.\n\nIn \"S v Mbele\", the accused was charged with theft in a magistrate's court. He contended that he had been under the influence of alcohol at the time of the offence; the State witness testified to the effect that he was “not quite all there.” The magistrate could not find on the evidence that the accused had the necessary criminal responsibility, and gave him the benefit of the doubt that his version could possibly be true. Since he was “not criminally liable” for the crime, the magistrate found him guilty of a contravention of section 1(1) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act. On review, the Witwatersrand Local Division held that, for a contravention of section 1(1), the State was required to prove that the accused’s faculties were impaired at the time he performed the act, and that, as a result, he was not criminally liable. It was insufficient, therefore, for the State to take matters only so far as uncertainty as to whether his faculties were impaired to the necessary degree. The court found that the State had not proven impairment of the accused's faculties. He could not be convicted, therefore, of the offence of contravening section 1(1). The conviction and sentence were accordingly set aside.\n\nIn \"S v September\", the appellant stood trial in a Provincial Division on charges of murder, assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, theft and malicious injury to property. The trial court found\n\n\nOn appeal, the appellant argued that the evidence was indeed of such a nature as to cast doubt on his criminal capacity, and that the trial court had correctly found that he could not be convicted of the charges laid against him. It was, however, further argued that positive proof was absent of a lack of criminal capacity, and that the appellant ought accordingly not to have been convicted on section 1(1). The court stressed the fact that it was the task of the trial court, in every case, to decide whether the accused indeed lacked the requisite criminal capacity. Three psychiatrists had testified as to the appellant's alleged state of intoxication. They differed widely in their opinions. The trial court had accepted, without furnishing reasons for so doing, the evidence of the psychiatrist whose opinion it was that the appellant had lacked criminal capacity. This indicated that the trial court had not examined the question of the appellant's criminal capacity to the requisite extent. The evidence as a whole, therefore, had to be assessed anew. After reassessing the evidence, the court found that no reasonable doubt had been cast on the appellant's criminal capacity. The evidence was furthermore sufficient to lead to the conclusion that the appellant, beyond reasonable doubt, was guilty of contravening the original counts. The court therefore set aside the convictions on section 1(1), and substituted convictions on the original charges.\n\nProvocation may be a complete defence in South African law, and may exclude:\n\n\nRoman and Roman-Dutch law did not regard anger, jealousy or other emotions as defences for any criminal conduct; they were only factors in mitigation of sentence, and even then only if they could be justified by provocation.\n\nSection 141 of the Transkei Penal Code of 1886 influenced the adoption by the courts of the view that provocation could never be a never be a complete defence to a charge of murder; at most it could be a partial defence. The Code provided that killing which would otherwise have constituted murder could be reduced to culpable homicide if the person responsible acted in the heat of the moment, as a result of passion occasioned by sudden provocation. The decision to reduce a charge of murder to one of culpable homicide depended on an application of the criterion of the ordinary person’s power of self-control; the test was objective, in other words.\n\n\"S v Mokonto\" saw a change from the objective to a subjective test. The accused believed that the death of his two brothers had been brought about by the evil powers of a witch. When he confronted her, she declared that he would not “see the setting of the sun today,” whereupon he struck her with a cane-knife, almost cutting off her head. He was convicted of murder. On appeal, Holmes JA held that he had been provoked to anger by the deceased’s threat, and that, therefore, the appropriate verdict should be one of culpable homicide. Holmes considered section 141 of the Transkeian Code, with its provision that \"homicide which would otherwise be murder may be reduced to culpable homicide, if the person who causes death does so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.\" The Code continues,\n\nAny wrongful act of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive any ordinary person of the power of self-control may be provocation, if the offender acts upon it on the sudden, and before there has been time for his passion to cool.\n\nThis did not correlate, Holmes found, with the Roman-Dutch notion that provocation is not a defence. Holmes held that the objective “reasonable person” criterion is not in harmony with modern subjective judicial thinking. It is judicially recognised that intention to kill is purely a subjective matter. Since the test of criminal intention was now subjective, and since earlier cases of provocation applied a degree of objectivity, it might be necessary, he thought, to consider afresh the whole question of provocation. On the other hand, he noted, the facts of a particular case might show that the provocation, far from negativing an intention to kill, had actually caused it. The crime would then be murder, not culpable homicide.\n\nThe test for intention being subjective, it seemed to Holmes that provocation, which bears upon intention, must also be judged subjectively. In crimes of which specific intention is an element, therefore, the question of the existence of such intention is a subjective one: What was going on in the mind of the accused? Provocation, Holmes held, is relevant to the question of the existence of such intention. Subjectively considered, it is also relevant to mitigation.\n\n\"S v Laubscher\" dealt with the defence of temporary non-pathological criminal incapacity. Laubscher, a medical student, shot and killed his father-in-law, and attempted also to shoot his mother-in-law and his estranged wife one day at his in-laws’ home. He was charged with and convicted of murder and attempted murder. His defence was that he had acted involuntarily, since he had lacked criminal capacity at the time of the commission. This was due to a total but temporary “psychological breakdown,” or temporary “disintegration of his personality.” In order to address the issue of the appellant’s mental faculties at the time of the crime, the court had to look at the role of the defence in South African law. To be criminally liable, a perpetrator must, at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, have criminal liability. The doctrine of criminal capacity is an independent subdivision of the concept of \"mens rea\". Therefore, to be criminally liable, a perpetrator’s mental faculties must be such that he is legally to blame for his conduct.\n\nThe court set out the two psychological characteristics of criminal capacity:\n\n\nIn the present case, the defence was one of non-pathological incapacity. Where a defence of non-pathological incapacity succeeds, the accused is not criminally liable; he may not be convicted of the alleged offence. He must be acquitted. Because he does not suffer from a mental illness, or from a defect of a pathological nature, he may not be declared a State patient either.\n\nLaubscher had experienced a considerable amount of stress in the period leading up to the incident. He was an emotionally sensitive 23-year-old with the intelligence of a genius. He and his wife had married young, when she was pregnant, and had struggled financially; he was still a student. Her parents had contributed R80 per month toward their rent, and had taken every opportunity thus afforded them to meddle in the couple's affairs. Laubscher and his parents-in-law did not get along; he feared his father-in-law. Nor did things improve when the baby was born.\n\nThe parents took his wife to their farm and made arrangements, without the appellant’s consent, to christen the baby. The wife did not return to the appellant afterwards—nor did the baby—and, upon reaching majority, began to institute divorce proceedings. One weekend, the appellant made arrangements with his wife to go away to his parents’ home for the weekend with the child, and to some spend time together. She agreed. When he arrived at the farm to pick them up, however, she had apparently changed her mind, so he made arrangements to see his family the following week.\n\nThe appellant travelled with a loaded gun, since he was driving alone. He arrived at the farm to be told, again, that he would not be leaving with his wife and child. He went to a hotel, checked in, misspelled his name and other words on the necessary forms, and did not have dinner, although he did have a rum and coke. He went back his in-laws' house and demanded to see his child. His mother-in-law told him he could not. The appellant could recollect nothing after this point. He was woken up the following morning in hospital, with no recollection of what he had done.\n\nThe appeal court agreed with the convictions on the first four counts. The defence of involuntary conduct (owing to psychological breakdown or disintegration of personality) had to fail, because Laubscher’s behaviour, according to his own version of events, did not support such a finding. His actions were goal-directed and purposeful—before, during and after the shooting. Altogether he had fired some 21 shots into various rooms of the house, requiring him to reload his gun at least twice. He had also managed to drive away from the house immediately afterwards, in an attempt to escape. This was not consistent with automatic behaviour. The trial court’s conviction was accordingly upheld. It was in \"Laubscher\" that the court first adopted the term “temporary non-pathological criminal incapacity,” using it to distinguish between lack of criminal capacity due to mental illness or defect, and lack of criminal capacity due to other factors, such as intoxication, provocation and severe emotional stress.\n\nAs to the fifth count (attempted murder), the court held that the State had not proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Laubscher had the necessary intention, in the form of \"dolus eventualis\", to kill his child—especially in view of the fact that the whole object of his visit to the farm that evening had been to collect his child. As regards sentence, the court held that the appellant had without doubt been suffering from severe stress, and so his sentence was mitigated.\n\nThe defence of psychogenic sane automatism was first raised successfully in the Cape Provincial Division, in \"S v Arnold\", where Arnold had shot and killed his wife, Tina, one day at their home. At his trial for murder, it emerged that, like Laubscher, he had been under severe emotional stress at the time of the incident. Apart from long-standing financial and marital problems, he was deeply distressed at parting from his disabled son, whom he had just delivered to a children’s home. He had placed the boy there at Tina’s insistence. Having taken a gun with him for protection, he returned home and went into the living room to put it away. Tina was in the living room; an argument broke out between them. At one point, Arnold banged his gun on the back of the sofa. It went off accidentally, but no-one was harmed. Tina informed Arnold that she wished to resume her former occupation as a stripper, and bared her breasts to him. At this, he fired upon and killed her. He claimed later that he had no recollection of aiming and pulling the trigger. The psychiatrist who gave evidence for the defence testified that, at the time of the shooting, Arnold’s “conscious mind was so ‘flooded’ by emotions that it interfered with his capacity to appreciate what was right or wrong and, because of his emotional state, he may have lost the capacity to exercise control over his actions.” The court, however, identified the legal issues in dispute as follows:\n\n\nIn answer to these questions, the court held that it was not satisfied that the State had passed the first hurdle: It had failed to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Arnold’s conduct was voluntary. Even if it had, though, the court was not satisfied that the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Arnold had criminal capacity at the relevant time. He was therefore acquitted.\n\nAfter \"Arnold\", there were a number of murder trials in which the accused claimed that he, too, had acted involuntarily or had lacked criminal capacity as a result of severe emotional stress, coupled with provocation. Although the defence enjoyed a measure of temporary success in the then-Supreme Court, there has thus far been only one case in which it has succeeded in the Appellate Division or in the Supreme Court of Appeal: that of \"S v Wiid\". The accused was also acquitted in the lower court in \"S v Nursingh\" and \"S v Moses\".\n\n\"S v Campher\", together with \"Wiid\", makes it clear that provocation may exclude not only the accused’s intention to murder, but in certain extreme cases also his criminal capacity. In \"S v Potgieter\", the Appellate Division cautioned that, if the accused’s version of events is unreliable, the psychiatric or psychological evidence adduced in favour of the defence of non-pathological incapacity (inevitably based on the accused’s version of events) would also be of doubtful validity.\n\nFor a long time it was unclear that the defence of temporary non-pathological criminal incapacity was at all different from the defence of sane automatism, and (if so) what the difference was. This question was finally resolved by the SCA in \"S v Eadie\". Eadie had battered a fellow motorist to death with a broken hockey stick in a fit of purported road rage. He had been drinking heavily. He raised the defence of temporary non-pathological criminal incapacity, but this defence was rejected. On conviction, he appealed to the SCA. In a judgment “long and very thorough,” Navsa JA comprehensively reviewed the jurisprudence on provocation and emotional stress, and the historical development of the defences of temporary non-pathological criminal incapacity and sane automatism. He concluded that they are one and the same thing. He went on to hold that a normal person can only lack self-control, and hence criminal capacity, if he is acting in a state of automatism. He also indicated that, although the test of capacity might still remain, in principle, essentially subjective, the application of this test is to be approached with caution. The courts must not too readily accept the ipse dixit of the accused regarding provocation or emotional stress. A court is entitled to draw a legitimate inference from what “hundreds of thousands” of other people would have done under the same circumstances: that is, by looking at the objective circumstances. Drawing such an inference could result in the court’s disbelieving an accused who says simply, without adducing any further evidence, that he lacked capacity or acted involuntarily under provocation or emotional stress.\n\n\"Eadie\" thus affirmed the High Court’s finding that the accused could not successfully raise the defence of non-pathological incapacity on the facts. Both the High Court and the Supreme Court of Appeal drew a pragmatic distinction between loss of control and loss of temper. \"Eadie\"\n\nsignals a warning that in future the defence of non-pathological incapacity will be scrutinised most carefully. Persons who may in the past have been acquitted in circumstances where they had killed someone who had insulted them will find that courts will scrupulously evaluate their ipse dixit in the context of objective standards of acceptable behaviour.\n\nOn this interpretation of \"Eadie\", capacity remains subjectively tested in principle, but the practical implementation of the test must accommodate the reality that the policy of the law, with regard to provoked killings, “must be one of reasonable restraint.” It may, writes Burchell,\n\nbe difficult for the courts in future not to blur the subtle distinction between, on the one hand, drawing legitimate inferences of individual subjective capacity from objective, general patterns of behaviour, and, on the other hand, judicially converting the current subjective criterion for judging capacity into an objective one.\n\nIt is possible to place a more radical interpretation on the judgment of Navsa JA in \"Eadie\"—not just as emphasising the court’s ability to draw legitimate inferences as to capacity from objective circumstances, but as going further and explicitly requiring the defence of provocation to result in automatism and changing the essence of the test from a subjective to an objective inquiry.\n\n“However,” writes Burchell,\n\nthe court would neither simply have overturned, by implication, a considerable body of judicial precedent on the nature of capacity nor would it have reached a sweeping conclusion that could possibly alter other aspects of the law where the test of capacity is in issue, without full argument on these issues. Rather than suggesting that the Court replaced the subjective inquiry into capacity with an objective evaluation it is possible to suggest an interpretation of the \"Eadie\" case that involves a middle course: Capacity should be both subjectively and objectively assessed.\n\nIn the subsequent case of \"S v Marx\", the court held that the binding effect of \"Eadie\" was to conflate sane automatism and non-pathological incapacity, “because a person who is deprived of self-control is both incapable of a voluntary act and at the same time lacks criminal capacity.”\n\nShannon Hoctor has bemoaned \"Eadie\"’s “potentially ruinous effect on the concept of non-pathological incapacity,” and hopes that the judgment will be ignored by the courts, becoming “a derelict on the waters of the law,” although he concedes that this is unlikely “in the light of courts such as the Eastern Cape High Court in \"Marx\" increasingly giving effect to the inevitable doctrinal aftermath [... M]ere passivity will not be enough. Strong judicial action is required.”\n\nFault is an element of every crime. It may take one of two forms:\n• intention (dolus); or\n• negligence (culpa).\nAll common-law crimes require intention (except for culpable homicide and contempt of court committed by an editor of a newspaper for which negligence is sufficient). Statutory crimes require either intention or negligence.\nFault refers to the legal blameworthiness of the reprehensible state of mind or careless conduct of a criminally accountable person who has acted unlawfully.\nIt is a firmly established principle of criminal justice that there can be no liability without fault, a principle generally expressed in the maxim actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea (the act is not wrongful unless the mind is guilty).\nIn other words, the general rule is that, in order for an accused to be held liable, in addition to unlawful conduct (or actus reus) and capacity, there must be fault (or mens rea) on the part of the accused.\nThe requirement of fault as an element of liability means, among other things, that fault must exist in respect of each and every element of the crime with which the accused has been charged. This is so whether fault is in the form of intention or of negligence. The only exception to the rule is where the Legislature expressly provides that fault need not exist in respect of each element of a crime but, even in this eventuality, there is a presumption of statutory interpretation that the Legislature intended some form of fault to be required.\nMurder, by way of illustration, is the unlawful, intentional killing of a human being. In terms of the rule, a person who kills another will be guilty only if he knows or at least foresees the possibility that what he has done is unlawfully to kill a human being. Fault must exist in respect of each of the elements of the crime; if it is absent for any one of them (as where the killer believes he is acting lawfully, or does not know or foresee that death will be the consequence of his conduct, or does not know or foresee that what he is killing is a human being), there can be no fault.\nThe accused must know, therefore,\n• that he may be acting unlawfully;\n• that his actions may bring about a death; and\n• that it is a human being he is killing.\n\nIntention, as a form of fault, has three principal elements:\n\n\nIntention generally takes one of three forms:\n\n\nThese three forms of intention may be general (\"indeterminatus\").\n\n\"Dolus directus\", or direct intention, is intention in its ordinary grammatical sense: The accused meant to perpetrate the prohibited conduct, or to bring about the criminal consequence. This type of intention will be present where the accused’s aim and object was to perpetrate the unlawful conduct or to cause the consequence, even though the chance of its resulting was small.\n\n\"Dolus indirectus\", or indirect intention, exists where, although the unlawful conduct or consequence was not the accused’s aim and object, he foresaw the unlawful conduct or consequence as certain, “substantially certain,” or “virtually certain.”\n\nFor instance, the accused in \"R v Kewelram\" set fire to certain stock in a store. His objective was the destruction of the stock (\"dolus directus\") in order to obtain the insurance money, but he foresaw the destruction of the store as a substantially certain, or inevitable, consequence of the burning of the stock (\"dolus indirectus\").\n\n\"Dolus eventualis\" exists where the accused does not \"mean\" to bring about the unlawful circumstance, or cause the unlawful consequence which follows from his conduct, but \"foresees\" the possibility of the circumstance’s existence or the consequence’s ensuing, and nonetheless proceeds with his conduct. In brief, the accused directs his will towards an event or result, but foresees that, in so doing, he may cause another event to ensue. Nevertheless he proceeds with his conduct. Intention in this sense is sometimes called “legal intention.”\n\nThe facts of \"R v Jolly\" provide a clear illustration of the meaning of \"dolus eventualis\". The appellants had unlawfully and deliberately derailed a train. No-one was seriously injured. The appellants argued that there was no desire to injure anyone; they had chosen a spot where the train was moving slowly up a rising gradient with banks on either side of the line. Innes CJ held, despite this, that they had intended to kill:\n\nNow the derailment of a train, even upon a slightly rising grade, must be attended by terrible possibilities of danger to those travelling upon it. Jolly recognised this, for he said in his evidence that he contemplated risk of life. But he and his associates were content to cause that risk in the interests of their larger design.\n\nOn Snyman’s definition, there are two requirements for existence of \"dolus eventualis\":\n\n\nThe first may be described as the cognitive part of the test; the second is the conative or volitional part.\n\nThe first requirement deals with what the accused conceives to be the circumstances or possible consequences of his actions. There cannot be \"dolus eventualis\" if he does \"not\" envisage those circumstances or consequences. \"Dolus eventualis\" differs from \"dolus indirectus\" in that the accused foresees the prohibited result not as one which \"necessarily\" will flow from his act, but only as a possibility.\n\n“In spite of an objective formulation of \"dolus eventualis\" in some earlier cases relating principally to the doctrine of common purpose,” since the early 1950s the courts have favoured a subjective test for intention, which was ultimately adopted by the Appellate Division in \"R v Nsele\". Since \"Nsele\", the subjective test for criminal intention has been consistently applied by South African courts. It is now settled law that\n\nintention, and more particularly \"dolus eventualis\", cannot be established through the application of an objective criterion. It must be proved that the accused subjectively foresaw the possible occurrence of the consequence in question.\n\nThe subjective test takes account only of the state of mind of the accused, the issue being whether the accused himself foresaw the consequences of his act. The test may be satisfied by inferential reasoning: that is to say, if it can be reasoned that, in the particular circumstances, the accused “ought to have foreseen” the consequences, and thus “must have foreseen,” and therefore, by inference, “did foresee” them.\n\nIn \"S v Sigwahla\", Holmes JA expressed the degree of proof in the following terms:\n\nSubjective foresight, like any other factual issue, may be proved by inference. To constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt the inference must be the only one which can reasonably be drawn. It cannot be so drawn if there is a reasonable possibility that subjectively the accused did not foresee, even if he ought reasonably to have done so, and even if he probably did do so.\n\nThe inference, then, must be the only one that can reasonably be drawn from the proved facts.\n\nIn \"S v Van Aardt\", having regard to the “sustained” and “vicious” assault upon the deceased by the appellant, the SCA found that “the appellant subjectively foresaw the possibility of his conduct causing the death of the deceased and was plainly reckless as to such result ensuing.” He was therefore guilty of murder on the basis of \"dolus eventualis\". This finding rendered irrelevant the question of whether or not the appellant owed a duty to the deceased of obtaining medical assistance for him. In the court \"a quo\", however, Pickering J had accepted \"that the State was required to prove that the appellant subjectively foresaw the reasonable possibility that his failure to obtain medical assistance for the deceased would lead to the death of the deceased.” “This,” argues Shannon Hoctor, “is the correct approach, in that in the face of any possible interpretive confusion the interpretation most favourable to the accused should be adopted.”\n\nSome consequences of an action will \"certainly\" occur; others will \"probably\" occur; while it is only a \"possibility\" that yet another consequence may occur. The question to be considered is whether all consequences, however remote the possibility of their occurrence, may be said to have been intended, or whether there is some point, in the scale of probability, at which foresight ceases to qualify as intention.\n\n“After some uncertainty in older cases,” this question was settled in part by the decision of the Appellate Division in \"R v Horn\". Prior to this case, it was unclear whether \"dolus eventualis\" required foresight on the part of the accused that the consequences in question would \"probably\" result from his act, or whether it was sufficient if he foresaw that the consequences might \"possibly\" result. The Appellate Division decided that realisation of the \"possibility\" of the consequences is sufficient for criminal intention.\n\nIn earlier cases, the test for liability had been stated to be whether or not the consequence was “likely” to occur. It was argued in \"Horn\" that “likely” “connotes a degree of probability, something more than a mere possibility.” Since in this case the evidence showed that the risk of harming the deceased was “one chance in a thousand,” and that the risk of killing her was “one chance in many thousands,” counsel argued that in the circumstances a fatal wounding was not a likely or probable occurrence, and so could not be said to have been intended by the appellant. Having examined earlier cases, Beyers JA was sceptical of this contention, observing,\n\nNo doubt, an accused may, in appropriate circumstances, be heard to say \"That which has happened was so improbable that I did not appreciate that there was a risk of it happening.\" But that is not to say that a person who does foresee a risk of death is entitled, because the risk is slight, to “take a chance” and, as it were, gamble with the life of another.\n\nOn this point, the judge went on:\n\nIt would be incongruous to limit a wrong-doer’s constructive intent to cases where the result which he had foreseen was likely to cause death and not to infer such intent where the result he had foreseen was, although possible, not likely.\nIt is only in proving the wrongdoer’s appreciation of death as a possible result that it becomes relevant whether death was \"likely\" for the more likely death was, the stronger is the inference that he in fact appreciated the risk to life.\n\nIn short, if the accused foresaw the consequences or circumstances in question not as a probable result of his act, but considered that there was even a \"possibility\" that they could result (and if he reconciled himself to this possibility), he will have had intention in the sense of \"dolus eventualis\". On the other hand, if he did not actually foresee the possibility, but as a reasonable man \"ought\" to have foreseen it, he lacked intention; at most he was negligent.\n\nThe view that foresight of only the \"possibility\" of the consequences resulting from an accused’s act is sufficient for \"dolus eventualis\" “can now be regarded as settled law.”\n\nThe courts have usually spoken simply of foresight of “possibility,” or of “risk,” unqualified by any adjective. Given that foresight of a possibility will constitute intention in the form of \"dolus eventualis\", does it follow, then, that even the most remote and unlikely possibility, if foreseen, must be taken to have been intended?\n\nThe Southern African courts waver between,\n\n\nA further possibility is that the distinction between real and remote possibility is not relevant to foresight, but rather to the enquiry into recklessness.\n\nIn \"S v De Bruyn\", Holmes JA stated \"obiter\" that \"dolus eventualis\" is present if the accused “foresees the possibility, \"however remote\", of his act resulting in death to another.” Later in his judgment he added (also \"obiter\"), “If, under cross-examination, an accused were to admit that he foresaw the possibility of death, on the footing that anything is possible, that would contribute to a conviction of murder.” In \"S v Beukes\", in contrast, Van Heerden JA accepted that \"dolus eventualis\" would normally be present only where the accused foresaw the occurrence of the unlawful consequence or the existence of the unlawful circumstance as a “reasonable” possibility.\n\nIn \"S v Ngubane\", Jansen JA stated,\n\nIn principle it should not matter in respect of \"dolus eventualis\" whether the agent foresees (subjectively) the possibility as strong or faint, as probable or improbable provided his state of mind in regard to that possibility is \"consenting,\" \"reconciling\" or \"taking [the foreseen possibility] into the bargain.\" However, the likelihood in the eyes of the agent of the possibility eventuating must obviously have a bearing on the question whether he did consent to that possibility.\n\nAccording to Jansen JA, “if the agent persists in his conduct despite foreseeing such a consequence as a real or concrete possibility, the inference could well be drawn that he ‘reconciled’ himself to that consequence, that he was reckless of that consequence.” Jansen JA states that it does not matter, in determining foresight, whether the accused foresaw a real or merely a remote possibility of a consequence or circumstance. The relevance of this distinction between real and remote possibility arises in determining whether the accused accepted the foreseen possibility into the bargain.\n\nDespite the views of certain South African writers, the Appellate Division in \"S v Goosen\" adopted the approach that has found favour among German criminal theorists: that the intention element (in consequence crimes) is not satisfied if the consequence occurs in a manner that differs markedly from the way in which the accused foresaw the causal sequence.\n\nIn other words, for intention in the form of \"dolus eventualis\" to exist, there not only has to be at least foresight of the possibility of the consequence occurring, and not only must the accused proceed with his conduct despite such foresight, but there has to be a substantial correlation between the foreseen way in which the consequence might have occurred and the actual way in which it did.\n\nThe appellant in \"Goosen\" foresaw the gun held by another in the gang being discharged intentionally, but he did not foresee, or it was not proved beyond reasonable doubt that he did foresee, the gun going off involuntarily or accidentally.\n\nVan Heerden JA, delivering the unanimous judgment of the Appellate Division in \"Goosen\", took the view that statements by Rumpff JA in \"S v Masilela\", and of Jansen JA in \"S v Daniels\"—to the effect that the accused’s mistake as regards the actual way in which death occurs cannot avail him—must be confined to the factual situations in those cases: in particular to instances when there was \"dolus directus\" in regard to the causing of death.\n\nVan Heerden JA took the approach that where the accused’s aim and objective was to bring about the death of the deceased, in general his mistake as regards the actual way in which death occurs would be irrelevant. Van Heerden JA nevertheless accepted that, even where \"dolus directus\" was present, there might be exceptions to this rule. Referring, however, to the judgment of Steyn CJ in \"S v Nkombani\", he held that, where \"dolus eventualis\" is alleged, the accused’s foresight of the way in which death might occur must not differ markedly from the \"actual\" way in which the death occurs. The meaning of “differ markedly” (“\"wesenlike afwyking\"”) would have to be elucidated by the courts in future cases, Van Heerden JA said.\n\nThe facts in \"Goosen\" were as follows: The appellant had participated in a robbery. It was found that, at the time, he had foreseen the possibility that one of his fellow robbers might intentionally shoot the deceased with a hand carbine, and thereby kill him. The robbers had waited for the deceased in a car outside his place of work. The deceased had got into his car and driven off; they followed him. When the deceased’s car stopped at a stop sign, the robbers jumped out of their car and confronted him. One of the robbers, Mazibuko, held the hand carbine while another member of the group struck the deceased. The deceased’s car (which had automatic transmission) started moving forward towards Mazibuko when the deceased’s foot slipped off the brake. As the car moved towards Mazibuko, the carbine went off and the deceased was fatally shot.\n\nMazibuko claimed that he had pulled the trigger of the carbine by accident, or involuntarily. The trial Court and the Appellate Division accepted that there was a possibility that the trigger of the carbine had been pulled involuntarily. Mazibuko was found guilty of culpable homicide, in that he had negligently caused the deceased’s death. The appellant, who had neither carried the carbine nor struck the deceased, but had nevertheless accompanied the gang, had on the insistent advice of counsel pleaded guilty to murder and was duly found guilty.\n\nOn appeal, the Appellate Division set aside the appellant’s conviction of murder (and the imposition of the death sentence), and found him guilty of culpable homicide. The court held that the causing of death by intentional conduct (which the appellant was held to have foreseen) was markedly different from causing death by involuntary conduct (the way in which the death in fact occurred). The court accepted that death caused by the involuntary discharge of the firearm might have been foreseen by another individual, but the appellant, who had failed Standard 6, and was of low intelligence, had not been proved to have foreseen this sequence of events. The court therefore found the appellant guilty only of culpable homicide (on the basis that a reasonable person in the place of the appellant would have foreseen the possibility of death resulting from the involuntary discharge of the firearm). The appellant was sentenced to six years’ imprisonment.\n\nVan Heerden JA gave the following hypothetical example to support his conclusion on the question of mistake regarding the causal sequence: Imagine that a robber plans to rob a café owner. He takes a revolver with him and, although he fervently hopes that he will not have to use the weapon, he foresees as a reasonable possibility that he may have to kill the café owner to achieve his object. In the hope that the victim will hand over his money without the need for force, he hides the revolver in his pocket. As he is about to confront the café owner, he slips on the floor, the loaded revolver in his pocket goes off, and the café owner is killed by the bullet. Is the robber guilty of murder?\n\nAccording to Van Heerden JA, he is not, because he made a fundamental mistake regarding the causal sequence which resulted in death. “However,” writes Burchell,\n\ncould it not be argued that an acquittal on a murder charge could have resulted on the basis that the robber’s conduct in entering the café with a loaded revolver in his pocket, although the factual cause of the deceased’s death, was not the legal cause of such death, since his slipping, falling and the gun going off constituted a substantially unusual event which was not foreseen as a real possibility and which served to break the causal chain?\n\nIf this alternative, causal approach to Van Heerden JA’s hypothetical example is correct, asks Burchell,\n\nwhy is it necessary to invoke the theory of mistake as regards the causal sequence? Perhaps the answer may lie in the fact that in common-purposes cases (such as \"Goosen\") the courts have specifically followed an approach which imputes the act of the perpetrator to the other participants in the common purpose, irrespective of whether the latter have contributed causally to the unlawful consequence or not. Their active participation in the common purpose coupled with the requisite guilty mind or fault is enough—either factual or legal causation between their association and the unlawful consequence is not required. The theory of mistake as regards the causal sequence, which is an aspect of \"mens rea\", may thus be an important limiting device in cases of common-purpose liability, excluding liability for murder where death was foreseen by the participants in a common purpose, but death in fact occurred in an unexpected, or even bizarre, way.\n\nSubjective foresight of the possibility of the occurrence of a consequence, or the existence of circumstances, is apparently not in itself sufficient for \"dolus eventualis\". In addition, the accused’s state of mind in regard to that possibility, it has been held, must be one of “consenting” to the materialisation of the possibility, “reconciling” himself to it, “taking [the foreseen possibility] into the bargain,” or “recklessness” in regard to that possibility. Jansen JA, in \"S v Ngubane\", used all of these apparently interchangeable terms to describe the additional element of \"dolus eventualis\".\n\nThe issue of whether an accused person who foresees the possibility of a consequence, or the existence of a circumstance, may be said to consent or reconcile himself or herself to, or accept the consequence or circumstance into the bargain, is referred to as the “volitional” component of \"dolus eventualis\".\n\nIn \"S v Beukes\", Van Heerden JA acknowledged that no decision has in fact turned on the question of recklessness, and that normally recklessness would only be satisfied where the accused foresaw a consequence as a “reasonable” possibility. Nevertheless, Van Heerden JA noted that recklessness is of value as an additional element of \"dolus eventualis\".\n\nVan Heerden JA was of the view that, as an accused would seldom admit this element, the court had to draw an inference regarding an accused’s state of mind from facts indicating, objectively assessed, a \"reasonable possibility\" that the result would ensue. From the mere fact that he acted, it could be inferred that he had reconciled himself to the result.\nVan Heerden JA held that this second element of \"dolus eventualis\", the volitional element, would normally only be satisfied where the perpetrator had foreseen the result as a reasonable possibility. The Judge of Appeal gave two circumstances in which the volitional element is useful:\n\n\nIn the latter case, Van Heerden JA says that the perpetrator would be reckless as to the result if he should take no steps to terminate the chain of events. He gives a hypothetical example: X, a party to a common purpose, initially does not foresee that another in the group is armed, but later finds out that he is. “Surely,” writes Burchell, “this second situation mentioned by the Judge of Appeal could be seen as a case where, once he finds out the truth, he then has foresight of the real (reasonable) possibility of a firearm being used.”\n\nThe subjective test of intention is based on the accused’s state of mind. The question is not whether the accused should have foreseen, but whether he actually foresaw.\n\nThe requirements of dolus eventualis are substantially the same whether a consequence or circumstance is involved. However, since a causal sequence is never in issue in a circumstance crime, the rules about mistake regarding the causal sequence enunciated in \"Goosen\" obviously do not apply.\n\nFurthermore, the element of “recklessness,” in the context of circumstance crimes, has been expressed in terms of a deliberate abstention from making inquiries which might lead to the truth.\n\n“However,” observes Burchell, “if the difference between motive and intention is borne in mind, the purpose of abstention from making inquiries need not be to avoid having one’s suspicions confirmed. Thus X would have the \"dolus eventualis\" required for the common-law offence of receiving stolen property, knowing the goods to be stolen, if he actually foresees as a real possibility that the goods have been stolen and nevertheless receives them, whatever his motive for abstaining from making further inquiries may be.”\n\nThe following defences exclude intention:\n\n\n\"Putative\" means \"supposed.\" The following are putative defences:\n\n\nNegligence is the term used in law to indicate that the conduct of a person has not conformed to a prescribed standard: that of the reasonable person (more specifically, what a reasonable person would have foreseen in the circumstances, and the care that would have been exercised by a reasonable person in such circumstances). The failure to ensure that conduct does conform to the standard is reprehensible. Negligence is therefore regarded as a form of fault.\n\nIntention is conceptually different from negligence. Jansen JA, in \"Ngubane\", stated that “\"culpa\" as opposed to \"dolus\", is an \"aliud\" and not a \"minus\".\" In other words, negligence is different and distinct from intention; it is not merely a lesser form of intention.\n\nIntention involves a course of action purposefully chosen, with the knowledge that it is unlawful. The test of intention is simply what the accused knew or foresaw. It is an enquiry into the actual state of mind of the actor. The test is “subjective.”\n\nThe test of negligence, on the other hand, is not necessarily what the actor thought or foresaw, but rather what a reasonable person would have foreseen and done in the circumstances. The enquiry is thus not as to the actual state of the actor’s mind but rather as to whether his or her conduct measured up to that of the reasonable person. The test is \"objective.\"\n\nJansen JA observed in \"S v Ngubane\" that “some of our writers have propounded a ‘subjective test’ for negligence. It is also said that recent cases disclose a swing to the subjective approach [...] and that the case of \"S v Van As\" confirms this. It is, however, unnecessary for present purposes to express any opinion on this view, save for mentioning that there may be some doubt as to whether the phrase “\"redelikerwyse kon en moes voorsien het\",” used in \"S v Van As\", connotes anything more than the conventional objective standard, albeit somewhat individualised.”\n\nThese comments clearly favour an essentially objective test of negligence. “Although,” as Burchell comments, “future courts will have to grapple with the rather enigmatic phrase ‘somewhat individualised,’” it is apparent that the Appellate Division in certain post-\"Ngubane\" decisions emphasised the objective nature of the negligence criterion.\n\nThis simple conceptual distinction is subject, however, to two qualifications. The first qualification is that negligence does not always involve inadvertence, so the distinction between intention as foreseeing and negligence as not foreseeing sometimes breaks down. Burchell argues “that the concept of conscious negligence is also recognised in our law.”\n\nThe second, although related, qualification is that proof of intention does not necessarily exclude a finding of negligence.\n\nIn determining liability in a criminal prosecution in which the fault of the accused allegedly constitutes negligence, the South African courts have traditionally applied the following test to determine whether the accused had been negligent:\n\n\nThe reasonable person is\n\n\nIn other words, the reasonable person is the average person, of ordinary knowledge and intelligence.\n\nThe criterion of the reasonable person was described by Holmes JA in \"S v Burger\" as follows:\n\nOne does not expect of a \"diligens paterfamilias\" any extremes such as Solomonic wisdom, prophetic foresight, chameleonic caution, headlong haste, nervous timidity, or the trained reflexes of a racing driver. In short, a \"diligens paterfamilias\" treads life’s pathway with moderation and prudent common sense.”\n\nThe first limb of the traditional test is this: Would a reasonable person, in the same circumstances as the accused, have foreseen the reasonable possibility of the occurrence of the consequence or the existence of the circumstance in question, including its unlawfulness?\n\nMere carelessness does not automatically entail criminal liability for the consequences. In other words, “negligence in the air” or “abstract negligence” is not enough. The accused’s negligence must relate to the consequences or circumstances in issue.\n\nThis relationship between negligence and the consequences or circumstances in issue is expressed in terms of reasonable foreseeability: Would a reasonable person in the position of the accused have foreseen the possibility of the occurrence of that consequence or the existence of that circumstance?\n\nIn the light of the Appellate Division decisions in \"S v Van der Mescht\", \"S v Bernardus\" and \"S v Van As\", it is now clear that, on a charge of culpable homicide, the prosecution must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have foreseen the possibility of death; reasonable foreseeability of bodily injury, short of death, will not suffice.\n\nIn \"S v Van der Mescht\", the accused and “G” had melted gold amalgam on a stove for the purposes of extracting the gold. As a result of the heating, the amalgam emitted mercurial gas which resulted in the death of G and four of the children who were in the house at the time.\nThe trial court convicted the accused of culpable homicide. The conviction was, however, set aside by the Appellate Division, the majority holding that the prosecution had failed to prove that the deaths were attributable to the accused’s negligence. In other words, it had not been proved, beyond reasonable doubt, that a reasonable person in the position of the accused would have foreseen that the heating of gold amalgam might lead to the death of someone.\n\nThe Appellate Division in \"S v Bernardus\" had to answer the following question of law: Is a person guilty of culpable homicide if he unlawfully assaults another and, in so doing, causes his death, but under circumstances in which he could not reasonably have foreseen the death?\nSteyn CJ, delivering the judgment of the court, answered this question in the negative: Death—not merely bodily injury short of death—must be reasonably foreseeable. Holmes JA did, however, point out that where an accused assaults another in circumstances in which he ought reasonably to have foreseen the possibility of causing him serious injury, he ought also to have foreseen “the possibility of death hovering in attendance: the two are sombrely familiar as cause and effect in the walks of human experience.”\n\nHolmes JA’s observation in no way detracts from the principle that, in culpable homicide cases, death must be reasonably foreseeable. The observation underscores the principle, but emphasises that in practice reasonable foreseeability of death might be inferred from reasonable foreseeability of serious bodily injury.\n\nRumpff CJ in S v Van As restated the general principle as follows: “In criminal law, when death follows upon an unlawful assault, it must be proved, before there can be a finding of culpable homicide, that the accused could and must reasonably have foreseen that death could intervene as a result of the assault. The expression “must have foreseen” is used in the sense of “ought to have foreseen”. If it is proved that the accused ought reasonably to have foreseen that death was a possible result and that the causation requirement has been satisfied the case is concluded [...] The question is, however, [...] could and should the accused reasonably have foreseen that the deceased could have died as a result [of the assault?] That foreseeability of serious bodily harm usually, but not always, goes hand in hand with foreseeability of death is correct, but it will certainly depend on the nature of the injuries inflicted in a particular case whether there was a reasonable foreseeability of death or not.”\nIn Van As, the accused gave “D’s” cheek a hard slap during an altercation. As a result D, who was a very fat man, lost his balance, fell backwards and hit his head on the cement floor. He fell unconscious and later died.\nThe trial court convicted the accused of culpable homicide, but on appeal the verdict was altered to one of guilty of assault only, since it had not been proved that, in all the circumstances, the accused could and should reasonably have foreseen D’s death.\n\nCAN NEGLIGENCE & INTENTION OVERLAP?\nIn S v Ngubane, Jansen JA stated that “dolus postulates foreseeing, but culpa does not necessarily postulate not foreseeing. A man may foresee the possibility of harm and yet be negligent in respect of that harm ensuing.”\nPrior to Ngubane, there had been a conflict in both academic and judicial opinion about whether dolus (intention) and culpa (negligence) were mutually exclusive concepts. Jansen JA in Ngubane has resolved the matter authoritatively by concluding that proof of dolus does not necessarily exclude a finding of culpa:\n“Dolus connotes a volitional state of mind; culpa connotes a failure to measure up to a standard of conduct. Seen in this light it is difficult to accept that proof of dolus excludes culpa. The facts of the present case illustrate this. The appellant, somewhat under the influence of liquor, without premeditation and as a result of some provocation, stabbed the deceased five times, the fatal injury penetrating the heart. The inference drawn by the Court a quo that he foresaw the possibility of death ensuing and that he killed intentionally (dolus eventualis) is clear. This, however, does not preclude the matter being viewed from a different angle: did not the appellant, foreseeing the possibility of death ensuing by failing to curb his emotions and failing to desist from attacking the deceased, fall short of the standard of the reasonable man (or, if the subjective approach were to be applied, to measure up to the standard of his own capabilities)? The existence of dolus does not preclude the answering of this question in the affirmative.’”\nIn reaching this conclusion, Jansen JA categorically rejected definitions of\nnegligence (culpa) that specifically require the absence of intention (dolus).\n\nNEGLIGENCE & MISTAKE\nIf the accused is charged with committing an offence for which negligence is sufficient for liability, then, if the accused genuinely and reasonably did not know that what he was doing was unlawful, he must be acquitted. \nIn R v Mbombela 1933 AD 269, the accused was tried by jury and found guilty of the murder of a nine-year-old child. The accused, between eighteen and twenty years of age, living in a rural area, was described by the court as of “rather below the normal” intelligence.\nOn the day in question, some children were outside a hut they supposed to be empty. They saw “something that had two small feet like those of a human being.” They were frightened and called the accused, who apparently thought the object was a “tikoloshe,” an evil spirit that, according to a widespread superstitious belief, occasionally took the form of a little old man with small feet. According to this belief, it would be fatal to look the “tikoloshe” in the face.\nThe accused went to fetch a hatchet and, in the half-light, struck the form a number of times with the hatchet. When he dragged the object out of the hut, he found that he had killed his young nephew.\nMbombela’s defence was bona fide mistake: He believed he was killing a “tikoloshe,” not a human being.\nA jury in the trial court found him guilty of murder. Applying a standard of reasonableness that ignored the “race or the idiosyncracies [sic], or the superstitions, or the intelligence of the person accused,” the Appellate Division held that, although his belief was unreasonable, it was based on a bona fide mistake of fact, so the killing fell within the Native Territories Penal Code definition of culpable homicide rather than murder.\n\nATTEMPT & ACCOMPLICES\n\nACTUS REUS and MENS REA: THE CONTEMPORANEITY RULE\nWhere fault (mens rea) is an element of the crime charged, the unlawful conduct and the fault must exist contemporaneously. In other words, the wrongdoer must intend to commit or be negligent in the commission of the crime at the time that the crime is being committed. Thus a person will not be guilty of murder if, “whilst he is driving to Y’s house in order to kill him there, he negligently runs over somebody, and it later transpires that the deceased is Y.” Likewise, it is not murder if a person kills another accidentally and “later expresses his joy at having killed him.”\nThe contemporaneity rule has been in issue in cases where the accused intends to kill another and, having inflicted what he thinks is a fatal wound on that other person, he then disposes of the body or sets alight to the building in which the body lies. In fact, the victim does not die from the initial assault, but from the subsequent conduct of disposing of the body, or from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by the fumes from the fire, as in S v Masilela 1968 (2) SA 558 (A).\nIn these cases, the initial assault is accompanied by the intent to kill but, technically, the unlawful consequence of death is not present at that time, because death only results later. Similarly, when death results, technically, there is no intent to kill because the accused believes his victim is already dead. \nThe Appellate Division has refused to exculpate the accused of murder in such a case. In S v Masilela, the appellants assaulted their victim by striking him over the head and throttling him with a tie. Although the assault caused the victim serious injuries which rendered him unconscious, it did not kill him. After throwing the victim on the bed and covering him with a blanket, the appellants proceeded to ransack the house. Then, believing the victim to be already dead, they set the bed alight, as well as the house, and made off. The victim died, not from the assault, but as a result of carbon-monoxide poisoning caused by the fumes from the fire.\nIn an appeal from a conviction of murder, it was contended that at most the appellants were guilty of attempted murder on the ground that, in respect of the assault, the intention (mens rea) for murder had been present, but not the unlawful consequence of death; and, with regard to the burning, there had been the unlawful consequence required for murder but not the intention (mens rea), since the appellants believed the victim to be already dead.\nThe Appellate Division held that the appellants were guilty of murder. Ogilvie Thompson JA refused to regard the assault and the subsequent burning as two separate and disconnected acts. Rumpff JA took the view that, in this kind of case, where the accused and nobody else causes death, the accused’s mistake as to the precise manner in which and time when death occurred is not a factor on which he may rely.\n\nPARTICIPATION IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES\nPERSONS INVOLVED IN A CRIME\nThere are three types of person who may be involved in the commission of a crime, and therefore liable for it:\n• perpetrators;\n• accomplices; and\n• accessories after the fact. \nSee S v Williams 1980 (1) SA 60 (A).\nPerpetrators and accomplices are participants in the crime; an accessory after the fact is not a participant.\nPerpetrators and accomplices participate before completion of the crime; accessories after the fact are involved after completion of the crime.\n\nFrom Snyman:\n\nPARTICIPATION BEFORE COMPLETION OF THE CRIME\nIn the case of participation before completion of the crime, a perpetrator is one who, with the necessary fault (mens rea), commits the unlawful conduct, and thereby satisfies the definitional elements of the crime in question. Where there is more than one perpetrator, we speak of co-perpetrators.\nAccording to contemporary South African criminal theory, a person may be liable as a perpetrator in three separate situations: \n• where he personally satisfies the definitional elements of the crime, and is therefore a perpetrator in his or her own right (since his liability is in no way accessory to or dependent on the conduct of another person);\n• where he or she, although possessing the requisite capacity and the fault element (mens rea) for the crime in question, does not personally comply with all of the elements of the unlawful conduct in question, and the conduct of the perpetrator is “attributed” or “imputed” to him or her, by virtue of his or her prior agreement or active association in a common purpose to commit the crime in question; or \n• where a person procures another person, who may be an innocent or unwilling agent, to commit a crime.\n\nCOMMON PURPOSE\nWhere two or more people agree to commit a crime or actively associate in a joint unlawful enterprise, each will be responsible for the specific criminal conduct committed by one of their number which falls within their common design. Liability arises from their “common purpose” to commit the crime.\nIf the participants are charged with having committed a “consequence crime,” it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that each participant committed conduct which contributed causally to the ultimate unlawful consequence. It is sufficient to establish\n• a prior agreement by the participants to commit a crime; or\n• no such prior agreement, but an active association by the participants in its commission. This usually happens when the number of people partaking in the crime is large—a mob, that is to say. \nIf this is established, then the conduct of the participant who actually causes the consequence is imputed or attributed to the other participants. It is not necessary to establish precisely which member of the common purpose caused the consequence, provided that it is established that one of the group brought about this result.\nIn respect of both of the above forms of common purpose, the following elements are essential:\n• fault (mens rea), which may take the form either of intention or of negligence, the central question being when the common purpose was formulated;\n• unlawful conduct, which refers participation in the unlawful act, rather than the act itself; and\n• causation, in terms of which the conduct of the person who actually causes the consequence is imputed or attributed to the other participants.\nThe common-purpose doctrine is a departure from the general principles of criminal law. Its rationale is one of crime control. The doctrine has been much criticised over the years, most recently in the aftermath of the Marikana massacre, when it was incorrectly claimed in media circles that it had its origins in apartheid-era legislation. It has survived such criticism, however, and remains a valuable tool for the courts.\n\nCommon Purpose: Active Association\nThe common-purpose rule originated in English law and was introduced into South Africa via the Native Territories’ Penal Code. The much-publicised murder conviction of the “Sharpeville Six” in terms of the common-purpose doctrine, in S v Safatsa 1988 (1) SA 868 (A), highlighted the significance of the common-purpose doctrine in the context of the administration of criminal justice in South Africa. The controversial imposition of the death penalty on the Six also played a significant role in strengthening the call for the abolition or reassessment of the death penalty in South Africa.\nEvidence of the specific participation of the Sharpeville Six in the murder of the deputy-mayor of Lekoa was meagre, aside from the fact that they had joined the crowd of about a hundred persons that attacked the deceased’s house in Sharpeville. It was not possible to determine which members of the mob had been personally responsible for killing the mayor. \nNevertheless, there was some evidence to implicate the Six in the subsequent killing of the deceased. He was killed by stoning and burning perpetrated by some members of the crowd, but it was not possible to determine which specific members had participated directly in the killing.\nAccused number 1 had grabbed hold of the deceased, wrestled with him for possession of his pistol, and thrown the first stone at the deceased, which felled him.\nAccused number 2 had thrown stones at the deceased and at his house. After the deceased’s house had been set alight, accused number 2 had thrown a stone at the deceased which had struck him on his back.\nAccused number 3 had grabbed the deceased, wrestled with him for possession of his pistol, and succeeded in dispossessing him of the weapon.\nAccused number 4 was part of the crowd which converged on the deceased’s house; she had shouted repeated exhortations to the crowd to kill the deceased (since the deceased was shooting at them) and had slapped a woman who had remonstrated with the crowd not to burn the deceased.\nAccused numbers 5 and 6 had been part of the vanguard of the crowd which had converged on the deceased’s house and stoned it, but they were not seen to have thrown any stones themselves, and were ultimately acquitted on the basis that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that they shared the requisite intent to kill at the relevant time.\nAccused number 7 had made petrol bombs, set the deceased’s house alight, and pushed the deceased’s car into the street and set it alight.\nAccused number 8 had also made petrol bombs and handed them out with instructions, had commanded the mob to set the deceased’s house on fire, and had assisted in pushing the car into the street.\nThe Appellate Division, in a unanimous judgment, approved the conviction of the Six on the basis of the doctrine of common purpose. The court pointed out that the intention of each participant must be considered, together with the question of whether or not each had the requisite dolus in respect of the death. The court traced the historical development of the doctrine, and found that “it would constitute a drastic departure from a firmly established practice to hold now that a party to a common purpose cannot be convicted of murder unless a causal connection is proved between his conduct and the death of the deceased. I can see no good reason for warranting such a departure.”\nIn S v Mgedezi 1989 (1) SA 687 (A), the Appellate Division drew a distinction between common-purpose liability\n• where there is a prior agreement, expressed or implied, to commit a crime (the mandate situation); and\n• where there is no such prior agreement.\nIn the latter situation, certain additional requirements have to be satisfied before the principle of imputation, which is the characteristic of common-purpose liability, can arise.\nIn S v Mgedezi, the court held that, in the absence of proof of a prior agreement, an accused who was not shown to have contributed causally to the killing or wounding of the victims could be held liable for those events on the basis of Safatsa only if certain prerequisites were satisfied: \n• he must have been present at the scene where the violence was being committed;\n• he must have been aware of the assault on the victims;\n• he must have intended to make common cause with those who were actually perpetrating the assault;\n• he must have manifested his sharing of a common purpose with the perpetrators by himself performing some act of association with the conduct of the others; and\n• there must be the requisite mens rea. In respect, therefore, of the killing of the deceased, he must have intended them to be killed, or must have foreseen the possibility of their being killed and performed his own act of association with recklessness as to whether or not death was to ensue.\nIn S v Thebus 2003 (6) SA 505 (CC), the Constitutional Court considered the active-association form of common purpose. The court held that, in its then-current form, the doctrine violated a number of constitutional rights. The formulation in Mgedezi, however, passed constitutional muster.\nIt can no longer be said, then, that common-purpose doctrine is part of the old order, since it has been ratified as constitutional in the new one.\nThebus has been criticised, though, for having dispensed with the causation element, and for its infringement on the presumption of innocence and the requirement that the prosecution prove each element of the crime. \nSee Burchell 580-588; Snyman 263-272.\n\nWHEN DOES A COMMON PURPOSE ARISE?\nDifferences of opinion about the precise moment when a common purpose arises were resolved by the Appellate Division in its unanimous judgment in S v Motaung 1990 (4) SA 485 (A), delivered by Hoexter JA who concluded that the matter must be decided with reference to legal principle. Hoexter JA held that a distinction should be drawn between “participation in a common purpose to kill which begins before the deceased has been fatally wounded and such participation which begins thereafter but while the deceased is still alive.”\nHoexter JA reached the conclusion that, where there is a reasonable possibility that a joiner-in (or late-comer) acceded to a common purpose to kill only after the deceased had been fatally injured by another, and that the joiner-in had done nothing to expedite the death of the deceased, he could not be found guilty of murder but only of attempted murder.\nOf course, if the joiner-in does perpetrate conduct which expedites the death of the deceased then he may be liable as a co-perpetrator in his own right.\n\nDISSOCIATION / WITHDRAWAL FROM A COMMON PURPOSE\nSee: Snyman at 270-272 \n• clear & unambiguous intention to withdraw.\n• some positive act of withdrawal.\n• voluntary.\n• before course of events have reached “commencement of execution”.\n• type of act required will depend on circumstances\n\nS v Singo 1993 (2) SA 765 (A)\nS v Lungile 1999 (2) SACR 597 (SCA)\nMusingadi & others v S 2005 (1) SACR 395 (SCA) or [2004] 4 All SA 274 (SCA) esp. par 33 onward\n\nACCOMPLICES\nS v Williams:\n• An accomplice is not a perpetrator or a co-perpetrator; he lacks actus reus of the perpetrator. This is the most important defining element of an accomplice.\n• associates himself wittingly with the crime - knowingly affords perpetrator / co-perpetrator opportunity, means or info which furthers commission of crime. \nSee Joubert J in this case on the frequent confusion between accomplices and perps.\n\nElements of accomplice liability:\n• Accomplice liability is accessory in nature. Someone else must have first initiated the unlawful act or acts.\n• Unlawful conduct here may take various forms, such as facilitating. See textbooks. \n• Accomplices must intentionally facilitate the completion of the crime; there’s no such thing as a negligent accomplice.\nS v Williams sets the above out in detail.

The crime is completed only at the moment that the property has been set alight. If the arsonist is caught at a stage before the property has been set alight, he is guilty of attempted arson only, provided that his conduct has, according to the general rules governing liability for attempt, proceeded beyond mere acts of preparation.\n\nAs in malicious injury to property, one cannot in principle commit arson in respect of one's own property. The courts, however, including the appellate division, in \"R v Mavros\", have held that a person commits arson if he sets fire to his own property to claim its value from the insurer. In the estimation of Snyman, \"It would have been better to punish this type of conduct as fraud instead of arson, but the courts will in all probability not depart from the appeal court's view.\"\n\nIntention, and more particularly the intention to damage property by setting fire to it, thereby causing patrimonial harm to somebody, is also required. \"Dolus eventualis\" in this regard is sufficient.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "List of The Sopranos characters – Friends and family\n\nDomenica is the daughter of Janice and Bobby Baccalieri. She was born sometime in 2005, after her parents got married. Getting her registered for a pre-school was the reason why Janice and Bobby were not able to take care of Junior the night he shot Tony. Domenica rode the amusement ride with her mother at the Feast of St. Elzéar when it broke. She longed for another ride and Tony later spun her around at the feast, to her joy. That year, Janice took Domenica to Satriale's Pork Store to demand that Tony make Bobby a capo. In 2007, Domenica played at the house near the lake when Tony, Carmela, Bobby, and Janice celebrated Tony's birthday. Janice kept her away from the water in fear she could drown.\n\nTony Soprano's cousin, who was imprisoned and soon thereafter became embroiled in a life of crime. Tony B. gets his massage license and tries to set up a massage business. He sabotages the business before it gets off the ground, and goes back to crime. Tony S. sets him up in the airbag scam, but it is not enough money for Tony B. To earn extra money, he performs a contract hit for Rusty and Angelo. After Angelo is killed, Tony B. kills Billy Leotardo in retaliation, igniting dangerous tensions with the New York crew. To bring peace with Johnny Sack (and to avoid Tony B.'s being tortured to death by Phil Leotardo), Tony S. kills Tony B. by shooting him in the face with a shotgun.\n\nQuintina is Livia's younger sister, a widow, and the mother of Tony Blundetto. Quintina, or \"Aunt Quin\" as people call her, is first seen when she and Livia are planning to board a plane for Arizona. However, because the tickets are stolen, the FBI questions her and Livia. She tries to keep connected with Tony Blundetto's ex-wife and children but hasn't seen then since Tony was incarcerated. Tony B. lives with his mother for a short time after being paroled from prison. She is very nervous and always trying to look out for Tony B. and his twin sons, Jason and Justin Blundetto. When Livia was having her \"change of life\" baby after Barbara Soprano and had a miscarriage and almost died from the miscarriage, Quintina left a note for Anthony and told him to find Johnny Boy.\n\nBrian is Carmela's cousin and a financial advisor. He assisted her in planning her estate when she worried over her own and her children's futures should anything happen to Tony. Tony and Brian became friends and Brian could later be seen accompanying Tony to parties at Bada Bing (for Paulie's homecoming) and Chief Smith's casino, drinking and enjoying the strippers. Tony set Brian up with Patsy to get cheap designer suits. Brian was also responsible for giving Tony the idea for the HUD scam. Later, he attended Hugh De Angelis' birthday party at Tony's home. Also, he and his wife accompanied Tony and Carmela to an Elton John/Billy Joel concert. Years later, in season 6 part 2, Brian and his pregnant wife bought Carmela's spec house.\n\nCarmela's father who is in his mid 70s. Hugh has been married to Mary for over 40 years and is a resident of West Orange, New Jersey. He is a former sailor in the United States Navy and spent time in Nova Scotia during the war. Although now semi-retired, Hugh had worked as a contractor, and he built Tony and Carmela's house. Almost everyone in the Soprano family consider Hugh a classy, old-school gentleman for whom tradition and respect are very important values. He has an affable and kindly manner, but does not hesitate to speak his mind on points of disagreement with family, particularly his wife. Hugh enjoys hunting and playing with Hot Wheels die cast cars with his grandson Anthony Jr. He is a member of the Knights of Columbus as evidenced by the custom-designed cake presented to him at his birthday celebration. He was considered a \"wild man\" in his youth; one time he had a physical altercation with a motorcycle gang and another time he disrupted a meeting of the German-American Bund by throwing a cherry bomb at its members.\n\nHugh and Mary eat Sunday dinner with Carmela and Tony when they are all on good terms. Hugh also has a brother named Lester and a sister named Lena, who is actually the mother of Christopher Moltisanti's father Dickie, thus making Hugh Chris' great uncle. During Carmela and Tony's separation, Hugh was eager to see Tony whenever possible and often took Tony's side in family discussions. This is due to Hugh's strong sense of tradition and respect for the traditional home and family. He did not want to be present at a family gathering if \"the man of the house\" was not there (in the episode \"Marco Polo\"). Hugh became involved in a real estate investment with Carmela involving a spec house. However, construction of the spec house was halted after a building inspector found that low-quality wood had been used. Carmela blamed her father for the setback and Hugh became angry that Carmela was treating him as a subordinate rather than a partner. After Tony's shooting, Hugh steals items from the house's storage garage and abandons the house. Carmela discovers this months later and scolds him about the permit - Hugh again becomes enraged at her attitude. Their feud leaves Mary meeting with Tony and Carmela alone while Hugh stays home. Carmela and Hugh reconciled enough for him to attend Christmas celebrations at the Soprano home later that year - after Carmela's spec house started to go ahead again.\n\nCarmela's mother who is in her mid 70s. Mary has been married to her husband Hugh De Angelis for over 40 years. Mary and Hugh have a long marriage, but she does nag her husband quite a bit and tends to treat Hugh as a subordinate rather than a husband, a theme that reappears in Hugh's relationship with both his wife and his daughter Carmela. Shortly after Carmela began dating Tony Soprano, she became extremely protective of her daughter and tried to prevent her from marrying him. After Carmela got married, the De Angelises met Tony's mother, Livia Soprano, with whom they became very angry after Livia told Carmela that \"Tony would get bored of her.\" Mary had a brother named Febby who died of cancer. Mary and Hugh started seeing Carmela more often after Livia was put in a nursing home. Mary has tried to prevent Tony from attending Hugh's 75th birthday party in fear that he would embarrass them in front of Russ and Lena Fegoli, her \"cultured Italian friends.\" Mary wishes to appear as a WASP and is embarrassed by Italian stereotypes. (For example, Mary, when Meadow was born, was disappointed at her granddaughter's dark skin tone.) Carmela became angered at her suggestion to ban Tony from the party but decided to put the issue aside. Mary and Hugh continue to surface during family functions and Sunday dinners at the Soprano home. Mary also suffers from psoriasis.\n\nAlyssa is the daughter of Barbara and Tom Giglione, sister of Thomas Giglione, niece of Tony and Carmela Soprano, and cousin of Meadow and AJ Soprano. She is seen during Sunday dinner at Uncle Junior's, witnessing Tony having an outburst because Junior repeatedly said, \"He never had the makings of a varsity athlete.\" Alyssa also attends Chris and Kelly Moltisanti's house-warming party.\n\nTommy is the son of Barbara and Tom Gigilione, brother of Alyssa Giglione, nephew of Tony and Carmela Soprano, and cousin of Meadow and AJ Soprano. He is seen at Sunday dinner at Uncle Junior's, witnessing Tony having an outburst because Junior repeatedly said, \"He never had the makings of a varsity athlete.\" Tommy also attends Chris and Kelly Moltisanti's house-warming party.\n\nBarbara's husband and Tony and Janice's brother-in-law. He and Barbara live in Brewster, New York with their two children. Apparently he is not involved in criminal activities, and he should not be confused with the capo \"Gigi\" who died in the toilet. He was at the Sopranos house every Christmas. The reason Barbara gives Tony for being unable to stay with Uncle Junior in \"Members Only\" indicates that Tom works in show business. His father is killed one day after retiring, falling off a roof while trying to install a satellite dish. Although not a member of the crime family, Tom's marriage to Tony's little sister Barbara caused Tony to be on excellent terms with him, and he gave a \"boost\" (envelope with cash) to Tom at his father's funeral. Tony debated the death of Tom's father in therapy, but in front of his family he was genuinely upset at the loss of Tom's father, and angry that Meadow was too casual about the death. Tom originally sported a goatee and beard in the earlier seasons, but shaved in off in favor of a clean shaven look later on.\n\n\nBarbara is the youngest child of Johnny and Livia Soprano, and sister of Tony and Janice. She is seen infrequently, usually only visiting her siblings for family functions, weddings or funerals. She lives in Brewster, New York and has two children with her husband, Tom. Barbara took part in caring for Junior Soprano as his dementia worsened.\n\nIn Season 6, after Tony's shooting by Uncle Junior, Barbara increased the level of contact with her siblings. She took part in keeping a round-the-clock vigil for Tony at the hospital and later attended family Sunday dinners at his home. She accompanied Janice to a viewing when Janice bought the Sacrimoni household and, in the series finale, was seen attending the wake of Janice's late husband, Bobby Baccalieri.\n\nHarpo is the estranged Italian-American-French Canadian, Quebec French speaking son of Janice Soprano born in Seattle, Washington. Janice said he was named from the song \"Harpo's Blues\" by Phoebe Snow (as opposed to Harpo Marx). His father, a French-Canadian Quebec French named Eugene, took him back to Montreal and Janice states that she tried to petition the State Department to have him returned to her. Janice tried to send Harpo to military school, the same one that Tony tries to send AJ to, but Tony says that \"Janice was too late for him.\" In the episode \"Proshai, Livushka,\" Janice mentions that Harpo had become homeless when Tony proposes flying him in for Livia's funeral. In season 5, she says she mentioned Harpo to Bobby once, but that the topic of him is never brought up in the family again. She tells Tony that he now goes by \"Hal\" instead of \"Harpo.\"\n\nAl is Kelli Moltisanti's father and Christopher's father-in-law. He owns several successful hardware stores in North New Jersey. Christopher pushed \"Little Paulie\" Germani out of a window because he allegedly stole tools from one of Al's hardware stores. Al appears to like Christopher. However, in episode \"Kennedy and Heidi,\" after Christopher's death, Al expresses his frustration with Chris leaving his daughter a widow and his granddaughter fatherless by driving a car under the influence of cocaine.\n\nRita is Kelli Moltisanti's mother and Christopher's mother-in-law. In \"Kennedy and Heidi,\" she mentions that the doctors said it was possible for Christopher to have survived the accident if they had gotten to him sooner.\n\nKelli was Christopher's new girlfriend in 2006. She became pregnant and planned to terminate the pregnancy, blaming herself for the lack of contraception. When she told Chris, he was actually overjoyed that Kelli was pregnant. Christopher bemoaned that his former fianceé Adriana could not have children and immediately suggested they go to Atlantic City and get married. Soon after their marriage, Kelli and Chris make an offer on a new home and move in. They also ate Sunday dinner with the Sopranos and Kelli complimented Tony on his (stolen) wine. Kelli became a regular at Soprano Sunday dinners - attending even when Christopher went to an AA meeting. Christopher's interest in Kelli began to drift and he began an affair with Julianna Skiff while his wife was still pregnant. Kelli remained devoted to Christopher and did not complain about his long absences. She attended the Sopranos' Christmas celebrations in 2006.\n\nIn 2007, Kelli was now a mother, having given birth to her and Christopher's daughter Caitlin. She later attended her baptism when Tony and Carmela Soprano became Caitlin's godparents. In the episode \"Walk Like a Man,\" Kelli had the idea to invite friends and family to her and Christopher's house for a barbecue and party. She was terrorized by Paulie Gualtieri when he drives his Cadillac CTS through their front yard in retaliation for Christopher throwing his nephew Little Paulie Germani out of a window. In the episode \"Kennedy and Heidi,\" when Christopher died, Tony commented that Kelli's behavior at the funeral reminded him of Jackie Kennedy Onassis. She was last seen with Caitlin attending a dinner at the Soprano house with Tony and Carmela.\n\nJoanne is the widow of Richard \"Dickie\" Moltisanti. After Christopher got revenge for his father's killing in For All Debts Public and Private he went to his mother's house to look through his father's things. He found an old picture of his father in a U.S. Navy uniform and gave it to his mother, thinking she would cherish such a picture, but she is later seen to put it face down on the table and not look at it. They then talked about Dickie, but she then proceeded to nag him about his drug abuse, to which Christopher retorted she is in no position to talk, given her alcoholism. Joanne attended Adriana La Cerva's bridal shower when she became engaged to Christopher. Later, she took part in an intervention for Christopher's drug addiction during which Christopher called her a whore. When Joanne's cousin Tony Blundetto killed Billy Leotardo, Christopher hid from Phil Leotardo at her townhouse. She was intimidated to the point of tears by Phil and Jason Masucci, but did not give up her son. The role of Joanne was played by actress Nancy Cassaro in only one episode, \"From Where to Eternity;\" thereafter the role was subsequently recast with actress Marianne Leone Cooper playing Joanne Moltisanti for the rest of the series.\n\n\"See separate entry\"\n\nCorrado was the father of Junior Soprano and Johnny Soprano and Tony Soprano's paternal grandfather. He emigrated to America from Avellino, Italy in 1910 and worked as a master stonemason. He helped to build a church in Tony's old neighborhood of Ironbound Newark, New Jersey, to which Tony occasionally brings his children, so that he can tell them about their heritage. Tony also recalls that when he was 13 his grandfather would let him play around on his construction sites, even allowing him to drive heavy machinery. Junior told a story about his old man smacking him in the mouth as a boy for refusing payment from a wealthy woman he helped. As punishment, Junior was forced to walk home, 11 miles away.\n\nErcole was Tony Soprano's late uncle, a brother of Junior and Johnny's who was born between them. Tony never met him and finds about his existence from Junior in \"The Happy Wanderer\". Ercole suffered from mental deficiencies and was institutionalized early in his life and his existence concealed. Junior explains that society did not understand these things back then, but praises his mother for making sure Ercole was taken care of. Junior also boasts to Tony that he and Johnny also paid for his care with their criminal proceeds. Ercole was named after Corrado and Johnny Soprano's grandfather (Ercole is Italian for Hercules) and shares the same name and nickname, Eckley, as former DiMeo family boss Ercole \"Eckley\" DiMeo. It is also reported that Ercole died not long before his brother Johnny Boy Soprano did, making his death presumably 1985 or 1986.\n\nTony Soprano's deceased father, the former captain of the Soprano crew. Johnny was married to Livia Pollio and they had three children: Janice, Tony, and Barbara. Johnny worked closely with his older brother Junior during Tony's childhood. They both went on to become capos in the DiMeo crime family. Johnny was well liked in the organization - boss Ercoli \"Eckley\" DiMeo was thought to be considering him to take over before his death. Sal \"Big Pussy\" Bonpensiero and Paulie Gualtieri were both in Johnny's crew. Bonpensiero stood up for Johnny in the unrest of '83 and Johnny's leadership led to Sal becoming a made man shortly afterwards. Both Sal and Paulie followed Johnny's wishes and supported Tony becoming capo after Johnny's death of emphysema. Johnny took Tony and his friend Silvio Dante under his wing and brought them up in the organization as part of his crew.\n\nJohnny made many road trips to Florida with Paulie Gualtieri, where Johnny had a piece of a dog track. On Paulie's first trip in the South, sometime during the early 1960s, when Johnny and Paulie were in a 1959 Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz in Georgia they were pulled over by a state trooper and Paulie, who was 20 at the time and had never been outside of New Jersey, was driving without a driver's license and worried about what to tell the trooper. Johnny told Paulie to tell the state trooper that his cousin was a state trooper and gave Paulie a southern-sounding name. When the trooper asked for the cousin's name, Paulie said 'Barney Fife'. The trooper then hit Paulie in the face, while Johnny laughed uncontrollably and resolved the issue by giving the trooper a one-hundred dollar bill.\n\nPaulie also told Tony that his father loved him very much and that the only time he saw Johnny cry was when Tony was born. Tony told Paulie that he \"never knew where he stood\" with his father.\n\nJohnny was only seen in flashbacks to Tony's childhood or in Tony's dream sequences. In 1969, Tony witnessed Johnny cut the pinky finger off of Mr. Satriale while Junior held him in place; Satriale was a gambler who was avoiding giving Johnny payment. This event contributed to Tony's first panic attack at the kitchen table that evening. Tony also saw his father and Junior attack Rocco Alatore over a debt, then recalled his father discussing a possible move to Reno, Nevada in 1967 to manage a supper club for Alatore (now on good terms with Johnny since the debt was repaid) and his mother refusing, a move that Livia would later sweep under the rug when Mr. Alatore later became a billionaire with his investments. It is revealed in the episode \"A Hit Is a Hit\" that Johnny was a silent partner in Hesh Rabkin's record company \"F-Note Records\".\n\nTony also witnessed Johnny plotting a scheme in 1967 at a children's carnival by bringing Janice along. Tony had originally thought that his father favored Janice over him, but later learned the truth, that mobsters brought their daughters to their meetings as a ruse. When Janice recalled the time Johnny shot through Livia's beehive hairdo while they were driving home, Tony thought the anecdote was shameful and made their family look \"dysfunctional\". Tony described his mother's relationship with his father as wearing him down to \"a little nub\"; for her part, Livia tearfully remembers Johnny as \"a saint\" several times. Johnny also kept a mistress named Fran Felstein, whom he had met during Tony's childhood. In 1976, when Tony was 16, Johnny stayed all night at her home when his pregnant wife was in the hospital. The next morning Johnny and Tony went to the hospital and Tony lied to his mother saying they went to a New York Yankees baseball game and stayed in New York. Livia saw through Johnny's lie and lost the baby due to bleeding.\n\nBy the 1980s, Johnny was a powerful and very well-respected capo, with his crew including Salvatore \"Big Pussy\" Bonpensiero, Paulie Gualtieri, Silvio Dante and his son Tony, among others. He held a controlling interest in Barone Sanitation, ownership of Satriale's Pork Store and co-ownership of Midget Horse Racing Track as well as having interests in horse tracks as far south as Florida. He also owned property in what is now Tribeca Square. Around this time, he had begun a friendship and business association with John \"Johnny Sack\" Sacrimoni, which would be inherited by Tony after his death. This longstanding friendship strengthened the DiMeo crime family's longstanding ties to the powerful Lupertazzi crime family in New York. \n\nIn September 1982, when Tony was 22 years old, and just two weeks before the birth of his granddaughter Meadow, Johnny ordered his son to murder a local bookie Willie Overall. This was Tony's first murder and it helped hasten his climb toward becoming a made man.\n\nJohnny died of emphysema in late 1986 at the age of 62. Not long before his death, he saw the incarceration of many of his fellow mobsters due to Fabian \"Febby\" Petrulio becoming a government witness; it is stated that he never recovered from the news of Febby's betrayal and it may have hastened his demise.\n\nThrough the various dream sequences and his therapy sessions, it appears Tony's relationship with his father was never as close as he presumed - an issue that Dr. Melfi attempted to engage but which was met with dismissal by Tony, who refused to delve deeply into his relationship with his father. What is clear is that Johnny Soprano exhibited many traits of a shameless narcissist who placed his own carnal desires above his family and used his own children as pawns in his criminal activities, a trait that Tony would somewhat copy by indulging in his own carnal appetites but not involving Meadow or AJ in his criminal activities.\n\nTracee was a young dancer who worked at the Bada Bing strip club. Her boss was Silvio Dante, the owner of the Bing, who extended credit to many of his dancers who wished to undergo breast augmentation. Silvio commented that Tracee had a nice body but poor teeth, and Tracee had run up a debt with Silvio for orthodontia to straighten her jagged teeth. Only 20 years old, she already had a son, who was taken by Child Protective Services after she burnt him with cigarettes. She blamed her abusive behavior on a \"lot of repressed anger\" which could be traced back to her own abusive upbringing. She was dating Ralph Cifaretto and got pregnant with his child. Her theme song at The Bing as a dancer was \"Living on a Thin Line\" by The Kinks. She drove a motorcycle. At The Bing, Ralph is seen having a threesome with Tracee, performing anal sex on her while she fellates a police officer in a storage closet.\n\nOne day at The Bing, Tracee expressed her thanks to Tony by giving him some homemade bread for advising her to take her sick son to the doctor, but Tony firmly reminded her that he was a superior like Silvio. This did not stop Tracee from seeking his advice on whether to have an abortion or to keep the baby. Tony gave his advice, although reluctantly, that taking her age and situation into account and with Ralph as the father, it would be best to get an abortion. Later, Tracee missed work, and Silvio hunted her down to find her waiting on Ralph hand and foot. As Silvio forced her into his car, he slapped her and threatened Tracee, telling her she is forced to be a dancer until the debt for her braces is repaid. Rather than confront Silvio about abusing Tracee, Ralph watched from the window laughing uncontrollably. A few days later, Tracee met Ralph at the Bada Bing VIP lounge, where she insulted him in front of the other associates and capos. Ralph followed her out to the deserted parking lot, where he teased her into thinking he would actually marry and support her. He then abruptly changed his tone and gleefully made snide remarks that her daughter would end up as a \"cocksucking slob\" just like her. Outraged, Tracee slapped him and insulted his masculinity, which led to Ralph brutally beating her to death. When Tony found out about this, he assaulted Ralph, violating a well-established Mafia code according to which made men were never to strike one another. Tony attempted to justify his actions by stating that Ralph \"disrespected the Bing\". When asked about his opinion on the incident by Tony, Silvio said that Tony would only have been able to physically retaliate if it had involved a mistress or a blood relative, because Tracee was neither, Ralph had a legitimate complaint against Tony and was owed an apology. Although Tony is disappointed that he cannot retaliate against Ralph, Silvio is also angry at Tracee's murder and says some punishment is justified, and tells Tony that Ralph is now banned from the Bada Bing.\n\nTracee's murder would have some effect on Tony's psyche, as he reports on the depression to Dr. Melfi, but lies that a teenage boy employed with Barone Sanitation died in an accident as Carmela was in joint therapy with him. During Thanksgiving dinner, when Tony sees Meadow in the kitchen, he has a momentary vision of Tracee, arguably as Meadow and Tracee were not that far apart in age. Tony apologizes for the recent rifts between them, and Meadow is more receptive, considering her recent breakup with Noah.\n\nSvetlana Kirilenko (Russian: Светла́на Кириленко) is the maternal cousin of Tony's ex, Irina, and is manager of a home health/nursing business. Irina has stated that she and Svetlana share a sister-like rivalry (e.g., Svetlana has a relatively stable life [a committed boyfriend; a career; self-confident; an independent nature], while Irina's is volatile [a series of temporary and tumultuous romances, no career; low self-esteem; dependent and emotionally fragile]). Svetlana's American fiance, who works for the New York Mets, is named Bill. During her childhood, Svetlana developed an osteosarcoma in her leg, which had to be amputated soon afterward.\n\nWe first see Svetlana after Tony's breakup with Irina; Svetlana contacts Tony after Irina's suicide attempt. Shortly thereafter she appears as the last in a series of home health nurses the Sopranos hire to care for Livia Soprano, after her primary caregiver and daughter, Janice, suddenly flees town in the aftermath of Richie Aprile's death. After Livia dies, Tony allows Svetlana to continue living in Livia's house, until she can find her own place to live. However, when Janice resurfaces to lay claim to Livia's house and valuables, Svetlana informs Janice that Livia had given her Livia's prized set of vintage phonograph records—which Janice coveted, and had planned to immediately sell on eBay. When Svetlana declines Janice's repeated requests to give her the records, anyway—alleging that they are \"a family heirloom\"—Janice vengefully steals and hides Svetlana's prosthetic leg. After Janice feigns ignorance of the leg's whereabouts but hints that the leg could reappear if Svetlana gives her the records, Svetlana sends two Russian mob thugs to attack Janice as payback. The thugs briefly strike Janice, and warn it could get worse if she does not cooperate. Sufficiently intimidated, Janice takes them to a bowling alley, where she surrenders the prosthetic leg, having hidden it in a locker.\n\nSvetlana resurfaces as a temporary replacement for Uncle Junior's nurse, Branca (who works for her), after he suffers a fall at the courthouse. One afternoon while Uncle Junior is asleep, Tony has sex with Svetlana on Junior's sofa; Branca arrives soon after they finish—both clothed, but disheveled, in the middle of a conversation in which Svetlana is trying to tactfully decline Tony's offer to expand their tryst into an ongoing affair. Branca takes in the scene but says nothing, while Svetlana displays a very guilty-looking facial expression. Irina soon finds out about this and informs Carmela about the affair, prompting Carmela's violent confrontation of Tony and their ultimate separation. Svetlana later tells Tony that Branca told Irina about their affair after an argument over Svetlana's withholding Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax and other taxes from her paycheck.\n\nTony admires Svetlana for her toughness of spirit, intelligence, and refusal to allow her disability and other random misfortunes to get in the way of her ambitions; he also thinks she looks like movie legend Greta Garbo. Svetlana is, arguably, the most (if not, only) psychologically well-adjusted of all Tony's extramarital sex partners.\n\nValentina lives in Fairfield in Essex County, New Jersey. She was Tony's mistress during seasons 4 and 5. Of Cuban and Italian descent, she was originally Ralph Cifaretto's girlfriend but was drawn to Tony after they met at Hesh's horse stable. Over lunch, she disclosed to Tony Ralph's sexual idiosyncrasies. The following day, Tony and Valentina have passionate sex in a hotel room where Valentina plays pranks on him when their lunch arrives; she begins dating Tony behind Ralph's back. Subsequently, after not being able to bear any more of Ralph's masochistic inclinations, she breaks up with Ralph and begins dating Tony exclusively, which Tony later reveals to Ralph. She believes it is good luck to step in horse manure before a race. As Ralph is rather preoccupied with his son's severe medical condition, he shrugs it off and is seemingly indifferent about it. In the Season Five episode \"The Test Dream\", after she pushes Tony to make a decision about staying with his wife or being committed to her, her robe catches fire while trying to cook eggs for Tony. Tony quickly extinguishes the fire, but Valentina suffers from second degree burns. Although it is soon discovered that Valentina will fully heal from the wounds and return to her beautiful self, Tony breaks the news to her that he is going back to Carmela.\n\nIrina is Tony's Russian mistress during the first two seasons. A native of Petrozavodsk, Russia, her father died at age 55 from lung cancer and cirrhosis of the liver after losing his job after the local factory closed. When her alcoholic parents died she lived with her uncle, whom Irina's cousin Svetlana calls a crude and miserable man, in Kazakhstan before moving to the United States. Irina works at the perfume counter at a local department store. Tony broke up with Irina in season 2 because she wanted him to commit to a relationship, but he could not because he was still married with children. Irina then attempted suicide but was found by her cousin, Svetlana. As a sign of friendship and apologies, Tony sent Silvio to tell her to move on with her life and present her with a one-time payoff of $75,000. In Season Four, when Assemblyman Ronald Zellman tells Tony that he has been dating Irina for quite some time, Tony does not care that she is seeing a new man. However, Tony later gets jealous and decides to take matters into his own hands. Tony humiliates Zellman in front of Irina by whipping him with a belt. Svetlana later tells Tony the couple had broken up because after the emasculating attack, Zellman \"could not perform.\" When Uncle Junior's nurse Branca, who works for Svetlana, walks in on Tony and Svetlana just after they had sex, she later tells Irina. Irina calls Tony's house, briefly speaks with AJ, and then tells Carmela that she is Tony's ex-mistress and informs Carmela of Tony's tryst with Svetlana. Carmela warns Irina never to call the house again, but the call prompts Carmela's violent confrontation of Tony and their marital separation. When Tony goes to confront Irina, Svetlana tells him that Irina is most likely hiding in Brighton Beach and reveals that Branca told Irina about their affair after an argument over Svetlana's withholding Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax and other taxes from her paycheck.\n\nJulianna is from Binghamton, New York and her parents own a catering business. She left home at seventeen because she said she didn't want to make Salisbury steak for the next twenty years. She nearly became Tony's new mistress as he recovered from his gunshot in 2006. They met because she was a realtor working for Century 21 and trying to purchase a building owned by Tony (Caputo's Poultry) in Newark, New Jersey. She was persistent in pursuing the deal, contacting Tony at Satriale's and the Bada Bing and over the phone. At the Bada Bing Tony first made a pass at Julianna but she told him she was going to exercise self-control and decline because she was engaged and everything was going well for her. Despite some misgivings eventually, her third offer was high enough for him to accept the deal; Tony arranged to meet her at home to sign the papers. When he arrived, they got business out of the way and immediately started kissing and began to undress one another. When the undressing reminds Tony of Carmela's devotion in taking care of him after his gunshot wound, Tony abruptly ends the encounter and walks out. Tony later spotted Julianna on a ride at the Feast of St. Elzéar but failed to get her attention.\n\nFollowing her rejection by Tony, Julianna went to an AA meeting. There, she met Christopher Moltisanti who was also in attendance and who remembered her from when she first approached Tony at Satriale's. He introduced himself after the meeting and invited her for coffee which prompted the beginning of an extramarital affair with Julianna. Tony reinitiated his pursuit of Julianna when they met to close the Caputo's poultry real estate deal and she was initially polite in declining any further contact with him. He arranged to meet with her on the basis of starting another real estate deal and this time she was more angry in rejecting his advances.\n\nDespite warnings from both of their sponsors, (Christopher and Julianna's relationship was enabling for the two recovering addicts) they began smoking heroin together. Christopher revealed to Tony his relationship with Julianna to avoid him investigating for himself and discovering their drug use. After a conversation about Christopher's disappointment with his life in organized crime (because of failure of others to live by the code of omertà), and their return to drug abuse, Julianna worried their relationship was ending and suggested they attend a meeting together. In episode \"Kennedy and Heidi,\" she attended Christopher's wake, encountering Tony and Carmela together as she came to pay her respects, where Tony accidentally introduced her as \"Julianna Skiffle\".\n\n\nGloria Trillo was a 40-year-old car saleswoman for Globe Motors, a Mercedes-Benz dealership in Fairfield, New Jersey. Tony asks his Uncle Junior, remembering back to his childhood if he knew a tradesman or building contractor with the last name Trillo, Junior vaguely remembers a stonemason or a building contractor named Trillo who had seven daughters. It is never revealed if this is the same Trillo family that Gloria is related to. She was also a patient of Dr. Melfi's. She met Tony Soprano at Melfi's office due to a scheduling mix-up; there was an immediate attraction between the two of them and within days they were having an affair. She tells Tony that she had \"killed\" seven relationships to date. Although she presented the facade of a strong and independent woman, Gloria is in fact mentally unstable and exhibits signs of Borderline Personality Disorder, which led to occasional violent arguments and physical altercations with Tony, bouts of severe depression and frequent suicidal thoughts. One such incident occurs after Gloria sees Tony's wife Carmela at her dealership, getting her car serviced, and offers to drive her home. After another clash, Tony is disgusted to realize Gloria has recognized him as a man capable of violence and is trying to provoke him into killing her as a form of surrogate suicide. Instead, he calls it quits and cuts off all contact with her and orders Patsy Parisi to threaten Gloria into staying away from him. Patsy accomplishes this by posing as a customer at the dealership and going on a test drive with Gloria; when they were out of the city, he pulled a gun on her and told her she would never see or talk to Tony or any of his family again, or \"the last face you'll see will be mine, not his. It won't be cinematic.\" This proves to be too much for unbalanced Gloria, and she resorts to suicide, hanging herself in her home just a few weeks later. Unaware of the relationship, Carmela --Tony's wife--informs Tony of her suicide in bed one night and he feels strong guilt and initially blames Dr. Melfi for Gloria's death, claiming that she did too little to save Gloria, but he also blames himself. Later, he comes to understand that Gloria was beyond salvation, and the relationship was a mistake from the beginning. An ongoing theme in their relationship was Gloria's use of the phrase, \"poor you,\" which reminded Tony of his mother and the toxic relationship he had with her.\n\n\"Father Phil\" is the priest at the Soprano's local Catholic church. Initially, Intintola and Carmela Soprano have a robust friendship based on a mutual love of romantic and \"indie\" movies, pseudo-intellectualism, and all things related to Classical European (especially Italian) culture. Tony Soprano finds their intimate friendship—and Father Phil's constant, uninvited visits to their home for Carmela's home-cooked food—threatening and irritating. Tony strongly suspects that Father Phil is in love with Carmela, and using their friendship to seduce her. Carmela denies this, saying she sees Father Phil only as a \"spiritual mentor\" she utilizes \"to become a better Catholic\", and, the rare male friend who appreciates things that the ultra-masculine Tony finds to be unmanly. One rainy evening, with Tony and Meadow in Maine and AJ away at a friend's house, Father Phil visits Carmela (who is sick), and the two share ziti and wine together. After lots of wine and watching a movie together, the two come dangerously close to kissing—and beyond—only for the mood and potential infidelity to be shut down by Father Phil's nausea (brought on by drinking too much); he sleeps over without having sex with Carmela, resulting in an awkward feeling between the two, the morning after. Carmela seems wistful and disappointed in Father Phil's inability to act on their mutual attraction in a way that she, as \"a good Catholic\" will not. Tony later finds out about this, and verbally taunts Father Phil several times. Carmela gets jealous when she makes a surprise, mid-week visit to the church to bring Father Phil a home-cooked specialty—only to see him already being fed a home-cooked dish by her best friend, Rosalie Aprile, and him having the same chemistry with her, that she thought he only had with her. Soon after, Carmela confronts and ends her friendship with Father Phil, accusing him of developing para-romantic relationships with women parishioners to gain gifts and other favors. After this, Father Phil is usually seen in the series celebrating Mass (particularly funerals), as a general attendee at Soprano family functions, and at charity functions coordinated by Carmela. Although Father Phil was mostly seen ministering to female parishioners, he also counseled men (e.g., he repeatedly invited Tony to attend church and confession more often, in order to reduce his anxiety attacks by improving his relationship with God, and turning away from the 'unrighteous path' of his 'business' activities). Another noted scene with Father Phil was when he counseled Ralph Cifaretto when \"Ralphie\" came to him devastated and perplexed by his teen son's life-threatening injury (after random, household play with a friend). Father Phil encourages Ralph to view the tragedy as an opportunity to change his life's course; he also gently rejects Ralph's assertion that God caused/allowed his son to be injured in order to punish Ralph for his criminal sins. Later in the series, Carmela confesses her adultery to Father Phil, who is disappointed and points out that although Tony is an adulterer as well, \"two wrongs do not make a right\". He orders Carmela to do a penance by way of doing something nice for Tony, which she later does. When Tony was comatose after being shot, Carmela was again dependent on Father Phil, as he is seen comforting her and the Soprano children who are at Tony's hospital bed.\n\nVic is a certified home contractor whom Carmela Soprano hired to wallpaper the dining room in her home. He is also the brother-in-law of David Scatino, the brother of Dave's wife Christine. He is a widower, his wife was a gourmet cook and died of breast cancer. They did not have children because Christine had problems with her womb. Carmela and Vic once kissed in the powder room Carmela is considering renovating and later made plans for a gourmet lunch date to be prepared by Carmela for Vic's next visit. However, after Vic discovers that Tony has taken over David's sporting goods store as a result of David's gambling addiction (which has subsequently left David bankrupt), Vic cancels his lunch date with Carmela by sending his assistant, Ramon, in his place to complete the redecoration while he finishes a job in Wyckoff, New Jersey. Vic is also seen meeting David Scatino at a bar. At first Vic tries to be supportive of David's problems, but after David badmouths his wife/Vic's sister Christine, Vic loses patience, ordering David to move away and to stay away from Vic's sister at all times; Vic also pledges to pay for Eric Scatino's college education, as David has also gambled away his son's college fund. Carmela and Vic later have an awkward meeting in a paint shop, but part on good terms as Carmela thanks Vic for assigning Ramon to finish her house, as she would have been too tempted to commit adultery, and Vic was being strong for the both of them.\n\nRobert Wegler had a relationship with Carmela Soprano while she was separated from her husband Tony. He was AJ's high school guidance counselor and they met through this relationship. It also proved to be their downfall as Wegler felt that Carmela was sexually manipulating him to improve AJ's college prospects. While having other close calls, Wegler was the only man that Carmela committed adultery with during the run of the series. He assigns AJ to read Death in Venice and Billy Budd for book reports and does very well impressing Tony. Meadow Soprano recognizes the signs of her mother and tells her suspicions to AJ, who does not believe her.\n\nRocco Alatore appears in flashbacks to Tony's childhood. Rocco Alatore was a neighbor to the Soprano family in the Ironbound neighborhood in Newark, New Jersey. Tony once witnessed his father and Junior attack Rocco over a debt, then recalled his father discussing a possible move to Reno, Nevada in 1967 to manage a supper club for Alatore (now on good terms with Johnny since the debt was repaid) and his mother refusing, a move that Livia would later sweep under the rug when Alatore became a billionaire with his investments.\n\nBoyfriend of Janice Soprano in 2001. Aaron was devout evangelical Christian which suited Janice's religious choice of the day (and would occasionally irritate Tony). They tried to make Christian rock music together. Aaron was also narcoleptic, causing him to fall asleep at inopportune times. He was also an occasional Sunday dinner guest at the Soprano residence, which he attended with Janice. He later appeared at the hospital while Tony recovered from his coma, protesting at a \"right to life\" protest rally.\n\nA young Asian-American patient at Junior Soprano's mental institution who becomes friends with and somewhat of an aide to Junior during his stay there. Carter helps Junior organize a card game between patients, aids him in writing a letter to Dick Cheney and provides diversions for him to avoid taking his prescription drugs. He is intelligent (a visitor references his time at M.I.T. and he once mentions being at the top of his class), but has serious anger management issues. He looks up to Junior Soprano as a role model and seems highly impressed by his authority and ability to influence and control other patients, all much to the disappointment of his visiting mother, who asks him to stay away from \"that gangster.\" Eventually, after Corrado comes to terms with his ailments and starts taking his medication, Carter becomes disillusioned and angry at Junior for this sign of defeat and betrayal to him, and gives him a beating.\n\nCarter's father is implied to have been very demanding of him, worked on Wall Street and was at one time subjected to news reports accusing him of something.\n\nDr. Cusamano's wife who is a stay-at-home mom. Friend of Carmela, but embarrassed and intimidated by the Soprano family's mafia connections. In \"I Dream of Jeannie Cusamano\", Tony told Dr. Melfi he had fantasized about Jeannie during a dream. In the same scene Dr. Melfi seems to indicate she is acquainted with the Cusamanos. Jeannie's twin sister, Joan (also played by Saundra Santiago), was harassed into writing a recommendation letter for Meadow's college application by Carmela in \"Full Leather Jacket\", although it's never made clear if she actually wrote the letter, or if Jeannie told Carmela it was written just to appease her.\n\nShe is described by Tony Soprano as the \"best friend\" of his mother Livia Soprano from when she was married to Johnny Soprano and was a regular attendee with Livia to Anthony Soprano Jr.'s birthday parties. Fanny cannot drive due to physical ailments brought on by her age and relies on Livia to drive her around. Livia accidentally hits her with her 1963 Oldsmobile 88 after driving her home, breaking her hip. Despite this, Fanny was one of the few people with something nice to say about Livia at her wake - that she always kept her informed when someone died.\n\nTony accidentally meets Fran at his parents grave-site. Based on John F. Kennedy's mistress Judith Exner and extremely attractive in her youth, she was the longtime mistress of Tony's father, Johnny Soprano, until his death in 1986. She worked as a saleslady in the fur department at Bamberger's, and is now losing her hearing, but admits she is too vain for a hearing aid. She recalls meeting Tony once, as a child. Tony's father even confided in Fran about the deleterious verbal abuse that Livia put him and their children through. Ironically, she was on a date with Junior Soprano at the 500 Club when she first met Johnny. Junior was also in love with Fran and wanted to propose, even buying a ring for her, but could not allow this marriage to affect his status in organized crime, and so could not bring up the courage to ask her. Tony learns that Livia forced his dad to give away his childhood dog, Tippy; it went to Fran and her son Bruce who is working for Israel's national airline El Al). She was briefly involved with President John F. Kennedy and allegedly had sex with him in the Oval Office. Tony secures her promised sale-share in a midget-car racetrack, which was co-owned by \"Johnny Boy\" with Hesh Rabkin and Phil Leotardo. While Tony originally enjoys her company, his fondness begins to wear thin, as she spends money, given to her by Tony, on expensive shoes rather than utilities, and then reveals that she continued to smoke around his father, even after his emphysema. Tony learns that his dad was with Fran on the night Livia was hospitalized for a miscarriage. Tony was even forced to lie to Livia, at the hospital, about his dad's \"attendance\" at a Yankee's game; this situation caused Tony much confusion and emotional trauma in his youth, and Fran is not seen for the remainder of the series.\n\nDov Ginsberg is one of Tony's financial advisors although as mentioned by Carmela, Ginsberg is actually a CPA. In the episode Everybody Hurts, Carmela's cousin Brian Cammarata, a finance expert, was advising Tony and Carmela about some finance planning but Tony decided to have a second opinion with Ginsberg which Brian fully approved. Later on at the horse track Ginsberg met with Tony and told him that the life insurance that Brian advised him was irrevocable and will only benefit Carmela when he dies. Ginsberg also told Tony that a life trust could be an alternative for him.\n\nGeorge is the father of AJ Soprano's one time friend, Jeremy Piocosta and an acquaintance of Tony Soprano. When AJ and Jeremy fight in school in 1999, Tony pays a visit to the Piocostas to get to the bottom of it. Although Tony is civil, and even clearly states that A.J. has a history of unruly behavior and may have instigated the fight, George becomes afraid that Tony will seek revenge and avoids contact with him. In 2001, George seems to have overcome his worries as he watches AJ's high school football game alongside Tony.\n\nRoberta was a long-term friend/mistress of Junior Soprano. He often took her down to Boca Raton, Florida on weekends and had set her up with an office job with the pipe-fitter's union. Roberta and Junior's relationship ended in 1999 when Tony got word from Carmela that his uncle performed cunnilingus on Bobbi, and Tony then made taunting references to this at a golf game. Bobbi had started the rumor herself by discussing her sex life at a nail parlor also frequented by Gaby Dante. Junior had warned Bobbi never to talk about this aspect of their relationship because it would cost him respect. Realizing that she had ignored his wishes, Junior stormed into her office and ended their sixteen-year relationship. Junior was so furious that Bobbi was afraid he would harm her, but in the end, he just fired her and smushed a lemon meringue pie in her face. In the following season, after Junior's release from prison into house arrest, he asks Bobby Baccala whether Sanfillipo has returned his call, indicating that Junior may have tried to reestablish their relationship. Baccala replies that she has not called and that she was very cold when he last saw her. Baccala also says that she was buying a garden fountain when he saw her, and Junior surmises that she must have bought a house. Junior smiles and recalls aloud his fondness for her.\n\nOwner of Satriale's Pork Store. We only see Francis in a flashback. He is a wholesaler who sells a variety of meat products. He is a successful independent neighborhood businessman who is familiar with the ways of the Mafia and is well liked and known in the neighborhood. Johnny Boy had known Francis for a long time and had been a regular guest at his house. Apparently, he owed Johnny Soprano a sufficient amount of money which he had received through Johnny Boy's loanshark operation. Johnny Boy informs him that he had been avoiding a meeting with him to discuss his overdue debt. Tony, as a youth, followed his dad to the pork store without his dad knowing. During one of Johnny Boy's final visits with Francis, he attempts to barter with Soprano by informing him of all the fine meats he had given Livia recently free of charge for compensation. Johnny Boy becomes enraged at Francis trying to barter his way out of his debt with the meat deliveries. There, Johnny Boy chopped off Francis' pinky with a cleaver. He half-heartedly apologizes to Francis in having been forced to inflict punishment upon him. In a later episode, \"...To Save Us All From Satan's Power\", Paulie mentions that Francis committed suicide with a gun. It is suspected that Francis committed suicide having been faced with being murdered over his large debt to Johnny Boy. Johnny Boy later is suspected of acquiring the business and therefore ultimately clearing his family of the debt brought upon them.\n\n\nDavid \"Davey\" Scatino is a childhood friend of Tony Soprano and Artie Bucco. He is often called Davey. He owns the local sporting goods store (Ramsey Sports and Outdoors) and his son, Eric, was a good friend of Meadow. Reluctantly, Tony allowed David to participate in a high-stakes poker game with full knowledge that he did not have the financial assets or poker savvy to win or break even. David quickly became heavily indebted to Tony. Tony took over his business, and took David's son's car as a down payment. The car was given to Meadow, but she quickly rejected it when she realized it once belonged to her friend. Having lost his life savings, his business, his son's college fund to Georgetown University, the respect of his family, and his wife (who divorced him), he decided to move out west to work on a ranch near Las Vegas. David was friends with Artie Bucco, Tony comparing Dave to Joe Namath and Artie to Y.A. Tittle.\n\nIn the Season 3 episode, \"The Telltale Moozadell\", Meadow informs Tony that David later went into a mental facility in Nevada, after a breakdown. Tony told David that he had subconsciously planned to profit from David's gambling habit, in accordance with his \"predatory\" nature. Tony later took offense when his other high school friend, Artie Bucco, became similarly indebted and suggested exactly the same thing, after Artie had attempted to commit suicide.\n\nYale is a hacky, untalented comedian whose act isn't well received. As part of his act he does impressions of Ed Sullivan and Bob Dylan. He is seen at Green Grove attempting to entertain the seniors, though none of them are listening, and also at The Bada Bing, which ends with his getting booed off the stage.\n\nRosalie Aprile's daughter. Kelli attended the funeral of her brother, Jackie Aprile Jr. and suggested that the Mafia was responsible for his death. Meadow Soprano chastised her for speaking of their family connections in front of an outsider and suggested that Kelli lacked loyalty.\n\nKaren was Bobby Baccalieri's wife until her death in a car accident in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey in 2002. They had two children, Bobby III and Sophia. Karen was friends with Carmela Soprano, Rosalie Aprile and Gabriella Dante and attended church functions with them. Bobby kept Karen's last baked ziti in the freezer for a long time following her death as he didn't feel ready to eat it. In the episode Calling All Cars, Janice Soprano becomes Bobby's girlfriend and Bobby finally feels comfortable enough to let Janice reheat the ziti.\n\nSon of Bobby Bacala and Karen Baccalieri, brother of Sophia Baccalieri. He is referred to as \"Bobby Jr.\" although his father is actually the second \"Bobby\". Bobby Jr.'s mother died in a car accident in 2002. He was often the victim of bullying from A.J. Soprano. After Bobby Jr.'s mother died, his father married Janice Soprano, who became Bobby's stepmother. Bobby Jr. was involved in the ride malfunction at the 2006 Feast of St. Elzear festival. His relationship with his father became more distant in his teenage years and he refused to play with his father's trainset and watch a Giants game with his father. Janice continues to use her manipulative skills with Bobby Jr. She controls his behavior by threatening him with a public reading of a report card to keep him home for Sunday dinner and to do his homework. Bobby Jr. cited A.J.'s behavior as a reason why he should be able to avoid family engagements. He was a fan of Massive Genius and likes the San Diego Chargers despite his father being a New York Giants fan.\n\nDaughter of Bobby and Karen Baccalieri, sister of Bobby Baccalieri III. Sophia's mother died in a car accident in 2002. Sophia's father later remarried and Janice Soprano became Sophia's stepmother. Sophia played soccer in school and Janice once got into a headline making altercation with another soccer mom at one of Sophia's games. In the series finale \"Made in America,\" now after the death of her father, it is revealed Sophia and her brother wished to live with their grandmother, which upsets Janice because she felt Dominica (Janice's daughter, Sophia's half-sister) was \"very much into her older sister.\" Janice then describes to Tony that her and Sophia \"actually have a bond\" when Janice expressed she wanted to live with her stepchildren. Whether or not Sophia and her brother became close to Janice is unclear; Janice is known for lying and judging from past episodes, Bobby's kids have always shown great contempt towards Janice.\n\nTony Blundetto's identical twin sons who spent time with him between his release from prison and death in 2004. Their father's sperm was smuggled out of United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners to impregnate his (now divorced) wife. In real life, in 2000, several mob associates at Federal Correctional Complex, Allenwood were convicted of smuggling sperm out of prison for exactly the same reason.\n\nTony Blundetto's estranged daughter, who lived with the Sopranos for an undisclosed period of time prior to the show. Tony Soprano told John Sacrimoni that he had spent the evening with Tony B. searching for her in Monticello, New York after she had allegedly disappeared again and was homeless and living with a crack cocaine addict. The grandmother has not seen her since Tony B.'s divorce following his incarceration. In one of the photographs at her grandmother's house, she is wearing an anarchist T-shirt. Kelly and Meadow attended school together briefly, although this is never discussed in the series and none of Meadow's friends ever mention her. The story was to provide him with an alibi for the killing of Joe Peeps. When Tony B. asks Meadow how his daughter did in school she replied \"Straight A's\".\n\nDaughter of Pat Blundetto and cousin to Tony Soprano, Tony Blundetto and Christopher Moltisanti. Louise helps her father move out of his home on the farm in Kinderhook, New York to a smaller place.\n\nAngie Bonpensiero is the wife of Sal \"Big Pussy\" Bonpensiero. They have three children, including sons Kevin and Matt, at college age in 2000, and daughter Terri, who was married and trying to conceive with her husband in 2000. Angie was unaware of her husband's status as an FBI informant. His disappearance when he was afraid his friends were on to him and subsequent erratic behavior created problems for their relationship. When she and Pussy were having marital problems, Angie considered suicide and divorce. She discussed this with her horrified friends Gabriella Dante, Rosalie Aprile and Carmela Soprano over lunch. She also revealed that she had been unwell since Pussy's return and had been investigated for cancer. Pussy had remained indifferent to her health problems and seemed more concerned about spraying WD-40 on his pocket knife. At Carmela's urging to stay true to her Catholic faith, Angie decided to move into a separate bedroom rather than end their marriage. Later, when Pussy arrives home and silently presents flowers to Angie, she smiles for a moment but then swats him with them.\n\nIn 2001, after Pussy \"disappeared\" for good, Angie believed that he had left her and decided to move on with her life. Tony continued to compensate Angie in her husband's absence - she used the money to buy a fancy new Cadillac but still complained to Carmela about her strained finances. As punishment, Tony damaged the car and took away her allowance. Soon, Carmela finds Angie giving out free samples at the local Pathmark and they lost contact. This likely moved Tony to forgive Angie, as he has since made her the manager of Pussy's body shop. After a long period of time without talking, she and Carmela decide to end their quarrel and go out to dinner where they both show off their new cars, with Angie showing how successful she has become running Pussy's Auto Body by buying a new Chevrolet Corvette. Shortly after the reconciliation Carmela learns that Angie is putting money out on the street via Patsy Parisi and Benny Fazio for shylocking and they are using their connections to help her with the body shop.\n\nDuke is Salvatore Bonpensiero's brother and a co-owner of the Body Shop. He runs the body shop alongside Angie Bonpensiero and helps repair Phil Leotardo's car. Edward is later extorted by Phil for his car repairs by refurnishing the Lincoln Town Car with an expensive front bench seat and brand new radio.\n\nKevin was one of Salvatore and Angie Bonpensiero's children.

He was enrolled in college in 2000 and visited home and played baseball at the batting cages with his father and A.J. He also talked philosophy with A.J. Soprano, offering to help out his father when A.J. first tried to relate Friedrich Nietzsche to Big Pussy. His father, who never enrolled in any philosophy classes, was at a loss until Matt told his father he better understood and would speak to A.J. about his concerns. He later broke up his parents fighting and got them back together.\n\nTerri is never seen, though she is Big Pussy's and Angie's oldest child and only daughter. It's mentioned she is attending Villanova University as well as her brother. She is married and has had difficulty conceiving a child. She is perhaps the same person as the Terri that is shown as a friend of Adriana La Cerva who helps her chose a wedding dress as well as tells her that a wife may be called on to testify against her husband (\"Watching Too Much Television\").\n\nGigi Cestone's wife. Tony Soprano offers his condolences to her at her husband's funeral. She did not know about her husband's gastrointestinal and heart condition that was helped brought on by the stress of dealing with Ralph Cifaretto as part of his crew, which Tony Soprano and others are told caused his heart attack. She is the mother of two children with Gigi that are never seen but are said by Gigi to be getting ready to go to college. She cooks Gigi and her children a huge Thanksgiving dinner and while Gigi likes her cooking, the amount of turkey and other food from the feast bothers his stomach for days afterwards, making Gigi comment, \"It's like spackle on my bowels.\"\n\nJustin's parents are divorced and his mother has since remarried.

Ralph Cifaretto's son who impales himself while playing with a bow and arrow with a friend while Ralph is in the bathtub. Ralph became very distraught over his son's serious injury, one of the few times he actually shows his true emotions to his criminal associates. He was injured while playing an archery game from J.R.R. Tolkien's \"Lord of The Rings\". Even with his son hospitalized and in the emergency ward recovering from the injury, Ralph still produced more illicit funds from his criminal enterprising than the rest of the Soprano crew. Ralph later tells Tony that he was in Florida for Justin's seventh birthday and was so high on cocaine that he forgot to call him and actually thought he did. Although Ralph has not been to church in a long time he did take Justin to have him baptized. Ralph may also have arranged to have the stables which held his and Tony's prized racehorse Pie-O-My set ablaze to pay for his son's overwhelming hospital bills, although Ralph denies this when Tony confronts him. It could be said that his son Justin's accident led to Ralph's death as Tony strangles him to death following an argument about the fire. Justin does not fully recover from the hospital before his father's murder and subsequent disappearance. When Tony visits Ralph after the stable fire though, Ralph mentions that only Justin's speech will be affected and that he'll have to learn to talk all over again.\n\nGabriella is the wife of longtime Soprano family soldier and consigliere Silvio Dante. They have a daughter, Heather Dante, who played volleyball and soccer with Meadow Soprano. She is close friends with Rosalie Aprile and Carmela Soprano and can often be seen dining out with them, typically at \"Nuovo Vesuvio\". \n\nIn 2006 when Tony was shot, Silvio became acting boss of the family.

The show mentioned her attending two different colleges after high school; The College of the Holy Cross, and Lackawanna College in the episode \"Christopher\". She was also mentioned again during the episode Unidentified Black Males.\n\nFather of Soprano crime family soldier Benny Fazio. Benny took his parents to dinner at Nuovo Vesuvio to celebrate their anniversary.\n\nMother of Soprano crime family soldier Benny Fazio. Benny took his parents to dinner at Nuovo Vesuvio to celebrate their anniversary.

Jen was pregnant with Benny's son in 2006. She attended a family dinner at Nuovo Vesuvio with Benny's parents, whom were celebrating their anniversary. Artie makes a table-side visit during their meal. In front of her, Artie makes a thinly veiled reference Benny's extramarital affair with Artie's former hostess Martina by asking Benny if he wants a \"Martina\", saying it is an Albanian martini, adding that \"Well apparently they go down real easy. Right, Ben\".\n\nJason is the son of Soprano capo Carlo Gervasi. He is seen in the second half of Season Six participating in a sports gambling ring at Rutgers University, along with Patsy Parisi's youngest son, also named Jason. There is never any indication of who his mother is or what happened to Carlo's wife \"Barbara\". When discussing A.J.'s suicide attempt Carlo thinks that Jason has occasional bouts of depression but does not really understand why. He displays violent tendencies common to violent psychopath behaviour displayed by Richie Aprile and Ralph Cifaretto, including torturing a welching gambler and beating a Somali cyclist. Throughout the series it seems Carlo has little to do with his son's life and does not discipline him. His behavior is initially admired but later seems repulsive to A.J. Soprano. In the series finale, Jason is arrested for selling drugs, forcing his father to turn against Tony Soprano and cut a deal with the FBI.\n\n\"Nucci\" is introduced as Paulie Gualtieri's elderly mother who is very nervous and protective of her son. When Paulie was younger, Nucci was always there to bail him out of jail and to defend him from the neighbors. After Tony had placed his own mother in the Green Grove Nursing Home, Paulie followed his lead and found Nucci a spot and she soon moved in. Unlike Tony's mother though, Nucci was grateful for Paulie for doing this for her. However, her old friends, Cookie Cirillo and Minn Matrone were far from friendly and tried to exclude her from social activities. To avenge his mother's honor, Paulie sent Benny and her grandson Little Paulie to badly beat Cookie's son, after which the two were forced to include her. Paulie later murdered Minn Matrone for her money. Nucci played an active role in getting Paulie to help Sal Vitro reclaim his landscaping business when Feech La Manna's nephew stole all of his customers.\n\nPaulie learns from his Aunt Dottie's deathbed that she is his mother and that Nucci adopted her nephew as her child. When Paulie hears this, he cuts off all contact with both of them, refusing to attend Dottie's funeral or pay for Nucci's accommodation at Green Grove. Nucci and Paulie reconnected at the Feast of St. Elzear festival - Nucci criticized Paulie for his involvement in organizing the festival as a ride malfunction had injured several children. Later, Paulie visited her at Green Grove (now paid for by her biological son) and they had a silent reconciliation. In episode \"Kennedy and Heidi,\" she died of natural causes, however her funeral was poorly attended, as a majority of the people went to Christopher Moltisanti's concurrent funeral, much to Paulie's ire as he felt Christopher always out-shined him in life, and even manages it in death.\n\nMinn was a friend of Nucci Gualtieri. Minn and her friend, Cookie Cirillo, didn't like Nucci very much, which Paulie resented. Her husband Salvatore was a barber accessories salesman for 46 years and attended the theatre every week. Minn is a fan of Stephen Sondheim. Minn was angry at Nucci when Nucci caused a car accident for the three friends while Minn was driving. She doesn't live at Green Grove but visits Cookie and the others, preparing to enter the facility after her hip surgery. Cookie mentioned that Minn kept her life savings under her mattress. Paulie heard this, and broke into Minn's house late that night. Paulie was looking for the money under her bed, but Minn caught him. Minn threatened to call \"his mother\" (Nucci), but he hung up the phone, trying to play it off as a misunderstanding. Minn saw through his act and kneed Paulie in the groin, and ran out of the bedroom screaming for help, but was chased down by Paulie in the hallway. Paulie threw Minn on the ground, and suffocated her with a small pillow. He left her dead body on the floor as he took the money.\n\nJoJo was the wife of Mikey Palmice - a soldier in Junior's crew and consigliere to Junior when he became boss. JoJo is a short form for the names Joanna, Joanne, Jody and Josephine although it is never known what her true name is because that is all Mikey refers to her as. She, like many other \"mob wives\", is aware of her husband's lifestyle. They have a turbulent relationship which is shown when her husband brings home a stolen food processor, and she comments \"yay, another kitchen appliance\". She fulfills the role of a subordinate housewife and is widely ignored, neglected and verbally abused by her husband, although it is never shown if Palmice physically harms her. It is suggested that she suffers from mental anguish or depression brought on by her husband's belittling behavior. However, as his wife she still loved him. Mikey was killed while out jogging, for attempting to kill Tony, leaving JoJo a widow. She appeared in the episode \"Pie-O-My\" after the death of the wife of Bobby Baccalieri, Karen. JoJo had brought food for Bobby to show her support at a difficult time. She had moved on from then. Janice Soprano had romantic ideas for Bobby and sensed a potential rival in JoJo so she took the meal to Junior's house to conceal it from Bobby, saying she made it herself.\n\nShe also has two children with Mikey, Michael Palmice Jr. and Francis Albert Palmice.\n\nDonna is the wife of longtime Soprano soldier Pasquale \"Patsy\" Parisi and sister-in-law to Phillip Parisi. She is occasionally seen accompanying him at family functions such as Furio Giunta's housewarming and Tony Blundetto's welcome home party. She very infrequently socializes with the other mob wives and does not appear to be part of Carmela's inner circle. In the series finale, \"Made in America,\" however, she is invited to the Soprano home with her husband to spend time and talk there due to Meadow Soprano now being engaged to be married to her older son Patrick.\n\nIt appeared in Season 6B that Jason Parisi, along with Jason Gervasi are associates of the DiMeo Crime Family. Jason is the younger son of Donna and Patsy Parisi and nephew of Phillip \"Philly Spoons\" Parisi. He is seen in the second half of Season 6, participating in an elusive professional sportsbook gambling ring at a coffee house in Rutgers University, along with Carlo Gervasi's son, also named Jason. Following A.J.'s attempted suicide Patsy Parisi reveals that Jason suffers from Attention deficit disorder. At Bobby Baccalieri's wake, when A.J. Soprano makes a speech about society he suggests that he and A.J. team up and go kill some terrorists. He displays violent tendencies common to mobsters, including torturing a welching gambler and beating a Somalian bicyclist. His behavior is initially admired, but later repulsive to A.J. Soprano. According to Patsy, Jason is a computer whiz and he built a website for his mother.\n\nPatrick is the son of Roberta Feliciano and Patsy Parisi, and the older brother of Jason Parisi. He is the nephew of Phillip Parisi. He is mentioned only in passing, but it is revealed that Patrick was Meadow Soprano's recurring \"mystery date\", and that the two have been dating since the premiere of \"Cleaver\". Tony and Carmela both have reservations about Patrick for reasons that are not disclosed, to which Meadow responds that he has changed. It is implied that he is studying or practicing law. In the series finale, Meadow announces her engagement to Patrick. Tony suggests that he have a frat party for himself and his friends at the Bada Bing and that he invite A.J. When he hears news about A.J.'s separation with his girlfriend he is pleased saying, \"I'm glad he switched back over to the other side.\"\n\nDeanna and Eugene Pontecorvo's daughter. Younger sister of Robby Pontecorvo. Eugene took Ally to Florida with the rest of his family on vacation when they were younger.\n\nEugene Pontecorvo's wife until his suicide in 2006. Deanna was eager to take the inheritance they received from the death of Gene's aunt and move to Florida. Her husband was unable to achieve this because his boss Tony Soprano refused his retirement request—as did the FBI. Deanna was frustrated with Gene's lack of progress with his work and not afraid to tell him so, contributing to his suicide.\n\nDeanne and Eugene Pontecorvo's son. He is the older brother of Ally Pontecorvo. Robert had a growing drug addiction which adds turmoil between him and his father. The drug addiction contributed as one of the major factors to his suicide.\n\nFrancesa Spatafore is the daughter of Vito Spatafore and Marie Spatafore and the younger sister of Vito Spatafore Jr. Francesa and Vito Jr. become estranged from each other after Tony Soprano has Vito Jr. sent off to boot camp in Idaho.\n\nMarie Spatafore is the wife of Vito Spatafore and mother of their two children Vito Jr. and Francesca who live in Belleville, New Jersey. She is also a cousin of Phil Leotardo and a friend to his wife - the two families eat dinner together. Marie accompanied Vito to the wedding of Allegra Sacrimoni. They left early and Marie remarked that Vito often behaved oddly at weddings. Despite his claims to be ill, she is not very surprised when he goes out later that night telling her he needs to make collections.\n\nMarie is loyal to her husband despite his homosexuality. When the crew are looking for Vito, Marie is visited by Silvio who quizzes her about their sex life, which she refuses to discuss, but seemingly confirms by her silence. She attended Phil's grandson's confirmation dinner despite the rumors about her husband. Phil himself is supportive of Marie but he discusses the need to find Vito with her. She tells Phil that Vito is a good father and a loving husband and she hopes that he will not be cast aside after his years of loyal service.\n\nMarie does not seem to have a close relationship with Carmela or the other Soprano family mob wives - although Carmela referred to her as a \"smart\" woman when she found out about Vito - implying that Marie must have known about his homosexuality. Carmela wonders whether they had an arrangement.\n\nWhen Vito phoned home from the road, Marie was not hostile towards him and, when he later returned to New Jersey after months of absence, she allowed him to see the children and seemed to consider his reconciliation overtures. When Vito was killed, Marie, now widow, was distraught again, insisting to Phil that Vito was a good father and a good man.\n\nIn 2007, her son Vito Jr. was seriously misbehaving, becoming a disturbing Goth delinquent, and Marie pleaded for Tony's financial aid to relocate their family to Maine to escape the judging neighborhood (condemning the family for Vito's sexuality), which she believed brought on his misconduct. When Tony was only able to scrape up money for a boot camp in Idaho (reportedly allowing corporal punishment against children), Marie had to painfully and tearfully accept the offer and let her son be forcefully taken to the camp by its agents.\n\nVito Spatafore Jr. is the son of Vito Spatafore and Marie Spatafore and the older brother of Francesca Spatafore. At a confirmation dinner for Phil Leotardo's grandson, Vito was teased by other children about his father's rumored homosexuality. When Vito Sr. called home from lamming it to avoid the consequences of being outed, he had a difficult conversation with his young son and asked him to look after his mother. He likes sports and is a fan of Vince Carter and the Miami Dolphins.\n\nAfter the death of his father, Vito became increasingly isolated and hostile, and started to dress and hang around with kids in the Gothic subculture. He frequently ran away from school, vandalized property and was expelled after defecating in the shower of his high school locker room. Both Tony and Phil sat down with Vito trying to set him straight, but he continued to act out. At wits end with her son's behavior his mother approached Tony asking for financial help to move to a new house in Maine so Vito Jr. could get a fresh start, but Tony, at that point deep in debt from gambling losses, pushed her into the cheaper alternative: a boot camp for delinquents in Idaho. Vito Jr. is last seen being forced out of his house by members of the boot camp in the middle of the night, who are going to transport him to the training camp in the West. As Vito Jr. is kicking and screaming he yells for his mom, who says this is for his own good, and cries out to him she loves him.\n\nMacKenzie Trucillo is the cousin of Kelli Aprile and Jackie Aprile Jr. It is not known whether she is a maternal or a paternal relative to the Aprile family.\n\n\nJim Witowski (also known as \"Johnny Cakes\") was Vito Spatafore's Polish-American gay lover and volunteer firefighter and local hero. Vito met Jim in New Hampshire after Vito fled New Jersey. Jim owned a diner in the New Hampshire town where Vito was staying and Vito was a frequent customer. While putting out a fire, he is seen running into a burning house and rescuing a small child, in which he receives applause when he takes the child to safety. Vito and Jim soon formed an attraction, though the two got into a fistfight outside a bar when Jim tried to kiss Vito and, still in denial about his homosexuality, Vito violently rebuffed him. Jim won the fight decisively. The two soon reconciled and Vito became Jim's live-in lover. Jim even professed his love for Vito one evening, and the pleasantry was returned by Vito to \"Johnny Cakes\". The pair enjoyed romantic dinners, and Vito buys a chopper motorcycle going on long motorcycle rides, and picnicking lakeside. Jim is the top and Vito is the bottom when the two lovers engage in sexual intercourse. Ultimately, Vito missed his family and fast-paced lifestyle back in New Jersey too much to stay with Jim. Vito left Jim's house early one morning to return to New Jersey while Jim was still asleep. Vito would later call Jim, but Jim was still angry over the way Vito had left and wanted nothing more to do with him. Vito was violently murdered soon thereafter.\n\nJim's nickname, Johnny Cakes, derives from a dish that he recommended to Vito when Vito initially came to his diner.\n\nJohnny Sack's son-in-law who feels intimidated by Johnny's mob leader reputation. Johnny insisted Eric call him \"Dad\" and paid for the lavish wedding of Eric and his daughter, Allegra.\n\nAngelo Garepe's son. He manages his own architectural salvage firm and is a successful business that makes Angelo proud.

Patty and Phil attended Allegra Sacrimoni's wedding together in 2006. Patty is friends with Marie Spatafore and the two families eat dinner together. Patty was also seen at the confirmation dinner of her grandson held at Da Giovanni. Patty was a factor in Phil's decision to kill Vito Spatafore after they discovered he was homosexual - she told Phil that Vito had to be made to face his \"sin.\" She offered little consolation to Marie at Vito's wake and was more upset about her tailor losing his sight. Patty accompanied Phil to the hospital when he first had worries about his heart and rushed him there when his heart attack occurred. She was at his bedside when Tony Soprano came to visit him. Patty was in the driver's seat when Phil was shot dead outside their car at a gas station in the series finale. After he's shot, she rushes out the door with car still in 'drive', and the doors locked, resulting in Phil's head being run over by the car.\n\nAlexandra is the daughter of Little Carmine Lupertazzi. She is seen attending the \"Cleaver\" premiere party with her family. Her father talks to her about the motifs the makers attempted to create in the film.\n\nThe wife of \"Little Carmine\" Lupertazzi. She is first seen at Carmine Sr.'s funeral. She is later terrified when her husband's boat is sunk right outside their home during the turf war with Johnny Sack. Her husband confides to Tony Soprano that Nicole had convinced him to exit the deadly turf war with Johnny Sack, as it was too dangerous and she did not want to become a \"the richest widow on Long Island\". Carmine also shared with Tony that he and Nicole had had domestic problems that they resolved with the help of marital counseling. She travelled with Carmine to France for a vacation and saw Nicolas Fouquet's Vaux-le-Vicomte chateau.\n\nGianna was the wife of Lupertazzi crime family capo Rusty Millio until his death in 2006.

Rusty does not like being asked to perform simple household chores like going shopping for groceries and other routine tasks.\n\nJohnny Sack's Jewish lawyer. He first tells John that he and his firm does not represent turncoats. John tells him that if his law firm represented turncoats then he would lose all his customers. He advised John to cooperate to avoid a life sentence, to which John rejected by saying that a rat-mobster is like being a Nazi to Ron's people. Ron later tries to come to an agreement with the prosecutor, to which she replies, \"Get back to me when you're sober, Ron.\" John and Ron make a plea agreement for several millions in assets and fifteen-years in exchange for John's allocution, to which Ron encourages John to take saying, \"You're still a young man. In fifteen years you'll be sixty-seven. The golden years.\"\n\nJohnny and Ginny Sack's daughter. During the series run she became a registered nurse, and Tony is seen giving her an envelope of cash as a present for graduating from nursing school. Johnny paid for her lavish wedding to Eric DeBenedetto while Johnny was in prison awaiting trial. Johnny was released to attend the wedding and Allegra was ecstatic that her father would be in attendance, but the judge's conditions meant that Allegra had to put up with metal detectors and US Marshals at the ceremony and reception. Her reception ended on a low-note with her departing limousine being blocked in by the Marshals' SUV's, her father breaking down in tears as he was forcibly led away in handcuffs, and her mother fainting in the crowd. As soon as Ginny fainted, Allegra rushed to her mother's side to check her well-being. She attended her father's trial for racketeering and was present when he was convicted. Ginny described difficulties in her relationship with Allegra to friends - she knew that Allegra felt Ginny was not happy for her and acknowledged it was difficult for Allegra to visit the house with her father imprisoned. Allegra was at her father's side, along with her mother and older sister, when he died of lung cancer in a prison hospital.\n\nJohnny Sack's daughter. Catherine complains that her family always talks about food and is at odds with her mother and sister in terms of appearance; Catherine looks almost underweight, whereas her mother is extremely obese and her sister is overweight. Catherine attended her father's trial for racketeering and was at her father's side, along with her mother and sister, when he died of lung cancer in the prison hospital.\n\n\nAlso known as Ginny Sack, she is the wife of John \"Johnny Sack\" Sacrimoni and the mother of Catherine and Allegra Marie Sacrimoni. Once a slender professional dancer, Ginny has struggled with her weight since having children. John's love for her seems genuine and blind to her size. In fact, he likes her as she is, \"Rubenesque\" as he described her, although she is much heavier than the term \"Rubenesque\" implies. Ginny's ample figure is the subject of numerous jokes by members of the Soprano crime family, and this leads to a serious dispute between her husband and Ralph Cifaretto. Johnny is willing to kill to defend her honor and viciously attacks a member of Ralph's crew, who Johnny mistakenly believes was telling jokes at Ginny's expense. John sometimes becomes angry with Ginny, particularly when she lies to him (as when he once found her sneak-eating hidden candy) but he is usually quick to forgive her. John's discovery of Ginny's secretive binge-eating made him realize he was too hard on the guys who made the joke about his wife.\n\nGinny was proud to attend her daughter Allegra's wedding and ecstatic when Johnny was allowed to attend, despite being in prison awaiting trial. Her day ended on a low note when US Marshals blocked her daughter's departure and dragged her sobbing husband off in handcuffs. This proved too much for Ginny, who fainted.\n\nGinny turned 50 in the episode, \"Moe n' Joe\", and her friends Carmela Soprano, Angie Bonpensiero, Gabriella Dante, Janice Soprano, and Rosalie Aprile attended a birthday celebration at her home. She discussed some difficulties with Allegra, who felt Ginny was not happy for her marriage. Gabriella pointed out that Allegra may just have been shocked to be less happy than she had expected to be as a newlywed.\n\nGinny was in court when Johnny admitted his involvement with the Mafia and received a 15-year sentence for racketeering. Ginny was forced to move when John arranged the sale of their home to Janice Soprano as part of an agreement with Tony to try to secure capital, for his family, following the asset seizures that came with his conviction.\n\nGinny visited her husband John in prison when he was diagnosed with cancer, and was at his side with their two daughters when he died. Tony mentioned, in passing (in the episode \"Remember When\") that Ginny had taken a job running an office, selling insurance.\n\nDenise Borino, who portrayed Sacrimoni, received the part in a 2000 open casting call. She died of cancer on October 27, 2010.\n\nYaryna is Phil Leotardo's Ukrainian mistress and also his maid, working for him and his wife. In 2006, she was with Phil when Benny Fazio bombed Phil's Brooklyn wire room. Yaryna and Phil were knocked down by the blast.\n\nIn 2007, in the episode \"The Blue Comet,\" Yaryna and her father are murdered in a case of mistaken identity. Her father, who resembles Phil a lot, was mistaken for him and shot by an Italian hitman working on orders from Tony Soprano. Yaryna witnesses her father's death and she herself is shot multiple times. She falls down the stairs and lies motionless while the hitman stands above her body and shoots her in the head to make sure she is dead.\n\nMeadow Soprano's one-time fiancé. The two met at Columbia University and began sharing an apartment together in her sophomore year (2002). Little is known of Finn's family life except that he is originally from Mission Viejo, California. Unlike Meadow, he is only part-Italian. Upon finishing college, Finn enrolled in dental school. For a brief period in the summer of 2004, Finn worked at a construction site run by the Aprile crew, a job Tony Soprano got for him. Finn struck up a friendship with the daughter of the site manager. One morning as he arrived very early to work, he saw Vito Spatafore fellating a security guard in a parked vehicle. Finn talked to Meadow about what he saw but she promised to keep his confidence. After Vito tried to intimidate Finn into attending a San Diego Padres and New York Yankees game with him, Finn panicked and decided to leave town before Vito came after him. Meadow was saddened and angered when Finn packed a suitcase without telling her or inviting her to accompany him and they argued. During the argument and when Meadow talked about a commitment, they decided to get engaged.\n\nIn 2006, Finn returned from dental school to support Meadow while Tony was in a coma and, he admitted, to escape dental school, which he disliked. He had to face Vito again and Vito behaved in a predatory and flirtatious way towards him. Finn accompanied Meadow to Allegra Sacrimoni's wedding but seemed uncomfortable when the festivities prompted questions about their own wedding plans.\n\nWhen Vito was spotted in a gay bar by two New York crew members making a collection, Meadow revealed Finn's secret to her mother and Rosalie Aprile. Then Carmela insisted Meadow tell her father. A visibly frightened Finn was brought to Satriale's to give his account of what he saw and his subsequent encounter with Vito to the senior members of the Soprano crime family. Finn's \"testimony\" proved highly significant in cementing the crew's belief that Vito was homosexual, since Finn was seen as a neutral party with no reason to lie.\n\nLater, Meadow complained to Tony that she was having difficulties in her relationship with Finn. Finn attended a Sunday dinner shortly after this conversation. Meadow and Finn later broke up, as revealed in another Sunday dinner conversation, the implied reasons being that Finn was \"abnormal\".\n\nMeadow Soprano's successful, star soccer coach and associate of Tony, Silvio, and Artie because of his involvement in coaching their children. Coach Hauser is a father himself with a daughter around Meadow's age and is married to a woman named Shelley. He was well liked by the fathers of kids in his team because of the success he brought them on the playing field. He tells Paulie that he has friends in law enforcement. He once had drinks with Tony, Silvio, and Artie at the Bada Bing club but refused Silvio's offer to go in the \"VIP Room\" with a stripper-prostitute. However once it was revealed Coach was leaving for another job at an exclusive academy for girls to head their team, the Soprano family began trying to intimidate him into staying. Paulie delivered a large screen television to his house and insisted he take it. Christopher returned his \"missing\" golden retriever - probably after taking it himself. He says that the \"gifts\" will not sway his decision because he has already decided to accept a coach position for the girls' team at the University of Rhode Island in Kingston. Meadow later revealed to her father that the coach had a sexual relationship with Ally Vandermeed, one of her peers who was a star soccer player on the team. Ally attempted suicide by cutting her wrists because of his trying to end the relationship by telling Ally he won't leave his wife for her. Tony, after an impassioned plea for temperance by Artie Bucco, decided against being a vigilante, and the coach ultimately was arrested by authorities for the statutory rape of Ally.\n\nMeadow Soprano's roommate at Columbia University. Caitlin hailed from a small town in Oklahoma (she wears a Bartlesville High School sweatshirt). At first, she seemed to enjoy New York City and college life, at one time dancing in her underwear in front of Meadow after a night out drinking. However, she has manic-depressive disorder and frequently annoyed Meadow and the dormitory Resident Assistant and Meadow's boyfriend, Noah Tannenbaum, with her troubles. She went out with them for her birthday and had an anxiety attack after seeing a homeless woman with newspaper in her buttocks. When Meadow was away, she annoyed Noah while he was writing a term paper, causing him to get a bad grade and later, inspiring Noah to get his attorney father to file a restraining order against her. She practiced cutting and pulled out her own hair. At a fraternity party, she sees Jackie Aprile Jr., who gives her ecstasy, which temporarily alleviates her depressive symptoms. Caitlin tells Jackie that she has a crush on him, then states to Meadow how handsome Jackie Jr. is and how lucky Meadow is to be dating him. Caitlin becomes aloof during the party, while high on ecstasy, and agrees to have sex offscreen with another frat boy at the party. Later she is shown comforting Meadow after her breakup with Jackie Jr., now appearing more emotionally stable.\n\nHunter is a good friend of Meadow Soprano. Her father is an advertising executive who Meadow thinks has a phony personality. In her younger years Hunter suffered from bulimia. She sang with Meadow in the school choir and the two hounded Chris to buy the speed to help them study. She had a crush on Brendan Filone shortly before his death and even wrote a poem for him. She attended the house party that was raided by the police at Livia Soprano's house after she had moved to Green Grove Retirement Community. Tony Soprano gives her the nickname \"Janet Jackson\" because of her wardrobe. Later she was accepted to Reed and visited Meadow just after she started there. Hunter drank with the soccer team around the time that their friend Ally Vandermeed tried to kill herself. In the final episode of the series, Carmela finds her talking to Meadow in her bedroom and casually mentions her expulsion from college. She has an aunt and uncle that are graduates of SUNY Purchase. Carmela is then quietly dismayed to learn that Hunter sorted her life out, went back to college at SUNY Purchase, and is now in medical school after graduating, which Carmela and Tony had hoped Meadow would enter.\n\nMeadow Soprano's first boyfriend at Columbia; they met during a film course. Noah is from Los Angeles. His father, an entertainment attorney for various celebrities and Hollywood notables, is Jewish and his mother is African American. \"Noah Tannenbaum\" was originally going to be the stage name of Brooklyn-born singer Neil Diamond. Noah first appears visiting the Soprano home with Meadow to view a movie for a class project. Being a film buff, Noah thought he had common ground with Tony when he observed video equipment at the Soprano residence. He told Tony that, just like him, he is a big fan of Howard Hawks movies. Noticing that Noah was pursuing Meadow, Tony asked Noah a few questions about his ethnic background. Upon confirmation of Noah's African American heritage Tony attempted to intimidate Noah into staying away from Meadow, hurling racial slurs and ordering Noah to stay away from Meadow in the process. Following this heated discussion Noah leaves the house in a huff. The next time Meadow brought him to the house Noah refused to get out of the car. Tony expressed his displeasure with Meadow for having any kind of relationship with him, starting a lengthy feud between Tony and Meadow which ultimately drove Noah and Meadow closer together. Later, after a visit from his father, Noah broke up with Meadow, saying she is \"too negative\" about things, though it was implied the real reason was pressure from his father due to Tony's criminal activities.\n\nA high school and grade school friend of Meadow Soprano and one of the star players on the team. In grade 11 she played on the soccer team alongside Meadow and had a sexual relationship with their coach, Don Hauser. Her father works overseas in Europe. Her mother, following the news of Ally's sexual abuse is perscribed sedatives and Charmaine Bucco tells Artie that she has become \"useless at home.\" Her parents are divorced and she is said to have tried committing suicide before. The relationship caused her to become anti-social and withdrawn from schoolwork and Meadow. Ally tried to kill herself by slicing her wrists displaying characteristics of having self-harm disorder after the coach took another job elsewhere, but her friends found her and she survived. Meadow later had her over for a sleepover while she was recovering from the suicide attempt. Coach Hauser was arrested for the statutory rape of Ally. She sells cigarettes to Meadow and her friends on the soccer team.\n\nA.J.'s high school principal. He caught A.J. and his friends both times they broke into the school. When A.J. and his friends destroyed the pool area and trophy display, Cincotta found the remains of a pizza with a custom topping selection only A.J. was known to order. When A.J. and his friend urinated on a wall and then stole the answer key to an exam, Cincotta got them to talk by pretending he had got their DNA from urine samples taken from the scene.\n\nAn ex-girlfriend of Hernan O'Brien, whom A.J. meets again in the Psychiatric hospital while recovering from his suicide attempt. They hang out together and, when they begin to have intercourse in the woods in A.J.'s Nissan Xterra, the vehicle's catalytic converter sets fire to the dry leaves below it and A.J. and Rhiannon scramble out; the truck explodes soon afterward. A.J. later tells his parents that Rhiannon, now his girlfriend, doesn't want him to join the Army. A.J. is shown picking up Rhiannon from high school in his new BMW M3 after a day of work at his new job, on the production team for a film bankrolled by Little Carmine. Rhiannon is a junior at Montclair High School.\n\nEgon was the best friend of A.J. when they attended Verbum Dei School. He plays varsity football at Verbum Dei and has orthodontal problems. Egon, like A.J., was also a troublemaker, having joined in with A.J. and several other children to trespass into the school's swimming pool when it was closed for the night and vandalize it by smashing trophy cases and throwing articles into the pool. Unlike A.J., Egon was not punished for the rampage as A.J. refused to rat out Egon and took the entire blame. Egon was also a poor student like A.J., and both boys were in danger of failing their geometry classes, a problem they sought to solve by breaking into the school after hours, this time to see an advance copy of the mid term exams and memorize the answers. Both are discovered by the headmaster of Verbum Dei when their superior test scores are reported as a suspicious improvement. While A.J. manages to evade the headmaster's intimidation, Egon breaks down in tears, revealing the cheating. Due to his prior disciplinary record, Anthony Junior is expelled from Verbum Dei. Egon's disciplinary record, as well as his ultimate punishment for the break-in and subsequent cheating, is unknown, although the audience is given a strong impression he was kicked out of Verbum Dei alongside A.J.\n\nHernan is an Irish-American school acquaintance of A.J. Soprano. After they graduated, Hernan and A.J. become friends and they often go clubbing in New York after A.J. dropped out of college. Hernan seems to use A.J.'s fame as a relation of Tony's to chat up girls and bathe in the reflected glory of his minor celebrity status. He is the ex-boyfriend of Rhiannon Flammer, who, in the episode \"The Blue Comet,\" starts dating A.J.\n\nA.J.'s WASP girlfriend in seasons four and five. Devin is from an even wealthier family than A.J. and this causes a little friction between them when he first finds out about it. A.J. and Devin had visited the Soprano home and been to see Meadow at the South Bronx Law Center that day to look for a quiet place to make out. This had prompted A.J. to discuss the injustice of his family's wealth. When discussing Devin with his friend Patrick, A.J. says that he thinks she is ready to have sex with him. Devin attended the party that A.J. organized when he was in high school. She shares the same last name as Charles Alfred Pillsbury and John Sargent Pillsbury, the founders of the Minneapolis flour and grain company.\n\nJeremy was a friend of A.J. Soprano and attended a summer camp with him. In 1999, their relationship had soured and A.J. and Jeremy had a fight in school after A.J. sent a text message to Jeremy insulting his mother. They argued again shortly after this and agreed to fight at \"the pit\" so they wouldn't get broken up. Jeremy's father, George, had a chance encounter with Tony Soprano on the same day and fled, fearing Tony was seeking revenge on his son's behalf. On arriving at the pit, Jeremy said he could not fight A.J. and instead offered money to replace a shirt he had damaged in their first encounter. His last name is taken from Pio Costa Enterprises situated in Fairfield, New Jersey.\n\nBlanca is A.J. Soprano's Dominican girlfriend, whom he met while working at the construction site. Blanca is an administrator at the site and is also responsible for making payments to Paulie Gualtieri. Blanca has a 3-year-old son named Hector from a previous marriage and lives in an apartment building in South Passaic. She attended Christmas celebrations at the Soprano family home and met A.J.'s parents (Tony and Carmela Soprano), who were initially skeptical about the relationship for several reasons: she was not Italian, she was ten years A.J.'s senior, and she was a single mother, but they ultimately accepted it because she was Catholic like they were. Blanca lives in a neighborhood that had been disturbed by a youth gang, which A.J. steps up to deal with. He convinces the gang members to move on by bribing them with a bicycle. A.J. eventually proposes marriage to Blanca and she accepts, but later changes her mind and ends the relationship, sending A.J. into an emotional downward spiral that lasts for several episodes. Later while in therapy, A.J. is asked by his therapist if his feelings about Blanca parallel his feelings about a Somali boy who was beaten by classmates in front of him. A.J. initially objects vigorously to the analogy on account that \"she's not black\" but later reluctantly admits that she is \"very tan\". A.J. also explores with compassion that Blanca's son barely talks because she cannot afford to send him to a better school. He contrasts that and other ills and inequalities in the world with the luxury in which his parents live.\n\nMatt is a friend of A.J. Soprano's. Matt attended the party that A.J. organized when he was at high school. While attending a Soprano family dinner with Ralph Cifaretto, he tells Ralph that he's half Jewish. Later, he works in the local branch of Blockbuster with A.J. He shares the same last name as real life Philadelphia crime family mobsters Phil Testa and his son Salvatore Testa. He sold in-store movie advertisement merchandise from Wallace and Gromit with A.J., against store policy making $500 off standee.\n\nPatrick is a close friend of A.J. Soprano. Patrick seems to be very curious of A.J.'s life as the son of a mobster, assuming his house resembles that of \"The Godfather Part II\"s. He seems even more impressed with Devin's father's art collection that includes paintings by Pablo Picasso and a mint condition vinyl of \"Rubber Soul\" when he and A.J. both visit her mansion.\n\nA screenwriter and an associate of Christopher Moltisanti from rehab. He moved from New Jersey to Hollywood and was successful in \"The Business\" owning a BMW Z3, being a member of the Screen Writers Guild and having a girlfriend that was an actress. He became addicted to heroin, cocaine and alcohol and later lost his job after not completing a script for \"Nash Bridges\". He later went to a rehabilitation clinic in Pennsylvania (where he first met Christopher) and was successful in turning his life around. He was awarded an Emmy and a Humanitas Prize for his earlier screen writing. He had written for \"Nash Bridges\", \"\" (a reference to Tim Daly's role as Superman), \"Law & Order SVU\" and wrote an episode of \"That's Life\".\n\nJ.T. dabbles in gambling and places horse bets with Christopher and finds a fondness for high-price poker games. J.T. borrows money from Christopher to play high-stakes poker and their friendship is effectively ended when he fails to pay it back on time. Little Paulie Germani and Chris beat J.T. up in his home and confiscate his BMW as a partial payment for his debts. Despite the beating, Chris later resumes their \"friendship\" when the debt has caused J.T. to relapse. As J.T. Dolan is enrolling in rehab again, Chris freezes the debt and assures J.T. that he will return to prosperous screenwriting. Later, as J.T was working as a full-time professor of a writer's class \"The Writer's Block\", Chris has J.T. forcibly abducted by \"Murmur\" and Benny Fazio and offers to clear the gambling debt if J.T. writes a screenplay for his feature movie project. J.T. agrees and writes the script for \"Cleaver\", a slasher horror film, from a story by Christopher, working on the film closely with Moltisanti and Carmine Lupertazzi Jr. who is its co-executive producer. However, when the film gets made in 2007, at its premiere, Christopher does not acknowledge Dolan's contributions to it when talking to the audience, leaving him embarrassed in front of his female companions. Also, the film's character, mob boss Sally Boy, upsets Tony Soprano for his apparent similarities to his person and Christopher attempts to do damage control when he orders J.T. (by hitting him over the head with his Humanitas prize) to tell Tony the character was his idea. J.T. does as instructed and spins a tale to Tony about plagiarizing the character from an old movie, but Tony remains unconvinced, particularly when he notices the cut on J.T.'s head.\n\nWhen Christopher relapsed again in 2007, after his latest feud with Paulie Gualtieri and assumed ridicule and disrespect by the crime family, he attempted to find comfort by talking to J.T. one late night, as his current sponsor was out of town. J.T. was cold and unreceptive, angry at his unannounced intrusion and under pressure to finish a script deadline for a show. Heavily drunk, Christopher said that he had seen and done terrible things and started hinting his knowledge of mob crimes. J.T. angrily tried to get Christopher to stop talking about them, suggesting that he did not want to know. After J.T. exclaimed \"Chris, you're in the Mafia!\", Christopher walked away, then turned and shot him in the head, killing him instantly.\n\nTina was the Italian American girlfriend of DiMeo crime family associate Salvatore \"Mustang Sally\" Intile. She inadvertently caused the beating of Bryan Spatafore by urging him to give her a ride \"The Point\" (Hunt's Point,Bronx) following an argument with Intile but Bryan was on his way to a job in Teaneck, New Jersey. Salvatore complains that after listening to her answering machine he is always hearing a different man's voice, making him believe that Tina is cheating on him, which she does not answer. Tina's association with the DiMeo crime family continued as a friend of Adriana La Cerva and she was expected to act as maid of honor in her planned wedding to Christopher Moltisanti. Tina upset Adriana by constantly flirting with Christopher and Adriana retaliates by using her role as an FBI informant to reveal that Tina had been embezzling funds from the shopping service she works for. The consequences of this revelation are unknown, but we do see FBI agent Robyn Sanseverino writing down the information, and Tina subsequently vanishes from the show.\n\nLiz is the mother of Adriana La Cerva. Liz was born Elizabeth Aprile and is a sister of the late Jackie Aprile Sr. and Richie Aprile and sister-in-law to Rosalie Aprile (see family tree). Liz was never a big supporter of Adriana's relationship with Christopher Moltisanti and Ade often stayed with her following arguments or domestic violence. Following Adriana's disappearance in 2004, Liz was visited by the FBI who informed her that her daughter was believed to be dead and that they suspected Chris's involvement. When Carmela Soprano encountered her at the 2006 Feast of St. Elzear, Liz, having become convinced of her daughter's murder, was already showing evident signs of depression: she had stopped taking care of her appearance and later attempted suicide. Carmela visited her in the hospital, but Liz appeared to be unconscious at the time.\n\nAmy was a woman engaged to Christopher Moltisanti's lawyer cousin Gregory Moltisanti from Essex County, New Jersey. Her father is a neurosurgeon at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. She was pre-Med at Yale University during her freshman year. Amy says that she has also worked with Quentin Tarantino and says that they are \"friends\" and also friends with Vince Vaughn. She met with Christopher because of his interest in scriptwriting and the two had a brief affair while she is in New York filming a Janeane Garofalo and Sandra Bernhard lesbian spy movie. She was a Vice President of a movie development company and worked with real-life movie director Jon Favreau, with whom she also put Chris in touch. She is the official script writer for Favreau and once read a movie script submitted by Billy Bob Thornton to Favreau for her input which was rejected. Amy is helping Favreau do an autobiographical movie of mobster Joe Gallo. She ultimately turns down Christopher's script for a semi-autobiographical account of his life in organized crime.\n\nRichie was an ex-boyfriend of Adriana La Cerva and her childhood neighbour in New Jersey. Richie was always a songwriter and musician but had changed his approach to life, giving up hard drugs and switching from glam metal to alternative rock, after an accident involving him receiving a near-fatal electric shock by a downed power line and receiving third-degree burns while high on heroin. When not writing or playing music he works at Kinko's. Richie changed the name and genre of his band, \"Defiler\", to an alternative rock band called \"Visiting Day\". A recording studio engineer criticizes Richie for having no choruses in his songs, instead just having another verse. He had previously recorded music in Denmark. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings regularly. He does not like The Beatles. His 3-person band uses an array of instruments including a ukulele. Richie reconnected with Adriana when she began to pursue a career in the music industry and her new boyfriend Christopher Moltisanti bankrolled her efforts to produce a demo tape for Richie's band. Richie and the rest of the band had a hard time in the recording sessions and refused Christopher's offer of amphetamines to aid the process, unwilling to risk relapsing into his old habits. Chris eventually became so frustrated with Richie that he beats him with his own guitar. Ultimately, Chris decides to abandon the project, much to the chagrin of Adriana, who still believes they could make the big time. Richie and his band weren't mentioned again during the show's run.\n\nHe is a West African physician who specializes in neurology. Dr. Ba is responsible for checking Tony's neurological functions after Tony suffered a gunshot wound, inflicted in 2006 by his uncle Corrado Soprano.\n\nDr. Bilal is an emergency room (urgent care) physician who treats Phil Leotardo in \"Kaisha\" when he experiences chest pains. Dr. Bilal runs blood tests and they do not show the usual chemical markers of cardiac distress so he sends Phil home. However, the pains return much worse later that evening, and Phil's wife rushes him back to the emergency room, where he collapses in Dr. Bilal's arms. \n\nTony Soprano's neighbor and family physician. His main field is internal medicine. He referred Tony to Dr. Melfi, who is a personal friend whom he entertained at his home at a dinner party. He and his wife, Jeannie Cusamano, have a dog, Esterhaus. He once invited Tony to play golf with him and some friends but Tony was upset that they only seemed interested in his mafia stories. Tony exacted revenge on Bruce by asking him to hold onto a package filled with sand for him, for an unspecified length of time, without telling Bruce what was in it. Bruce and Jean were tempted to open the package but terrified to know what it held. Heroin or a gun were their guesses.\n\nThe doctor who treated Adriana and Tony Soprano after they were involved in the accident at Mount Mercy Hospital in Dover, New Jersey. Shortly after Tony was admitted, the doctor said that the tests indicated that Tony was ok to leave the hospital. When Tony asked if the doctor if he was sure he performed all the correct tests, the doctor became defensive, feeling Tony was implying the doctor was incompetent because he was black. He stated that he has a degree from Johns Hopkins University and that his grandmother (hinted at being Jane E. Mitchell, a nurse) was the first black woman licensed to practice medicine in Delaware. Later Tony Soprano and Tony Blundetto brought Christopher to see the doctor, in an attempt to convince Christopher that Adriana was not giving Tony fellatio in the car, therefore causing the accident. After Blundetto made a thinly veiled threat, the doctor confirms what the Tonys were trying to tell Christopher. He is impressed by Blundetto's medical knowledge thinking at first that he is a doctor. He affirms that the injuries Adriana had were consistent with her sitting upright during the time of the accident. Soprano then thanks the doctor and tries to give him money. The doctor refuses and leaves them in disgust.\n\nThe second psychotherapist of A.J., following Dr. Vogel. A.J. starts attending sessions with her after his discharge from the hospital's mental health ward. When A.J.'s parents get concerned about his wish to join the military, they go have a talk with Dr. Doherty, but Tony instead starts complaining and telling her about his own mother and upbringing. It could be said that Dr. Doherty is rather reminiscent of Dr. Melfi (except her blonde hair), down to her skirt and the crossed legs, as in, the same therapists for Tony and A.J. in a \"like father like son\" motif.\n\nA player in the Soprano family's executive game - a high-stakes, all-night poker tournament and head of the Fried Medical Group with offices located throughout the tristate area. He is a doctor who specializes in treating erectile dysfunction, which is the source of much juvenile joking by the other card players. Dr. Fried was able to turn the tables when performing some out-of-hospital surgery on Furio Giunta after the attempted armed robbery at the Aprile social club. Furio, in agony, asks Tony \"Who is this prick, is he a real doctor?\" to which Dr. Fried replies, \"Close - I'm a prick doctor, get it?!\" In 2002 Dr. Fried acted as the initial property buyer in Tony's HUD scam - selling properties on to Maurice Tiffen at a profit. In 2004, Fried and numerous others were the victims of a large-scale car robbery at his daughter's wedding. He reached out to Tony about the theft. It turned out that Feech La Manna had organized the car theft scheme.\n\nA general surgeon who is responsible for Junior's care when he has his colon cancer operation. He volunteered as a doctor to work in Somalia for a month. Junior is in awe of the man but Tony is less impressed by his dismissive attitude and feels Junior is blinded by his physician's famous namesake. When Tony consults an oncologist to discuss Junior's post-operative care, a tumor panel is convened and Kennedy becomes reluctant to be involved in the case as his decision is questioned. Junior receives chemotherapy but Dr. Kennedy stops returning his and Tony's calls. Tony catches up with Dr. Kennedy on the golf course initially presenting him a club as a gift but it soon becomes clear he is there to intimidate the man. Shortly afterwards Dr. Kennedy visits Junior at his chemotherapy appointment and gives him his home phone number.\n\nA counselor to whom Dr. Melfi refers Meadow. Kobler encourages Meadow to take a year off or participate in a college exchange program in Europe, much to her parents' dismay. She costs $200-a-session and says that it's Meadow's \"right\" to go to Europe and that she could pick up her education later. Through her academic connections Wendy says that if Meadow wants to stay in Europe that she could get her accepted into the University of Barcelona. Following the murder of Jackie Aprile Jr. she says that Meadow should consider going on Prozac to deal with the grief and sorrow of his death.\n\nA Ukrainian-Russian Jewish therapist to whom Carmela Soprano is referred by Dr. Melfi after Carmela shows up, alone, to one of her and Tony's short lived couples sessions. He tells Carmela that he has been married for thirty-one years. Dr. Krakower bluntly tells Carmela she enables Tony's lifestyle and she will never overcome her guilt and shame about her life unless she cuts Tony out of it completely. He says that no matter if Carmela leaves or not before the end of their session he won't charge her for the visit. He advises Carmela to \"take what is left of the children\", divorce Tony, and accept no alimony or child support from him (as his is \"blood money\"), which probably also explains why Dr. Krawkower will not accept pay from Carmela. Carmela, unwilling to follow this advice, does not see Dr. Krakower again. He tells Carmela to have Tony read Fyodor Dostoyevsky's \"Crime and Punishment\" if he goes to prison. Dr. Krakower's first name is never mentioned.\n\nDr. Jennifer Melfi's psychotherapist who also used to be her teacher. Elliot tries to convince her numerous times to refer Tony to another colleague. Elliot calls Dr. Melfi \"Jen\" in their sessions. Vin Makazian reveals to Tony when he is asked to put surveillance on her that she sees her own psychiatrist, Kupferberg, which surprises Tony.\n\nElliot has a daughter, Saskia. Saskia, a lesbian, was an upperclassman at Columbia University when Meadow Soprano was a freshman, and gave a presentation that led Meadow to join the South Bronx legal clinic that eventually put Meadow on the path to law school. \n\nIn the episode \"Employee of the Month,\" Elliot also counsels Melfi following her rape.\n\nElliot once unknowingly encountered Tony Soprano in the parking garage at Columbia University, while both were visiting their daughters. He followed Tony in his car in the hopes of taking Tony's parking space when he left but annoyed Tony by driving too closely, describing him later to Melfi in a therapy session as \"this Bluto-type guy.\" He presented the encounter to Melfi as a way of saying that parking garages are not inherently dangerous places and that she should not blame herself for her rape. He thought that Tony may have been a maintenance man working in the building.\n\nIn 2007, following Tony's shooting by Junior and the rise of his media profile, Melfi accuses Elliot of directing their therapy towards discussing \"Patient Soprano\" because of his desire for gossip and continuous shows of interest. In the episode \"The Second Coming,\" he tells Melfi of a study that concludes talk therapy enables sociopaths. In the episode \"The Blue Comet,\" he further presses Melfi about Soprano at a dinner party, where he reveals to guests that Soprano is Melfi's patient, to her embarrassment, a serious breach of doctor-patient confidentiality, although he dismisses her protests casually, saying everyone at the table is a professional. Melfi is upset, but nevertheless later reads the study herself, which leads her to finally drop Tony Soprano as a patient at their next session.\n\nElliot seems to be interested in the Mafia on a personal level. In the episode \"Stage 5\", he can be seen watching the news when the Lupertazzi crime family is discussed, remarking: \"This Santoro thing, I called it a year ago\". He once tried to explain this interest to Melfi by saying that his father was a huge fan of \"The Untouchables\".\n\nAn Indian oncologist, with whom Tony arranges an appointment to discuss the best management of Junior's colon cancer. Mehta suggests they convene a tumor board meeting.\n\nDr. Melfi is Tony Soprano's therapist.\n\nTony Soprano's attending physician, who treats Tony for his gutshot in 2006. He advises Tony that while he is healing from his gunshot wound that he might have erectile problems which eventually subside.\n\nJunior Soprano's cardiologist, who allowed Junior to use his office to conduct meetings while under the pretense of coming in for medical appointments due to the physician-patient privilege clause that denies the FBI and authorities to listening in on their conversations, meeting with associates including Tony and Richie Aprile. After Corrado's fall in the shower and heart attack scare he tells Corrado the tremors were from the stress of the trial and the house arrest. Corrado refers to him in front of Tony and Richie Aprile as \"the best goddamned heart doctor in the world.\" His father \"Marty Schreck\" was a wealthy bookmaker in New Jersey that Corrado used to do business with back in the 1950s. The FBI used this as an opportunity to gather information by inserting an agent, who posed as a nurse and talked to Junior. He perscribes Corrado a sleep breathing machine because he has forty arousals, meaning changes of sleep.\n\nA psychotherapist whom A.J.'s pediatrician recommends to Carmela for therapy concerning A.J.'s depression. In the episode \"The Second Coming,\" Dr. Vogel also enters A.J. into a mental hospital and arranges a group therapy session with him and his parents after A.J. tries to commit suicide.\n\n\nMelfi eats dinner with Nils at Giuseppe's, where they bump into Tony Soprano accompanied by Silvio Dante and Paulie Gualtieri. Nils is astonished that she knows a Mafia figure and deduces that she must be treating him.\n\nJennifer Melfi and Richard LaPenna's son. Jennifer tells Jason that his grandfather was a contractor. He is not very close to Richard, and following his mother's rape grows even more distant from him. He attends prestigious Bard College in the Hudson Valley of New York. While dining with his mother at an upscale restaurant, Jason witnesses an incident wherein his mother gets into an argument with a stranger over smoking and is embarrassed when they are asked to leave because of her drunken behavior. After his mother's rape, Jason loses interest in his classes at Bard and vows revenge on Melfi's attacker and, in anger, asks the detective for five minutes alone with him.\n\nRichard is the estranged husband of Jennifer Melfi and father of Jason LaPenna. When Dr. Melfi's family learn that she is treating a major mob figure, they urge her to end the association as it is unhealthy. Richard is a member of an organization that aims to combat the negative portrayal of Italian Americans as Mafia figures in the media. This Italian Anti-Defamation League is based on the real-life Italian-American Civil Rights League founded by Colombo crime family boss, Joe Colombo. Richard and Jennifer had reconciled in 2001 and he was living with her at the time of her rape. Richard was largely supportive and eager to seek justice for the rape. He originally thinks Jennifer's rapist is Puerto-Rican, but later finds out that he is partially Italian (Jesus Rossi) and is personally offended. He was very angry when mishandling of the chain of custody allowed the man to go free. However, Richard placed some of the blame for the rape on Jennifer, as she had parked in a poorly lit garage and left work late.\nRichard is 10 years older than Melfi, and Melfi confides in her therapist, Dr. Elliot Kupferberg, that she feels she initially entered into the relationship because Richard offered her an almost paternal sense of security, but his paternalism frustrated her.\n\nJennifer Melfi's mother. When she is told that Dr. Melfi has a patient in the Mafia she encourages her to stop seeing him.\n\nJennifer Melfi's father.\n\n\n"

                "Tattoo\n\nA tattoo is a form of body modification where a design is made by inserting ink, dyes and pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment. Tattoos fall into three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning); symbolic (with a specific meaning pertinent to the wearer); pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item). Tattoos have historically been regarded in the West as 'uncivilised', and over the last 100 years the fashion has been associated mainly with sailors, working men and criminals. By the end of the 20th Century many Western stigmas of the tattoo culture had been dismissed and the practice has become more acceptable and accessible for people of all trades and levels of society.\n\nThe word \"tattoo\", or \"tattow\" in the 18th century, is a loanword from the Polynesian word \"tatau\", meaning \"to write\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" gives the etymology of tattoo as \"In 18th c. tattaow, tattow. From Polynesian (Samoan, Tahitian, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as painting, scarring, or staining.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat or performance — see \"military tattoo\". In this case, the English word \"tattoo\" is derived from the Dutch word \"taptoe\".\n\nThe first written reference to the word \"tattoo\" (or \"tatau\") appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard explorer Captain Cook's ship the \"HMS Endeavour\": \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humour or disposition\".\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by Cook, when he returned in 1769 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\".\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\nMainstream art galleries hold exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs such as \"Beyond Skin\", at the Museum of Croydon. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word \"irezumi\" means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using \"tebori\", the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is \"horimono\". Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing.\n\nAnthropologist Ling Roth in 1900 described four methods of skin marking and suggested they be differentiated under the names \"tatu\", \"moko\", \"cicatrix\", and \"keloid\".\n\nThe American Academy of Dermatology distinguishes five types of tattoos: traumatic tattoos, also called \"natural tattoos\", that result from injuries, especially asphalt from road injuries or pencil lead; amateur tattoos; professional tattoos, both via traditional methods and modern tattoo machines; cosmetic tattoos, also known as \"permanent makeup\"; and medical tattoos.\n\nAccording to George Orwell, coal miners could develop characteristic tattoos owing to coal dust getting into wounds. This can also occur with substances like gunpowder. Similarly, a traumatic tattoo occurs when a substance such as asphalt is rubbed into a wound as the result of some kind of accident or trauma. These are particularly difficult to remove as they tend to be spread across several layers of skin, and scarring or permanent discoloration is almost unavoidable depending on the location. An amalgam tattoo is when amalgam particles are implanted in to the soft tissues of the mouth, usually the gums, during dental filling placement or removal; another example of such accidental tattoos is the result of a deliberate or accidental stabbing with a pencil or pen, leaving graphite or ink beneath the skin.\n\nMany tattoos serve as rites of passage, marks of status and rank, symbols of religious and spiritual devotion, decorations for bravery, sexual lures and marks of fertility, pledges of love, amulets and talismans, protection, and as punishment, like the marks of outcasts, slaves and convicts. The symbolism and impact of tattoos varies in different places and cultures. Tattoos may show how a person feels about a relative (commonly mother/father or daughter/son) or about an unrelated person. Today, people choose to be tattooed for artistic, cosmetic, sentimental/memorial, religious, and magical reasons, and to symbolize their belonging to or identification with particular groups, including criminal gangs (see criminal tattoos) or a particular ethnic group or law-abiding subculture. Some Māori still choose to wear intricate moko on their faces. In Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, the yantra tattoo is used for protection against evil and to increase luck. Text-based tattoos including quotes, lyrics, personal mottos or scripture are popular in western culture. As an example some Christians might have a Psalm or verse from the Bible tattooed on their body. Popular verses include John 3:16, Philippians 4:13, and Psalms 23.\n\nExtensive decorative tattooing is common among members of traditional freak shows and by performance artists who follow in their tradition.\n\nPeople have also been forcibly tattooed.\n\nA well-known example is the Nazi practice of forcibly tattooing Nazi concentration camp inmates with identification numbers during The Holocaust as part of the Nazis' identification system, beginning in fall 1941. The Nazis' SS introduced the practice at Auschwitz concentration camp in order to identify the bodies of registered prisoners in the concentration camps. During registration, the Nazis would pierce the outlines of the serial-number digits onto the prisoners' arms. Of the Nazi concentration camps, only Auschwitz put tattoos on inmates. The tattoo was the prisoner's camp number, sometimes with a special symbol added: some Jews had a triangle, and Romani had the letter \"Z\" (from German \"Zigeuner\" for \"Gypsy\"). In May 1944, the Jewish men received the letters \"A\" or \"B\" to indicate particular series of numbers. For unknown reasons, this number series for women never began again with the \"B\" series after they had reached the number limit of 20,000 for the \"A\" series. The practice continued until the last days of Auschwitz.\n\nTattoos have also been used for identification in other ways. As early as the Zhou, Chinese authorities would employ facial tattoos as a punishment for certain crimes or to mark prisoners or slaves. During the Roman Empire, Roman soldiers were required by law to have identifying tattoos on their hands in order to make desertion difficult. Gladiators and slaves were likewise tattooed: exported slaves were tattooed with the words \"tax paid\", and it was a common practice to tattoo \"Stop me, I'm a runaway\" on their foreheads. Owing to the Biblical strictures against the practice, Emperor Constantine I banned tattooing the face around AD 330, and the Second Council of Nicaea banned all body markings as a pagan practice in AD 787.\n\nIn the period of early contact between the Māori and Europeans, the Maori people hunted and decapitated each other for their moko tattoos, which they traded for European items including axes and firearms. Moko tattoos were facial designs worn to indicate lineage, social position, and status within the tribe. The tattoo art was a sacred marker of identity among the Maori and also referred to as a vehicle for storing one's tapu, or spiritual being, in the afterlife.\nTattoos are sometimes used by forensic pathologists to help them identify burned, putrefied, or mutilated bodies. As tattoo pigment lies encapsulated deep in the skin, tattoos are not easily destroyed even when the skin is burned.\n\nTattoos are also placed on animals, though rarely for decorative reasons. Pets, show animals, thoroughbred horses, and livestock are sometimes tattooed with identification and other marks. Tattooing with a 'slap mark' on the shoulder or on the ear is the standard identification method in commercial pig farming. Branding is used for similar reasons and is often performed without anesthesia, but is different from tattooing as no ink or dye is inserted during the process, the mark instead being caused by permanent scarring of the skin. Pet dogs and cats are sometimes tattooed with a serial number (usually in the ear, or on the inner thigh) via which their owners can be identified. However, the use of a microchip has become an increasingly popular choice and since 2016 is a legal requirement for all 8.5 million pet dogs in the UK.\n\nThe cosmetic surgery industry continues to see a trend of increased popularity for both surgical and noninvasive procedures. When used as a form of cosmetics, tattooing includes permanent makeup and hiding or neutralizing skin discolorations. Permanent makeup is the use of tattoos to enhance eyebrows, lips (liner and/or lipstick), eyes (liner), and even moles, usually with natural colors, as the designs are intended to resemble makeup.\n\nA growing trend in the US and UK is to place artistic titoos over the surgical scars of a mastectomy. \"More women are choosing not to reconstruct after a mastectomy and tattoo over the scar tissue instead... The mastectomy tattoo will become just another option for post cancer patients and a truly personal way of regaining control over post cancer bodies and proving once and for all that breast cancer is not just a pink ribbon.\" The tattooing of nipples on reconstructed breasts remains in high demand, however.\n\nFunctional tattoos are used primarily for a purpose other than aesthetics. One such use is to tattoo Alzheimer patients with their name, so they may be easily identified if they go missing.\n\nMedical tattoos are used to ensure instruments are properly located for repeated application of radiotherapy and for the areola in some forms of breast reconstruction. Tattooing has also been used to convey medical information about the wearer (e.g., blood group, medical condition, etc.). Additionally, tattoos are used in skin tones to cover vitiligo, a skin pigmentation disorder.\n\nSS blood group tattoos (German: Blutgruppentätowierung) were worn by members of the Waffen-SS in Nazi Germany during World War II to identify the individual's blood type. After the war, the tattoo was taken to be prima facie, if not perfect, evidence of being part of the Waffen-SS, leading to potential arrest and prosecution. This led a number of Ex-Waffen-SS to shoot themselves through the arm with a gun, removing the tattoo and leaving scars like the ones resulting from pox inoculation, making the removal less obvious.\n\nTattoos were probably also used in ancient medicine as part of the treatment of the patient. In 1898, Daniel Fouquet, a medical doctor, wrote an article on “medical tattooing” practices in Ancient Egypt, in which he describes the tattooed markings on the female mummies found at the Deir el-Bahari site. He speculated that the tattoos and other scarifications observed on the bodies may have served a medicinal or therapeutic purpose: \"The examination of these scars, some white, others blue, leaves in no doubt that they are not, in essence, ornament, but an established treatment for a condition of the pelvis, very probably chronic pelvic peritonitis.\"\n\nPreserved tattoos on ancient mummified human remains reveal that tattooing has been practiced throughout the world for many centuries. The Ainu, an indigenous people of Japan, traditionally had facial tattoos, as did the Austroasians. Today, one can find Atayal, Seediq, Truku, and Saisiyat of Taiwan, Berbers of Tamazgha (North Africa), Yoruba, Fulani and Hausa people of Nigeria, and Māori of New Zealand with facial tattoos. Tattooing was popular among certain ethnic groups in southern China, Polynesia, Africa, Borneo, Cambodia, Europe, Japan, the Mentawai Islands, MesoAmerica, New Zealand, North America and South America, the Philippines, Iron Age Britain, and Taiwan. In 2015, scientific re-assessment of the age of the two oldest known tattooed mummies, identified Ötzi as the oldest currently known example. This body, with 61 tattoos, was found embedded in glacial ice in the Alps, and was dated to 3,250 BC.\nIt is a myth that the modern revival of tattooing stems from Captain James Cook's three voyages to the South Pacific in the late 18th century. Certainly, Cook's voyages and the dissemination of the texts and images from them brought more awareness about tattooing (and, as noted above, imported the word \"tattow\" into Western languages), but Europeans have been tattooed throughout history. On Cook's first voyage in 1768, his science officer and expedition botanist, Sir Joseph Banks, as well as artist Sydney Parkinson and many others of the crew, returned to England with tattoos, although many of these men would have had pre-existing tattoos. Banks was a highly regarded member of the English aristocracy that had acquired his position with Cook by co-financing the expedition with ten thousand pounds, a very large sum at the time. In turn, Cook brought back with him a tattooed Raiatean man, Omai, whom he presented to King George and the English Court. On subsequent voyages other crew members, from officers, such as American John Ledyard, to ordinary seamen, were tattooed. \n\nThe first documented professional tattooist in Britain was established in the port of Liverpool in the 1870s. In Britain tattooing was still largely associated with sailors and the lower or even criminal class, but by the 1870s had become fashionable among some members of the upper classes, including royalty, and in its upmarket form it could be an expensive and sometimes painful process. A marked class division on the acceptability of the practice continued for some time in Britain. Recently a trend has arisen marketed as 'Stick and Poke' tattooing; primitive figures are permanently inscribed by the user himself after he obtains a 'DIY' kit containing needles, ink and a collection of suggestions.\n\nAs most tattoos in the U.S. were done by Polynesian and Japanese amateurs, tattoo artists were in great demand in port cities all over the world, especially by European and American sailors. The first recorded professional tattoo artist in the United States was a German immigrant, Martin Hildebrandt. He opened a shop in New York City in 1846 and quickly became popular during the American Civil War among soldiers and sailors of both Union and Confederate militaries.\n\nHildebrandt began traveling from camp to camp to tattoo soldiers, making his popularity increase, and also giving birth to the tradition of getting tattoos while being an American serviceman. Soon after the Civil War, tattoos became fashionable among upper-class young adults. This trend lasted until the beginning of World War I. The invention of the electric tattoo machine caused popularity of tattoos among the wealthy to drop off. The machine made the tattooing procedure both much easier and cheaper, thus, eliminating the status symbol tattoos previously held, as they were now affordable for all socioeconomic classes. The status symbol of a tattoo shifted from a representation of wealth, to a mark typically seen on rebels and criminals. Despite this change, tattoos remained popular among military servicemen, and the tradition continues today.\n\nMany studies have been done of the tattooed population and society's view of tattoos. In June 2006, the \"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology\" published the results of a telephone survey of 2004. It found that 36% of Americans ages 18–29, 24% of those 30–40, and 15% of those 41–51 had a tattoo. In September 2006, the Pew Research Center conducted a telephone survey that found that 36% of Americans ages 18–25, 40% of those 26–40 and 10% of those 41–64 had a tattoo. They concluded that Generation X and Generation Y are not afraid to express themselves through their appearance, and tattoos are the most popular form of self-expression. In January 2008, a survey conducted online by Harris Interactive estimated that 14% of all adults in the United States have a tattoo, slightly down from 2003, when 16% had a tattoo. Among age groups, 9% of those ages 18–24, 32% of those 25–29, 25% of those 30–39 and 12% of those 40–49 have tattoos, as do 8% of those 50–64. Men are slightly more likely to have a tattoo than women.\n\nRichmond, Virginia, has been cited as one of the most tattooed cities in the United States. That distinction led the Valentine Richmond History Center to create an online exhibit titled \"History, Ink: The Tattoo Archive Project.\" The introduction to the exhibit notes, \"In the past, western culture associated tattoos with those individuals who lived on the edge of society; however, today they are recognized as a legitimate art form and widely accepted in mainstream culture.\"\n\nSince the 1970s, tattoos have become a mainstream part of Western fashion, common among all genders, to all economic classes, and to age groups from the later teen years to middle age. For many young Americans, the tattoo has taken on a decidedly different meaning than for previous generations. The tattoo has \"undergone dramatic redefinition\" and has shifted from a form of deviance to an acceptable form of expression.\n\nProtection papers were used by American sailors to prevent themselves from being taken off American ships and impressed into the Royal Navy. These were simple documents that described the sailor as being an American sailor. Many of the protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the Royal Navy paid no attention to them. \"In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'\" One way of making them more specific was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal, and thus use that description to identify the seaman. As a result, many of the later certificates carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as other specific information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen. \"Frequently their 'protection papers' made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos.\"\n\n\"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tattoos were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the protection papers issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-passports catalogued tattoos alongside birthmarks, scars, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as pigments, even gunpowder and urine. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols.\"\n\nBecause these protection papers were used to define freemen and citizenship, many black sailors and other men also used them to show that they were freemen if they were stopped by officials or slave catchers. They also called them \"free papers\" because they certified their non-slave status. Many of the freed blacks used descriptions of tattoos for identification purposes on their freedom papers.\n\nTattooing involves the placement of pigment into the skin's dermis, the layer of dermal tissue underlying the epidermis. After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a homogenized damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the immune system's phagocytes to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin granulation tissue forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by collagen growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within fibroblasts, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, but in the long term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.\nSome tribal cultures traditionally created tattoos by cutting designs into the skin and rubbing the resulting wound with ink, ashes or other agents; some cultures continue this practice, which may be an adjunct to scarification. Some cultures create tattooed marks by hand-tapping the ink into the skin using sharpened sticks or animal bones (made like needles) with clay formed disks or, in modern times, needles.\n\nThe most common method of tattooing in modern times is the electric tattoo machine, which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle or a group of needles that are soldered onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit. The unit rapidly and repeatedly drives the needles in and out of the skin, usually 80 to 150 times a second. The needles are single-use needles that come packaged individually.\n\nTattooing is regulated in many countries because of the associated health risks to client and practitioner, specifically local infections and virus transmission. Disposable plastic aprons and eye protection can be worn depending on the risk of blood or other secretions splashing into the eyes or clothing of the tattoist. Hand hygiene, assessment of risks and appropriate disposal of all sharp objects and materials contaminated with blood are crucial areas. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. All equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use. It is good practice to provide clients with a printed consent form that outlines risks and complications as well as instructions for after care.\n\nThe Government of Meiji Japan had outlawed tattoos in the 19th century, a prohibition that stood for 70 years before being repealed in 1948. As of 6 June 2012 all new tattoos are forbidden for employees of the city of Osaka. Existing tattoos are required to be covered with proper clothing. The regulations were added to Osaka's ethical codes, and employees with tattoos were encouraged to have them removed. This was done because of the strong connection of tattoos with the yakuza, or Japanese organized crime, after an Osaka official in February 2012 threatened a schoolchild by showing his tattoo.\n\nTattoos had negative connotations in historical China, where criminals often had been marked by tattooing. The association of tattoos with criminals was transmitted from China to influence Japan. Today, tattoos have remained a taboo in Chinese society.\n\nThe Romans tattooed criminals and slaves, and in the 19th century released US convicts, Australian convicts, and British army deserters were identified by tattoos. Prisoners in Nazi concentration camps were tattooed with an identification number. Today, many prison inmates still tattoo themselves as an indication of time spent in prison.\n\nNative Americans also used tattoos to represent their tribe. Catholic Croats of Bosnia used religious Christian tattooing, especially of children and women, for protection against conversion to Islam during the Ottoman rule in the Balkans.\n\nTattoos are strongly empirically associated with deviance, personality disorders, and criminality. Although the general acceptance of tattoos is on the rise in Western society, they still carry a heavy stigma among certain social groups. Tattoos are generally considered an important part of the culture of the Russian mafia.\n\nCurrent cultural understandings of tattoos in Europe and North America have been greatly influenced by long-standing stereotypes based on deviant social groups in the 19th and 20th centuries. Particularly in North America tattoos have been associated with stereotypes, folklore, and racism. Not until the 1960s and 1970s did people associate tattoos with such societal outcasts as bikers and prisoners. Today, in the United States many prisoners and criminal gangs use distinctive tattoos to indicate facts about their criminal behavior, prison sentences, and organizational affiliation. A teardrop tattoo, for example, can be symbolic of murder, or each tear represents the death of a friend. At the same time, members of the U.S. military have an equally well-established and longstanding history of tattooing to indicate military units, battles, kills, etc., an association that remains widespread among older Americans. In Japan tattoos are associated with yakuza criminal groups but there are non-yakuza groups such as Fukushi Masaichi's tattoo association that sought to preserve the skins of dead Japanese who have extensive tattoos. Tattooing is also common in the British Armed Forces. Depending on vocation tattoos are accepted in a number of professions in America. Companies across many fields are increasingly focused on diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn Britain, there is evidence of women with tattoos, concealed by their clothing, throughout the 20th century, and records of women tattoists such as Jessie Knight from the 1920s. A study of \"at-risk\" (as defined by school absenteeism and truancy) adolescent girls showed a positive correlation between body modification and negative feelings towards the body and low self-esteem; however, the study also demonstrated that a strong motive for body modification is the search for \"self and attempts to attain mastery and control over the body in an age of increasing alienation\". The prevalence of women in the tattoo industry in the 21st century, along with larger numbers of women bearing tattoos, appears to be changing negative perceptions.\n\nFormer sailor Rowland Hussey Macy, who formed Macy's department stores, used a red star tattoo that he had on his hand for the store's logo.\n\nTattoos have also been used in marketing and advertising with companies paying people to have logos of brands like HBO, Red Bull, ASOS.com, and Sailor Jerry's rum tattooed in their bodies. This practice is known as \"skinvertising\".\n\nB.T.'s Smokehouse, a barbecue restaurant located in Massachusetts, offered customers free meals for life if they had the logo of the establishment tattooed on a visible part of their bodies. Nine people took the business up on the offer.\n\nBecause it requires breaking the skin barrier, tattooing carries health risks including infection and allergic reactions. Tattooing can be uncomfortable to excruciating depending on the area and can result in the person fainting. Modern tattooists reduce risks by following universal precautions working with single-use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. Many jurisdictions require that tattooists have blood-borne pathogen training such as that provided through the Red Cross and OSHA. As of 2009 (in the United States) there have been no reported cases of HIV contracted from tattoos.\n\nIn amateur tattooing, such as that practiced in prisons, however, there is an elevated risk of infection. Infections that can theoretically be transmitted by the use of unsterilized tattoo equipment or contaminated ink include surface infections of the skin, fungal infections, some forms of hepatitis, herpes simplex virus, HIV, staph, tetanus, and tuberculosis.\n\nTattoo inks have been described as \"remarkably nonreactive histologically\". However, cases of allergic reactions to tattoo inks, particularly certain colors, have been medically documented. This is sometimes due to the presence of nickel in an ink pigment, which triggers a common metal allergy. Occasionally, when a blood vessel is punctured during the tattooing procedure, a bruise/hematoma may appear.\n\nCertain colours - red or similar colours such as purple, pink, and orange - tend to cause more problems and damage compared to other colours. Red ink has even caused skin and flesh damages so severe that the amputation of a leg or an arm has been necessary. If part of a tattoo (especially if red) begins to cause even minor troubles, like becoming itchy or worse, lumpy, then Danish experts strongly suggest to remove the red parts.\n\nIn 2017, researchers from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in France say the chemicals in tattoo ink can travel in the bloodstream and accumulate in the lymph nodes, obstructing their ability to fight infections. However, the authors noted in their paper that most tattooed individuals including the donors analyzed do not suffer from chronic inflammation.\n\nWhile tattoos are considered permanent, it is sometimes possible to remove them, fully or partially, with laser treatments. Typically, black and some colored inks can be removed more completely than inks of other colors. The expense and pain associated with removing tattoos are typically greater than the expense and pain associated with applying them. Pre-laser tattoo removal methods include dermabrasion, salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with salt), cryosurgery, and excision—which is sometimes still used along with skin grafts for larger tattoos. These older methods, however, have been nearly completely replaced by laser removal treatment options.\n\nA temporary tattoo is a non-permanent image on the skin resembling a permanent tattoo. Temporary tattoos can be drawn, painted, airbrushed or needled as a permanent tattoo with an ink which can be dissolved in blood within 6 months of art as a form of body painting.\n\nDecal (press-on) temporary tattoos are used to decorate any part of the body. They may last for a day or for more than a week.\n\nFoil temporary tattoos are a variation of decal-style temporary tattoos, printed using a foil stamping technique instead of using ink. The foil design is printed as a mirror image in order to be viewed in the right direction once it is applied to the skin. Each metallic tattoo is protected by a transparent protective film.\n\nAlthough they have become more popular and usually require a greater investment, airbrush temporary tattoos are less likely to achieve the look of a permanent tattoo, and may not last as long as press-on temporary tattoos. An artist sprays on airbrush tattoos using a stencil with alcohol-based, FDA-approved cosmetic inks. Like decal tattoos, airbrush temporary tattoos also are easily removed with rubbing alcohol or baby oil.\n\nAnother tattoo alternative is henna-based tattoos, which generally contain no additives. Henna is a plant-derived substance which is painted on the skin, staining it a reddish-orange-to-brown color. Because of the semi-permanent nature of henna, they lack the realistic colors typical of decal temporary tattoos. Due to the time-consuming application process, it is a relatively poor option for children. If you do choose henna temporary tattoos, ensure that they are pure henna. Dermatological publications report that allergic reactions to natural henna are very rare and the product is generally considered safe for skin application. Serious problems can occur, however, from the use of henna with certain additives. The FDA and medical journals report that painted black henna temporary tattoos are especially dangerous. Black Henna or Pre-Mixed Henna Temporary Tattoos May Be Harmful - see below for safety information.\n\nDecal temporary tattoos, when legally sold in the United States, have had their color additives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as cosmetics --- the FDA has determined these colorants are safe for “direct dermal contact.” While the FDA has received some accounts of minor skin irritation, including redness and swelling, from this type of temporary tattoo, the agency has found these symptoms to be “child specific” and not significant enough to support warnings to the public. Unapproved pigments, however, which are sometimes used by non-US manufacturers, can provoke allergic reactions in anyone. Understanding the types of temporary tattoos available to consumers, knowing where they are manufactured, and ensuring they come from a reliable source are keys to determining whether temporary tattoos are safe.\n\nThe types of airbrush paints manufactured for crafting, creating art or decorating clothing should never be used for tattooing. These paints are not approved for direct contact with skin, and can be allergenic or toxic. Always ask the airbrush tattoo artist what kind of ink he or she is using and whether it meets FDA approval.\n\nThe FDA regularly issues warnings to consumers about avoiding any temporary tattoos labeled as black henna or pre-mixed henna as these may contain potentially harmful ingredients including silver nitrate, carmine, pyrogallol, disperse orange dye and chromium. Black henna gets its color from paraphenylenediamine (PPD), a textile dye approved by the FDA for human use only in hair coloring. In Canada, the use of PPD on the skin, including hair dye, is banned. Research has linked these and other ingredients to a range of health problems including allergic reactions, chronic inflammatory reactions, and late-onset allergic reactions to related clothing and hairdressing dyes. They can cause these reactions long after application. Neither black henna nor pre-mixed henna are approved for cosmetic use by the FDA.\n\nJudaism generally prohibits tattoos among its adherents based on the commandments in Leviticus 19. Jews tend to believe this commandment only applies to Jews and not to gentiles.\nThere is no specific rule in the New Testament prohibiting tattoos and most Christian denominations believe the laws in Leviticus are outdated as well as believing the commandment only applied to the Israelites, not to the gentiles. While most Christian groups tolerate tattoos, some Evangelical and fundamentalist Protestant denominations do believe the commandment does apply today for Christians and believe it is a sin to get one.\n\nMany Coptic Christians in Egypt take a cross tattoo in their right wrist to differ from the Muslims.\n\nTattoos are considered to be haram in Sunni Islam, based on rulings from scholars and passages in the Hadith. Shia Islam does not entirely prohibit tattooing, although it may be looked down upon in Shia communities.\n\nAnthropological\n\nPopular and artistic\n\nMedical\n\n",
                "History of tattooing\n\nTattooing has been practiced across the globe since at least Neolithic times, as evidenced by mummified preserved skin, ancient art, and the archaeological record. Both ancient art and archaeological finds of possible tattoo tools suggest tattooing was practiced by the Upper Paleolithic period in Europe. However, direct evidence for tattooing on mummified human skin extends only to the 4th millennium BC. The oldest discovery of tattooed human skin to date is found on the body of Ötzi the Iceman, dating to between 3370 and 3100 BC. Other tattooed mummies have been recovered from at least 49 archaeological sites including locations in Greenland, Alaska, Siberia, Mongolia, western China, Egypt, Sudan, the Philippines, and the Andes. These include Amunet, Priestess of the Goddess Hathor from ancient Egypt (c. 2134–1991 BC), multiple mummies from Siberia including the Pazyryk culture of Russia, and from several cultures throughout pre-Columbian South America.\n\nCemeteries throughout the Tarim Basin (Xinjiang of western China) including the sites of Qäwrighul, Yanghai, Shengjindian, Zaghunluq, and Qizilchoqa have revealed several tattooed mummies with Western Asian/Indo-European physical traits and cultural materials. These date from between 2100 and 550 BC.\n\nIn ancient China, tattoos were considered a barbaric practice, and were often referred to in literature depicting bandits and folk heroes. As late as the Qing Dynasty, it was common practice to tattoo characters such as (\"Prisoner\") on convicted criminals' faces. Although relatively rare during most periods of Chinese history, slaves were also sometimes marked to display ownership.\n\nHowever, tattoos seem to have remained a part of southern culture. Marco Polo wrote of Quanzhou, \"Many come hither from Upper India to have their bodies painted with the needle in the way we have elsewhere described, there being many adepts at this craft in the city\". At least three of the main characters Lu Zhishen, Shi Jin (史進), and Yan Ching (燕青) in the classic novel \"Water Margin\" are described as having tattoos covering nearly all of their bodies. Wu Song was sentenced to a facial tattoo describing his crime after killing Xi Menqing (西门庆) to avenge his brother. In addition, Chinese legend claimed the mother of Yue Fei (a famous Song general) tattooed the words \"Repay the Country with Pure Loyalty\" (, \"jing zhong bao guo\") down her son's back before he left to join the army.\n\nGreek written records of tattooing date back to at least the 5th-century BCE. The ancient Greeks and Romans used tattooing to penalize slaves, criminals, and prisoners of war. While known, decorative tattooing was looked down upon and religious tattooing was mainly practiced in Egypt and Syria. According to Robert Graves in his book \"The Greek Myths\", tattooing was common amongst certain religious groups in the ancient Mediterranean world, which may have contributed to the prohibition of tattooing in Leviticus. The Romans of Late Antiquity also tattooed soldiers and arms manufacturers, a practice that continued into the ninth century.\n\nThe Greek verb \"stizein\" (στίζειν), meaning \"to prick,\" was used for tattooing. Its derivative \"stigma\" (στίγμα) was the common term for tattoo marks in both Greek and Latin. During the Byzantine period, the verb \"kentein\" (κεντεῖν) replaced \"stizein\", and a variety of new Latin terms replaced \"stigmata\" including \"signa\" \"signs,\" \"characteres\" \"stamps,\" and \"cicatrices\" \"scars.\"\n\nIn Southern India, permanent tattoos are called \"pachakutharathu\". It was very common in South India, especially Tamil Nadu, before 1980. In northern India, permanent tattoos are called \"godna\". Tattoos have been used as cultural symbols among many tribal populations, as well as the general Hindu population of India.\n\nIn India, tattoos have many names, including \"tarazwa\", \"gondan\", and \"ungkala\".\n\nSeveral Indonesian tribes have in their tattooing culture. One notable example is the Dayak people of Kalimantan in Borneo (Bornean traditional tattooing). Another ethnic group that practices tattooing are the Mentawai people, as well as Moi and Meyakh people in West Papua.\n\nTattooing for spiritual and decorative purposes in Japan is thought to extend back to at least the Jōmon or Paleolithic period and was widespread during various periods for both the Japanese and the native Ainu. Chinese texts from before 300 AD described social differences among Japanese people as being indicated through tattooing and other bodily marking. Chinese texts from the time also described Japanese men of all ages as decorating their faces and bodies with tattoos.\n\nBetween 1603 and 1868, Japanese tattooing was only practiced by the \"ukiyo\" (floating world) subculture. Generally firemen, manual workers and prostitutes wore tattoos to communicate their status. By the early 17th century, criminals were widely being tattooed as a visible mark of punishment. Criminals were marked with symbols typically including crosses, lines, double lines and circles on certain parts of the body, mostly the face and arms. These symbols sometimes designated the places where the crimes were committed. In one area, the character for \"dog\" was tattooed on the criminal's forehead.\n\nThe Government of Meiji Japan, formed in 1868, banned the art of tattooing altogether, viewing it as barbaric and lacking respectability. This subsequently created a subculture of criminals and outcasts. These people had no place in \"decent society\" and were frowned upon. They could not simply integrate into mainstream society because of their obvious visible tattoos, forcing many of them into criminal activities which ultimately formed the roots for the modern Japanese mafia, the Yakuza, with which tattoos have become almost synonymous in Japan.\n\nDespite a lack of direct textual references, tattooed human remains and iconographic evidence indicate that ancient Egyptians practiced tattooing from at least 2000 BCE. It is theorized that tattooing entered Egypt through Nubia, but this claim is complicated by the high mobility between Lower Nubia and Upper Egypt as well as Egypt's annexation of Lower Nubia during the Middle Kingdom. Archeologist Geoffrey J. Tassie argues that it may be more appropriate to classify tattoo in ancient Egypt and Nubia as part of a larger Nile Valley tradition.\n\nThe most famous tattooed mummies from this region are Amunet, a priestess of Hathor, and two Hathoric dancers from Dynasty XI that were found at Deir el-Bahari. In 1898, Daniel Fouquet, a medical doctor from Cairo, wrote an article on medical tattooing practices in ancient Egypt in which he describes the tattoos on these three mummies and speculates that they may have served a medicinal or therapeutic purpose: \"The examination of these scars, some white, others blue, leaves in no doubt that they are not, in essence, ornament, but an established treatment for a condition of the pelvis, very probably chronic pelvic peritonitis.\"\n\nAncient Egyptian tattooing appears to have been practiced on women exclusively; with the possible exception of one extremely worn Dynasty XII stele, there is no artistic or physical evidence that men were tattooed. However, by the Meroitic Period (300 BCE – 400 CE) it was practiced on Nubian men as well.\n\nAccounts of early travelers to ancient Egypt describe the tool used as an uneven number of metal needles attached to a wooden handle.\n\nCoptic tattoos often consist of three lines, three dots and two elements, reflecting the Trinity. The tools used had an odd the number of needles to bring luck and good fortune. Many Copts have the Coptic cross tattooed on the inside of their right arm. This may have been influenced by a similar practice tattooing religious symbols on the wrists and arms during the Ptolemaic Period.\n\nHerodotus' writings suggest that slaves and prisoners of war were tattooed in Persia during the classical era. This practice spread from Persia to Greece and then to Rome.\n\nThe most famous depiction of tattooing in Persian literature goes back 800 years to a tale by Rumi about a man who is proud to want a lion tattoo but changes his mind once he experiences the pain of the needle.\n\nIn the \"hamam\" (the baths), there were \"dallaks\" whose job was to help people wash themselves. This was a notable occupation because apart from helping the customers with washing, they were massage-therapists, dentists, barbers, and tattoo artists.\n\nTattooing has been a part of Filipino life since pre-Hispanic colonization of the Philippine Islands, tattooing in the Philippines to some were a form of rank and accomplishments, and some believed that tattoos had magical qualities. The more famous tattooed indigenous peoples of the Philippines resided in north Luzon, especially among the Bontoc Igorot, Kalinga, and Ifugao peoples. The Visayans of the southern islands were also heavily tattooed.\n\nFilipino tattooing was first documented by the European Spanish explorers as they landed among the Islands in the late 16th century, and called the natives \"Los Pintados\" (The Painted Ones) as they mistook the tattoos for paint. Before European exploration, tattooing was widespread, but conversion to Christianity greatly diminished the practice as heathen or low-class.\n\nAs Lane Wilcken's \"Filipino Tattoos Ancient to Modern\" denotes, there are many similarities between the tattooing traditions of the Philippines and indigenous Polynesian designs--not only with their societal function and similar designs, but in the tools used to hand-tap them on (generally a needle or thorn on a stick, with a hammer to pound it into the skin). While the most common modern term for indigenous tattoos is \"batok,\" an ancient Tagalog word for tattoos was \"tatak,\" extremely similar to the Samoan word \"tatau\".\n\nThe Māori people of New Zealand practised a form of tattooing known as Tā moko, traditionally created with chisels. In the colonial period Tā moko fell out of use, partly because of the European practice of collecting Mokomokai, or tattooed heads.\n\nHowever, from the late 20th century onward, there has been a resurgence of tā moko amongst Maori. There is also a related tattoo art, kirituhi, which has a similar aesthetic to tā moko but is worn by non-Maori.\n\nThe traditional male tattoo in Samoa is called the pe'a. The traditional female tattoo is called the malu. The word \"tattoo\" is believed to have originated from the Samoan word \"tatau.\" \n\nWhen the Samoan Islands were first seen by Europeans in 1722 three Dutch ships commanded by Jacob Roggeveen visited the eastern island known as Manua. A crew member of one of the ships described the natives in these words, \"They are friendly in their speech and courteous in their behavior, with no apparent trace of wildness or savagery. They do not paint themselves, as do the natives of some other islands, but on the lower part of the body they wear artfully woven silk tights or knee breeches. They are altogether the most charming and polite natives we have seen in all of the South Seas...\"\n\nThe ships lay at anchor off the islands for several days, but the crews did not venture ashore and did not even get close enough to the natives to realize that they were not wearing silk leggings, but their legs were completely covered in tattoos.\n\nIn Samoa, the tradition of applying tattoo, or tatau, by hand has been unbroken for over two thousand years. Tools and techniques have changed little. The skill is often passed from father to son, each tattoo artist, or tufuga, learning the craft over many years of serving as his father's apprentice. A young artist-in-training often spent hours, and sometimes days, tapping designs into sand or tree bark using a special tattooing comb, or au. Honoring their tradition, Samoan tattoo artists made this tool from sharpened boar's teeth fastened together with a portion of the turtle shell and to a wooden handle. \n\nTraditional Samoan tattooing of the \"pe'a\", body tattoo, is an ordeal that is not lightly undergone. It takes many weeks to complete. The process is very painful and used to be a necessary prerequisite to receiving a matai title; this however is no longer the case. Tattooing was also a very costly procedure.\n\nIt was not uncommon for half a dozen boys to be tattooed at the same time, requiring the services of four or more artists. It was not just the men who received tattoos, but the women too; their designs are of a much lighter nature rather than having the large areas of solid dye which are frequently seen in men’s tattoos. The tattooing of women was not nearly as ritualized like men’s were.\n\nSamoan society has long been defined by rank and title, with chiefs (ali'i) and their assistants, known as talking chiefs (tulafale). The tattooing ceremonies for young chiefs, typically conducted at the time of puberty, were part of their ascendance to a leadership role. The permanent marks left by the tattoo artists would forever celebrate their endurance and dedication to cultural traditions. The pain was extreme and the risk of death by infection was a concern; to back down from tattooing was to risk being labeled a \"pala'ai\" or coward. Those who could not endure the pain and abandoned their tattooing were left incomplete, would be forced to wear their mark of shame throughout their life. This would forever bring shame upon their family so it was avoided at all cost. \n\nThe Samoan tattooing process used a number of tools which remained almost unchanged since their first use. \"Autapulu\" is a wide tattooing comb used to fill in the large dark areas of the tattoo. \"Ausogi'aso tele\" is a comb used for making thick lines. \"Ausogi'aso laititi\" is a comb used for making thin lines. \"Aumogo\" small comb is used for making small marks. \"Sausau\" is the mallet is used for striking the combs. It is almost two feet in length and made from the central rib of a coconut palm leaf. \"Tuluma\" is the pot used for holding the tattooing combs. Ipulama is the cup used for holding the dye. The dye is made from the soot collected from burnt lama nuts. \"Tu'I\" used to grind up the dye. These tools were primarily made out of animal bones to ensure sharpness.\n\nThe tattooing process itself would be 5 sessions, in theory. These 5 sessions would be spread out over 10 days in order for the inflammation to subside.\n\nChristian missionaries from the west attempted to purge tattooing among the Samoans, thinking it barbaric and inhumane. Many young Samoans resisted mission schools since they forbade them to wear tattoos. But over time attitudes relaxed toward this cultural tradition and tattooing began to reemerge in Samoan culture.\n\nTattooed mummies dating to c. 500 BC were extracted from burial mounds on the Ukok plateau during the 1990s. Their tattooing involved animal designs carried out in a curvilinear style. The Man of Pazyryk, a Scythian chieftain, is tattooed with an extensive and detailed range of fish, monsters and a series of dots that lined up along the spinal column (lumbar region) and around the right ankle.\n\nSome artifacts dating back 3,000 years from the Solomon Islands may have been used for tattooing human skin. Obsidian pieces have been duplicated, then used to conduct tattoos on pig skin, then compared to the original artifacts. \"They conducted these experiments to observe the wear, such as chipping and scratches, and residues on the stones caused by tattooing, and then compared that use-wear with 3,000 year old artifacts. They found that the obsidian pieces, old and new, show similar patterns, suggesting that they hadn't been used for working hides, but were for adorning human skin.\"\n\nIn Taiwan, facial tattoos of the Atayal tribe are called \"ptasan\"; they are used to demonstrate that an adult man can protect his homeland, and that an adult woman is qualified to weave cloth and perform housekeeping.\nTaiwan is believed to be the homeland of all the Austronesian peoples which includes Filipinos, Indonesians, Polynesians and Malagasy peoples, all with strong tattoo traditions. This along with the striking correlation between Austronesian languages and the use of the so-called hand-tapping method suggests that Austronesian peoples inherited their tattooing traditions from their ancestors established in Taiwan or along the southern coast of the Chinese mainland.\n\nThai tattoos also known as Yantra tattooing was common since ancient times. Just as other native southeast Asian cultures, animistic tattooing was common in Tai tribes that were is southern China. Over time this animistic practice of tattooing for luck and protection assimilated Hindu and Buddhist ideas. The Sak Yant traditional tattoo is practiced today by many and are usually given either by a Buddhist monk or a Brahmin priest. The tattoos usually depict Hindu gods and use the Mon script or ancient Khmer script, which were the scripts of the classical civilizations of mainland southeast Asia.\n\nThe earliest possible evidence for tattooing in Europe appears on ancient art from the Upper Paleolithic period as incised designs on the bodies of humanoid figurines. The Löwenmensch figurine from the Aurignacian culture dates to approximately 40,000 years ago and features a series of parallel lines on its left shoulder. The ivory Venus of Hohle Fels, which dates to between 35,000 and 40,000 years ago also exhibits incised lines down both arms, as well as across the torso and chest.\n\nThe oldest and most famous direct proof of ancient European tattooing appears on the body of Ötzi the Iceman, who was found in the Ötz valley in the Alps and dates from the late 4th millennium BC. Studies have revealed that Ötzi had 61 carbon-ink tattoos consisting of 19 groups of lines simple dots and lines on his lower spine, left wrist, behind his right knee, and on his ankles. It has been argued that these tattoos were a form of healing because of their placement, though other explanations are plausible.\n\nPre-Christian Germanic, Celtic and other central and northern European tribes were often heavily tattooed, according to surviving accounts, but it may also have been normal paint. The Picts may have been tattooed (or scarified) with elaborate, war-inspired black or dark blue woad (or possibly copper for the blue tone) designs. Julius Caesar described these tattoos in Book V of his \"Gallic Wars\" (54 BC). Nevertheless, these may have been painted markings rather than tattoos.\n\nAhmad ibn Fadlan wrote of his encounter with the Scandinavian Rus' tribe in the early 10th century, describing them as tattooed from \"fingernails to neck\" with dark blue \"tree patterns\" and other \"figures.\" However, this may also have been paint, since the word used can mean both tattoo and painting. During the gradual process of Christianization in Europe, tattoos were often considered remaining elements of paganism and generally legally prohibited.\n\nThe significance of tattooing was long open to Eurocentric interpretations. In the mid-19th century, Baron Haussmann, while arguing against painting the interior of Parisian churches, said the practice \"reminds me of the tattoos used in place of clothes by barbarous peoples to conceal their nakedness\".\n\nBritish and other pilgrims to the Holy Lands throughout the 17th century were tattooed to commemorate their voyages, including William Lithgow in 1612. \n\nIn 1691 William Dampier brought to London a native of the western part of New Guinea (now part of Indonesia) who had a tattooed body and became known as the \"Painted Prince\".\n\nBetween 1766 and 1779, Captain James Cook made three voyages to the South Pacific, the last trip ending with Cook's death in Hawaii in February 1779. When Cook and his men returned home to Europe from their voyages to Polynesia, they told tales of the 'tattooed savages' they had seen. The word \"tattoo\" itself comes from the Tahitian \"tatau\", and was introduced into the English language by Cook's expedition (though the word 'tattoo' or 'tap-too', referring to a drumbeat, had existed in English since at least 1644)\n\nIt was in Tahiti aboard the Endeavour, in July 1769, that Cook first noted his observations about the indigenous body modification and is the first recorded use of the word tattoo to refer to the permanent marking of the skin. In the Ship's log book recorded this entry: \"Both sexes paint their Bodys, Tattow, as it is called in their Language. This is done by inlaying the Colour of Black under their skins, in such a manner as to be indelible.\" Cook went on to write, \"This method of Tattowing I shall now describe...As this is a painful operation, especially the Tattowing of their Buttocks, it is performed but once in their Lifetimes.\"\n\nCook's Science Officer and Expedition Botanist, Sir Joseph Banks, returned to England with a tattoo. Banks was a highly regarded member of the English aristocracy and had acquired his position with Cook by putting up what was at the time the princely sum of some ten thousand pounds in the expedition. In turn, Cook brought back with him a tattooed Raiatean man, Omai, whom he presented to King George and the English Court. Many of Cook's men, ordinary seamen and sailors, came back with tattoos, a tradition that would soon become associated with men of the sea in the public's mind and the press of the day. In the process sailors and seamen re-introduced the practice of tattooing in Europe and it spread rapidly to seaports around the globe.\n\nBy the 19th century tattooing had spread to British society but was still largely associated with sailors and the lower or even criminal class. Tattooing had however been practised in an amateur way by public schoolboys from at least the 1840s and by the 1870s had become fashionable among some members of the upper classes, including royalty. In its upmarket form it could be a lengthy, expensive and sometimes painful process.\n\nTattooing spread among the upper classes all over Europe in the 19th century, but particularly in Britain where it was estimated in Harmsworth Magazine in 1898 that as many as one in five members of the gentry were tattooed. Taking their lead from the British Court, where George V followed Edward VII's lead in getting tattooed; King Frederick IX of Denmark, the King of Romania, Kaiser Wilhelm II, King Alexander of Yugoslavia and even Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, all sported tattoos, many of them elaborate and ornate renditions of the Royal Coat of Arms or the Royal Family Crest. King Alfonso XIII of modern Spain also had a tattoo.\n\nThe perception that there is a marked class division on the acceptability of the practice has been a popular media theme in Britain, as successive generations of journalists described the practice as newly fashionable and no longer for a marginalised class. Examples of this cliché can be found in every decade since the 1870s. Despite this evidence, a myth persists that the upper and lower classes find tattooing attractive and the broader middle classes rejecting it. In 1969, the House of Lords debated a bill to ban the tattooing of minors, on grounds it had become \"trendy\" with the young in recent years but was associated with crime. It was noted that 40 per cent of young criminals had tattoos and that marking the skin in this way tended to encourage self-identification with criminal groups. Two peers, Lord Teynham and the Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair however rose to object that they had been tattooed as youngsters, with no ill effects. Since the 1970s tattoos have become more socially acceptable, and fashionable among celebrities. Tattoos are less prominent on figures of authority, and the practice of tattooing by the elderly is still considered remarkable.\n\nThe Jesuit Relations of 1652 describes tattooing among the Petun and the Neutrals:\nIn the period shortly after the American Revolution, to avoid impressment by British Navy ships, sailors used government issued protection papers to establish their American citizenship. However, many of the descriptions of the individual described in the seamen's protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the Royal Navy simply paid no attention to them. \"In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'\"\n\nOne way of making them more specific and more effective was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal as to subject and location, and thus use that description to precisely identify the seaman. As a result, many of the official certificates also carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as any other specific identifying information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen who wanted to avoid impressment. During this period, tattoos were not popular with the rest of the country. \"Frequently the \"protection papers\" made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos.\"\n\n\"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tattoos were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the protection papers issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-passports catalogued tattoos alongside birthmarks, scars, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as pigments, even gunpowder and urine. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols.\"\n\nSometimes, to protect themselves, the sailors requested not only that the tattoos be described, but that they would also be sketched out on the protection certificate as well. As one researched said, \"Clerks writing the documents often sketched the tattoos as well as describing them.\"\n\nSince the 1950s, a false belief has persisted that modern Western tattooing originated exclusively from Captain James Cook’s voyages to the South Pacific in the 1770s. Tattooing has been consistently present in Western society from the modern period stretching back to Ancient Greece. A long history of European tattoo predated these voyages, including among sailors and tradesmen, pilgrims visiting the Holy Land, and on Europeans living among Native Americans.\n\nTattoo historian Anna Felicity Friedman suggests a couple reasons for the \"Cook Myth.\" First, modern European words for the practice (e.g., “tattoo,” “tatuaje,” “tatouage,” “Tätowierung,” and “tatuagem”) derive from the Tahitian word “tatau,” which was introduced to European languages through Cook’s travels. However, prior European texts show that a variety of metaphorical terms were used for the practice, including “pricked,” “marked”, “engraved,” “decorated,” “punctured,” “stained,” and “embroidered.” Friedman also points out that the growing print culture at the time of Cook’s voyages may have increased the visibility of tattooing despite its prior existence in the West.\n\nThe first documented professional tattooer in the United States was Martin Hildebrandt, a German immigrant who arrived in Boston, Massachusetts in 1846. Between 1861 and 1865, he tattooed soldiers on both sides in the American Civil War. The first documented professional tattooist (with a permanent studio, working on members of the paying public) in Britain was Sutherland Macdonald in the early 1880s. Tattooing was an expensive and painful process, and by the late 1880s had become a mark of wealth for the crowned heads of Europe.\n\nIn 1891, New York tattooer Samuel O'Reilly patented the first electric tattoo machine, a modification of Thomas Edison's electric pen.\nThe earliest appearance of tattoos on women during this period were in the circus in the late 19th century. These \"Tattooed Ladies\" were covered — with the exception of their faces, hands, necks, and other readily visible areas — with various images inked into their skin. In order to lure the crowd, the earliest ladies, like Betty Broadbent and Nora Hildebrandt told tales of captivity; they usually claimed to have been taken hostage by Native Americans that tattooed them as a form of torture. However, by the late 1920s the sideshow industry was slowing and by the late 1990s the last tattooed lady was out of business.\n\nAlthough tattooing has steadily increased in popularity since the invention of the electric tattoo machine, it was not until the 1960s that the place of tattooing in popular culture radically shifted. The Tattoo Renaissance began in the late 1950s, and was greatly influenced by several artists in particular Lyle Tuttle, Cliff Raven, Don Nolan, Zeke Owens, Spider Webb, and Don Ed Hardy. A second generation of artists, trained by the first, continued these traditions into the 1970s, and included artists such as Bob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Jack Rudy.\n\nSince the 1970s, tattoos have become a mainstream part of global and Western fashion, common among both sexes, to all economic classes, and to age groups from the later teen years to middle age. The decoration of blues singer Janis Joplin with a wrist let and a small heart on her left breast, by the San Francisco tattoo artist Lyle Tuttle, has been called a seminal moment in the popular acceptance of tattoos as art. Formal interest in the art of the tattoo became prominent in the 1970s through the beginning of the 21st century. For many young Americans, the tattoo has taken on a decidedly different meaning than for previous generations. The tattoo has \"undergone dramatic redefinition\" and has shifted from a form of deviance to an acceptable form of expression.\n\nIn 1988, scholar Arnold Rubin created a collection of works regarding the history of tattoo cultures, publishing them as the \"Marks of Civilization\". In this, the term \"Tattoo Renaissance\" was coined, referring to a period marked by technological, artistic, and social change. Wearers of tattoos, as members of the counterculture began to display their body art as signs of resistance to the values of the white, heterosexual, middle-class. The clientele changed from sailors, bikers, and gang members to the middle and upper class. There was also a shift in iconography from the badge-like images based on repetitive pre-made designs known as flash to customized full-body tattoo influenced by Polynesian and Japanese tattoo art, known as sleeves, which are categorized under the relatively new and popular Avant-garde genre. Tattooers transformed into \"Tattoo Artists\": men and women with fine art backgrounds began to enter the profession alongside the older, traditional tattooists.\n\nTattoos have experienced a resurgence in popularity in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe, Japan, and North and South America. The growth in tattoo culture has seen an influx of new artists into the industry, many of whom have technical and fine arts training. Coupled with advancements in tattoo pigments and the ongoing refinement of the equipment used for tattooing, this has led to an improvement in the quality of tattoos being produced.\n\nJennifer LeRoy (Miss February 1993) was the first Playboy Playmate with a visible tattoo on her centerfold.\n\nDuring the 2000s, the presence of tattoos became evident within pop culture, inspiring television shows such as A&E's \"Inked\" and TLC's \"Miami Ink\" and \"LA Ink\". In addition, many celebrities have made tattoos more acceptable in recent years.\n\nContemporary art exhibitions and visual art institutions have featured tattoos as art through such means as displaying tattoo flash, examining the works of tattoo artists, or otherwise incorporating examples of body art into mainstream exhibits. One such 2009 Chicago exhibition, \"Freaks & Flash\", featured both examples of historic body art as well as the tattoo artists who produced it.\n\nIn 2010, 25% of Australians under age 30 had tattoos. Mattel released a tattooed Barbie doll in 2011, which was widely accepted, although it did attract some controversy.\n\nOver the past three decades Western tattooing has become a practice that has crossed social boundaries from \"low\" to \"high\" class along with reshaping the power dynamics regarding gender. It has its roots in \"exotic\" tribal practices of the Native Americans and Japanese, which are still seen in present times.\n\nAs various kinds of social movements progressed bodily inscription crossed class boundaries, and became common among the general public. Specifically, the tattoo is one access point for revolutionary aesthetics of women. Feminist theory has much to say on the subject. \"Bodies of Subversion: A Secret History of Women and Tattoo\", by Margot Mifflin, became the first history of women's tattoo art when it was released in 1997. In it, she documents women's involvement in tattooing coinciding to feminist successes, with surges in the 1880s, 1920s, and the 1970s. Today, women sometimes use tattoos as forms of bodily reclamation after traumatic experiences like abuse or breast cancer. In 2012, tattooed women outnumbered men for the first time in American history - according to a Harris poll, 23% of women in America had tattoos in that year, compared to 19% of men. In 2013, Miss Kansas, Theresa Vail, became the first Miss America contestant to show off tattoos during the swimsuit competition — the insignia of the U.S. Army Dental Corps on her left shoulder and one of the \"Serenity Prayer\" along the right side of her torso.\n\nIn August 2013, William Mullane of London was tattooed with a portrait of his late father which used ink mixed with a small portion of his father’s ashes.\n\nThe legal status of tattoos is still developing. In recent years, various lawsuits have arisen in the United States regarding the status of tattoos as a copyrightable art form. However, these cases have either been settled out of court or are currently being disputed, and therefore no legal precedent exists directly on point. The process of tattooing was held to be a purely expressive activity protected by the First Amendment by the Ninth Circuit in 2010.\n\nThroughout the world's different military branches, tattoos are either regulated under policies or strictly prohibited to fit dress code rules.\n\nThe United States Air Force regulates all kinds of body modification. Any tattoos which are deemed to be \"prejudicial to good order and discipline\", or \"of a nature that may bring discredit upon the Air Force\" are prohibited. Specifically, any tattoo which may be construed as \"obscene or advocate sexual, racial, ethnic or religious discrimination\" is disallowed. Tattoo removal may not be enough to qualify; resultant \"excessive scarring\" may be disqualifying. Further, Air Force members may not have tattoos on their neck, face, head, tongue, lips or scalp.\n\nTattoos in the Army are regulated under the new Sergeant Major of the Army Daniel A. Dailey. Under its new rules tattoos are strictly prohibited on the arms and legs and anywhere above the collar bone line, tattoos that are visible on other parts of the body cannot be any longer than two inches wide, and only one band tattoo is permitted in the body. Soldiers who are currently in the army, and are affected under the new policy are grandfathered to keep the current tattoos under the validation of their commanders.\n\nThe United States Coast Guard policy has changes over the years.Tattoos should not be visible over the collarbone or when wearing a V-neck shirt. Tattoos or military brands on the arms should not surpass the wrist. But only one hand tattoos of a form of ring are permitted when not exceeding ¼ inch width. Face tattoos are also permitted as permanent eyeliners for females as long as they are appropriately worn and not brightly colored to fit uniform dressing code. Disrespectful derogatory tattoos and sexually explicit are prohibited on the body.\n\nThe United States Marine Corps has disclosed a new policy meeting their new standards of professionalism in the military appearance, on the Marine Corps Bulletin 1020 released on 6 February 2016, substituting any previous policy from the past\".\"\n\nThe new policy in the Marine Corps unauthorized tattoo’s in different parts of the body such as the wrist, knee, elbow and above the collar bone. Wrist tattoos have to be two inches above the wrist, elbow tattoos two inches above and one inch below, and the knee two inches above and two below.\n\n[[File:Tattooed sailor aboard the USS New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Tattooed sailor aboard the \n[[Category:Art history by medium|Tattoo]]\n[[Category:Tattooing]]",
                "Maya society\n\nMaya society concerns the social organization of the Pre-Hispanic Mayas, its political structures and social classes.\n\nA Classic period Maya polity was a small kingdom (\"ajawil\", \"ajawlel\", \"ajawlil\") headed by a hereditary ruler – \"ajaw\", later \"k’uhul ajaw\". Both terms appear in early Colonial texts including \"Papeles de Paxbolón\" where they are used as synonyms for Aztec and Spanish terms for rulers and their domains. These are \"tlatoani\" and \"tlahtocayotl\" in Nahuatl, and the Spanish words \"rey\", \"majestad\", and \"reino\" and \"señor\" for ruler/leader/lord and \"señorío\" or \"dominio\" of realm. Such kingdoms were usually no more than a capital city with its neighborhood and several dependent towns (similar to a city-state). There were also larger polities that controlled larger territories and subjugated smaller polities; the extensive systems controlled by Tikal and Caracol serve as examples of these.\n\nEach kingdom had its name that did not necessarily correspond to any locality within its territory. Its identity was that of a political unit associated with a particular ruling dynasty. For instance, the archaeological site of Naranjo was the capital of the kingdom of Saal. The land (\"chan ch’e’n\") of the kingdom and its capital were called \"Wakab’nal\" or \"Maxam\" and were part of a larger geographical entity known as \"Huk Tsuk\". Despite constant warfare and eventual shifts in regional power, most kingdoms never disappeared from the political landscape until the collapse of the whole system in the 9th century. In this respect, Classic Maya kingdoms were similar to late Postclassic polities encountered by the Spanish in Yucatán and Central Mexico: some polities were subordinate to hegemonic centers or rulers through conquest and/or dynastic unions and yet even then they persisted as distinct entities.\nMayanists have been increasingly accepting the \"court paradigm\" of Classic Maya societies that puts the emphasis on the centrality of the royal household and especially the person of the king. This approach focuses on the totality of Maya monumental spaces as the embodiment of the diverse activities of the royal household. It considers the role of places and spaces (including dwellings of royalty and nobles, throne rooms, temples, halls and plazas for public ceremonies) in establishing and negotiating power and social hierarchy, but also in producing and projecting aesthetic and moral values that define the order of a wider social realm.\n\nSpanish sources invariably describe even the largest Maya settlements of Yucatán and Guatemala as dispersed agglomerations of dwellings grouped around the temples and palaces of the ruling dynasty and lesser nobles. Though there was economic specialization among Classic period Maya centers (see Chunchucmil, for example), it was not conducted at a scale similar to that of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. Some argue that Maya cities were not urban centers but were, instead, structured according to and conceptualized as enormous royal households, the locales of the administrative and ritual activities of the royal court. Within the theoretical framework of this model, they were the places where privileged nobles could approach the holy ruler, where aesthetical values of the high culture were formulated and disseminated, and where aesthetic items were consumed. They were the self-proclaimed centers and the sources of social, moral, and cosmic, order. The fall of a royal court as in the well-documented cases of Piedras Negras or Copán would cause the inevitable ‘death’ of the associated settlement.\n\nScribes held a prominent position in Maya courts and had their own patron deities (see Howler monkey gods and Maya maize god). They are likely to have come from aristocratic families. It appears that some scribes were attached to the royal house, while others were serving at temples and were, perhaps, counted among the priests. It seems likely that they were organized hierarchically. Maya art often depicts rulers with trappings indicating they were scribes or at least able to write, such as having pen bundles in their headdresses. Additionally, many rulers have been found in conjunction with writing tools such as shell or clay ink pots.\n\nAncient Maya kinship and descent have alternatively been described as patrilineal, matrilineal, and bilateral. Maya political organization has been characterized as both segmentary (involving well-defined lineages and clan-like structures) and centralized.\n\nTo the Maya, body modification is a reflection of a cultural, and individual identity. Through different modifications, the body can be experienced individually, used as a symbol, or as a political statement. Beauty was also used to outwardly show and perform social and moral values.\n\nPhysical remains of the Maya help piece together the motivation and significance for enduring vast amounts of pain, and using huge amounts of wealth to make themselves beautiful. Ancient Maya placed a high value on certain extreme body modifications, often undergoing tedious and painful procedures as a rite of passage, an homage to their gods, and as a permanently visible status symbol of their place in society that would last a lifetime, and into their afterlife. Therefore, there was aesthetic, religious, and social reasoning behind the modification. \n\nThe origin of cranial modification for the Maya is unknown, however it was possibly inherited from the Olmecs, predecessors of the Maya, located near the Tuxtla Mountains. Cranial modification was one of the Olmecs most important practices. Individuals enduring cranial modification could be of any status, but many more elite individuals were depicted with cranial modifications. Intentional deformation practices were used as a way to differentiate between members of the society. All members of an elite family were expected to go through cranial modification shortly after birth. The procedure occurred while the skull of the child was not fully grown and had some plasticity making it easily malleable. \n\nThere are as many as 14 different cranial shapes caused by several different types of purposeful modification or deformation techniques used by members of the Maya society. Neonatal deformation was performed in two main ways: compression of the head with pads and adjusted bindings, or restraining the child on specially designed cradles. Often, a binding device was attached to the forehead so instead of growing naturally into a round or circular form, the child’s cranium grew into a long, and tapered form which indented above the brow line. These different modifications resulted in an abundant amount of stress on the new child’s body, and often led to death.\n\n The two main head shapes of cranial modification for the Maya were erect deformation and oblique deformation. Erect deformation was modification through the use of cradle boards, which often left the occipital flattening asymmetrical, and affected a child’s mobility. Oblique deformation was modification through the use of a paddle applied to the head and was sometimes in use with a frontal board and bandaging. This type of deformation did not cause problems with mobility. Practiced by all members of society, there were distinct differences of temporal and regional preferences. \n\nDuring the Preclassic period, 2000 B.C. – A.D. 250, Maya skull modification imitated the head form of Olmec gods depicted throughout Olmec artwork. With the use of new and different techniques emerging in the Classic period, A.D. 250-900, new cranial modification styles were endured, possibly as an indicator of membership within a kin group, or as a sign of a specific status. Additionally, in the Classic period, the general population used the erect deformation style of modification, while children expected to have high-status positions were given oblique deformation. Around A.D. 900, the modification style standardized, and most human remains were found with tall skulls and flattened foreheads, the same modifications documented by the Spaniards when they arrived in Mesoamerica. \n\nRegional differences in cranial modification styles were also evident. Within the Western Maya lowlands, the popular style of modification imitated the shape of the Maize God’s head, and therefore, more people were discovered to have slanted skulls. High-status Maya mothers would artificially induce cross-eyedness (strabismus) and would strap on boards to flatten the foreheads of high-born infants as a lifelong sign of noble status. The eye condition was used to honor Kinich Ahau, the cross-eyed sun god of the Maya. Across the Guatemala highlands, erect deformation shapes were more likely to be used, and sometimes a band was placed vertically down the head to separate the head into two distinct sections. Cranial modification was able to draw lines between different ethnic groups, as well as represent social status/hierarchy within an individual culture.\nMost evidence of cranial deformation is found through osteological remains discovered through archaeological excavation of Maya sites. Through analysis of the different forms of the skulls, osteologists are able to differentiate between little difference in deformation styles to help understand minute differences between styles, and what these differences may mean. Interpretation of these different cranium types has been debated, but it is clear the shapes are different dependent based on time and region. As stated previously, Spanish and other European records provided detailed descriptions of cranium modification within their historical records. Some of the information the Spaniards recorded included the different types of methods, and the popular materials used for cranium modification. Lastly, other archaeological remains including art depictions, or figurines exhibiting modified skull shape help to illuminate the importance of distinguishing one’s self through the various types of modification. \n\nDue to a lack of written records on the reasons or motivation for cranial modification, the reason the head was the center of this modification is still not clear. One reason is possibly the need for children to be protected when they are born. The Maya believed when children were born, they were vulnerable and thus needed to be protected from soul loss and evil winds. The soul was encased within the head, and therefore these newly souled infants needed to be guarded; cranium modification was one of the ways to protect the soul from being snatched from the newborn. The head was understood to be a portal into a person’s true essence or essential entity, which could be harmed, stolen, or manipulated. Performing cranial modification as soon as the child was born ensured the soul, or essence, of the child was fully protected.\n\nAdditionally, hair was seen as a way to preserve the essence of the soul, \"tonalli,\" from leaving the head of the body. Cutting the hair of a boy too soon was thought to diminish that individual’s knowledge and reason. Lastly, \"Tzompantli\", or skull racks, were associated with passage to the celestial world, and the heads on the rack were believed to contain the essence of the individual spirits. Therefore, by killing an enemy and removing their skull’s from their bodies, the essence of the individual was violated.\n\nMembers of the community were expected to go through cranium modification as a part of a child’s integration into the society. Maya men aspired to look like their ruler, Pakal, who was meant to represent incarnations of the deities. Pakal’s body was shaped to resemble motifs and images of what the Sun and Maize gods were expected to look like. Evidence of the social hierarchy of the Maya was shown in pottery, figurines, drawings, monuments, and architecture picturing high-status elites with the oblique cranium modification. The oblique style cranuml modification, the style endured by Pakal, may have also meant to shape the head like a jaguar, a figure extremely important to Maya religion, sacred to their culture, and a status of power. Additionally, Maya women standards of beauty were also based on the Maize God. Overall, cranial modifications are significant because of their relation with deities and power symbols of the Maya and the outwardly performative aspect displaying specific characteristics of a member within the Maya culture and society. \n\nThe modification of teeth was dependent on social status, as well as location. Dental modification may have been a way to identify with a lineage, polity, ruler, or region. The Maya practiced primarily two different types: filing and inlay. Filing was altering the tooth shape to create notches, grooves, or points. This type of dental modification appeared during the Early Preclassic period (1400-1000 B.C.) and was completed with stone abraders and water. Inlay was drilling holes to insert different materials, and was popular throughout the Middle Preclassic period (900-600 B.C.). In the remainder of the time periods the two were used simultaneously, but filing was much more common overall. \n\nMost likely teeth were modified as a part of ritual or for aesthetic purposes, and younger children usually did not have modified teeth. Once their permanent teeth had arrived, adolescent warriors had their teeth filed to sharp points to give them a fierce appearance, and as a further mark of status. Maya women filed their teeth, or had holes drilled into them where precious stones or luxury materials, such as jade, pyrite, hematite, or turquoise could be inlaid into the teeth. High-status women often had their teeth filed, in different patterns, and would have jadeite, hematite, pyrite, turquoise, or other decorations inset into holes drilled in their teeth. Depending on the material, the meaning of the inlay varied. For example, jade symbolized pure breath or the ability to express elegant speech.\n\nOverall, little evidence for the relationship between socioeconomic status and types of dental modification exists. Most evidence comes from documentation of Europeans in the 16 century who viewed the processes of dental modification. However, these accounts can be problematic as they are filled with bias, and much of the process may be recorded incorrectly, or emphasized in a way to villainize the Maya. More concrete evidence is found through archaeological of ceramics or iconography, and osteological remains of Maya people themselves. Iconographic or images of dental modification, including filling and inlay, are pictured on ceramics or within paintings found at Maya or other Mesoamerican sites. Additionally, teeth of Maya individuals have been excavated from Maya sites and analyzed by dendrologists and other dental specialists recognized dental disease associated with excess filling or drilling of the teeth. This means dental modification was occurring on living subjects. Dental diseases found on the remains of the teeth of Maya individuals shows evidence for excessive dental modifications. Additionally, some of the dental remains were inlaid with various stones, and were filed in a variety of ways. \n\nModification of the teeth was important as different teeth styles exhibited certain characteristics and motifs important to Maya religion, and social status. “Modified dentition conveyed ideas about wealth, threat, and the nature of speech.” Incisors were filed in “T” shape to represent “wind” motifs, as wind was especially important to the Maya embodying the “life force” and a way to honor the maize god. Pakal, the Maya King, had his teeth filed in the shape of a “T” as a way to change the structure of his facial features to make it look as though he were squinting, a direct reflection of the maize god. Teeth were an advertisement of status and as it was an abundant amount of pain, it was likely a rite of passage into adulthood, signifying the ability to tolerate pain. Overall, dental modification was meant to show a specific kind of status, despite being endured by both men and women of various classes. Enduring this type of pain exhibited traits about the overall character of an individual, and congratulated members for reaching a milestone of life. \n\nBody paint, tattoos, and scarification were all used in different ways by the Mayan to signify important events in ones life, as well as to symbolize differing class distinctions. As evidence of skin modification from human remains can not be studied, the evidence for tattooing, scarification, and body paint among the Maya comes from iconographic images such as pottery and murals, artifacts such as tools and vessels used for storing pigment, as well as ethnohistoric accounts.\n\nBody paint patterns were incredibly localized and color and design varied according to location. Two of the most widely used colors among the Maya were red, which was made of cinnabar or vermilion, with hematite and iron ore added. Another popular culture, and one that was possibly the most valued among the Mayans was a blue or green pigment made with indigo and a mineral called Palygorskite. This blue/green color was highly valued because it was associated not only with jade, but with sacrifice to the gods as well. Spanish explorer Diego de Landa states in one of his accounts:\n\n\"...they had the custom of painting their faces and bodies red... they thought it very pleasing...the victim...having smeared him with blue... they brought him up to the round alter...\" The evidence for body painting among the Mayan largely comes from various murals. One mural found in Bonampak, Chiapa shows a man being painted red from the neck down by a servant while a woman’s face is painted red. Another mural found at Calakmul depicts merchants and non-elites wearing face paint of various colors and designs, suggesting that paint may have been used to differentiate class and gender.\n\nWhile there is a physical difference between scarification and tattoos, the Mayans may not have differentiated between the two practices. Tattoos and scarification were used to mark significant events in a Mayan’s life. Diego de Landa says: \"A thief from the highest class is punished by having his face tattooed on both sides from the beard to the forehead. … the young men do not tattoo except to a slight degree until marriage.”Scholar Cara Tremain argues that some tattoos and scars may have been associated with the elite, as “killing” and “rebirth” of the skin through cutting creates an association with death and the rebirth of deities. Tremain also argues that some types of tattooing and scarification symbolized valor and bravery. This theory is supported by the accounts of Diego de Landa who said: “They tattooed their bodies, and the more they do this, the more brave and valiant are they considered, as tattooing is accompanied with great suffering, and is done in this way. Those who do the work first painted the part which they wish with color and afterwards they delicately cut in the paintings, and so with the blood and coloring matter the marks remained in the body. This work is done a little at a time on account of the extreme pain, an afterwards also they were quite sick with it, since the designs festered and matter formed. In spite of all this they made fun of those who were not tattooed.”\n\nThe practice of piercing one’s ears, lips, nose, or cheeks was shared by all Mayans, but it was the type of jewelry worn that was used to differentiate social status. Children would be pierced at a young age as well, with ear flares and spools getting increasingly bigger as the child aged, stretching the ear. The majority of evidence for Mayan piercings comes from archaeological remains of jewelry found in tombs, such as labrets and ear spools. Ethnohistorical accounts also provide us evidence for the amount and high quality of the piercings the Mayans wore. In an account of his travels the Spanish Bishop Diego Lopez de Cogolludiois stated:“The holes in the noses and ears [were filled with] nose and ear pieces of cuzas and other stones of varied colors.”\n\nThe Mayas employed warfare in each period of their development for the purposes of obtaining sacrificial victims, settling competitive rivalries, acquiring critical resources and gaining control of trade routes. Warfare was important to the Maya religion, because raids on surrounding areas provided the victims required for human sacrifice, as well as slaves for the construction of temples. Large-scale battles were also fought to determine and defend territories as well as secure economic power. The Mayas defended their cities with defensive structures such as palisades, gateways, and earthworks. Some cities had a wall within the outer wall, so advancing enemies would be trapped in a killing alley, where they could be slaughtered in great number. During the post-Classic period, the amount of internal warfare increased greatly as the region became more politically fragmented. Armies were enlarged, and in some cases mercenaries were hired. The resulting destruction of many urban centers contributed to the decline of the Maya.\n\nThe ruler of a Maya city was the supreme war captain. Some only dictated military activity, while others participated in the battle. There was a core of warriors that served year-round as guards and obtained sacrificial victims, but most large Maya cities and religious centers had militias. These men were paid to fight for the duration of the battle. Then they would return to their fields or crafts. The militia units were headed by nacoms, hereditary war chiefs, that employed ritual as well as strategic methods in warfare. Some nacoms were only chief strategists, and the troops were led into battle by batabs, or officers. In a large war, even commoners who did not have weapons would fight using hunting tools and by hurling rocks. “In the highlands, women occasionally fought in battles according to native chronicles” (Foster, 144).\n\nThe jungle terrain of Mesoamerica made it difficult for large armies to reach their destination. The warriors who were familiar with the battle landscape could strategically retreat into familiar wilderness. Other war tactics included the siege of cities and the formation of alliances with lesser enemies to defeat more prominent ones. There is evidence that canoes were used to attack cities, located on lakes and rivers. In the late Classic period, destructive warfare methods, such as burning, became more prevalent.\n\nWarfare was a ritual process, which was believed to be sanctioned by the gods. Military leaders, in many instances, also had religious authority. Before going into battle, the armies would call upon the gods with dances and music of drums, whistles, conch shell horns and singing. The drumming and war cries would signify the start of the battle. The armies also carried religious idols into battle to inspire the warriors. They fought fiercely because they believed that death on the battle field secured them eternal bliss, whereas capture by the enemy was regarded as worse than any death. When an enemy was defeated, the victorious army exploited the religious icons and sometimes humiliated the defeated leader with prolonged captivity. The treatment of prisoners by the victorious was brutal and often ended in decapitation. The Maya also had a ritual of giving blood. The reason that they gave blood was to show respect to their gods. They gave blood from their genitals and tongue. Afterwards, they would drip their blood onto a piece of paper and burn it into the sky to show respect to their gods.\n\nWeapons used by the Maya included spear-throwers known as atlatls, blowguns, obsidian spiked clubs, spears, axes, lances and knives tipped with flint or obsidian blades. Bow and arrows were also used, but not as extensively. Though there were few helmets, they used decorated shields made from woven mats, wood and animal skins for protection. The Maya war leaders dressed to inspire their warriors and terrify their enemies. They usually wore padded cotton armor, a mantle with religious insignia, and elaborate wooden and cloth headdresses, that represented the animal spirit or “way” of the warrior. Metal was not used in battle because of the limited supply.\n\n\n"

                "Tattoo\n\nA tattoo is a form of body modification where a design is made by inserting ink, dyes and pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment. Tattoos fall into three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning); symbolic (with a specific meaning pertinent to the wearer); pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item). Tattoos have historically been regarded in the West as 'uncivilised', and over the last 100 years the fashion has been associated mainly with sailors, working men and criminals. By the end of the 20th Century many Western stigmas of the tattoo culture had been dismissed and the practice has become more acceptable and accessible for people of all trades and levels of society.\n\nThe word \"tattoo\", or \"tattow\" in the 18th century, is a loanword from the Polynesian word \"tatau\", meaning \"to write\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" gives the etymology of tattoo as \"In 18th c. tattaow, tattow. From Polynesian (Samoan, Tahitian, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as painting, scarring, or staining.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat or performance — see \"military tattoo\". In this case, the English word \"tattoo\" is derived from the Dutch word \"taptoe\".\n\nThe first written reference to the word \"tattoo\" (or \"tatau\") appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard explorer Captain Cook's ship the \"HMS Endeavour\": \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humour or disposition\".\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by Cook, when he returned in 1769 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\".\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\nMainstream art galleries hold exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs such as \"Beyond Skin\", at the Museum of Croydon. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word \"irezumi\" means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using \"tebori\", the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is \"horimono\". Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing.\n\nAnthropologist Ling Roth in 1900 described four methods of skin marking and suggested they be differentiated under the names \"tatu\", \"moko\", \"cicatrix\", and \"keloid\".\n\nThe American Academy of Dermatology distinguishes five types of tattoos: traumatic tattoos, also called \"natural tattoos\", that result from injuries, especially asphalt from road injuries or pencil lead; amateur tattoos; professional tattoos, both via traditional methods and modern tattoo machines; cosmetic tattoos, also known as \"permanent makeup\"; and medical tattoos.\n\nAccording to George Orwell, coal miners could develop characteristic tattoos owing to coal dust getting into wounds. This can also occur with substances like gunpowder. Similarly, a traumatic tattoo occurs when a substance such as asphalt is rubbed into a wound as the result of some kind of accident or trauma. These are particularly difficult to remove as they tend to be spread across several layers of skin, and scarring or permanent discoloration is almost unavoidable depending on the location. An amalgam tattoo is when amalgam particles are implanted in to the soft tissues of the mouth, usually the gums, during dental filling placement or removal; another example of such accidental tattoos is the result of a deliberate or accidental stabbing with a pencil or pen, leaving graphite or ink beneath the skin.\n\nMany tattoos serve as rites of passage, marks of status and rank, symbols of religious and spiritual devotion, decorations for bravery, sexual lures and marks of fertility, pledges of love, amulets and talismans, protection, and as punishment, like the marks of outcasts, slaves and convicts. The symbolism and impact of tattoos varies in different places and cultures. Tattoos may show how a person feels about a relative (commonly mother/father or daughter/son) or about an unrelated person. Today, people choose to be tattooed for artistic, cosmetic, sentimental/memorial, religious, and magical reasons, and to symbolize their belonging to or identification with particular groups, including criminal gangs (see criminal tattoos) or a particular ethnic group or law-abiding subculture. Some Māori still choose to wear intricate moko on their faces. In Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, the yantra tattoo is used for protection against evil and to increase luck. Text-based tattoos including quotes, lyrics, personal mottos or scripture are popular in western culture. As an example some Christians might have a Psalm or verse from the Bible tattooed on their body. Popular verses include John 3:16, Philippians 4:13, and Psalms 23.\n\nExtensive decorative tattooing is common among members of traditional freak shows and by performance artists who follow in their tradition.\n\nPeople have also been forcibly tattooed.\n\nA well-known example is the Nazi practice of forcibly tattooing Nazi concentration camp inmates with identification numbers during The Holocaust as part of the Nazis' identification system, beginning in fall 1941. The Nazis' SS introduced the practice at Auschwitz concentration camp in order to identify the bodies of registered prisoners in the concentration camps. During registration, the Nazis would pierce the outlines of the serial-number digits onto the prisoners' arms. Of the Nazi concentration camps, only Auschwitz put tattoos on inmates. The tattoo was the prisoner's camp number, sometimes with a special symbol added: some Jews had a triangle, and Romani had the letter \"Z\" (from German \"Zigeuner\" for \"Gypsy\"). In May 1944, the Jewish men received the letters \"A\" or \"B\" to indicate particular series of numbers. For unknown reasons, this number series for women never began again with the \"B\" series after they had reached the number limit of 20,000 for the \"A\" series. The practice continued until the last days of Auschwitz.\n\nTattoos have also been used for identification in other ways. As early as the Zhou, Chinese authorities would employ facial tattoos as a punishment for certain crimes or to mark prisoners or slaves. During the Roman Empire, Roman soldiers were required by law to have identifying tattoos on their hands in order to make desertion difficult. Gladiators and slaves were likewise tattooed: exported slaves were tattooed with the words \"tax paid\", and it was a common practice to tattoo \"Stop me, I'm a runaway\" on their foreheads. Owing to the Biblical strictures against the practice, Emperor Constantine I banned tattooing the face around AD 330, and the Second Council of Nicaea banned all body markings as a pagan practice in AD 787.\n\nIn the period of early contact between the Māori and Europeans, the Maori people hunted and decapitated each other for their moko tattoos, which they traded for European items including axes and firearms. Moko tattoos were facial designs worn to indicate lineage, social position, and status within the tribe. The tattoo art was a sacred marker of identity among the Maori and also referred to as a vehicle for storing one's tapu, or spiritual being, in the afterlife.\nTattoos are sometimes used by forensic pathologists to help them identify burned, putrefied, or mutilated bodies. As tattoo pigment lies encapsulated deep in the skin, tattoos are not easily destroyed even when the skin is burned.\n\nTattoos are also placed on animals, though rarely for decorative reasons. Pets, show animals, thoroughbred horses, and livestock are sometimes tattooed with identification and other marks. Tattooing with a 'slap mark' on the shoulder or on the ear is the standard identification method in commercial pig farming. Branding is used for similar reasons and is often performed without anesthesia, but is different from tattooing as no ink or dye is inserted during the process, the mark instead being caused by permanent scarring of the skin. Pet dogs and cats are sometimes tattooed with a serial number (usually in the ear, or on the inner thigh) via which their owners can be identified. However, the use of a microchip has become an increasingly popular choice and since 2016 is a legal requirement for all 8.5 million pet dogs in the UK.\n\nThe cosmetic surgery industry continues to see a trend of increased popularity for both surgical and noninvasive procedures. When used as a form of cosmetics, tattooing includes permanent makeup and hiding or neutralizing skin discolorations. Permanent makeup is the use of tattoos to enhance eyebrows, lips (liner and/or lipstick), eyes (liner), and even moles, usually with natural colors, as the designs are intended to resemble makeup.\n\nA growing trend in the US and UK is to place artistic titoos over the surgical scars of a mastectomy. \"More women are choosing not to reconstruct after a mastectomy and tattoo over the scar tissue instead... The mastectomy tattoo will become just another option for post cancer patients and a truly personal way of regaining control over post cancer bodies and proving once and for all that breast cancer is not just a pink ribbon.\" The tattooing of nipples on reconstructed breasts remains in high demand, however.\n\nFunctional tattoos are used primarily for a purpose other than aesthetics. One such use is to tattoo Alzheimer patients with their name, so they may be easily identified if they go missing.\n\nMedical tattoos are used to ensure instruments are properly located for repeated application of radiotherapy and for the areola in some forms of breast reconstruction. Tattooing has also been used to convey medical information about the wearer (e.g., blood group, medical condition, etc.). Additionally, tattoos are used in skin tones to cover vitiligo, a skin pigmentation disorder.\n\nSS blood group tattoos (German: Blutgruppentätowierung) were worn by members of the Waffen-SS in Nazi Germany during World War II to identify the individual's blood type. After the war, the tattoo was taken to be prima facie, if not perfect, evidence of being part of the Waffen-SS, leading to potential arrest and prosecution. This led a number of Ex-Waffen-SS to shoot themselves through the arm with a gun, removing the tattoo and leaving scars like the ones resulting from pox inoculation, making the removal less obvious.\n\nTattoos were probably also used in ancient medicine as part of the treatment of the patient. In 1898, Daniel Fouquet, a medical doctor, wrote an article on “medical tattooing” practices in Ancient Egypt, in which he describes the tattooed markings on the female mummies found at the Deir el-Bahari site. He speculated that the tattoos and other scarifications observed on the bodies may have served a medicinal or therapeutic purpose: \"The examination of these scars, some white, others blue, leaves in no doubt that they are not, in essence, ornament, but an established treatment for a condition of the pelvis, very probably chronic pelvic peritonitis.\"\n\nPreserved tattoos on ancient mummified human remains reveal that tattooing has been practiced throughout the world for many centuries. The Ainu, an indigenous people of Japan, traditionally had facial tattoos, as did the Austroasians. Today, one can find Atayal, Seediq, Truku, and Saisiyat of Taiwan, Berbers of Tamazgha (North Africa), Yoruba, Fulani and Hausa people of Nigeria, and Māori of New Zealand with facial tattoos. Tattooing was popular among certain ethnic groups in southern China, Polynesia, Africa, Borneo, Cambodia, Europe, Japan, the Mentawai Islands, MesoAmerica, New Zealand, North America and South America, the Philippines, Iron Age Britain, and Taiwan. In 2015, scientific re-assessment of the age of the two oldest known tattooed mummies, identified Ötzi as the oldest currently known example. This body, with 61 tattoos, was found embedded in glacial ice in the Alps, and was dated to 3,250 BC.\nIt is a myth that the modern revival of tattooing stems from Captain James Cook's three voyages to the South Pacific in the late 18th century. Certainly, Cook's voyages and the dissemination of the texts and images from them brought more awareness about tattooing (and, as noted above, imported the word \"tattow\" into Western languages), but Europeans have been tattooed throughout history. On Cook's first voyage in 1768, his science officer and expedition botanist, Sir Joseph Banks, as well as artist Sydney Parkinson and many others of the crew, returned to England with tattoos, although many of these men would have had pre-existing tattoos. Banks was a highly regarded member of the English aristocracy that had acquired his position with Cook by co-financing the expedition with ten thousand pounds, a very large sum at the time. In turn, Cook brought back with him a tattooed Raiatean man, Omai, whom he presented to King George and the English Court. On subsequent voyages other crew members, from officers, such as American John Ledyard, to ordinary seamen, were tattooed. \n\nThe first documented professional tattooist in Britain was established in the port of Liverpool in the 1870s. In Britain tattooing was still largely associated with sailors and the lower or even criminal class, but by the 1870s had become fashionable among some members of the upper classes, including royalty, and in its upmarket form it could be an expensive and sometimes painful process. A marked class division on the acceptability of the practice continued for some time in Britain. Recently a trend has arisen marketed as 'Stick and Poke' tattooing; primitive figures are permanently inscribed by the user himself after he obtains a 'DIY' kit containing needles, ink and a collection of suggestions.\n\nAs most tattoos in the U.S. were done by Polynesian and Japanese amateurs, tattoo artists were in great demand in port cities all over the world, especially by European and American sailors. The first recorded professional tattoo artist in the United States was a German immigrant, Martin Hildebrandt. He opened a shop in New York City in 1846 and quickly became popular during the American Civil War among soldiers and sailors of both Union and Confederate militaries.\n\nHildebrandt began traveling from camp to camp to tattoo soldiers, making his popularity increase, and also giving birth to the tradition of getting tattoos while being an American serviceman. Soon after the Civil War, tattoos became fashionable among upper-class young adults. This trend lasted until the beginning of World War I. The invention of the electric tattoo machine caused popularity of tattoos among the wealthy to drop off. The machine made the tattooing procedure both much easier and cheaper, thus, eliminating the status symbol tattoos previously held, as they were now affordable for all socioeconomic classes. The status symbol of a tattoo shifted from a representation of wealth, to a mark typically seen on rebels and criminals. Despite this change, tattoos remained popular among military servicemen, and the tradition continues today.\n\nMany studies have been done of the tattooed population and society's view of tattoos. In June 2006, the \"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology\" published the results of a telephone survey of 2004. It found that 36% of Americans ages 18–29, 24% of those 30–40, and 15% of those 41–51 had a tattoo. In September 2006, the Pew Research Center conducted a telephone survey that found that 36% of Americans ages 18–25, 40% of those 26–40 and 10% of those 41–64 had a tattoo. They concluded that Generation X and Generation Y are not afraid to express themselves through their appearance, and tattoos are the most popular form of self-expression. In January 2008, a survey conducted online by Harris Interactive estimated that 14% of all adults in the United States have a tattoo, slightly down from 2003, when 16% had a tattoo. Among age groups, 9% of those ages 18–24, 32% of those 25–29, 25% of those 30–39 and 12% of those 40–49 have tattoos, as do 8% of those 50–64. Men are slightly more likely to have a tattoo than women.\n\nRichmond, Virginia, has been cited as one of the most tattooed cities in the United States. That distinction led the Valentine Richmond History Center to create an online exhibit titled \"History, Ink: The Tattoo Archive Project.\" The introduction to the exhibit notes, \"In the past, western culture associated tattoos with those individuals who lived on the edge of society; however, today they are recognized as a legitimate art form and widely accepted in mainstream culture.\"\n\nSince the 1970s, tattoos have become a mainstream part of Western fashion, common among all genders, to all economic classes, and to age groups from the later teen years to middle age. For many young Americans, the tattoo has taken on a decidedly different meaning than for previous generations. The tattoo has \"undergone dramatic redefinition\" and has shifted from a form of deviance to an acceptable form of expression.\n\nProtection papers were used by American sailors to prevent themselves from being taken off American ships and impressed into the Royal Navy. These were simple documents that described the sailor as being an American sailor. Many of the protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the Royal Navy paid no attention to them. \"In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'\" One way of making them more specific was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal, and thus use that description to identify the seaman. As a result, many of the later certificates carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as other specific information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen. \"Frequently their 'protection papers' made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos.\"\n\n\"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tattoos were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the protection papers issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-passports catalogued tattoos alongside birthmarks, scars, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as pigments, even gunpowder and urine. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols.\"\n\nBecause these protection papers were used to define freemen and citizenship, many black sailors and other men also used them to show that they were freemen if they were stopped by officials or slave catchers. They also called them \"free papers\" because they certified their non-slave status. Many of the freed blacks used descriptions of tattoos for identification purposes on their freedom papers.\n\nTattooing involves the placement of pigment into the skin's dermis, the layer of dermal tissue underlying the epidermis. After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a homogenized damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the immune system's phagocytes to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin granulation tissue forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by collagen growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within fibroblasts, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, but in the long term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.\nSome tribal cultures traditionally created tattoos by cutting designs into the skin and rubbing the resulting wound with ink, ashes or other agents; some cultures continue this practice, which may be an adjunct to scarification. Some cultures create tattooed marks by hand-tapping the ink into the skin using sharpened sticks or animal bones (made like needles) with clay formed disks or, in modern times, needles.\n\nThe most common method of tattooing in modern times is the electric tattoo machine, which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle or a group of needles that are soldered onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit. The unit rapidly and repeatedly drives the needles in and out of the skin, usually 80 to 150 times a second. The needles are single-use needles that come packaged individually.\n\nTattooing is regulated in many countries because of the associated health risks to client and practitioner, specifically local infections and virus transmission. Disposable plastic aprons and eye protection can be worn depending on the risk of blood or other secretions splashing into the eyes or clothing of the tattoist. Hand hygiene, assessment of risks and appropriate disposal of all sharp objects and materials contaminated with blood are crucial areas. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. All equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use. It is good practice to provide clients with a printed consent form that outlines risks and complications as well as instructions for after care.\n\nThe Government of Meiji Japan had outlawed tattoos in the 19th century, a prohibition that stood for 70 years before being repealed in 1948. As of 6 June 2012 all new tattoos are forbidden for employees of the city of Osaka. Existing tattoos are required to be covered with proper clothing. The regulations were added to Osaka's ethical codes, and employees with tattoos were encouraged to have them removed. This was done because of the strong connection of tattoos with the yakuza, or Japanese organized crime, after an Osaka official in February 2012 threatened a schoolchild by showing his tattoo.\n\nTattoos had negative connotations in historical China, where criminals often had been marked by tattooing. The association of tattoos with criminals was transmitted from China to influence Japan. Today, tattoos have remained a taboo in Chinese society.\n\nThe Romans tattooed criminals and slaves, and in the 19th century released US convicts, Australian convicts, and British army deserters were identified by tattoos. Prisoners in Nazi concentration camps were tattooed with an identification number. Today, many prison inmates still tattoo themselves as an indication of time spent in prison.\n\nNative Americans also used tattoos to represent their tribe. Catholic Croats of Bosnia used religious Christian tattooing, especially of children and women, for protection against conversion to Islam during the Ottoman rule in the Balkans.\n\nTattoos are strongly empirically associated with deviance, personality disorders, and criminality. Although the general acceptance of tattoos is on the rise in Western society, they still carry a heavy stigma among certain social groups. Tattoos are generally considered an important part of the culture of the Russian mafia.\n\nCurrent cultural understandings of tattoos in Europe and North America have been greatly influenced by long-standing stereotypes based on deviant social groups in the 19th and 20th centuries. Particularly in North America tattoos have been associated with stereotypes, folklore, and racism. Not until the 1960s and 1970s did people associate tattoos with such societal outcasts as bikers and prisoners. Today, in the United States many prisoners and criminal gangs use distinctive tattoos to indicate facts about their criminal behavior, prison sentences, and organizational affiliation. A teardrop tattoo, for example, can be symbolic of murder, or each tear represents the death of a friend. At the same time, members of the U.S. military have an equally well-established and longstanding history of tattooing to indicate military units, battles, kills, etc., an association that remains widespread among older Americans. In Japan tattoos are associated with yakuza criminal groups but there are non-yakuza groups such as Fukushi Masaichi's tattoo association that sought to preserve the skins of dead Japanese who have extensive tattoos. Tattooing is also common in the British Armed Forces. Depending on vocation tattoos are accepted in a number of professions in America. Companies across many fields are increasingly focused on diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn Britain, there is evidence of women with tattoos, concealed by their clothing, throughout the 20th century, and records of women tattoists such as Jessie Knight from the 1920s. A study of \"at-risk\" (as defined by school absenteeism and truancy) adolescent girls showed a positive correlation between body modification and negative feelings towards the body and low self-esteem; however, the study also demonstrated that a strong motive for body modification is the search for \"self and attempts to attain mastery and control over the body in an age of increasing alienation\". The prevalence of women in the tattoo industry in the 21st century, along with larger numbers of women bearing tattoos, appears to be changing negative perceptions.\n\nFormer sailor Rowland Hussey Macy, who formed Macy's department stores, used a red star tattoo that he had on his hand for the store's logo.\n\nTattoos have also been used in marketing and advertising with companies paying people to have logos of brands like HBO, Red Bull, ASOS.com, and Sailor Jerry's rum tattooed in their bodies. This practice is known as \"skinvertising\".\n\nB.T.'s Smokehouse, a barbecue restaurant located in Massachusetts, offered customers free meals for life if they had the logo of the establishment tattooed on a visible part of their bodies. Nine people took the business up on the offer.\n\nBecause it requires breaking the skin barrier, tattooing carries health risks including infection and allergic reactions. Tattooing can be uncomfortable to excruciating depending on the area and can result in the person fainting. Modern tattooists reduce risks by following universal precautions working with single-use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. Many jurisdictions require that tattooists have blood-borne pathogen training such as that provided through the Red Cross and OSHA. As of 2009 (in the United States) there have been no reported cases of HIV contracted from tattoos.\n\nIn amateur tattooing, such as that practiced in prisons, however, there is an elevated risk of infection. Infections that can theoretically be transmitted by the use of unsterilized tattoo equipment or contaminated ink include surface infections of the skin, fungal infections, some forms of hepatitis, herpes simplex virus, HIV, staph, tetanus, and tuberculosis.\n\nTattoo inks have been described as \"remarkably nonreactive histologically\". However, cases of allergic reactions to tattoo inks, particularly certain colors, have been medically documented. This is sometimes due to the presence of nickel in an ink pigment, which triggers a common metal allergy. Occasionally, when a blood vessel is punctured during the tattooing procedure, a bruise/hematoma may appear.\n\nCertain colours - red or similar colours such as purple, pink, and orange - tend to cause more problems and damage compared to other colours. Red ink has even caused skin and flesh damages so severe that the amputation of a leg or an arm has been necessary. If part of a tattoo (especially if red) begins to cause even minor troubles, like becoming itchy or worse, lumpy, then Danish experts strongly suggest to remove the red parts.\n\nIn 2017, researchers from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in France say the chemicals in tattoo ink can travel in the bloodstream and accumulate in the lymph nodes, obstructing their ability to fight infections. However, the authors noted in their paper that most tattooed individuals including the donors analyzed do not suffer from chronic inflammation.\n\nWhile tattoos are considered permanent, it is sometimes possible to remove them, fully or partially, with laser treatments. Typically, black and some colored inks can be removed more completely than inks of other colors. The expense and pain associated with removing tattoos are typically greater than the expense and pain associated with applying them. Pre-laser tattoo removal methods include dermabrasion, salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with salt), cryosurgery, and excision—which is sometimes still used along with skin grafts for larger tattoos. These older methods, however, have been nearly completely replaced by laser removal treatment options.\n\nA temporary tattoo is a non-permanent image on the skin resembling a permanent tattoo. Temporary tattoos can be drawn, painted, airbrushed or needled as a permanent tattoo with an ink which can be dissolved in blood within 6 months of art as a form of body painting.\n\nDecal (press-on) temporary tattoos are used to decorate any part of the body. They may last for a day or for more than a week.\n\nFoil temporary tattoos are a variation of decal-style temporary tattoos, printed using a foil stamping technique instead of using ink. The foil design is printed as a mirror image in order to be viewed in the right direction once it is applied to the skin. Each metallic tattoo is protected by a transparent protective film.\n\nAlthough they have become more popular and usually require a greater investment, airbrush temporary tattoos are less likely to achieve the look of a permanent tattoo, and may not last as long as press-on temporary tattoos. An artist sprays on airbrush tattoos using a stencil with alcohol-based, FDA-approved cosmetic inks. Like decal tattoos, airbrush temporary tattoos also are easily removed with rubbing alcohol or baby oil.\n\nAnother tattoo alternative is henna-based tattoos, which generally contain no additives. Henna is a plant-derived substance which is painted on the skin, staining it a reddish-orange-to-brown color. Because of the semi-permanent nature of henna, they lack the realistic colors typical of decal temporary tattoos. Due to the time-consuming application process, it is a relatively poor option for children. If you do choose henna temporary tattoos, ensure that they are pure henna. Dermatological publications report that allergic reactions to natural henna are very rare and the product is generally considered safe for skin application. Serious problems can occur, however, from the use of henna with certain additives. The FDA and medical journals report that painted black henna temporary tattoos are especially dangerous. Black Henna or Pre-Mixed Henna Temporary Tattoos May Be Harmful - see below for safety information.\n\nDecal temporary tattoos, when legally sold in the United States, have had their color additives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as cosmetics --- the FDA has determined these colorants are safe for “direct dermal contact.” While the FDA has received some accounts of minor skin irritation, including redness and swelling, from this type of temporary tattoo, the agency has found these symptoms to be “child specific” and not significant enough to support warnings to the public. Unapproved pigments, however, which are sometimes used by non-US manufacturers, can provoke allergic reactions in anyone. Understanding the types of temporary tattoos available to consumers, knowing where they are manufactured, and ensuring they come from a reliable source are keys to determining whether temporary tattoos are safe.\n\nThe types of airbrush paints manufactured for crafting, creating art or decorating clothing should never be used for tattooing. These paints are not approved for direct contact with skin, and can be allergenic or toxic. Always ask the airbrush tattoo artist what kind of ink he or she is using and whether it meets FDA approval.\n\nThe FDA regularly issues warnings to consumers about avoiding any temporary tattoos labeled as black henna or pre-mixed henna as these may contain potentially harmful ingredients including silver nitrate, carmine, pyrogallol, disperse orange dye and chromium. Black henna gets its color from paraphenylenediamine (PPD), a textile dye approved by the FDA for human use only in hair coloring. In Canada, the use of PPD on the skin, including hair dye, is banned. Research has linked these and other ingredients to a range of health problems including allergic reactions, chronic inflammatory reactions, and late-onset allergic reactions to related clothing and hairdressing dyes. They can cause these reactions long after application. Neither black henna nor pre-mixed henna are approved for cosmetic use by the FDA.\n\nJudaism generally prohibits tattoos among its adherents based on the commandments in Leviticus 19. Jews tend to believe this commandment only applies to Jews and not to gentiles.\nThere is no specific rule in the New Testament prohibiting tattoos and most Christian denominations believe the laws in Leviticus are outdated as well as believing the commandment only applied to the Israelites, not to the gentiles. While most Christian groups tolerate tattoos, some Evangelical and fundamentalist Protestant denominations do believe the commandment does apply today for Christians and believe it is a sin to get one.\n\nMany Coptic Christians in Egypt take a cross tattoo in their right wrist to differ from the Muslims.\n\nTattoos are considered to be haram in Sunni Islam, based on rulings from scholars and passages in the Hadith. Shia Islam does not entirely prohibit tattooing, although it may be looked down upon in Shia communities.\n\nAnthropological\n\nPopular and artistic\n\nMedical\n\n",
                "Anderson v. City of Hermosa Beach\n\nAnderson v. City of Hermosa Beach, 621 F. 3d 1051 (2010), was a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which ruled that tattoos, the process of tattooing, and the business of tattooing are pure expressive activities that are fully protected by the First Amendment's free speech clause. The court determined that the process of tattooing constitutes pure expressive activity rather than conduct that is sufficiently imbued with elements of communication. As pure expressive activity, the process of tattooing can only be regulated by a proper time, place, and manner restriction. The court found in Anderson v. The City of Hermosa Beach that the Hermosa Beach Municipal Code banning tattoo parlors within the city was not a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction because the regulation was not narrowly tailored to meet the government’s interest and the regulation did not leave open ample alternative avenues for the same messages to be conveyed.\n\nA tattoo is a visual symbol engrafted onto a person’s skin with needles and ink that depicts pictures and words. The Supreme Court of the United States has held that pictures and other forms of symbolic speech, unless otherwise indicated, are protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. Pictures, such as paintings and photographs are considered pure expression regardless of the media by which the forms of expression are conveyed.\n\nWhile messages being displayed on a person’s skin may be protected by the First Amendment, the process of tattooing may lead to health and safety risks. If applied in unsanitary conditions, tattooing can result in the spread of communicable diseases such as hepatitis. The government has been able to regulate the activity of tattooing because the government has an interest in keeping the public safe and healthy.\n\nPast cases involving tattooing and the First Amendment have used the Spence Test in order to determine whether or not the process of tattooing can be considered as having an expressive component. The Spence Test, described in \"Spence v. Washington\" states that conduct can be considered to be imbued with expressive elements of communication if the conduct is intended to communicate a message and the conduct is likely to be understood as being communicative by its intended audience. If the conduct is considered to be communicative, free speech protection may apply. However, the government has a freer hand in the regulation process. ii Regulations must follow the O’Brien Test. The O'Brien Test states that the government can regulate communicative conduct if it is within the government's constitutional right to do so, the regulation furthers an important governmental interest that is unrelated to the suppression of speech, and the regulation is narrowly tailored to prohibit no more speech than is essential to further that interest.\n\nExpressive activity such as writing a book or giving a public speech is considered pure speech and is afforded the most protection under the First Amendment. A statute that regulates purely expressive activity is constitutional only if it is written as a valid time, place, and manner restriction.\n\nPast court cases within the United States have addressed the issue of whether or not the process of tattooing is protected by the First Amendment. In 1980, in \"Yurkew v. Sinclair\" the court indicated that the process of tattooing was not sufficiently imbued with elements of communication. Therefore, the process of tattooing was not protected by the First Amendment. v Similarly, in the 2008 case of \"Hold Fast Tattoo, LLC v. City of North Chicago\", the court found that the process of tattooing was not protected under the First Amendment. v While the court held that the tattoo itself may be considered as protected speech, the physical process of tattooing was distinct and one step removed from the finished product. Past tattoo cases show that courts within the United States have traditionally found the process of tattooing to fall outside the protection of the First Amendment.\n\nThe County of Los Angeles generally permits tattooing within its jurisdiction. However, the city of Hermosa Beach, located within Los Angeles County, banned tattoo parlors within its city limits. The Hermosa Beach Municipal Code § 17.06.070 stated: \"Except as provided in this title, no building shall be erected, re-constructed or structurally altered, nor shall any building or land be used for any purpose except as hereinafter specifically provided…” The Code accepted permit requests from several types of businesses including bars, restaurants, movie theaters, youth hostels, and shops. However, tattoo shops were not listed in the provision of the zoning code. As a result, tattoo shops were banned in Hermosa Beach.\n\nIn 2006, Johnny Anderson, co-owner of Yer Cheat’n Heart Tattoo in Gardena, sought to expand his business and open a new tattoo shop in Hermosa Beach. Anderson, aware of the municipal ban on tattoo shops within Hermosa Beach, sued the city. The action was initially dismissed because Anderson had not expended all resources for determining whether or not his tattoo shop would be allowed within the city. Following city administrative procedures, Anderson filed a request with the city requesting that his shop be exempt from the municipal ban. The city denied his special permit request in 2007. Anderson then filed a 42 USC § 1983 civil rights claim, alleging the Hermosa Beach Municipal Code violated his first and fourteenth amendment civil liberties.\n\nAnderson’s claim was originally heard by the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The decision of the district court remained consistent with past free speech tattoo jurisprudence. The court stated that although the process of tattooing is considered non-verbal conduct that can express certain ideas, such expression is not sufficiently imbued with elements of communication and therefore cannot receive First Amendment protection. The process of tattooing was not considered pure expressive activity or expressive conduct. Failing to reach either of these statuses, Judge Christina Snyder reviewed the zoning statute by applying the rational basis test. The court found that the municipal ban on tattoo parlors was valid because the regulation was rationally related to the city’s interest of protecting the public from potential health risks associated with the tattooing process.\n\nOn September 9, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the holding of the lower court. Judge Jay Bybee acted against precedent by holding that the tattoo, the process of tattooing, and the business of tattooing are purely expressive activities that are fully protected under the First Amendment. The court also held that the city’s total ban on tattoo parlors is not a reasonable time, place, and manner restriction.\n\nThe questions presented in \"Anderson v. City of Hermosa Beach\" are as follows:\n\nThe court claimed in \"Anderson v. City of Hermosa Beach\" that tattoos, tattooing, and the business of tattooing are considered pure speech. In creating a tattoo, the court held that both the tattoo artist and client are participating in expressive activity. Both parties collaborate and contribute to the artistic vision of the final product.\n\nIn \"Anderson v. City of Hermosa Beach\", the Court states that the Supreme Court of the United States has consistently held that First Amendment protections encompass more expression than spoken and written words. Tattoos are composed of words, symbols, and images that are meant to convey a variety of messages to both the artist, the client, and the audience who may later view the tattoo. Therefore, the Court held that tattoos are entitled to full First Amendment protection.\n\nThe Court also held that the business of tattooing does not affect whether or not the process of tattooing is free expression. The sale of artwork does not remove the expressive content from being protected by the First Amendment. This protection does not become diminished as the artwork is sold. The Court noted that the sale of the tattoo is intertwined with the process of tattooing and the tattoo itself. The business of tattooing is therefore pure expressive activity that is entitled to full protection under the First Amendment.\n\nThe court found that tattooing is similar to writing or painting. Writing and painting are considered pure speech. Therefore, the process of tattooing should be considered pure speech rather than conduct that can contain expressive elements. With activities such as writing, painting, and tattooing, the court notes that the processes of creation are “inextricably intertwined” with the final products. Both the tattoo and the process of tattooing must be afforded First Amendment protection. The process of creation cannot be distinctly separated from the final product. The court notes that a tattoo cannot be created without the conduct of placing a needle beneath a client’s skin just as the Declaration of Independence could not have been created without the process of placing a quill on paper. The court holds that the process of tattooing and the tattoo itself are so intertwined that the restriction of tattooing effectively restricts the ability to obtain a tattoo and display constitutionally protected expression.\n\nThe court states that the process of tattooing may place a client’s safety at risk. However, a form of speech cannot lose First Amendment protection based on the surface on which the expression is applied. The court notes that the governmental interest in keeping the public safe may enable the city of Hermosa Beach to regulate the process of tattooing. However, a complete ban on the process of tattooing cannot be permitted.\n\nA government can regulate pure speech if the regulation is a valid time, place, and manner regulation. In order to be a permissible time, place, and manner regulation, the regulation must be content neutral and serve an important governmental interest. The regulation must be narrowly tailored to achieve this governmental interest, and the government regulation must leave ample alternative channels of communication open to speakers. The Ninth Circuit Court held that the Municipal Code that banned tattoo parlors in Hermosa Beach was not a valid time, place and manner restriction.\n\nThe court found that the city’s Municipal Code was content neutral. All tattoo parlors were banned in Hermosa Beach regardless of the content of the tattooed images. The court also determined that the city government has an interest in regulating the process of tattooing. The governmental interest of protecting the public health and safety is a significant governmental interest. The government can protect this interest through regulatory means as long as the regulation is narrowly tailored to achieve the goal of protecting the citizens of Hermosa Beach.\n\nThe City of Hermosa Beach argued that the process of tattooing can put a client’s safety at risk because puncturing the skin with a needle can create infection. Therefore, the city must be able to regulate such activity in order to protect its citizens. California state law requires tattoo artists to register their businesses with country health departments. The city of Hermosa Beach argued in this case that Los Angeles County had limited resources to inspect and regulate tattoo parlors. As a result, the city claimed that a total ban on tattoo parlors was justified because it was the only way to ensure that citizens of Hermosa Beach would not be at risk of infection from unsanitary needles.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals rejected the city’s argument. The Hermosa Beach Municipal Code banning tattoo shops was not narrowly tailored to achieve the city’s interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens. The ordinance was too broad and banned speech that is traditionally protected under the First Amendment. The court determined that a total ban on tattooing would not only prohibit unsanitary and unsterile tattoo shops within the city, but would also prohibit tattoo shops that practiced tattooing in a safe manner. The city claimed anything less than a total ban on tattooing would leave the public unprotected. However, the court held that the city must give more proof to show that its interests could not be achieved with a more narrowly defined regulation. The court concluded that the city could not justify the total ban with its refusal to allocate the resources necessary to accommodate public health concerns while also protecting the speech of tattoo artists and clients. The city’s interests could be achieved through regulatory means rather than a total ban on tattoo parlors. For example, a regulation that required tattoo artists to receive proper sterilization and sanitary training would allow the government to achieve its goal of protecting the public health while also enabling tattoo artists and clients to express themselves freely.\n\nThe court indicated that even if the regulation was narrowly tailored, it would still be unconstitutional. Ample alternatives for expressing the ideas conveyed in a tattoo are not available to speakers in Hermosa Beach. The court held that a tattoo is a unique form of communication that carries a distinct message. This message could not be equally or effectively conveyed through another medium such as a temporary tattoo or a canvas. The permanence and pain associated with a tattoo creates a unique message, indicating to a reader of the message that the speaker is highly committed to the message he or she is displaying. The Hermosa Beach Municipal Code forecloses an entire, unique medium of expression to tattoo artists and clients. Without providing speakers in Hermosa Beach with ample alternatives to convey the same message found in a tattoo, the Hermosa Beach Municipal Code is not a valid time, place, and manner restriction. The ban on tattoo parlors unconstitutionally restricts a speaker’s freedom of expression.\n\nJudge Noonan delivered a concurring opinion in \"Anderson v. City of Hermosa Beach.\" He states that the process of tattooing should not be considered as pure expression in all cases. Noonan gives the example that a tattoo that was “punitively affixed” would not be protected by the First Amendment. Therefore, context plays a significant role in determining whether or not the process of tattooing falls under First Amendment protection in a specific case.\n\nNoonan also indicates that while the process of tattooing may qualify as protected speech, tattooing still requires regulation because the creation of a tattoo can involve dangerous risks to a client’s health and safety.\n\nUntil 2010, no federal court of appeals had decided a case that involved tattooing restrictions and free speech implications. The United States Supreme Court has not addressed the First Amendment issues raised by the process of tattooing and denied a writ of certiorari to a case that challenged South Carolina’s restrictions on tattooing. \"Anderson v. City of Hermosa Beach\" is the first federal decision that has diverged from past court rulings. Past decisions indicated that the process of tattooing was conduct that had no expressive value. The ruling in \"Anderson\" would go on to subsequently influence a case that was brought before the Arizona Supreme Court. The Arizona Supreme Court, like the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, determined that the process of tattooing is a purely expressive activity that must receive robust First Amendment protections.\n\nColeman v. City of Mesa marked the first time a state Supreme Court ruled that tattoos and the process of tattooing were protected under the First Amendment. In 2008 a tattoo artist applied to open a tattooing business in a strip mall within the city of Mesa. The applicant was denied a permit, and sued the government on First Amendment grounds. While the plaintiff lost at trial, Ryan Coleman eventually made his way to the state Supreme Court. The Arizona Supreme Court agreed to hear Coleman’s case, acknowledging that Coleman had a viable First Amendment claim. In the 2012 case of \"Coleman v. City of Mesa\", the Arizona Supreme Court granted First Amendment protection to tattooing. The court cited \"Anderson\" when holding that obtaining a tattoo, applying a tattoo, and engaging in the business of tattooing are protected under the First Amendment. The court determined that these activities were considered pure speech that was to be afforded the highest level of protection by the First Amendment and Article 2, Section 6 of the Arizona Constitution.\n\nHistory of tattooing\n\n\"Cohen v.

                "Tattoo removal\n\nTattoo removal has been performed with various tools since the start of tattooing. While tattoos were once considered permanent, it is now possible to remove them with treatments, fully or partially. Before the development of laser tattoo removal methods, common techniques included dermabrasion, TCA (Trichloroacetic acid, an acid that removes the top layers of skin, reaching as deep as the layer in which the tattoo ink resides), salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with salt), cryosurgery and excision which is sometimes still used along with skin grafts for larger tattoos. Some early forms of tattoo removal included the injection or application of wine, lime, garlic or pigeon excrement. Tattoo removal by laser was performed with continuous-wave lasers initially, and later with Q-switched lasers, which became commercially available in the early 1990s. Today, \"laser tattoo removal\" usually refers to the non-invasive removal of tattoo pigments using Q-switched lasers. Typically, black and other darker-colored inks can be removed completely.\n\nA poll conducted in January 2012 by Harris Interactive reported that 1 in 7 (14%) of the 21% of American adults who have a tattoo regret getting one. The poll didn't report the reasons for these regrets, but a poll that was done 4 years prior reported that the most common reasons were \"too young when I got the tattoo\" (20%), \"it's permanent\" and \"I'm marked for life\" (19%), and \"I just don't like it\" (18%). An earlier poll showed that 19% of Britons with tattoos suffered regret, as did 11% of Italians with tattoos. Surveys of tattoo removal patients were done in 1996 and 2006 and provided more insight. Of those polled, the patients who regretted their tattoos typically obtained their tattoos in their late teens or early twenties, and were evenly distributed by gender. Among those seeking removals, more than half reported that they \"suffered embarrassment\". A new job, problems with clothes, and a significant life event were also commonly cited as motivations. Extravagant motives include tattooing your ex-husband's or wife's name. Angelina Jolie, Eva Longoria, Marc Anthony and Denise Richards are some of the celebrities that got this kind of tattoo removed.\n\nThe choice to get a tattoo that is later regretted is related to the end-of-history illusion, in which teenagers and adults of all ages know that their tastes have changed regularly over the years before the current moment, but believe that their tastes will somehow not continue to grow and mature in the future. As a result, they wrongly believe that any tattoo that appeals to them today will always appeal to them in the future.\n\nSome wearers decide to cover an unwanted tattoo with a new tattoo. This is commonly known as a cover-up. An artfully done cover-up may render the old tattoo completely invisible, though this will depend largely on the size, style, colors and techniques used on the old tattoo and the skill of the tattoo artist. Covering up a previous tattoo necessitates darker tones in the new tattoo to effectively hide the older, unwanted piece. Many tattoos are too dark to cover up and in those cases patients may receive laser tattoo removal to lighten the existing ink to make themselves better candidates for a cover up tattoo.\n\nTattoo removal is most commonly performed using lasers that break down the ink particles in the tattoo. The broken-down ink is then fought off by the immune system, mimicking the natural fading that time or sun exposure would create. All tattoo pigments have specific light absorption spectra. A tattoo laser must be capable of emitting adequate energy within the given absorption spectrum of the pigment to provide an effective treatment. Certain tattoo pigments, such as yellows and fluorescent inks are more challenging to treat than darker blacks and blues, because they have absorption spectra that fall outside or on the edge of the emission spectra available in the tattoo removal laser. Recent pastel coloured inks contain high concentrations of titanium dioxide which is highly reflective. Consequently, such inks are difficult to remove since they reflect a significant amount of the incident light energy out of the skin.\n\nWidely considered the gold standard treatment modality to remove a tattoo, laser tattoo removal requires repeat visits. The newer Q-switched lasers are said by the National Institutes of Health to result in scarring only rarely and are usually used only after a topical anesthetic has been applied. Areas with thin skin will be more likely to scar than thicker-skinned areas. There are several types of Q-switched lasers, and each is effective at removing a different range of the color spectrum. Lasers developed after 2006 provide multiple wavelengths and can successfully treat a much broader range of tattoo pigments than previous individual Q-switched lasers. Unfortunately the dye systems used to change the wavelength result in significant power reduction such that the use of multiple separate specific wavelength lasers remains the gold standard. \n\nThe energy density (fluence), expressed as joules/cm, is determined prior to each treatment as well as the spot size and repetition rate (hertz). To mitigate pain the preferred method is simply to cool the area before and during treatment with a medical-grade chiller/cooler and to use a topical anesthetic. During the treatment process, the laser beam passes harmlessly through the skin, targeting only the ink resting in a liquid state within. While it is possible to see immediate results, in most cases the fading occurs gradually over the 7–8 week healing period between treatments.\n\nExperimental observations of the effects of short-pulsed lasers on tattoos were first reported in the late 1960s. In 1979 an argon laser was used for tattoo removal in 28 patients, with limited success. In 1978 a carbon dioxide laser was also used, but generally caused scarring after treatments.\n\nIn the early 1980s, a new clinical study began in Canniesburn Hospital's Burns and Plastic Surgery Unit, in Glasgow, Scotland, into the effects of Q-switched ruby laser energy on blue/black tattoos. Further studies into other tattoo colours were then carried out with various degrees of success. Research at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow also showed that there was no detectable mutagenicity in tissues following irradiation with the Q-switched ruby laser. This essentially shows that the treatment is safe, from a biological viewpoint, with no detectable risk of the development of cancerous cells.\n\nIt was not until the late 1980s that Q-switched lasers became commercially practical with the first marketed laser coming from Dermalase Limited, Glasgow. One of the first American published articles describing laser tattoo removal was authored by a group at Massachusetts General Hospital in 1990.\n\nTattoos consist of thousands of particles of tattoo pigment suspended in the skin. While normal human growth and healing processes will remove small foreign particles from the skin, tattoo pigment particles are permanent because they are too big to be removed. Laser treatment causes tattoo pigment particles to heat up and fragment into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are then removed by normal body processes.\n\nLaser tattoo removal is a successful application of the theory of selective photothermolysis (SPTL). However, unlike treatments for blood vessels or hair the mechanism required to shatter tattoo particles uses the photomechanical effect. In this situation the energy is absorbed by the ink particles in a very short time, typically nanoseconds. The surface temperature of the ink particles can rise to thousands of degrees but this energy profile rapidly collapses into a shock wave. This shock wave then propagates throughout the local tissue (the dermis) causing brittle structures to fragment. Hence tissues are largely unaffected since they simply vibrate as the shock wave passes. For laser tattoo removal the selective destruction of tattoo pigments depends on four factors:\n\nQ-switched lasers are the only commercially available devices that can meet these requirements.\n\nAlthough they occur infrequently, mucosal tattoos can be successfully treated with Q-switched lasers as well.\n\nA novel method for laser tattoo removal using a fractionated CO2 or Erbium:YAG laser, alone or in combination with Q-switched lasers, was reported by Ibrahimi and coworkers from the Wellman Center of Photomedicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital. This new approach to laser tattoo removal may afford the ability to remove colors such as yellow and white, which have proven to be resistant to traditional Q-switched laser therapy.\n\nSeveral colors of laser light (quantified by the laser wavelength) are used for tattoo removal, from visible light to near-infrared radiation. Different lasers are better for different tattoo colors. Consequently, multi-color tattoo removal almost always requires the use of two or more laser wavelengths. Tattoo removal lasers are usually identified by the lasing medium used to create the wavelength (measured in nanometers (nm)):\n\nPulsewidth or pulse duration is a critical laser parameter. All Q-switched lasers have appropriate pulse durations for tattoo removal.\n\nSpot size, or the width of the laser beam, affects treatment. Light is optically scattered in the skin, like automobile headlights in fog. Larger spot sizes slightly increase the effective penetration depth of the laser light, thus enabling more effective targeting of deeper tattoo pigments. Larger spot sizes also help make treatments faster.\n\nFluence or energy density is another important consideration. Fluence is measured in joules per square centimeter (J/cm²). It is important to be treated at high enough settings to fragment tattoo particles.\n\nRepetition rate helps make treatments faster but is not associated with any treatment effect. Faster treatments are usually preferred because the pain ends sooner.\n\nComplete laser tattoo removal requires numerous treatment sessions, typically spaced at least seven weeks apart. Treating more frequently than seven weeks increases the risk of adverse effects and does not necessarily increase the rate of ink absorption. Anecdotal reports of treatments sessions at four weeks leads to more scarring and dischromia and can be a source of liability for clinicians. At each session, some but not all of the tattoo pigment particles are effectively fragmented, and the body removes the smallest fragments over the course of several weeks or months. The result is that the tattoo is lightened over time. Remaining large particles of tattoo pigment are then targeted at subsequent treatment sessions, causing further lightening. The number of sessions and spacing between treatments depends on various parameters, including the area of the body treated, skin color and effectiveness of the immune system. Tattoos located on the extremities, such as the ankle, generally take longest. As tattoos fade clinicians may recommend that patients wait many months between treatments to facilitate ink resolution and minimize unwanted side effects.\n\nThe amount of time required for the removal of a tattoo and the success of the removal varies with each individual and their immune system function. Factors influencing this include: skin type, location, color, amount of ink, scarring or tissue change, layers of ink, immune system function and circulation. Factors under the individuals control are more time between treatments, nutrition, stress, sleep, exercise and fluid levels. In the past health care providers would simply guess on the number of treatments a patient needed which was rather frustrating to patients. A predictive scale, the \"Kirby-Desai Scale\", was developed by Dr. Will Kirby and Dr. Alpesh Desai, dermatologists with specialization in tattoo removal techniques, to assess the potential success and number of treatments necessary for laser tattoo removal, provided the medical practitioner is using a Q-switched Nd:YAG (neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet) laser incorporating selective photothermolysis with six weeks between treatments.\n\nThe Kirby-Desai Scale assigns numerical values to six parameters: skin type, location, color, amount of ink, scarring or tissue change, and layering. Parameter scores are then added to yield a combined score that will show the estimated number of treatments needed for successful tattoo removal. Experts recommend that the Kirby-Desai scale be used by all laser practitioners prior to starting tattoo removal treatment to help determine the number of treatments required for tattoo removal and as a predictor of the success of the laser tattoo removal treatments. Prior to 2009, clinicians had no scientific basis by which to estimate the number of treatments needed to remove a tattoo and the use of this scale is now standard practice in laser tattoo removal.\n\nCertain colors have proved more difficult to remove than others. In particular, this occurs when treated with the wrong wavelength of laser light is used. Some have postulated that the reason for slow resolution of green ink in particular is due to its significantly smaller molecular size relative to the other colours. Consequently, green ink tattoos may require treatment with 755 nm light but may also respond to 694 nm, 650 nm and 1064 nm. Multiple wavelengths of light may be needed to remove colored inks.\n\nOne small Greek study showed that the R20 method--four passes with the laser, twenty minutes apart--caused more breaking up of the ink than the conventional method without more scarring or adverse effects. However, this study was performed on a very small patient population (12 patients total), using the weakest of the QS lasers, the 755 nm Alexandrite laser. One of the other main problems with this study was the fact that more than half of the 18 tattoos removed were not professional and amateur tattoos are always easier to remove. Proof of concept studies are underway, but many laser experts advise against the R20 method using the more modern and powerful tattoo removal lasers available at most offices as an increase in adverse side effects including scarring and dischromia is likely. Patients should inquire about the laser being used if the R20 treatment method is offered by a facility as it is usually only offered by clinics that are using the weak 755 nm Alexandrite as opposed to the more powerful and versatile devices that are more commonly used. Moreover, dermatologists offering the R20 method should inform patients that it just one alternative to proven protocols and is not a gold standard treatment method to remove tattoos.\n\nThere are a number of factors that determine how many treatments will be needed and the level of success one might experience. Age of tattoo, ink density, color and even where the tattoo is located on the body, all play an important role in how many treatments will be needed for complete removal. However, a rarely recognized factor of tattoo removal is the role of the client’s immune response. The normal process of tattoo removal is fragmentation followed by phagocytosis which is then drained away via the lymphatics. Consequently, it’s the inflammation resulting from the actual laser treatment and the natural stimulation of the hosts’s immune response that ultimately results in removal of tattoo ink; thus variations in results are enormous.\n\nLaser tattoo removal is uncomfortable - many patients say it is worse than getting the tattoo. The pain is often described to be similar to that of hot oil on the skin, or a \"snap\" from an elastic band. Depending on the patient's pain threshold, and while some patients may forgo anesthesia altogether, most patients will require some form of local anesthesia. Pre-treatment might include the application of an anesthetic cream under occlusion for 45 to 90 minutes or cooling by ice or cold air prior to the laser treatment session. A better method is complete anesthesia which can be administered locally by injections of 1% to 2% lidocaine with epinephrine.\n\nA simple, new technique (published in March 2014) which helps to reduce the pain sensation felt by patients has been described by MJ Murphy He used a standard microscope glass slide pressed against the tattooed skin and fired the laser through the glass. Results on 31 volunteers showed a significant reduction of up to 50% in pain alongside a reduction in blistering and punctate bleeding. This technique represents the simplest and most effective method to reduce the pain sensation using a non-invasive procedure.\n\nImmediately after laser treatment, a slightly elevated, white discoloration with or without the presence of punctuate bleeding is often observed. This white color change is thought to be the result of rapid, heat-formed steam or gas, causing dermal and epidermal vacuolization. Pinpoint bleeding represents vascular injury from photoacoustic waves created by the laser's interaction with tattoo pigment. Minimal edema and erythema of adjacent normal skin usually resolve within 24 hours. Subsequently, a crust appears over the entire tattoo, which sloughs off at approximately two weeks post-treatment. As noted above, some tattoo pigment may be found within this crust. Post-operative wound care consists of simple wound care and a non-occlusive dressing. Since the application of laser light is sterile there is no need for topical antibiotics. Moreover, topical antibiotic ointments can cause allergic reactions and should be avoided. Fading of the tattoo will be noted over the next eight weeks and re-treatment energy levels can be tailored depending on the clinical response observed.\n\nAbout half of the patients treated with Q-switched lasers for tattoo removal will show some transient changes in the normal skin pigmentation. These changes usually resolve in 6 to 12 months but may rarely be permanent.\n\nHyperpigmentation is related to the patient's skin tone, with skin types IV, V and VI more prone regardless of the wavelength used. Twice daily treatment with hydroquinones and broad-spectrum sunscreens usually resolves the hyperpigmentation within a few months, although, in some patients, resolution can be prolonged.\n\nHypopigmentation is more commonly observed in darker skin tones. It is more likely to occur with higher fluence and more frequent treatments. Sometimes lighter skin exhibits hypopigmentation after a series of treatments. Allowing more time between treatments reduces chances of hypopigmentation. Since it is more likely to see hypopigmentation after multiple treatments, some practitioners suggest waiting a few additional weeks, after a few sessions. Usually treatment stops until hypopigmentation resolves in a matter of months. \n\nTransient textural changes are occasionally noted but often resolve within a few months; however, permanent textural changes and scarring very rarely occur. If a patient is prone to pigmentary or textural changes, longer treatment intervals are recommended. Additionally, if a blister or crust forms following treatment, it is imperative that the patient does not manipulate this secondary skin change. Early removal of a blister of crust increases the chances of developing a scar. Additionally, patients with a history of hypertrophic or keloidal scarring need to be warned of their increased risk of scarring.\n\nLocal allergic responses to many tattoo pigments have been reported, and allergic reactions to tattoo pigment after Q-switched laser treatment are also possible. Rarely, when yellow cadmium sulfide is used to \"brighten\" the red or yellow portion of a tattoo, a photoallergic reaction may occur. The reaction is also common with red ink, which may contain cinnabar (mercuric sulphide). Erythema, pruritus, and even inflamed nodules, verrucose papules, or granulomas may present. The reaction will be confined to the site of the red/yellow ink. Treatment consists of strict sunlight avoidance, sunscreen, interlesional steroid injections, or in some cases, surgical removal. Unlike the destructive modalities described, Q-switched lasers mobilize the ink and may generate a systemic allergic response. Oral antihistamines and anti-inflammatory steroids have been used to treat allergic reactions to tattoo ink.\n\nStudies of various tattoo pigments have shown that a number of pigments (most containing iron oxide or titanium dioxide) change color when irradiated with Q-switched laser energy. Some tattoo colors including flesh tones, light red, white, peach and light brown containing pigments as well as some green and blue tattoo pigments, changed to black when irradiated with Q-switched laser pulses. The resulting gray-black color may require more treatments to remove. If tattoo darkening does occur, after 8 weeks the newly darkened tattoo can be treated as if it were black pigment.\n\nVery rarely, non Q-switched laser treatments, like CO2 or Argon lasers, which are very rarely offered these days, can rupture blood vessels and aerosolize tissue requiring a plastic shield or a cone device to protect the laser operator from tissue and blood contact. Protective eyewear may be worn if the laser operator chooses to do so.\n\nWith the mechanical or salabrasion method of tattoo removal, the incidence of scarring, pigmentary alteration (hyper- and hypopigmentation), and ink retention are extremely high.\n\nThe use of Q-switched lasers could very rarely produce the development of large bulla. However, if patients follow post care directions to elevate, rest, and apply intermittent icing, it should minimize the chances of bulla and other adverse effects. In addition, health care practitioners should contemplate the use of a cooling device during the tattoo removal procedure. While the infrequent bulla development is a possible side effect of Q-switched laser tattoo removal, if treated appropriately and quickly by the health care practitioner, it is unlikely that long term consequences would ensue.\n\nAlthough laser treatment is well known and often used to remove tattoos, unwanted side effects of laser tattoo removal include the possibility of discoloration of the skin such as hypopigmentation (white spots, more common in darker skin) and hyperpigmentation (dark spots) as well as textural changes - these changes are usually not permanent when the Nd:YAG is used but it is much more likely with the use of the 755 nm Alexandrite, the 694 nm Ruby and the R20 method. Very rarely, burns may result in scarring but this usually only occurs when patients don't care for the treated area properly. Occasionally, \"paradoxical darkening\" of a tattoo may occur, when a treated tattoo becomes darker instead of lighter. This occurs most often with white ink, flesh tones, pink, and cosmetic make-up tattoos.\n\nSome tattoo pigments contain metals that could theoretically break down into toxic chemicals in the body when exposed to light. This has not yet been reported in vivo but has been shown in laboratory tests. Laser removal of traumatic tattoos may similarly be complicated depending on the substance of the pigmenting material. In one reported instance, the use of a laser resulted in the ignition of embedded particles of firework debris.\n\nNotes\n\nFurther reading\n\n"

                "Horse\n\nThe horse (\"Equus ferus caballus\") is one of two extant subspecies of \"Equus ferus\". It is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family Equidae. The horse has evolved over the past 45 to 55 million years from a small multi-toed creature, \"Eohippus\", into the large, single-toed animal of today. Humans began to domesticate horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies \"caballus\" are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. These feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered Przewalski's horse, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true wild horse. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.\n\nHorses' anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed sense of balance and a strong fight-or-flight response. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down, with younger horse tending to sleep significantly more than adults. Female horses, called mares, carry their young for approximately 11 months, and a young horse, called a foal, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under saddle or in harness between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30 years.\n\nHorse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited \"hot bloods\" with speed and endurance; \"cold bloods\", such as draft horses and some ponies, suitable for slow, heavy work; and \"warmbloods\", developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300 breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.\n\nHorses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as police work, agriculture, entertainment, and therapy. Horses were historically used in warfare, from which a wide variety of riding and driving techniques developed, using many different styles of equipment and methods of control. Many products are derived from horses, including meat, milk, hide, hair, bone, and pharmaceuticals extracted from the urine of pregnant mares. Humans provide domesticated horses with food, water and shelter, as well as attention from specialists such as veterinarians and farriers.\n\nSpecific terms and specialized language are used to describe equine anatomy, different life stages, colors and breeds.\n\nDepending on breed, management and environment, the modern domestic horse has a life expectancy of 25 to 30 years. Uncommonly, a few animals live into their 40s and, occasionally, beyond. The oldest verifiable record was \"Old Billy\", a 19th-century horse that lived to the age of 62. In modern times, Sugar Puff, who had been listed in \"Guinness World Records\" as the world's oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.\n\nRegardless of a horse or pony's actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each January 1 of each year in the Northern Hemisphere and each August 1 in the Southern Hemisphere. The exception is in endurance riding, where the minimum age to compete is based on the animal's actual calendar age.\n\nThe following terminology is used to describe horses of various ages:\n\n\nIn horse racing, these definitions may differ: For example, in the British Isles, Thoroughbred horse racing defines colts and fillies as less than five years old. However, Australian Thoroughbred racing defines colts and fillies as less than four years old.\n\nThe height of horses is usually measured at the highest point of the withers, where the neck meets the back. This point is used because it is a stable point of the anatomy, unlike the head or neck, which move up and down in relation to the body of the horse.\n\nIn English-speaking countries, the height of horses is often stated in units of hands and inches: one hand is equal to . The height is expressed as the number of full hands, followed by a point, then the number of additional inches, and ending with the abbreviation \"h\" or \"hh\" (for \"hands high\"). Thus, a horse described as \"15.2 h\" is 15 hands plus 2 inches, for a total of in height.\nThe size of horses varies by breed, but also is influenced by nutrition. Light riding horses usually range in height from and can weigh from . Larger riding horses usually start at about and often are as tall as , weighing from . Heavy or draft horses are usually at least high and can be as tall as high. They can weigh from about .\n\nThe largest horse in recorded history was probably a Shire horse named Mammoth, who was born in 1848. He stood high and his peak weight was estimated at . The current record holder for the world's smallest horse is Thumbelina, a fully mature miniature horse affected by dwarfism. She is tall and weighs .\n\nPonies are taxonomically the same animals as horses. The distinction between a horse and pony is commonly drawn on the basis of height, especially for competition purposes. However, height alone is not dispositive; the difference between horses and ponies may also include aspects of phenotype, including conformation and temperament.\n\nThe traditional standard for height of a horse or a pony at maturity is . An animal 14.2 h or over is usually considered to be a horse and one less than 14.2 h a pony, but there are many exceptions to the traditional standard. In Australia, ponies are considered to be those under . For competition in the Western division of the United States Equestrian Federation, the cutoff is . The International Federation for Equestrian Sports, the world governing body for horse sport, uses metric measurements and defines a pony as being any horse measuring less than at the withers without shoes, which is just over 14.2 h, and , or just over 14.2½ h, with shoes.\n\nHeight is not the sole criterion for distinguishing horses from ponies. Breed registries for horses that typically produce individuals both under and over 14.2 h consider all animals of that breed to be horses regardless of their height. Conversely, some pony breeds may have features in common with horses, and individual animals may occasionally mature at over 14.2 h, but are still considered to be ponies.\n\nPonies often exhibit thicker manes, tails, and overall coat. They also have proportionally shorter legs, wider barrels, heavier bone, shorter and thicker necks, and short heads with broad foreheads. They may have calmer temperaments than horses and also a high level of intelligence that may or may not be used to cooperate with human handlers. Small size, by itself, is not an exclusive determinant. For example, the Shetland pony which averages , is considered a pony. Conversely, breeds such as the Falabella and other miniature horses, which can be no taller than , are classified by their registries as very small horses, not ponies.\n\nHorses have 64 chromosomes. The horse genome was sequenced in 2007. It contains 2.7 billion DNA base pairs, which is larger than the dog genome, but smaller than the human genome or the bovine genome. The map is available to researchers.\n\nHorses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive markings, described by a specialized vocabulary. Often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex. Horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings, which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.\n\nMany genes that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified. Current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color, and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits. The basic coat colors of chestnut and black are determined by the gene controlled by the Melanocortin 1 receptor, also known as the \"extension gene\" or \"red factor,\" as its recessive form is \"red\" (chestnut) and its dominant form is black. Additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as graying, and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses.\n\nHorses that have a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks \"white\" is usually a middle-aged or older gray. Grays are born a darker shade, get lighter as they age, but usually keep black skin underneath their white hair coat (with the exception of pink skin under white markings). The only horses properly called white are born with a predominantly white hair coat and pink skin, a fairly rare occurrence. Different and unrelated genetic factors can produce white coat colors in horses, including several different alleles of dominant white and the sabino-1 gene. However, there are no \"albino\" horses, defined as having both pink skin and red eyes.\n\nGestation lasts approximately 340 days, with an average range 320–370 days, and usually results in one foal; twins are rare. Horses are a precocial species, and foals are capable of standing and running within a short time following birth. Foals are usually born in the spring. The estrous cycle of a mare occurs roughly every 19–22 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. Most mares enter an \"anestrus\" period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. Foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.\n\nHorses, particularly colts, sometimes are physically capable of reproduction at about 18 months, but domesticated horses are rarely allowed to breed before the age of three, especially females. Horses four years old are considered mature, although the skeleton normally continues to develop until the age of six; maturation also depends on the horse's size, breed, sex, and quality of care. Larger horses have larger bones; therefore, not only do the bones take longer to form bone tissue, but the epiphyseal plates are larger and take longer to convert from cartilage to bone. These plates convert after the other parts of the bones, and are crucial to development.\n\nDepending on maturity, breed, and work expected, horses are usually put under saddle and trained to be ridden between the ages of two and four. Although Thoroughbred race horses are put on the track as young as the age of two in some countries, horses specifically bred for sports such as dressage are generally not put under saddle until they are three or four years old, because their bones and muscles are not solidly developed. For endurance riding competition, horses are not deemed mature enough to compete until they are a full 60 calendar months (five years) old.\n\nThe horse skeleton averages 205 bones. A significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human is the lack of a collarbone—the horse's forelimbs are attached to the spinal column by a powerful set of muscles, tendons, and ligaments that attach the shoulder blade to the torso. The horse's legs and hooves are also unique structures. Their leg bones are proportioned differently from those of a human. For example, the body part that is called a horse's \"knee\" is actually made up of the carpal bones that correspond to the human wrist. Similarly, the hock contains bones equivalent to those in the human ankle and heel. The lower leg bones of a horse correspond to the bones of the human hand or foot, and the fetlock (incorrectly called the \"ankle\") is actually the proximal sesamoid bones between the cannon bones (a single equivalent to the human metacarpal or metatarsal bones) and the proximal phalanges, located where one finds the \"knuckles\" of a human. A horse also has no muscles in its legs below the knees and hocks, only skin, hair, bone, tendons, ligaments, cartilage, and the assorted specialized tissues that make up the hoof.\n\nThe critical importance of the feet and legs is summed up by the traditional adage, \"no foot, no horse\". The horse hoof begins with the distal phalanges, the equivalent of the human fingertip or tip of the toe, surrounded by cartilage and other specialized, blood-rich soft tissues such as the laminae. The exterior hoof wall and horn of the sole is made of keratin, the same material as a human fingernail. The end result is that a horse, weighing on average , travels on the same bones as would a human on tiptoe. For the protection of the hoof under certain conditions, some horses have horseshoes placed on their feet by a professional farrier. The hoof continually grows, and in most domesticated horses needs to be trimmed (and horseshoes reset, if used) every five to eight weeks, though the hooves of horses in the wild wear down and regrow at a rate suitable for their terrain.\n\nHorses are adapted to grazing. In an adult horse, there are 12 incisors at the front of the mouth, adapted to biting off the grass or other vegetation. There are 24 teeth adapted for chewing, the premolars and molars, at the back of the mouth. Stallions and geldings have four additional teeth just behind the incisors, a type of canine teeth called \"tushes\". Some horses, both male and female, will also develop one to four very small vestigial teeth in front of the molars, known as \"wolf\" teeth, which are generally removed because they can interfere with the bit. There is an empty interdental space between the incisors and the molars where the bit rests directly on the gums, or \"bars\" of the horse's mouth when the horse is bridled.\n\nAn estimate of a horse's age can be made from looking at its teeth. The teeth continue to erupt throughout life and are worn down by grazing. Therefore, the incisors show changes as the horse ages; they develop a distinct wear pattern, changes in tooth shape, and changes in the angle at which the chewing surfaces meet. This allows a very rough estimate of a horse's age, although diet and veterinary care can also affect the rate of tooth wear.\n\nHorses are herbivores with a digestive system adapted to a forage diet of grasses and other plant material, consumed steadily throughout the day. Therefore, compared to humans, they have a relatively small stomach but very long intestines to facilitate a steady flow of nutrients. A horse will eat of food per day and, under normal use, drink of water. Horses are not ruminants, they have only one stomach, like humans, but unlike humans, they can utilize cellulose, a major component of grass. Horses are hindgut fermenters. Cellulose fermentation by symbiotic bacteria occurs in the cecum, or \"water gut\", which food goes through before reaching the large intestine. Horses cannot vomit, so digestion problems can quickly cause colic, a leading cause of death.\n\nThe horses' senses are based on their status as prey animals, where they must be aware of their surroundings at all times. They have the largest eyes of any land mammal, and are lateral-eyed, meaning that their eyes are positioned on the sides of their heads. This means that horses have a range of vision of more than 350°, with approximately 65° of this being binocular vision and the remaining 285° monocular vision. Horses have excellent day and night vision, but they have two-color, or dichromatic vision; their color vision is somewhat like red-green color blindness in humans, where certain colors, especially red and related colors, appear as a shade of green.\n\nTheir sense of smell, while much better than that of humans, is not quite as good as that of a dog. It is believed to play a key role in the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the Vomeronasal organs, also called Jacobson's organs. These have a separate nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.\n\nA horse's hearing is good, and the pinna of each ear can rotate up to 180°, giving the potential for 360° hearing without having to move the head. Noise impacts the behavior of horses and certain kinds of noise may contribute to stress: A 2013 study in the UK indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. This study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. An Australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had a higher rate of gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.\n\nHorses have a great sense of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed proprioception—the unconscious sense of where the body and limbs are at all times. A horse's sense of touch is well developed. The most sensitive areas are around the eyes, ears, and nose. Horses are able to sense contact as subtle as an insect landing anywhere on the body.\n\nHorses have an advanced sense of taste, which allows them to sort through fodder and choose what they would most like to eat, and their prehensile lips can easily sort even small grains. Horses generally will not eat poisonous plants, however, there are exceptions; horses will occasionally eat toxic amounts of poisonous plants even when there is adequate healthy food.\n\nAll horses move naturally with four basic gaits: the four-beat walk, which averages ; the two-beat trot or jog at (faster for harness racing horses); the canter or lope, a three-beat gait that is ; and the gallop. The gallop averages , but the world record for a horse galloping over a short, sprint distance is . Besides these basic gaits, some horses perform a two-beat pace, instead of the trot. There also are several four-beat \"ambling\" gaits that are approximately the speed of a trot or pace, though smoother to ride. These include the lateral rack, running walk, and tölt as well as the diagonal fox trot. Ambling gaits are often genetic in some breeds, known collectively as gaited horses. Often, gaited horses replace the trot with one of the ambling gaits.\n\nHorses are prey animals with a strong fight-or-flight response. Their first reaction to threat is to startle and usually flee, although they will stand their ground and defend themselves when flight is impossible or if their young are threatened. They also tend to be curious; when startled, they will often hesitate an instant to ascertain the cause of their fright, and may not always flee from something that they perceive as non-threatening. Most light horse riding breeds were developed for speed, agility, alertness and endurance; natural qualities that extend from their wild ancestors. However, through selective breeding, some breeds of horses are quite docile, particularly certain draft horses.\n\nHorses are herd animals, with a clear hierarchy of rank, led by a dominant individual, usually a mare. They are also social creatures that are able to form companionship attachments to their own species and to other animals, including humans. They communicate in various ways, including vocalizations such as nickering or whinnying, mutual grooming, and body language. Many horses will become difficult to manage if they are isolated, but with training, horses can learn to accept a human as a companion, and thus be comfortable away from other horses. However, when confined with insufficient companionship, exercise, or stimulation, individuals may develop stable vices, an assortment of bad habits, mostly stereotypies of psychological origin, that include wood chewing, wall kicking, \"weaving\" (rocking back and forth), and other problems.\n\nStudies have indicated that horses perform a number of cognitive tasks on a daily basis, meeting mental challenges that include food procurement and identification of individuals within a social system. They also have good spatial discrimination abilities. They are naturally curious and apt to investigate things they have not seen before. Studies have assessed equine intelligence in areas such as problem solving, speed of learning, and memory. Horses excel at simple learning, but also are able to use more advanced cognitive abilities that involve categorization and concept learning. They can learn using habituation, desensitization, classical conditioning, and operant conditioning, and positive and negative reinforcement. One study has indicated that horses can differentiate between \"more or less\" if the quantity involved is less than four.\n\nDomesticated horses may face greater mental challenges than wild horses, because they live in artificial environments that prevent instinctive behavior whilst also learning tasks that are not natural. Horses are animals of habit that respond well to regimentation, and respond best when the same routines and techniques are used consistently. One trainer believes that \"intelligent\" horses are reflections of intelligent trainers who effectively use response conditioning techniques and positive reinforcement to train in the style that best fits with an individual animal's natural inclinations.\n\nHorses are mammals, and as such are warm-blooded, or endothermic creatures, as opposed to cold-blooded, or poikilothermic animals. However, these words have developed a separate meaning in the context of equine terminology, used to describe temperament, not body temperature. For example, the \"hot-bloods\", such as many race horses, exhibit more sensitivity and energy, while the \"cold-bloods\", such as most draft breeds, are quieter and calmer. Sometimes \"hot-bloods\" are classified as \"light horses\" or \"riding horses\", with the \"cold-bloods\" classified as \"draft horses\" or \"work horses\".\n\"Hot blooded\" breeds include \"oriental horses\" such as the Akhal-Teke, Arabian horse, Barb and now-extinct Turkoman horse, as well as the Thoroughbred, a breed developed in England from the older oriental breeds. Hot bloods tend to be spirited, bold, and learn quickly. They are bred for agility and speed. They tend to be physically refined—thin-skinned, slim, and long-legged. The original oriental breeds were brought to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa when European breeders wished to infuse these traits into racing and light cavalry horses.\n\nMuscular, heavy draft horses are known as \"cold bloods\", as they are bred not only for strength, but also to have the calm, patient temperament needed to pull a plow or a heavy carriage full of people. They are sometimes nicknamed \"gentle giants\". Well-known draft breeds include the Belgian and the Clydesdale. Some, like the Percheron, are lighter and livelier, developed to pull carriages or to plow large fields in drier climates. Others, such as the Shire, are slower and more powerful, bred to plow fields with heavy, clay-based soils. The cold-blooded group also includes some pony breeds.\n\n\"Warmblood\" breeds, such as the Trakehner or Hanoverian, developed when European carriage and war horses were crossed with Arabians or Thoroughbreds, producing a riding horse with more refinement than a draft horse, but greater size and milder temperament than a lighter breed. Certain pony breeds with warmblood characteristics have been developed for smaller riders. Warmbloods are considered a \"light horse\" or \"riding horse\".\n\nToday, the term \"Warmblood\" refers to a specific subset of sport horse breeds that are used for competition in dressage and show jumping. Strictly speaking, the term \"warm blood\" refers to any cross between cold-blooded and hot-blooded breeds. Examples include breeds such as the Irish Draught or the Cleveland Bay. The term was once used to refer to breeds of light riding horse other than Thoroughbreds or Arabians, such as the Morgan horse.\n\nHorses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. In an adaptation from life in the wild, horses are able to enter light sleep by using a \"stay apparatus\" in their legs, allowing them to doze without collapsing. Horses sleep better when in groups because some animals will sleep while others stand guard to watch for predators. A horse kept alone will not sleep well because its instincts are to keep a constant eye out for danger.\n\nUnlike humans, horses do not sleep in a solid, unbroken period of time, but take many short periods of rest. Horses spend four to fifteen hours a day in standing rest, and from a few minutes to several hours lying down. Total sleep time in a 24-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours, mostly in short intervals of about 15 minutes each. The average sleep time of a domestic horse is said to be 2.9 hours per day.\n\nHorses must lie down to reach REM sleep. They only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum REM sleep requirements. However, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into REM sleep while still standing. This condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.\n\nThe horse adapted to survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, surviving in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not. Horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order Perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the Tertiary period. In the past, this order contained 14 families, but only three—Equidae (the horse and related species), Tapiridae (the tapir), and Rhinocerotidae (the rhinoceroses)—have survived to the present day.\n\nThe earliest known member of the family Equidae was the \"Hyracotherium\", which lived between 45 and 55 million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4 toes on each front foot, and 3 toes on each back foot. The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the \"Mesohippus\", which lived 32 to 37 million years ago. Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee, known informally as splint bones. Their legs also lengthened as their toes disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5 million years ago, the modern \"Equus\" had evolved. Equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.\n\nBy about 15,000 years ago, \"Equus ferus\" was a widespread holarctic species. Horse bones from this time period, the late Pleistocene, are found in Europe, Eurasia, Beringia, and North America. Yet between 10,000 and 7,600 years ago, the horse became extinct in North America and rare elsewhere. The reasons for this extinction are not fully known, but one theory notes that extinction in North America paralleled human arrival. Another theory points to climate change, noting that approximately 12,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants.\n\nA truly wild horse is a species or subspecies with no ancestors that were ever domesticated. Therefore, most \"wild\" horses today are actually feral horses, animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals. Only two never-domesticated subspecies, the Tarpan and the Przewalski's Horse, survived into recorded history and only the latter survives today.\n\nThe Przewalski's horse (\"Equus ferus przewalskii\"), named after the Russian explorer Nikolai Przhevalsky, is a rare Asian animal. It is also known as the Mongolian wild horse; Mongolian people know it as the \"taki\", and the Kyrgyz people call it a \"kirtag\". The subspecies was presumed extinct in the wild between 1969 and 1992, while a small breeding population survived in zoos around the world. In 1992, it was reestablished in the wild due to the conservation efforts of numerous zoos. Today, a small wild breeding population exists in Mongolia. There are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.\n\nThe tarpan or European wild horse (\"Equus ferus ferus\") was found in Europe and much of Asia. It survived into the historical era, but became extinct in 1909, when the last captive died in a Russian zoo. Thus, the genetic line was lost. Attempts have been made to recreate the tarpan, which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities, but nonetheless descended from domesticated ancestors and not true wild horses.\n\nPeriodically, populations of horses in isolated areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally have been proven to be feral or domestic. For example, the Riwoche horse of Tibet was proposed as such, but testing did not reveal genetic differences from domesticated horses. Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan based on shared characteristics, but genetic studies have shown that the Sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.\n\nBesides the horse, there are seven other species of genus \"Equus\" in the Equidae family. These are the ass or donkey, \"Equus asinus\"; the mountain zebra, \"Equus zebra\"; plains zebra, \"Equus quagga\"; Grévy's zebra, \"Equus grevyi\"; the kiang, \"Equus kiang\"; and the onager, \"Equus hemionus\".\n\nHorses can crossbreed with other members of their genus. The most common hybrid is the mule, a cross between a \"jack\" (male donkey) and a mare. A related hybrid, a hinny, is a cross between a stallion and a jenny (female donkey). Other hybrids include the zorse, a cross between a zebra and a horse. With rare exceptions, most hybrids are sterile and cannot reproduce.\n\nDomestication of the horse most likely took place in central Asia prior to 3500 BC. Two major sources of information are used to determine where and when the horse was first domesticated and how the domesticated horse spread around the world. The first source is based on palaeological and archaeological discoveries; the second source is a comparison of DNA obtained from modern horses to that from bones and teeth of ancient horse remains.\n\nThe earliest archaeological evidence for the domestication of the horse comes from sites in Ukraine and Kazakhstan, dating to approximately 3500–4000 BC. By 3000 BC, the horse was completely domesticated and by 2000 BC there was a sharp increase in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern Europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent. The most recent, but most irrefutable evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the Sintashta and Petrovka cultures c. 2100 BC.\n\nDomestication is also studied by using the genetic material of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. The variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. This is reflected in the difference in genetic variation between the DNA that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line (Y-chromosome) versus that passed on along the maternal, or dam line (mitochondrial DNA). There are very low levels of Y-chromosome variability, but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial DNA. There is also regional variation in mitochondrial DNA due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. Another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation. In horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 BC.\n\nBefore the availability of DNA techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypotheses were proposed. One classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication. Another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication. However, the lack of a detectable substructure in the horse has resulted in a rejection of both hypotheses.\n\nFeral horses are born and live in the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. Many populations of feral horses exist throughout the world. Studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses, as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses that live in domesticated conditions.\n\nThere are also semi-feral horses in many parts of the world, such as Dartmoor and the New Forest in the UK, where the animals are all privately owned but live for significant amounts of time in \"wild\" conditions on undeveloped, often public, lands. Owners of such animals often pay a fee for grazing rights.\n\nThe concept of purebred bloodstock and a controlled, written breed registry has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times. Sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called \"thoroughbreds\". Thoroughbred is a specific breed of horse, while a \"purebred\" is a horse (or any other animal) with a defined pedigree recognized by a breed registry. Horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as conformation, color, performance ability, or disposition. These inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and artificial selection methods. Horses have been selectively bred since their domestication. An early example of people who practiced selective horse breeding were the Bedouin, who had a reputation for careful practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their Arabian horses and placing great value upon pure bloodlines. These pedigrees were originally transmitted via an oral tradition. In the 14th century, Carthusian monks of southern Spain kept meticulous pedigrees of bloodstock lineages still found today in the Andalusian horse.\n\nBreeds developed due to a need for \"form to function\", the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work. Thus, a powerful but refined breed such as the Andalusian developed as riding horses with an aptitude for dressage. Heavy draft horses developed out of a need to perform demanding farm work and pull heavy wagons. Other horse breeds developed specifically for light agricultural work, carriage and road work, various sport disciplines, or simply as pets. Some breeds developed through centuries of crossing other breeds, while others descended from a single foundation sire, or other limited or restricted foundation bloodstock. One of the earliest formal registries was General Stud Book for Thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the foundation bloodstock for the breed. There are more than 300 horse breeds in the world today.\n\nWorldwide, horses play a role within human cultures and have done so for millennia. Horses are used for leisure activities, sports, and working purposes. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that in 2008, there were almost 59,000,000 horses in the world, with around 33,500,000 in the Americas, 13,800,000 in Asia and 6,300,000 in Europe and smaller portions in Africa and Oceania. There are estimated to be 9,500,000 horses in the United States alone. The American Horse Council estimates that horse-related activities have a direct impact on the economy of the United States of over $39 billion, and when indirect spending is considered, the impact is over $102 billion. In a 2004 \"poll\" conducted by Animal Planet, more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the world's 4th favorite animal.\n\nCommunication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. Sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. Many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.\n\nHistorically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. Equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. Many sports, such as dressage, eventing and show jumping, have origins in military training, which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. Other sports, such as rodeo, developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations. Sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques. Horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. All forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. The popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.\n\nHorses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions. Examples include show jumping, dressage, three-day eventing, competitive driving, endurance riding, gymkhana, rodeos, and fox hunting. Horse shows, which have their origins in medieval European fairs, are held around the world. They host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as \"In-hand\" classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to be evaluated on their conformation. The method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.\nSports such as polo do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. Although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the rider's actions—be it getting a ball through a goal or some other task. Examples of these sports of partnership between human and horse include jousting, in which the main goal is for one rider to unseat the other, and buzkashi, a team game played throughout Central Asia, the aim being to capture a goat carcass while on horseback.\n\nHorse racing is an equestrian sport and major international industry, watched in almost every nation of the world. There are three types: \"flat\" racing; steeplechasing, i.e. racing over jumps; and harness racing, where horses trot or pace while pulling a driver in a small, light cart known as a sulky. A major part of horse racing's economic importance lies in the gambling associated with it.\n\nThere are certain jobs that horses do very well, and no technology has yet developed to fully replace them. For example, mounted police horses are still effective for certain types of patrol duties and crowd control. Cattle ranches still require riders on horseback to round up cattle that are scattered across remote, rugged terrain. Search and rescue organizations in some countries depend upon mounted teams to locate people, particularly hikers and children, and to provide disaster relief assistance. Horses can also be used in areas where it is necessary to avoid vehicular disruption to delicate soil, such as nature reserves. They may also be the only form of transport allowed in wilderness areas. Horses are quieter than motorized vehicles. Law enforcement officers such as park rangers or game wardens may use horses for patrols, and horses or mules may also be used for clearing trails or other work in areas of rough terrain where vehicles are less effective.\n\nAlthough machinery has replaced horses in many parts of the world, an estimated 100 million horses, donkeys and mules are still used for agriculture and transportation in less developed areas. This number includes around 27 million working animals in Africa alone. Some land management practices such as cultivating and logging can be efficiently performed with horses. In agriculture, less fossil fuel is used and increased environmental conservation occurs over time with the use of draft animals such as horses. Logging with horses can result in reduced damage to soil structure and less damage to trees due to more selective logging.\n\nModern horses are often used to reenact many of their historical work purposes. Horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles. Horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. Countries such as the United Kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other VIPs to and from certain culturally significant events. Public exhibitions are another example, such as the Budweiser Clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon similar to that used before the invention of the modern motorized truck.\n\nHorses are frequently seen in television, films and literature. They are sometimes featured as a major character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories. Both live horses and iconic images of horses are used in advertising to promote a variety of products. The horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry, in a variety of poses and equipment. The mythologies of many cultures, including Greco-Roman, Hindu, Islamic, and Norse, include references to both normal horses and those with wings or additional limbs, and multiple myths also call upon the horse to draw the chariots of the Moon and Sun. The horse also appears in the 12-year cycle of animals in the Chinese zodiac related to the Chinese calendar.\n\nPeople of all ages with physical and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from association with horses. Therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence. The benefits of equestrian activity for people with disabilities has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the Paralympic Games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI). Hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. In hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horse's movement to improve their patient's cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.\n\nHorses also provide psychological benefits to people whether they actually ride or not. \"Equine-assisted\" or \"equine-facilitated\" therapy is a form of experiential psychotherapy that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with mental illness, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, and those who are going through major life changes. There are also experimental programs using horses in prison settings. Exposure to horses appears to improve the behavior of inmates and help reduce recidivism when they leave.\n\nHorses have been used in warfare for most of recorded history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used in warfare dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, and the use of horses in warfare was widespread by the end of the Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses have been used in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.\n\nHorses are raw material for many products made by humans throughout history, including byproducts from the slaughter of horses as well as materials collected from living horses.\n\nProducts collected from living horses include mare's milk, used by people with large horse herds, such as the Mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis. Horse blood was once used as food by the Mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. Drinking their own horses' blood allowed the Mongols to ride for extended periods of time without stopping to eat. The drug Premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares (pregnant mares' urine), and was previously a widely used drug for hormone replacement therapy. The tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.\n\nHorse meat has been used as food for humans and carnivorous animals throughout the ages. It is eaten in many parts of the world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures, and a subject of political controversy in others. Horsehide leather has been used for boots, gloves, jackets, baseballs, and baseball gloves. Horse hooves can also be used to produce animal glue. Horse bones can be used to make implements. Specifically, in Italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a \"spinto\", which is used to test the readiness of a (pig) ham as it cures. In Asia, the saba is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.\n\nHorses are grazing animals, and their major source of nutrients is good-quality forage from hay or pasture. They can consume approximately 2% to 2.5% of their body weight in dry feed each day. Therefore, a adult horse could eat up to of food. Sometimes, concentrated feed such as grain is fed in addition to pasture or hay, especially when the animal is very active. When grain is fed, equine nutritionists recommend that 50% or more of the animal's diet by weight should still be forage.\n\nHorses require a plentiful supply of clean water, a minimum of to per day. Although horses are adapted to live outside, they require shelter from the wind and precipitation, which can range from a simple shed or shelter to an elaborate stable.\n\nHorses require routine hoof care from a farrier, as well as vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental examinations from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist. If horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. When turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained. Regular grooming is also helpful to help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.\n\n\n",
                "Ungulate\n\nUngulates (pronounced ) are any members of a diverse group of primarily large mammals that includes odd-toed ungulates such as horses and rhinoceroses, and even-toed ungulates such as cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, deer, and hippopotamuses. Most terrestrial ungulates use the tips of their toes, usually hoofed, to sustain their whole body weight while moving.\n\nThe term means, roughly, \"being hoofed\" or \"hoofed animal\". As a descriptive term, \"ungulate\" normally excludes cetaceans (whales, dolphins, porpoises), as they do not possess most of the typical morphological characteristics of ungulates, but recent discoveries indicate that they are descended from early artiodactyls. Ungulates are typically herbivorous (though some species are omnivorous, such as pigs), and many employ specialized gut bacteria to allow them to digest cellulose, as in the case of ruminants. They inhabit a wide range of habitats, including jungles, plains and rivers.\n\nUngulata, which used to be considered an order, has been split into the following: Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates), Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), Tubulidentata (aardvarks), Hyracoidea (hyraxes), Sirenia (dugongs and manatees), Proboscidea (elephants) and occasionally Cetacea (whales and dolphins).\n\nHowever, in 2009 morphological and molecular work has found that aardvarks, hyraxes, sea cows, and elephants are more closely related to sengis, tenrecs, and golden moles than to the perissodactyls and artiodactyls, and form Afrotheria. Elephants, sea cows, and hyraxes are grouped together in the clade Paenungulata, while the aardvark has been considered as either a close relative to them or a close relative to sengis in the clade Afroinsectiphilia. This is a striking example of convergent evolution.\n\nThere is now some dispute as to whether this smaller Ungulata is a cladistic (evolution-based) group, or merely a phenetic group (form taxon) or folk taxon (similar, but not necessarily related). Some studies have indeed found the mesaxonian ungulates and paraxonian ungulates to form a monophyletic lineage, closely related to either the Ferae (the carnivorans and the pangolins) in the clade Fereuungulata or to the bats. Other studies found the two orders not that closely related, as some place the perissodactyls as close relatives to bats and Ferae in Pegasoferae and others place the artiodactyls as close relatives to bats.\n\nBelow is a simplified taxonomy (assuming that ungulates do indeed form a natural grouping) with the extant families, in order of the relationships. Keep in mind that there are still some grey areas of conflict, such as the case with relationship of the pecoran families and the baleen whale families. See each family for the relationships of the species as well as the controversies in their respective article.\n\n\nBelow is the general consensus of the phylogeny of the ungulate families.\nPerissodactyla and Artiodactyla include the majority of large land mammals. These two groups first appeared during the late Paleocene, rapidly spreading to a wide variety of species on numerous continents, and have developed in parallel since that time. Some scientists believed that modern ungulates are descended from an evolutionary grade of mammals known as the condylarths; the earliest known member of the group was the tiny \"Protungulatum\", an ungulate that co-existed with the last of non-avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago; however, many authorities do not consider it a true placental, let alone an ungulate. The enigmatic dinoceratans were among the first large herbivorous mammals, although their exact relationship with other mammals is still debated with one of the theories being that they might just be distant relatives to living ungulates; the most recent study recovers them as within the true ungulate assemblage, closest to \"Carodnia\".\n\nIn Australia, the marsupial \"Chaeropus\" also developed hooves, convergent those of artiodactyls.\n\nPerissodactyls are said to have evolved from the Phenacodontidae, small, sheep-sized animals that were already showing signs of anatomical features that their descendents would inherit (the reduction of digit I and V for example). By the start of the Eocene, 55 million years ago (Mya), they had diversified and spread out to occupy several continents. Horses and tapirs both evolved in North America; rhinoceroses appear to have developed in Asia from tapir-like animals and then colonised the Americas during the middle Eocene (about 45 Mya). Of the approximately 15 families, only three survive (McKenna and Bell, 1997; Hooker, 2005). These families were very diverse in form and size; they included the enormous brontotheres and the bizarre chalicotheres. The largest perissodactyl, an Asian rhinoceros called \"Paraceratherium\", reached , more than twice the weight of an elephant.\n\nIt has been found in a cladistic study that the anthracobunids and the desmostylians - two lineages that have been previously classified as Afrotherians (more specifically closer to elephants) - have been classified as a clade that is closely related to the perissodactyls. The desmostylians were large amphibious quadrupeds with massive limbs and a short tail. They grew to in length and are thought to have weighed more than . Their fossils are known from the northern Pacific Rim, from southern Japan through Russia, the Aleutian Islands and the Pacific coast of North America to the southern tip of Baja California. Their dental and skeletal form suggests desmostylians were aquatic herbivores dependent on littoral habitats. Their name refers to their highly distinctive molars, in which each cusp was modified into hollow columns, so that a typical molar would have resembled a cluster of pipes, or in the case of worn molars, volcanoes. They are the only marine mammals to have gone extinct.\n\nThe South American meridiungulates, which contain the somewhat tapir-like pyrotheres and astrapotheres, the mesaxonic litopterns and the diverse notoungulates; As a whole, meridiungulates are said to have evolved from animals like \"Hyopsodus\". For a while their relationships with other ungulates was a mystery. Some paleontologists have even challenged the monophyly of Meridiungulata by suggesting that the pyrotheres may be more closely related to other mammals, such as Embrithopoda (an African order that are related to elephants) than to other South American ungulates. A recent study based on bone collagen as also found that to suggest that at least litopterns and the notoungulates were closely related to the perissodactyls.\n\nThe oldest known fossils assigned to Equidae date from the early Eocene, 54 million years ago. They had been assigned to the genus \"Hyracotherium\", but the type species of that genus is now considered not a member of this family, but the other species have been split off into different genera. These early Equidae were fox-sized animals with three toes on the hind feet, and four on the front feet. They were herbivorous browsers on relatively soft plants, and already adapted for running. The complexity of their brains suggest that they already were alert and intelligent animals. Later species reduced the number of toes, and developed teeth more suited for grinding up grasses and other tough plant food.\n\nRhinocerotoids diverged from other perissodactyls by the early Eocene. Fossils of \"Hyrachyus eximus\" found in North America date to this period. This small hornless ancestor resembled a tapir or small horse more than a rhino. Three families, sometimes grouped together as the superfamily Rhinocerotoidea, evolved in the late Eocene: Hyracodontidae, Amynodontidae and Rhinocerotidae, thus creating an explosion of diversity unmatched for a while until environmental changes drastically eliminated several species.\n\nThe first tapirids, such as \"Heptodon\", appeared in the early Eocene. They appeared very similar to modern forms, but were about half the size, and lacked the proboscis. The first true tapirs appeared in the Oligocene. By the Miocene, such genera as \"Miotapirus\" were almost indistinguishable from the extant species. Asian and American tapirs are believed to have diverged around 20 to 30 million years ago; and tapirs migrated from North America to South America around 3 million years ago, as part of the Great American Interchange.\n\nPerissodactyls were the dominant group of large terrestrial browsers right through the Oligocene. However, the rise of grasses in the Miocene (about 20 Mya) saw a major change: the artiodactyl species with their more complex stomachs were better able to adapt to a coarse, low-nutrition diet, and soon rose to prominence. Nevertheless, many perissodactyl species survived and prospered until the late Pleistocene (about 10,000 years ago) when they faced the pressure of human hunting and habitat change.\n\nThe artiodactyls are thought to have evolved from a small group of condylarths, Arctocyonidae, which were unspecialized, superficially raccoon-like to bear-like omnivores from the Early Paleocene\n(about 65 to 60 million years ago). They had relatively short limbs lacking specializations associated with their relatives (e.g. reduced side digits, fused bones, and hoofs), and long, heavy tails. Their primitive anatomy makes it unlikely that they were able to run down prey, but with their powerful proportions, claws, and long canines, they may have been able to overpower smaller animals in surprise attacks. Evidently these mammals soon evolved into two separate lineages: the mesonychians and the artiodactyls.\n\nMesonychians are depicted as \"wolves on hooves\" and were the first major mammalian predators, appearing in the Paleocene. Early mesonychids had five digits on their feet, which probably rested flat on the ground during walking (plantigrade locomotion), but later mesonychids had four digits that ended in tiny hoofs on all of their toes and were increasingly well adapted to running. Like running members of the even-toed ungulates, mesonychids (\"Pachyaena\", for example) walked on their digits (digitigrade locomotion). Mesonychians fared very poorly at the close of the Eocene epoch, with only one genus, \"Mongolestes\", surviving into the Early Oligocene epoch, as the climate changed and fierce competition arose from the better adapted creodonts.\n\nThe first artiodactyls looked like today's chevrotains or pigs: small, short-legged creatures that ate leaves and the soft parts of plants. By the Late Eocene (46 million years ago), the three modern suborders had already developed: Suina (the pig group); Tylopoda (the camel group); and Ruminantia (the goat and cattle group). Nevertheless, artiodactyls were far from dominant at that time: the perissodactyls were much more successful and far more numerous. Artiodactyls survived in niche roles, usually occupying marginal habitats, and it is presumably at that time that they developed their complex digestive systems, which allowed them to survive on lower-grade food. While most artiodactyls were taking over the niches left behind by several extinct perissodactyls, one lineage of artiodactyls began to venture out into the seas.\n\nThe traditional theory of cetacean evolution was that cetaceans were related to the mesonychids. These animals had unusual triangular teeth very similar to those of primitive cetaceans. This is why scientists long believed that cetaceans evolved from a form of mesonychid. Today many scientists believe cetaceans evolved from the same stock that gave rise to hippopotamuses. This hypothesized ancestral group likely split into two branches around . One branch would evolve into cetaceans, possibly beginning about with the proto-whale \"Pakicetus\" and other early cetacean ancestors collectively known as Archaeoceti, which eventually underwent aquatic adaptation into the completely aquatic cetaceans. The other branch became the anthracotheres, a large family of four-legged beasts, the earliest of whom in the late Eocene would have resembled skinny hippopotamuses with comparatively small and narrow heads. All branches of the anthracotheres, except that which evolved into Hippopotamidae, became extinct during the Pliocene without leaving any descendants. The family Raoellidae is said to be the closest artiodactyl family to the cetaceans. Consequentially, new theories in cetacean evolution hypothesize that whales and their ancestors escaped predation, not competition, by slowly adapting to the ocean.\n\nUngulates are in high diversity in response to sexual selection and ecological events; the majority of ungulates lack a collar bone. Terrestrial ungulates are for the most part herbivores, with some of them being grazers. However, there are exceptions to this as pigs, peccaries, hippos and duikers are known to have an omnivorous diet. Some cetaceans are the only modern ungulates that are carnivores; baleen whales consume significantly smaller animals in relation to their body size, such as small species of fish and krill; toothed whales, depending on the species, can consume a wide range of species: squid, fish, sharks, and other species of mammals such as seals and other whales. In terms of ecosystem ungulates have colonized all corners of the planets, from mountains to the ocean depths; grasslands to deserts and have been domesticated by humans.\n\nUngulates have developed specialized adaptations, especially in the areas of cranial appendages, dentition, and leg morphology including the modification of the astragalus (one of the ankle bones at the end of the lower leg) with a short, robust head.\n\nThe hoof is the tip of a toe of an ungulate mammal, strengthened by a thick horny (keratin) covering. The hoof consists of a hard or rubbery sole, and a hard wall formed by a thick nail rolled around the tip of the toe. The weight of the animal is normally borne by both the sole and the edge of the hoof wall. Hooves grow continuously, and are constantly worn down by use. In most modern ungulates, the radius and ulna are fused along the length of the forelimb; early ungulates, such as the arctocyonids, did not share this unique skeletal structure. The fusion of the radius and ulna prevents an ungulate from rotating its forelimb. Since this skeletal structure has no specific function in ungulates, it is considered a homologous characteristic that ungulates share with other mammals. This trait would have been passed down from a common ancestor. While the two orders of ungulates colloquial names are based on the number of toes of their members (\"odd-toed\" for the perissodactyls and \"even-toed\" for the terrestrial artiodactyls), it is not an accurate reason they are grouped. Tapirs have four toes in the front, yet they are members of the \"odd-toed\" order; peccaries and modern cetaceans are members of the \"even-toed\" order, yet peccaries have three toes in the front and whales are an extreme example as they have flippers instead of hooves. Scientists had classified them according to the distribution of their weight to their toes.\n\nPerissodactyls have a mesaxonic foot meaning that the weight is distributed on the third toe on all legs thanks to the plane symmetry of their feet. There has been reduction of toes from the common ancestor, with the classic example being horses with their single hooves. In consequence, there was an alternative name for the perissodactyls the nearly obsolete Mesaxonia. Perissodactyls are not the only lineage of mammals to have evolved this trait; the meridiungulates have evolved mesaxonic feet numerous times.\n\nTerrestrial artiodactyls have a paraxonic foot meaning that the weight is distributed on the third and the fourth toe on all legs. The majority of these mammals have cloven hooves, with two smaller ones known as the dewclaws that are located further up on the leg. The earliest cetaceans (the archaeocetes), also have this characteristic in the addition of also having both an astragalus and cuboid bone in the ankle, which are further diagnostic traits of artiodactyls.\nIn modern cetaceans, the front limbs have become pectoral fins and the hind parts are internal and reduced. Occasionally, the genes that code for longer extremities cause a modern cetacean to develop miniature legs (known as atavism). The main method of moving is an up-and-down motion with the tail fin, called the fluke, which is used for propulsion, while the pectoral fins together with the entire tail section provide directional control. All modern cetaceans still retain their digits despite the external appearance suggesting otherwise.\n\nMost ungulates have developed reduced canine teeth and specialized molars, including bunodont (low, rounded cusps) and hypsodont (high crowned) teeth. The development of hypsodonty has been of particular interest as this adaptation was strongly associated with the spread of grasslands during the Miocene about 25 million years. As forest biomes declined, grasslands spread, opening new niches for mammals. Many ungulates switched from browsing diets to grazing diets, and possibly driven by abrasive silica in grass, hypsodonty became common. However, recent evidence ties the evolution of hyspodonty to open, gritty habitats and not the grass itself. This is termed the Grit, not grass hypothesis.\n\nSome ungulates completely lack upper incisors and instead have a dental pad to assist in browsing. It can be found in camels, ruminants, and some toothed whales; modern baleen whales are remarkable in that they have baleen instead to filter out the krill from the water. On the other spectrum teeth have been evolved as weapons or sexual display seen in pigs and peccaries, some species of deer, musk deer, hippopotamuses, beaked whales and the Narwhal, with its long canine tooth.\n\nUngulates evolved a variety of cranial appendages that today can be found in cervoids (with the exception of musk deer). In oxen and antelope, the size and shape of the horns vary greatly, but the basic structure is always a pair of simple bony protrusions without branches, often having a spiral, twisted or fluted form, each covered in a permanent sheath of keratin. The unique horn structure is the only unambiguous morphological feature of bovids that distinguishes them from other pecorans. Male horn development has been linked to sexual selection, while the presence of horns in females is likely due to natural selection. The horns of females are usually smaller than those of males, and are sometimes of a different shape. The horns of female bovids are thought to have evolved for defense against predators or to express territoriality, as nonterritorial females, which are able to use crypsis for predator defense, often do not have horns.\n\nRhinoceros horns, unlike those of other horned mammals, only consist of keratin. The horns rest on the nasal ridge of the animals skull.\n\nAntlers are unique to cervids and found mostly on males: only caribou and reindeer have antlers on the females, and these are normally smaller than those of the males. Nevertheless, fertile does from other species of deer have the capacity to produce antlers on occasion, usually due to increased testosterone levels. Each antler grows from an attachment point on the skull called a pedicle. While an antler is growing, it is covered with highly vascular skin called velvet, which supplies oxygen and nutrients to the growing bone. Antlers are considered one of the most exaggerated cases of male secondary sexual traits in the animal kingdom, and grow faster than any other mammal bone. Growth occurs at the tip, and is initially cartilage, which is mineralized to become bone. Once the antler has achieved its full size, the velvet is lost and the antler's bone dies. This dead bone structure is the mature antler. In most cases, the bone at the base is destroyed by osteoclasts and the antlers fall off at some point. As a result of their fast growth rate, antlers are considered a handicap since there is an incredible nutritional demand on deer to re-grow antlers annually, and thus can be honest signals of metabolic efficiency and food gathering capability.\n\nOssicones are horn-like (or antler-like) protuberances that can be found on the heads of giraffes and male okapis today. They are similar to the horns of antelopes and cattle, save that they are derived from ossified cartilage, and that the ossicones remain covered in skin and fur, rather than horn. Antlers (such as on deer) are derived from bone tissue: when mature, the skin and fur covering of the antlers, termed \"velvet\", is sloughed and scraped off to expose the bone of the antlers.\n\nPronghorn are unique when compared to their relatives. Each \"horn\" of the pronghorn is composed of a slender, laterally flattened blade of bone that grows from the frontal bones of the skull, forming a permanent core. As in the Giraffidae, skin covers the bony cores, but in the pronghorn it develops into a keratinous sheath which is shed and regrown on an annual basis. Unlike the horns of the family Bovidae, the horn sheaths of the pronghorn are branched, each sheath possessing a forward-pointing tine (hence the name pronghorn). The horns of males are well developed.\n\nMany of the world’s ungulate species exist only in relatively small populations in which some degree of inbreeding inevitably occurs. A study of 16 species of captive ungulates revealed that juvenile survival of inbred young is generally lower than that of non-inbred young. (Also see Inbreeding depression). These findings have implications for the genetic management of small ungulate populations.\n\n\n",
                "Odd-toed ungulate\n\nMembers of the order Perissodactyla, otherwise known as odd-toed ungulates, are mammals characterized by an odd number of toes and by hindgut fermentation with somewhat simple stomachs. Perissodactyla comes from the Ancient Greek περισσός (\"perissós\", “uneven”) + δάκτυλος (\"dáktulos\", “a finger, toe”). Unlike the even-toed ungulates, they digest plant cellulose in their intestines rather than in one or more stomach chambers. The order includes three extant families: Equidae (horses, asses, and zebras), Rhinocerotidae (rhinoceroses), and Tapiridae (tapirs), with a total of about 17 species. Despite their very different appearances, they were recognized as related families in the 19th century by the zoologist Richard Owen, who also coined the order name.\n\nThe largest odd-toed ungulates are rhinoceroses, and the extinct \"Paraceratherium\", a hornless rhino from the Oligocene, is considered one of the largest land mammals of all time. At the other extreme, an early member of the order, the prehistoric horse \"Hyracotherium\", had a withers height of only . Apart from dwarf varieties of the domestic horse and donkey, perissodactyls reach a body length of and a weight of . While rhinos have only sparse hair and exhibit a thick epidermis, tapirs and horses have dense, short coats. Most species are grey or brown, although zebras and young tapirs are striped.\n\nThe main axes of both the front and rear feet pass through the third toe, which is always the largest. The remaining toes have been reduced in size to varying degrees. Tapirs, which are adapted to walking on soft ground, have four toes on their fore feet and three on their hind feet. Living rhinos have three toes on both the front and hind feet. Modern equines possess only a single toe; however, their feet are equipped with hooves, which almost completely cover the toe. Rhinos and tapirs, by contrast, have hooves covering only the leading edge of the toes, with the bottom being soft.\n\nThe ulnae and fibulae are reduced in horses. A common feature that clearly distinguishes this group from other mammals is the saddle-shaped ankle between the astragalus and the scaphoid, which greatly restricts the mobility of the foot. The thigh is relatively short, and the clavicle is absent.\n\nOdd-toed ungulates have a long upper jaw with an extended diastema between the front and cheek teeth, giving them an elongated head. The various forms of snout between families are due to differences in the form of the premaxilla. The lacrimal bone has projecting cusps in the eye sockets and a wide contact with the nasal bone. The temporomandibular joint is high and the mandible is enlarged.\n\nRhinos have one or two horns made of agglutinated keratin, unlike the horns of even-toed ungulates, which have a bony core.\n\nThe number and form of the teeth vary according to diet. The incisors and canines can be very small or completely absent, as in the two African species of rhinoceros. In the horses, usually only the males possess canines. The surface shape and height of the molars is heavily dependent on whether soft leaves or hard grass makes up the main component of their diets. Three or four cheek teeth are present on each jaw half, so the dental formula of odd-toed ungulates is: \nAll perissodactyls are hindgut fermenters. In contrast to ruminants, hindgut fermenters store digested food that has left the stomach in an enlarged cecum, where the food is digested by bacteria. No gallbladder is present. The stomach of perissodactyls is simply built, while the cecum accommodates up to in horses. The intestine is very long, reaching up to in horses. Extraction of nutrients from food is relatively inefficient, which probably explains why no odd-toed ungulates are small; for large animals, nutritional requirements per unit of body weight are lower and the surface-to-volume ratio is smaller.\n\nThe present distribution of most perissodactyl species is only a small fraction of their original range. Members of this group are now found only in Central and South America, eastern and southern Africa, and central, southern, and southeastern Asia. During the peak of odd-toed ungulate existence, from the Eocene to the Oligocene, perissodactyls were distributed over much of the globe, the only exceptions being Australia and Antarctica. Horses and tapirs arrived in South America after the formation of the Isthmus of Panama in the Pliocene, around 3 million years ago. In North America, they died out around 10,000 years ago, while in Europe, the tarpans disappeared in the 19th century. Hunting and habitat restriction have reduced the present-day species to fragmented relict populations. In contrast, domesticated horses and donkeys have gained a worldwide distribution, and feral animals of both species are now also found in regions outside of their original range, such as in Australia.\n\nPerissodactyls inhabit a number of different habitats, leading to different lifestyles. Tapirs are solitary and inhabit mainly tropical rainforests. Rhinos tend to live alone in rather dry savannas, and in Asia, wet marsh or forest areas. Horses inhabit open areas such as grasslands, steppes, or semideserts, and live together in groups. Odd-toed ungulates are exclusively herbivores that feed, to varying degrees, on grasses, leaves, and other plant parts. A distinction is often made between primarily grass feeders (white rhinos, equines) and leaf feeders (tapirs, other rhinos).\n\nOdd-toed ungulates are characterized by a long gestation period and a small litter size, usually delivering a single young. The gestation period is 330–500 days, being longest in the rhinos. Newborn perissodactyls are precocial; young horses and rhinos can follow the mother after a few hours. The young are nursed for a relatively long time, often into their second year, reaching sexual maturity around eight or ten years old. Perissodactyls are long-lived, with several species reaching an age of almost 50 years in captivity.\n\nTraditionally, the odd-toed ungulates were classified with other mammals such as artiodactyls, hyraxes, mammals with a proboscis, and other \"ungulates\". A close family relationship with hyraxes was suspected based on similarities in the construction of the ear and the course of the carotid artery.\n\nRecent molecular genetic studies, however, have shown the ungulates to be polyphyletic, meaning that in some cases the similarities are the result of convergent evolution rather than common ancestry. Elephants and hyraxes are now considered to belong to Afrotheria, so are not closely related to the perissodactyls. These, in turn, are in the Laurasiatheria, a superorder that had its origin in the former supercontinent Laurasia. Molecular genetic findings suggest that the cloven Artiodactyla (containing the cetaceans as a deeply nested subclade) are the sister taxon of the Perissodactyla; together, the two groups form the Euungulata. More distant are the bats (Chiroptera) and Ferae (a common taxon of carnivorans, Carnivora, and pangolins, Pholidota). In a discredited alternative scenario, a close relationship exists between perissodactyls, carnivores, and bats, this assembly comprising the Pegasoferae.\n\nAccording to studies published in March 2015, odd-toed ungulates are in a close family relationship with at least some of the so-called Meridiungulata, a very diverse group of mammals living from the Paleocene to the Pleistocene in South America, whose systematic unity is largely unexplained. Some of these were classified on the basis of their paleogeographic distribution. However, a close relationship can be worked out to perissodactyls by means of protein sequencing and comparison with fossil collagen from remnants of phylogenetically young members of the Meridiungulata (specifically \"Macrauchenia\" from the Litopterna and \"Toxodon\" from the Notoungulata). Both kinship groups, the odd-toed ungulates and the Litopterna-Notoungulata, are now in the higher-level taxon of Panperissodactyla. This kinship group is included among the Euungulata which also contains the even-toed ungulates and whales (Artiodactyla). The separation of the Litopterna-Notoungulata group from the perissodactyls probably took place before the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. \"Condylarths\" can probably be considered the starting point for the development of the two groups, as they represent a heterogeneous group of primitive ungulates that mainly inhabited the northern hemisphere in the Paleogene.\n\nOdd-toed ungulates (Perissodactyla) comprise three living families with around 17 species—in the horse the exact count is still controversial. Rhinos and tapirs are more closely related to each other than to the horses. The separation of horses from other perissodactyls took place according to molecular genetic analysis in the Paleocene some 56 million years ago, while the rhinos and tapirs split off in the lower middle Eocene, about 47 million years ago. \n\nThere are many perissodactyl fossils of multivariant form. The major lines of development include the following groups:\n\n\nRelationships within the large group of odd-toed ungulates are not fully understood. Initially, after the establishment of \"Perissodactyla\" by Richard Owen in 1848, the present-day representatives were considered equal in rank. In the first half of the 20th century, a more systematic differentiation of odd-toed ungulates began, based on a consideration of fossil forms, and they were placed in two major suborders: Hippomorpha and Ceratomorpha. The Hippomorpha comprises today's horses and their extinct members (Equoidea); the Ceratomorpha consist of tapirs and rhinos plus their extinct members (Tapiroidea and Rhinocerotoidea). The names Hippomorpha and Ceratomorpha were introduced in 1937 by Horace Elmer Wood, in response to criticism of the name \"Solidungula\" that he proposed three years previously. It had been based on the grouping of horses and Tridactyla and on the rhinoceros/tapir complex. The extinct brontotheriidae were also classified under Hippomorpha and therefore possess a close relationship to horses. Some researchers accept this assignment because of similar dental features, but there is also the view that a very basal position within the odd-toed ungulates places them rather in the group of \"Titanotheriomorpha\".\n\nOriginally, the Chalicotheriidae were seen as members of Hippomorpha, and presented as such in 1941. William Berryman Scott thought that, as claw-bearing perissodactyls, they belong in the new suborder Ancylopoda (where Ceratomorpha and Hippomorpha as odd-toed ungulates were combined in the group of Chelopoda). The term Ancylopoda, coined by Edward Drinker Cope in 1889, had been established for chalicotheres. However, further morphological studies from the 1960s showed a middle position of Ancylopoda between Hippomorpha and Ceratomorpha. Leonard Burton Radinsky saw all three major groups of odd-toed ungulates as peers, based on the extremely long and independent phylogenetic development of the three lines. In the 1980s, Jeremy J. Hooker saw a general similarity of Ancylopoda and \"Ceratomorpha\" based on dentition, especially in the earliest members, leading to the unification in 1984 of the two submissions in the interim order, \"Tapiromorpha\". At the same time he expanded the Ancylopoda to include the \"Lophiodontidae\". The name \"Tapiromorpha\" goes back to Ernst Haeckel, who coined it in 1873, but it was long considered synonymous to Ceratomorpha because Wood had not considered it in 1937 when Ceratomorpha were named, since the term had been used quite differently in the past. Also in 1984, Robert M. Schoch used the conceptually similar term Moropomorpha, which today applies synonymously to Tapiromorpha. Included within the Tapiromorpha are the now extinct Isectolophidae, a sister group of the Ancylopoda-Ceratomorpha group and thus the most primitive members of this relationship complex.\n\nThe evolutionary development of Perissodactyla is well documented in the fossil record. Numerous finds are evidence of the adaptive radiation of this group, which was once much more varied and widely dispersed. \"Radinskya\" from the late Paleocene of East Asia is often considered to be one of the oldest close relatives of the ungulates. Its only 8 cm skull must have belonged to a very small and primitive animal with a π-shaped crown pattern on the enamel of its rear molars similar to that of perissodactyls and their relatives, especially the rhinos. Finds of \"Cambaytherium\" and \"Kalitherium\" in the Cambay shale of western India indicate an origin in Asia dating to the Lower Eocene roughly 54.5 million years ago. Their teeth also show similarities to \"Radinskya\" as well as to the Tethytheria clade. The saddle-shaped configuration of the navicular joints and the mesaxonic construction of the front and hind feet also indicates a close relationship to Tethytheria. However, this construction deviates from that of Cambaytherium, indicating that it is actually a member of a sister group. Ancestors of Perissodactyla may have arrived via an island bridge from the Afro-Arab landmass onto the Indian subcontinent as it drifted north towards Asia.\n\nThe alignment of hyopsodontids and phenacodontids to Perissodactyla in general suggests an older Laurasian origin and distribution for the clade, dispersed across the northern continents already in the early Paleocene. These forms already show a fairly well-developed molar morphology, with no intermediary forms as evidence of the course of its development. The close relationship between meridiungulate mammals and perissoodactyls in particular is of interest since the latter appear in South America soon after the KT event, implying rapid ecological radiation and dispersal after the mass extinction.\n\nThe Perissodactyla appear relatively abruptly at the beginning of the Lower Paleocene before about 63 million years ago, both in North America and Asia, in the form of phenacodontids and hyopsodontids. The oldest finds from an extant group originate among other sources from \"Sifrhippus\", an ancestor of the horses from the Willswood lineup in northwestern Wyoming. The distant ancestors of tapirs appeared not too long after that in the Ghazij lineup in Balochistan, such as \"Ganderalophus\", as well as \"Litolophus\" from the Chalicotheriidae line, or \"Eotitanops\" from the group of brontotheriidae. Initially, the members of the different lineages looked quite similar with an arched back and generally four toes on the front and three on the hind feet. \"Hyracotherium\", which is considered a member of the horse family, outwardly resembled \"Hyrachyus\", the first representative of the rhino and tapir line. All were small compared to later forms and lived as fruit and foliage eaters in forests. The first of the mega-fauna to emerge were the brontotheres, in the Middle and Upper Eocene. \"Megacerops\", known from North America, reached a withers height of and could have weighed just over . The decline of brontotheres at the end of the Eocene is associated with competition arising from the advent of more successful herbivores.\n\nMore successful lines of odd-toed ungulates emerged at the end of the Eocene when dense jungles gave way to steppe, such as the chalicotheriid rhinos, and their immediate relatives; their development also began with very small forms. \"Paraceratherium\", one of the largest mammals ever to walk the earth, evolved during this era. They weighed up to and lived throughout the Oligocene in Eurasia. About 20 million years ago at the onset of the Miocene the perissodactyls first reached Africa when it became connected to Eurasia because of the closing of the Tethys Ocean. For the same reason, however, new animals such as the mammoths also entered the ancient settlement areas of odd-toed ungulates, creating competition that led to the extinction of some of their lines. The rise of ruminants, which occupied similar ecological niches and had a much more efficient digestive system, is also associated with the decline in diversity of odd-toed ungulates. A significant cause for the decline of perissodactyls was climate change during the Miocene, leading to a cooler and drier climate accompanied by the spread of open landscapes. However, some lines flourished, such as the horses and rhinos; anatomical adaptations made it possible for them to consume tougher grass food. This led to open land forms that dominated the newly created landscapes. With the emergence of the Isthmus of Panama in the Pliocene, perissodactyls and other megafauna were given access to one of their last habitable continents: South America. However, many perissodactyls became extinct at the end of the ice ages, including American horses and the \"Elasmotherium\". Whether over-hunting by humans (overkill hypothesis), climatic change, or a combination of both factors was responsible for the extinction of ice age mega-fauna, remains controversial.\n\nIn 1758, in his seminal work \"Systema Naturae\", Linnaeus (1707–1778) classified horses (\"Equus\") together with hippos (\"Hippopotamus\"). At that time, this category also included the tapirs (\"Tapirus\"), more precisely the lowland or South American tapir (\"Tapirus terrestus\"), the only tapir then known in Europe. Linnaeus classified this tapir as \"Hippopotamus terrestris\" and put both genera in the group of the \"Belluae\" (\"beasts\"). He combined the rhinos with the Glires, a group now consisting of the lagomorphs and rodents. Mathurin Jacques Brisson (1723–1806) first separated the tapirs and hippos in 1762 with the introduction of the concept \"le tapir\". He also separated the rhinos from the rodents, but did not combine the three families now known as the odd-toed ungulates. In the transition to the 19th century, the individual perissodactyl genera were associated with various other groups, such as the proboscidean and even-toed ungulates. In 1795, Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772- 1844) and Georges Cuvier (1769–1832) introduced the term \"pachyderm\" (Pachydermata), including in it not only the rhinos and elephants, but also the hippos, pigs, peccaries, tapirs and hyrax . The horses were still generally regarded as a group separate from other mammals and were often classified under the name \"Solidungula\" or \"Solipèdes\", meaning \"one-hoof animal\".\n\nIn 1861, Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville (1777–1850) classified ungulates by the structure of their feet, differentiating those with an even number of toes from those with an odd number. He moved the horses as \"solidungulate\" over to the tapirs and rhinos as \"multungulate\" animals and referred to all of them together as \"onguligrades à doigts impairs\", coming close to the concept of the odd-toed ungulate as a systematic unit. Richard Owen (1804–1892) quoted Blainville in his study on fossil mammals of the Isle of Wight and introduced the name \"Perissodactyla\".\n\nIn 1884, Othniel Charles Marsh (1831–1899) came up with the concept \"Mesaxonia\", which he used for what are today called the odd-toed ungulates, including their extinct relatives, but explicitly excluding the hyrax. \"Mesaxonia\" is now considered a synonym of \"Perissodactyla\", but it was sometimes also used for the true odd-toed ungulates as a subcategory (rhinos, horses, tapirs), while \"Perissodactyla\" stood for the entire order, including the hyrax. The assumption that hyraxes were \"Perissodactyla\" was held well into the 20th century. Only with the advent of molecular genetic research methods had it been recognized that the hyrax is not closely related to perissodactyls but rather to elephants and manatees.\n\nThe domestic horse and the donkey play an important role in human history particularly as transport, work and pack animals. The domestication of both species began several millennia B.C. Due to the motorisation of agriculture and the spread of automobile traffic, such use has declined sharply in Western industrial countries; riding is usually undertaken more as a hobby or sport. In less developed regions of the world, the traditional uses for these animals are, however, still widespread. To a lesser extent, horses and donkeys are also kept for their meat and their milk.\n\nIn contrast, the existence in the wild of almost all other odd-toed ungulates species has declined dramatically because of hunting and habitat destruction. The quagga is extinct and Przewalski's horse has been eradicated in the wild.\n\nPresent threat levels, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (2012):\n\n\n"

                "Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range\n\nThe Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range is a refuge for a historically significant herd of free-roaming Mustangs, feral horses colloquially called \"wild horses\", located in the Pryor Mountains of Montana and Wyoming in the United States. The range has an area of and was established in 1968 along the Montana–Wyoming border as the first protected refuge dedicated exclusively for Mustangs. It was the second feral horse refuge in the United States. About a quarter of the refuge lies within the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area. A group of federal agencies, led by the Bureau of Land Management, administers the range.\n\nBecause of the unique genetic makeup of the Pryor Mountains Mustang herd, equine geneticist Dr. E. Gus Cothran concluded in 1992 that \"the Pryor herd may be the most significant wild-horse herd remaining in the United States.\" Dr. D. Phillip Sponenberg, equine veterinarian at Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, agreed, noting, \"[These animals] don't exist anywhere else.\"\n\nIn 1900, there were two to five million feral horses in the United States. However, their numbers were in steep decline as domestic cattle and sheep competed with them for resources. After the mid-1930s, their numbers fell even more drastically due to intervention by the U.S. government. The United States Forest Service and the U.S. Grazing Service (the predecessor to the Bureau of Land Management (BLM)) began to remove feral horses from federal land. The two agencies were concerned that there were too many horses on the land, which led to overgrazing and significant soil erosion. Ranchers wanted the feral horses removed because they were grazing on land ranchers wanted to use for their own livestock. Hunters were worried that as horses degraded range land, hunting species would also suffer. It was not clear that there were too many horses, or that the land was incurring damage due to the presence of the horses. Nonetheless, both agencies responded to political pressure to act, and they began to remove hundreds of thousands of feral horses from federal property. From 1934 to 1963, the Grazing Service (and from 1946 onward, the BLM) paid private contractors to kill Mustangs and permitted their carcasses to be used for pet food. Ranchers were often permitted to round up any horses they wanted, and the Forest Service shot any remaining animals.\n\nFeral horse advocates were unhappy with the Forest Service and BLM's horse culling procedures. They argued that herding horses from the air or by motorized vehicle (such as motorcycles) terrorized the animals and caused numerous and cruel injuries. Led by Velma Bronn Johnston—better known as \"Wild Horse Annie,\" a secretary at an insurance firm in Reno, Nevada—animal welfare and horse advocates lobbied for passage of a federal law to prevent this kind of hunting. Their efforts were successful. On September 8, 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed into law the Hunting Wild Horses and Burros on Public Lands Act (Public Law 86- 234, also known as the \"Wild Horse Annie Act\"), which banned the hunting of feral horses on federal land from aircraft or motorized vehicles.\n\nHowever, in 1961 President John F. Kennedy ordered the United States Department of the Interior to implement measures to stop soil erosion on federal land. On the Pryor Mountains range, where there were about 140 to 200 horses, BLM ordered in 1964 that the horses be removed. Fearful that the horses were not going to be stabled but that the roundup was a prelude to slaughter of the entire herd, in 1966 Johnston began a letter-writing and public relations campaign against the BLM. Johnston's goal was the establishment of a permanent refuge for the Pryor Mountains herd, but this was a daunting task. Hunting and ranching lobby groups had strongly opposed establishment of a feral horse refuge in Nevada, and only accepted creation of the Nevada Wild Horse Range in 1962 because it was within the Nellis Air Force Range area of (renamed Nevada Test and Training Range in 2001). In 1965, Johnston founded the International Society for the Protection of Mustangs and Burros (ISPMB), a nonprofit group dedicated to educating the public about the plight of feral horses and burros, which and lobbied Congress and the executive branch for their protection on public land. Johnston and her group had several local allies as well. They included Bessie Tillett (a widowed rancher's wife in her 80s) and her sons, Royce and Lloyd Tillett. The Tilletts tried to protect the feral horses beginning in 1964, claiming them as their own and threatening BLM officials who tried to remove the herd from land the Tilletts leased from BLM. (The Tilletts also kept feral horses from the herd on their private land, and began adopting them out.) BLM officials suspended the Tilletts' lease in 1966 (the reason was inadequate fencing), forcing the family to give up their claim to many horses. Others who wanted to protect the herd included ranchers and the people of nearby Lovell, Wyoming, who saw the horses not only as part of Western heritage but also a major tourist attraction. The ISPMB and its allies proved highly effective in raising public awareness of the issue and building political support for their efforts, and in 1966 BLM suspended its plans for the roundup.\n\nIn 1968, BLM proposed three new plans for dealing with the Pryor Mountains Mustang herd: removing but not killing all but 30 to 35 animals and allowing the rest to remain on the range; killing all but 10 to 15 animals and allowing the herd to recover to 30 animals; or allowing the state of Montana to remove all the animals and sell them. In response, Pryor Mountains horse advocates began pushing for a protected sanctuary for these animals. The group contacted ABC News producer Hope Ryden and made her aware of BLM's plans. Ryden visited the range and filmed a news segment which aired on July 11, 1968, on \"ABC News\" with Frank Reynolds. ABC News and BLM were \"deluged\" with mail protesting the removal of the horses after the segment aired. On August 27, 1968, the Humane Society of the United States successfully sued to stop trapping of the horses. The political landscape shifted dramatically toward protection rather than removal of the horses. On September 9, 1968, Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall formally established a Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range of . Montana's senior Senator, Mike Mansfield, was so elated that he published Udall's order scrapping the BLM plan in the \"Congressional Record.\"\n\nThe size of the range was determined by law, which specified that the range could cover only those areas where feral horses existed in 1971 (but not necessarily historically). A boundary fence had been constructed between BLM and Forest Service land in the 1940s, which significantly affected feral horse distribution in the Pryor Mountains and restricted the horses to rangeland south, east, and west of the Custer National Forest. By 1968, when the refuge was created, fences completely surrounded what became the refuge, limiting the horses' spread. Both BLM and the Forest Service interpreted the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 as requiring protection of feral horses only on those lands where the horses existed as of 1971, not lands which they had historically used.\n\nEstablishment of the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range did not end debate over the legal status of the horse herd, how they should be protected, or how many horses should be permitted to live on the range.\n\nIn October 1968, the Interior department established an Advisory Committee to report on the state of the herd, the status of forage on the range, and whether feral horses should continue to be kept on the range. The panel met a month later, and commissioned studies on whether branded runaway horses should be allowed to mix with the herd, whether BLM should build artificial watering holes to encourage the animals to range more widely, whether BLM should manage the herd's bloodlines by introducing stallions to the herds, and how many horses should live on the range. At its February 1969 meeting, the committee proved sharply divided over horse management issues. Studies of the range proved highly inadequate. BLM presented a study to the committee which attempted to show that horses were grazing the land so heavily that extensive erosion was taking place, but a private study found that the erosion was due to topography and drought and not because of the horses. Another study, conducted by a group which promoted hunting on the range, found that the horses were having a negative impact on edible plants in the Pryor Mountains and were having a detrimental impact on deer fawn survival. But the committee discovered that this study hadn't even been conducted in the Pryor Mountains but at another location. Another BLM study concluded that the Pryor Mountains horses had changed from grazers to browsers and were consuming large mountain mahogany shrub, a critical deer food source. But an Advisory Committee analysis showed that the plants documented in the study were small mountain mahogany shrub variety, not the large mahogany shrub BLM claimed, and that the vegetation was in good shape, not deteriorated as the BLM claimed.\n\nIn June 1969, the Committee rendered its unanimous opinion that forage on the range was in good shape, herd health was good, and that the range should be managed solely for the protection of wild horses. The Advisory Committee did, however, recommend that the herd levels be reduced to no more than 100 horses; that branded, deformed, old, and sick animals be culled from the herd; that BLM should create new watering holes to encourage the herd to forage more widely; that the range be fenced; and that roads be constructed in the range's interior to improve access for tourists. In 1970, BLM built a catch-basin to help supply horses on the range with water.\n\nAlso at issue were BLM practices for managing horses in protected areas. Under BLM policy, ranchers could release a branded mare into a herd and then, the following year, round up the band the mare ran with for slaughter or sale. In Nevada, state law permitted ranchers to round up any unbranded horses on their private land and slaughter or sell them. Concerned about these practices, and about continuing horse hunts in unprotected areas, Johnston and her group began working to pass federal legislation to protect feral horses throughout the U.S. She was joined by a number of prominent people, including country music singer Judy Lynn, \"Gunsmoke\" actress Amanda Blake, and \"New Hampshire Union Leader\" publisher and conservative William Loeb III.\n\nOn December 18, 1971, President Richard M. Nixon signed into law the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971 (WFRHBA), which made it a crime for anyone to harass or kill feral horses or burros on federal land, required the departments of the Interior and Agriculture to protect the animals, required studies of the animals' habits and habitats, and permitted public land to be set aside for their use. In addition, the act required that feral horses be protected as \"living symbols of the historic and pioneer spirit of the West\", and that management plans must \"maintain a thriving natural ecological balance among wild horse populations, wildlife, livestock, and vegetation and to protect the range from the deterioration associated with overpopulation.\" Although feral horse ranges were principally for the protection of the horses, the land was required to be maintained for multiple use. BLM was also permitted to close public land to livestock grazing to protect feral horse and burro habitat.\n\nThe WFRHBA gave jurisdiction over challenges to BLM and Forest Service management of feral horses and how the act is implemented to the Department of the Interior's Board of Land Appeals. The act also contained provisions for the removal of excess animals; the destruction of lame, old, or sick animals; the private placement or adoption of excess animals; and even the destruction of healthy animals if range management required it.\n\nIn fact, the destruction of healthy or unhealthy horses almost never occurred. The WFRHBA left range management policy unresolved in many respects, although it did specify that BLM and the Forest Service consult with state wildlife agencies. In practice, BLM struggled to accommodate the needs of feral horses among its other priorities (which included livestock grazing, prevention of soil erosion, and accommodating big game hunting). In November 1971, BLM announced a major effort to save the Pryor Mountains herd from starvation after a poor summer growing season left vegetation on the range stunted. By 1974, the herd on the Pryor Mountain range had increased by 17 percent over the 1968 level. However, there was strong disagreement over whether the population had actually increased as much as this, if at all.\n\nIn 1973, BLM began a pilot project on the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range known as the Adopt-A-Horse initiative. The program took advantage of provisions in the WFRHBA to allow private \"qualified\" individuals to \"adopt\" as many horses as they wanted if they could show that they could provide adequate care for the animals. At the time, title to the horses remained permanently with the U.S. federal government. The pilot project was so successful that BLM allowed it to go nationwide in 1976. (As of 2001, the Adopt-a-Horse program was the primary method of removing excess feral horses from BLM and Forest Service land.) In 1976, Congress included a provision in the Federal Land Policy and Management Act that permitted the humane use of helicopters in capturing free-roaming horses on federal land, and for the use of motorized vehicles in transporting them to corrals. In 2009, a BLM official said that while many federally protected feral horse ranges have trouble adopting out all their horses, every horse from the Pryor Mountains herd put up for adoption was subsequently adopted by a private citizen.\nThere were, however, strong disagreements over the nature of the horses. Many ranchers and hunters considered feral horses to be an invasive species, or at least an introduced species. While conceding that federal law protects the animals, these individuals also argued that economic needs (like livestock grazing) should take precedence over the horses. However, horse advocates argued that horses were native to North America and eliminated by paleolithic human beings, and as a native wild animal they should be protected like the grizzly bear or bald eagle. To test which definition applied to feral horses, in 1974 the New Mexico Livestock Board seized 19 free-roaming feral burros which were preventing cattle from using a watering hole on federal land. The United States District Court for the District of New Mexico held that, under the Property Clause of the U.S. Constitution, Congress could regulate wild animals only to protect public land from damage. The case went to the Supreme Court of the United States. In \"Kleppe v. New Mexico\", 426 U.S. 529 (1976), the Supreme Court ruled that these free-roaming horses and burros were, in fact, wildlife, and it rejected New Mexico's narrow construction of the Property Clause. Ranchers continued to litigate the issue, however. In the early 1980s, ranching interests won a ruling from the Department of the Interior that feral horses who ate grass or drank water which ranchers had leased had \"taken\" these resources from the ranchers in violation of the \"takings clause\" of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. However, in \"Mountain States Legal Foundation v. Hodel\", 799 F.2d 1423 (1986), cert. den'd. 480 U.S. 951 (1987), the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit said that a wild animal was not an \"agent\" of the federal government and hence could not be found guilty of \"taking\" the ranchers' leased grass or water.\n\nProblems with the Adopt-a-Horse program also emerged. BLM was accused of allowing too many adoptions so as to deplete feral horse populations on federal land. Many private individuals were also accused of \"adopting\" horses only to later sell them for slaughter as pet food. Responding to these problems, in 1978 Congress passed the Public Rangelands Improvement Act (PRIA). The PRIA limited adoptions to only four horses a year per individual and allowed BLM to relinquish title to the horse after one year (during which inspections regarding the animal's treatment were to occur). The law also required BLM to inventory all feral horse herds, scientifically determine what constituted \"appropriate\" herd levels, and determine through a public process whether \"excess\" animals should be removed. Congress further amended PRIA in 1978 to require updated herd counts. Pursuant to the 1978 amendments, BLM established 209 \"herd management areas\" (HMAs) where feral horses existed on federal land. The Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range was one of only three HMAs solely dedicated to feral horses. In January 1982, the director of BLM issued a moratorium on the destruction of excess adoptable animals. From 1988 to 2004, Congress also prohibited BLM from using any funds to destroy excess animals.\n\nMost of the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range was designated a wilderness study area in 1981. Wilderness study areas (WSAs) are authorized by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. The act directed the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) of the United States Department of the Interior to inventory and study all federally owned roadless areas for possible designation as a Wilderness Area. Until the United States Congress makes a final determination on the status of a wilderness study area, the BLM must manage the area as a protected national wilderness. Three BLM areas entirely enclosed by the range and one National Park Service area only partially within the range were recommended for wilderness in August 1991 and December 1981. These areas are the Burnt Timber Canyon WSA, Pryor Mountain WSA, Big Horn Tack-On WSA, and Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area WSA.\n\nIn November 1996, Congress passed the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act, which authorized BLM and the Forest Service to use helicopters and motor vehicles to round up and transport feral horses on public lands.\n\nIn 2004, Republican Senator from Montana Conrad Burns inserted a rider into the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 (a 3,000-page omnibus appropriations bill) which permitted BLM to sell excess animals more than 10 years old or which have been offered for adoption three times. The amendment also required that excess, unadoptable horses \"shall be made available for sale without limitation.\" Burns was reportedly acting on behalf of ranching interests, who wished more of the horses removed from federal land. Although the legislation (signed into law by President George W. Bush) was described by one media outlet as \"undercut[ing] more than three decades of lobbying and legislative action aimed at protecting America's wild horses from slaughter\", as of May 2011 it has not been repealed.\n\nIn early 2005, BLM discovered that some of the excess wild horses it had sold had been slaughtered. BLM suspended the sales program in April 2005 and resumed them in May 2005 after implementing new requirements to deter buyers from slaughtering the animals. In the fall of 2007, the last three horse slaughterhouses in the United States closed. However, BLM procedures do not ban the export of wild horses for sale and slaughter outside the United States.\n\nIn 2008, the Government Accountability Office concluded BLM was not in compliance with the 2004 amendment. BLM had imposed limitations on the sale of excess horses to help ensure that they were not slaughtered (thus avoiding a public outcry).\n\nThe Pryor Mountains are a region of Montana and Wyoming. They were formed in the late Cretaceous and Early Tertiary period (about 70 to 60 million years ago) when magma welling up from below cracked a vast limestone plateau into four pieces and uplifted the northeast corner of each piece. The Bighorn River flows north from Wyoming until it reaches the plateau between the Bighorn and Pryor mountains. The river flows along the fault line between the two mountain ranges, and has cut the Bighorn Canyon deep into the limestone. The Crow Native American tribe called the mountains Baahpuuo Isawaxaawuua (\"Hitting the Rock Mountains\"), because of the large amount of flint found there (a type of rock which could be chipped into arrowheads and spear points). The mountains draw their current name from Sergeant Nathaniel Hale Pryor, a member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition who vainly pursued horses stolen from the expedition in the area.\n\nSoil and water resources on the range are limited. Soil depth varies from less than deep to deep, and there are only five perennial water sources on the range. Livestock grazing occurred on the range until the late 1960s, and the area historically was severely overgrazed, which has created the limited forage conditions found on the range today.\n\nThe Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range is east of and adjacent to Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area. The range consists primarily of alpine meadows, high desert, rocky ridges, and steep, semi-alpine slopes. The average elevation is about . Rainfall varies from as little as in the foothills to in the mountains' upper reaches. Snowfall is generally about a year, and occurs from September to May.\n\nHistorians and scientists speculate that feral horses have lived on and near Pryor Mountains since at least the late 1600s. Crow Indian tradition maintains that the horses were brought to the area by about 1725. Non-Indian explorers found native people in possession of large numbers of horses as early as 1743. Thousands of feral horses lived in the area by the time American pioneers began settling near the Pryor Mountains in the late 1800s.\nIt was widely believed that the Pryor Mountains horses were direct descendants of the Barb horses brought to North America by Juan de Oñate's expedition to explore America north of the Rio Grande in the early 1600s. Their bloodlines may also include American Saddlebred, Canadian, Irish Hobby, and Tennessee Walking horses, although this was in dispute for many years. Some people claimed that the horses were nothing more than local domestic horses which had escaped to the wild. In 1992, equine geneticist Dr. E. Gus Cothran ran genetic studies on the herd, and concluded that their primary bloodline descends from Spanish Barbs. Since no genetic variants were observed which were not also seen in domestic horse breeds, in 2010 Cothran concluded the horses were not a unique species which had survived from prehistoric times. Rather, they were linear descendants of the Spanish Barb, with some evidence of genetic similarity to light racing and riding breeds. The genetic tests also revealed that the Pryor Mountains horses carried a rare allele variant known as \"Qac\" that only Spanish horses brought to the Americas also carried. Dr. D. Phillip Sponenberg of the Virginia–Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, and an expert on horse breeds, observed that, physically, the horses conform to the Colonial Spanish Horse type. Genetic studies have also revealed that the herd exhibits a high degree of genetic diversity, and BLM has acknowledged the genetic uniqueness of the herd.\n\nThe Pryor Mountains feral horse conforms to a very specific type. The animal is generally high, with an average of . The horses weigh on the range, and more if raised in captivity. The animals exhibit a wide range of solid colors, including bay, black, chestnut, dun, grullo, and blue or red roan. Buckskin coloring is rare but does occur, and pinto coloring can be minimally expressed. However, the majority of colors are dun or grullo. Nearly all the horses on the range exhibit primitive markings such as dorsal stripes, transverse stripes across the withers, and horizontal \"zebra\" stripes on the back of the forelegs. The Pryor Mountains horse's body is heavy, with strong bones. Manes and tails tend to be long, and the horse's winter coat is very heavy and often curly. The head is convex or straight (the \"Roman nose\" identified by horse breeders), with wide-set eyes, hooked ears, and a broad forehead that tapers well to the muzzle. The front teeth meet evenly, the upper lip is usually longer than the lower, and the nostrils are small and crescent shaped. The neck is medium in length, and most of the animals have only five lumbar vertebrae (an anatomical feature common in primitive horses)—although some have a fifth and sixth vertebrae which are fused. The horse's shoulders are long and sloping, the withers are prominent, and chests are medium to narrow in width. The croup is generally sloped, and tail-set is low. The hooves are ample and very hard.\n\nPryor Mountains Mustangs exhibit a natural paso gait. The horses are generally intelligent, strong, and sure-footed, and exhibit great stamina. Like all feral horses, they generally avoid human contact, are distrustful, and are easily spooked. However, once they are familiar with an individual, they can exhibit a strong social bond with that individual. Pryor Mountains horses can be broken and ridden, and trained to do any task a domesticated horse can perform. Trained Pryor Mountains horses have a calm temperament, and are alert on trails.\n\nThe horses form bands or \"harems,\" in which a single stallion mates and controls a group of about six mares. Another eight to 10 \"bachelor\" stallions accompany the band at a distance, hoping to win control of it from the stallion or mate with mares.\n\nBLM counts the herd visually about every four years by flying over the range, reporting on each animal found, and using statistical methods to correct for historic undercounting and other problems. In 1984, BLM set the maximum carrying capacity of the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range at 121 adult animals, and revised this to 95 adult animals in 1992.\n\nManagement of the Pryor Mountains horse herd has focused on fulfilling the Free-Roaming Wild Horse and Burro Act's requirement that BLM maintain a \"thriving natural ecological balance\". In general, BLM initially focused on how many horses the range could support and in maintaining conformity to the Pryor Mountains standard. However, with the development of DNA testing in the mid-1980s, the focus changed to maintaining the herd's genetic viability as well. In 1988, researchers at Washington State University authored a paper which raised concern that the herd exhibited a lack of genetic diversity, and could be suffering from genetic drift and/or a population bottleneck. BLM contracted with veterinarian E. Gus Cothran (then at the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Kentucky, but now at the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences) to take random genetic samples of the herd in 1994, 1997, and 2001. Cothran's analysis found \"no evidence of a bottleneck\". Genetic diversity was actually above the mean for feral horse herds in the United States, and just below the mean for domesticated breeds. The BLM, however, interpreted these studies in 2009 to indicate that the genetic diversity of the Pryor Mountains herd is \"well above\" the mean for domestic breeds. Cothran considered the herd to be in genetic equilibrium, although he cautioned that a minimum of 120 breeding-age animals should be kept on the range to maintain the genetic health of the herd. Research by biologists and veterinarians at Colorado State University, the University of Kentucky, and other colleges found that there is little inbreeding in bands, as the stallions tend to drive off colts when they are about two years old.\n\nIn 1990, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report highly critical of BLM's wild horse management programs. The GAO concluded that the BLM had little scientific basis for deciding what the range carrying capacity was or how many horses should be removed to attain ecological equilibrium or restoration. Furthermore, the GAO found that the BLM had not reduced livestock grazing or engaged in range management activities to improve the carrying capacity of the land.\n\nFor years, BLM had also allowed any horse to be adopted from the range. Since adopters favored \"pretty\" horses, the genetics of the herd altered so that mostly bays and blacks were left on the range. This problem was quickly discovered and adoption procedures changed in 1994 so that now the original colors and patterns of the herd are returning. That same year, the Pryor Mountains Mustang Breeders Association was formed to preserve the gene pool of the herd and establish a registry for Pryor Mountains horses in private hands. In order to be placed on the register, the horse must have a registered sire and dam, have a title issued either by BLM or the Tillett ranch, and have a certificate of blood typing from the Gluck Equine Research Center at the University of Kentucky. As of 2008, 209 horses in 16 U.S. states and one Canadian province were on the registry.\n\nBLM undertook a roundup of the horse herd in 1997 to reduce its numbers, and BLM officials said that they expected to do another in late 2000 when the herd size reached 200. By August 1999, there were 180 adult horses and colts on the range.\nIn May 2009, after several long-term studies of the rangeland, BLM determined that the range's maximum carrying capacity was 179 feral horses. This assumed that all BLM land, as well as lands leased from other owners (public and private), would continue to be available to the animals, and that BLM would be able to manage the horses by using artificial watering sites to encourage the horses to utilize undergrazed portions of the range. BLM also said it would implement other range management techniques, including restoration of riparian vegetation to enhance existing watering holes, use of controlled burns to reduce the amount of dead wood and brush on the range, noxious weed control, better fencing, and other methods. BLM also proposed purchasing of land from the state of Montana, and another of private land, to add to the range.\n\nAt the same time, BLM said it would reduce the herd from its existing 195 adults to 120. The goal was to temporarily remove feral horses from the refuge to allow the range to recover from the historic overgrazing caused by livestock, not because BLM believed there were too many horses on the range. According to Jared Bybee, BLM wild horse and burro specialist, grass cover on the range was at just 18 percent of its historic average. Sixty percent of the remaining horses would be males, to reduce the rate of population growth. The agency said it would remove 30 horses a year from the herd and stable them at a yearly cost of $18,000 to $21,000 until the correct herd size and sex ratios had been reached. Horses to be removed from the herd included those which did not closely fit the conformity type; which were genetically well represented; which were 11 to 15 years of age, had sired or foaled, and were not band stallions; and were between five and 10 years of age or 16 to 20 years of age. Genetic diversity would be measured by visual observation of the herd's conformity to type (using a visual system developed by Dr. Sponenberg), and measures taken to improve genetic diversity if signs of inbreeding occurred. The Cloud Foundation and Front Range Equine Rescue, both feral horse advocacy groups, challenged the roundup in federal court. A federal district court judge delayed the roundup three days to consider their request, but on September 2, 2009, rejected the injunction and allowed the roundup to proceed.\n\nBLM began its roundup of feral horses on the Pryor Mountains range in early September 2009. After several days, 130 of 188 feral horses were rounded up. Forty-six horses were put up for adoption, while the freed mares were given a contraceptive vaccine to help keep the herd population down. The Forest Service also closed a portion of the Custer National Forest to livestock grazing after about 40 feral horses moved into the area, but rounded these up as well and returned them to the range.\n\nAt this time, BLM also placed \"guzzlers\" on the range. A guzzler is a precipitation (usually rainwater) collection device which traps water in a storage tank (ranging in size from a few to several thousand gallons/liters). The storage tank can be above-ground, partially buried, or below-ground. A mechanical valve releases water into a drinking trough from the storage tanks, allowing animals access to the water. When the valve senses that the water level in the trough is low, it opens and allows more water into the drinking area. Five guzzlers were placed in undergrazed areas to encourage the horses to better utilize this forage.\n\nIn the fall of 2010, BLM issued a set of draft strategy documents for operating its wild horse programs, and solicited public comment on the plans. After receiving numerous comments, BLM said in February 2011 it would quicken the pace at which it made revisions to its roundup procedures, use of fertility control drugs, and wild horse and burro range land management. The agency also commissioned a study from the National Academies of Science (NAS) on wild-horse management. Due for release in 2013, independent NAS experts will study a wide variety of issues, including the carrying capacity of wild horse and burro ranges, wild horse and burro population growth, and best practices in fertility control.\n\nIn September 2011, BLM announced it would begin working with the Humane Society of the United States to develop new practices in herd management and roundup, and increase its emphasis on adoptions and the use of drugs as fertility control to help better manage its wild horse herds.\n\nThe Pryor Mountains feral horse herd is one of the most accessible feral horse herds in the United States. Tourism to the range increased steadily in the mid to late 2000s.\nThe range can be easily accessed via a paved road which parallels Bighorn Canyon, and which provides excellent viewing of the horses. The range can also be accessed from Laurel, Montana, by traveling south on U.S. Route 310 and then taking the Forest Service gravel road to Dryhead Overlook. Those with four-wheel drive vehicles can take the rutted dirt road through the forest to Penn's Cabin, which is another good horse viewing spot. Those interested in circumnavigating the range can take the dirt Burnt Timber Ridge Road from Penn's Cabin to the dirt Sykes Ridge Road, and follow Sykes Ridge Road to its terminus. (Sykes Ridge Road also offers the best viewing of the Bighorn Basin.) Roads around the range tend to be impassable in wet weather or snow. Some of the range may be accessed via the Crow Indian Reservation. A trespass permit (obtainable from the Crow Nation) is required to cross tribal land or exit a vehicle while on tribal land.\n\nHiking on the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse range is good, but there are no maintained or marked trails and (as of 2000) no guidebooks to the area.\n\nIn addition to feral horses, the Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Refuge is also a good place to see other wildlife and plant species. Among the species found there are Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep, black bears, blue grouse, cougars, elk, gray wolves, mule deer, ring-necked pheasant, and sage grouse. The Pryor Mountains are also home to the most diverse bat populations in Montana, with 10 species identified (and potentially other species also present). The range is also home to several animals which BLM or the state of Montana considers sensitive to ecological change, such as Baird's sparrow, long-eared myotis (a species of vesper bat), pallid bat, peregrine falcon, spotted bat, Townsend's big-eared bat, and Yellowstone cutthroat trout. There are also 15 species of plants on the range which have been granted special status by the state of Montana or the federal government.\n\nThis herd was the subject of the 1995 documentary film \"Cloud: Wild Stallion of the Rockies\" and its sequel, the 2003 documentary film \"Cloud's Legacy: The Wild Stallion Returns\".\n\n\n",
                "Tarpan\n\nThe tarpan (\"Equus ferus ferus\"), also known as Eurasian wild horse, was a subspecies of wild horse. It is now extinct. The last individual believed to be of this subspecies died in captivity in Russia in 1909, although some sources claim that it was not a genuine wild horse due to its resemblance to domesticated horses.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, several attempts were made to develop horses that looked like tarpans through selective breeding, called \"breeding back\" by advocates. The breeds that resulted included the Heck horse, the Hegardt or Stroebel's horse, and a derivation of the Konik breed, all of which have a primitive appearance, particularly in having the grullo coat color. Some of these horses are now commercially promoted as \"tarpans\". However, those who study the history of the ancient wild horse assert that the word \"tarpan\" only describes the true wild horse.\n\nThe name \"tarpan\" or \"tarpani\" is from a Turkic language (Kazakh or Kyrgyz) name meaning \"wild horse\". The Tatars and the Cossacks distinguished the wild horse from the feral horse; the latter was called \"Takja\" or \"Muzin\".\n\nIn modern use, the term has been loosely used to refer to the predomesticated ancestor of the modern horse, \"Equus ferus,\" to the predomestic subspecies believed to have lived into the historic era, \"Equus ferus ferus,\" and to all European primitive or \"wild\" horses in general. The modern \"bred-back\" horse breeds are also promoted as \"tarpan\" by their supporters, though researchers discourage this use of the word, which they believe should only apply to the ancient \"E. ferus ferus\".\n\nThe tarpan was first described by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1774; he had seen the animals in 1769 in the district of Bobrov, near Voronezh. In 1784 Pieter Boddaert named the species \"Equus ferus\", referring to Gmelin's description. Unaware of Boddaert's name, Otto Antonius published the name \"Equus gmelini\" in 1912, again referring to Gmelin's description. Since Antonius' name refers to the same description as Boddaert's it is a junior objective synonym. It is now thought that the domesticated horse, named \"Equus caballus\" by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, is descended from the tarpan; indeed, many taxonomists consider them to belong to the same species. By a strict application of the rules of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the tarpan ought to be named \"E. caballus\", or if considered a subspecies, \"E. caballus ferus\". However, biologists have generally ignored the letter of the rule and used \"E. ferus\" for the tarpan to avoid confusion with the domesticated subspecies.\n\nIt is debated if the small, free-roaming horses seen in the forests of Europe during 18th and 19th centuries and called \"tarpan\" were indeed wild, never-domesticated horses, hybrids of the Przewalski's horse and local domestic animals, or simply feral horses. Most studies have been based on only two preserved specimens and research to date has not positively linked the tarpan to Pleistocene or Holocene-era animals. \n\nIn 2003, the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature \"conserved the usage of 17 specific names based on wild species, which are predated by or contemporary with those based on domestic forms\", confirming \"E. ferus\" for the tarpan. Taxonomists who consider the domestic horse a subspecies of the wild tarpan should use \"Equus ferus caballus\"; the name \"Equus caballus\" remains available for the domestic horse where it is considered to be a separate species.\n\nTraditionally, two tarpan subtypes have been proposed, the forest tarpan and steppe tarpan, although there seem to be only minor differences in type. The general view is that there was only one subspecies, the tarpan, \"Equus ferus ferus\". The last individual, which died in captivity in 1909, was between tall at the shoulders, had a thick falling mane, a grullo coat colour, dark legs, and primitive markings, including a dorsal stripe and shoulder stripes. \n\nA number of genotypes have been identified within European wild horses from the Pleistocene and Holocene; their coat color genes including those creating bay, black and leopard complex are known to be present in the wild horse population in Europe and were depicted in cave paintings of wild horses during the Pleistocene. The dun gene, a dilution gene seen in Przewalski's horse that also creates the grullo or \"blue dun\" coat, seen in the Konik has genetic markers identified in modern horses, but has not yet been studied in European wild horses. It is considered likely that at least some wild horses had a dun coat.\n\nSome theorize that the tarpan had a standing mane because all other extant wild equines display this feature, and falling manes are considered an indication of domestication. However, historical accounts do not unambiguously describe a standing mane in European wild horses, and it is likely that they had a short, falling mane. This feature is advantageous in regions with much rainfall because it diverts rain and snow from the neck and face and prevents a loss of heat, as much as a bushy tail. Mummified Siberian wild horses display a hanging mane as well.\n\nThe appearance of European wild horses is reconstructed with genetic, osteologic and historic data. One genetic study suggests that bay was the predominant color in European wild horses. During the Mesolithic, a gene coding a black coat color appeared on the Iberian peninsula. This color spread east but was less common than bay in the investigated sample and never reached Siberia. Bay in combination with dun results in the \"bay dun\" color seen in Przewalski's horses, black with dun creates the grullo coat. A loss of dun dilution may have been advantageous in more forested western European landscapes, as dark colors were a better camouflage in forests. Pangaré or \"mealy\" coloration, a characteristic of other wild equines, might have been present in at least some tarpans, as historic accounts report a light-colored belly. It is also likely that European wild horses had primitive markings, consisting of stripes on the shoulders, legs and spine.\n\nWild horses have been present in Europe since the Pleistocene and ranged from southern France and Spain east to central Russia. There are cave drawings of primitive predomestication horses at Lascaux, France and in Cave of Altamira, Spain, as well as artifacts believed to show the species in southern Russia, where a horse of this type was domesticated around 3000 BCE. \"Equus ferus\" had a continuous range from western Europe to Alaska; historic material suggests wild horses lived in most parts of Holocene Europe and the Eurasian steppe, except for parts of Scandinavia, Iceland and Ireland. \n\nThe \"forest horse\" or \"forest tarpan\" was a hypothesis of various 19th-century natural scientists, including Tadeusz Vetulani, who suggested that the continuous forestation of Europe after the last ice age created forest-adapted subtype of the wild horse, which he named \"Equus sylvestris.\" However, historic references do not describe any major difference between the populations, therefore most authors assume there was only one subspecies of western Eurasian wild horse, \"Equus ferus ferus.\" Nevertheless, a stocky type of horse living in forests and highlands was described during the 19th century in Spain, the Pyrenees, the Camargue, the Ardennes, Great Britain, and the southern Swedish upland. They had a robust head and strong body, and a long frizzy mane. The color was described as faint brown or yellowish brown with eel stripe and leg stripes, or wholly black legs. The flanks and shoulders were spotted, some of them tended to an ashy colour. They dwelled in rocky habitats and showed intelligent and fierce behaviour. In Dutch swamps, black wild horses were found with a large skull, small eyes and a bristly muzzle. The mane was full, with broad hooves and curly hair. However, it is possible that these were feral and not wild horses. \n\nHerodotus described lightly-coloured wild horses in an area now part of the Ukraine in the 5th century BCE. In the 12th century, Albertus Magnus states that mouse-coloured wild horses with a dark eel stripe lived in the German territory, and in Denmark, large herds were hunted. Wild horses still were common in the east of Prussia during the 15th and early 16th centuries. During the 16th century, wild horses disappeared from most of the mainland of western Europe and became less common in eastern Europe as well. Belsazar Hacquet saw wild horses in the Polish zoo in Zamość during the Seven Years' War. According to him, those wild horses were of small body size, had a blackish brown colour, a large and thick head, short dark manes and tail hair, and a “beard”. They were absolutely untameable and defended themselves harshly against predators. Kajetan Kozmian visited the population at Zamość as well and reported that they were small and strong, had robust limbs and a constantly dark mouse colour. Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin witnessed herds in Voronezh in 1768. Those wild horses were described as very fast and shy and would flee by any noise, small with small pinned ears, and a short frizzly mane. The tail was shorter than in domestic horses. They were described as mouse-colored with a light belly and legs becoming black, although gray and white horses were mentioned as well. The coat was long and dense. Peter Simon Pallas witnessed possible wild tarpans in the same year in southern Russia. He thought they were feral animals that escaped during the confusions of wars. These herds were important game of the Tatars and numbered between five and 20 animals. The horses he described had a small body, large and thick heads, short frizzly manes and short tail hair, as well as pinned ears. The colour was described as faint brownish, sometimes brown or black. He also reported of obvious domestic hybrids with lightly colored legs or grays. \n\"The Natural History of Horses\" by 19th-century author Charles Hamilton Smith also described tarpans. According to Smith, the herds of wild horses numbered from a few to hundred individuals. They often were mixed with domestic horses, and alongside pure herds there were herds of feral horses or hybrids. The color of pure tarpans was described as constantly brown, cream-colored or mouse-colored. The short frizzy mane was reported to be black, as were the tail and legs. The ears either were of varying size, but set up high at the skull. The eyes were small. According to Smith, tarpans made stronger sounds than domestic horses and the overall appearance of these wild horses was mule-like. A tarpan herd survived in the Zoo of Zamość until 1806, when the reserve had to sell them because of economic problems. They were dispersed onto the local farms at the Biłgoraj region, tamed and bred to domestic horses. According to Kozmian, wild horses had been exterminated in the Polish wilderness shortly before, because they damaged hay collected for livestock.\n\nThe human-caused extinction of the tarpan began in Southern Europe, possibly in antiquity. While humans had been hunting wild horses since the Paleolithic, during historic times horse meat was an important source of protein for many cultures. As large herbivores, the range of the tarpan was continuously decreased by the increasing civilization of the Eurasian continent. Wild horses were further persecuted because they caused damage to hay storages and often took domestic mares from pastures. Furthermore, interbreeding with wild horses was an economic loss for farmers since the foals of such matings were intractable. Tarpans survived the longest in the southern parts of the Russian steppe. By 1880, when most \"tarpans\" may have become hybrids, wild horses became very rare. In 1879 the last scientifically confirmed individual was killed. After that, only dubious sightings were documented. As the tarpan horse died out in the wild between 1875 and 1890, the last considered-wild mare was accidentally killed during an attempt at capture. The last captive tarpan died in 1909 in a Russian zoo. \n\nAn early 19th-century attempt was made by the Polish government to save the tarpan type by establishing a preserve for animals descended from the tarpan in a forested area in Białowieża. In 1780, a wildlife park was established protecting a population of tarpans until the beginning of the 19th century. When the preserve had to close down in 1806, the last remaining tarpans were donated to local farmers and it is claimed that they survived through crossbreeding with domestic horses. The Konik is claimed to descend from these hybrid horses. However, there is no evidence that the Konik is genetically different in any significant degree from other domestic breeds, and thus claims that it is a descendant of the tarpan cannot be substantiated.\n\nThe oldest archaeological evidence for domesticated horses is from Kazakhstan and Ukraine between 6000 and 5500 years BP (Before Present). The diverse mitochondrial DNA of the domestic horse coinciding with the very low diversity on the Y chromosome suggests that many mares but only very few stallions were used, and local use of wild mares or even secondary sites of domestication are likely. Therefore, the European tarpan may have contributed to the domestic horse.\n\nSome researchers consider the tarpans of the last two centuries of their existence to be mixed wild and feral population or completely feral horses. Few consider the more recent animals historically called \"tarpans\" to be genuine wild horses without domestic influence. Historic references to \"wild horses\" may actually refer to feral domestic horses or hybrids. Some 19th-century authors wrote that local \"wild\" horses had hoof problems, leading to crippled legs, and therefore they assumed these were feral horses. Other contemporary authors claimed all \"wild\" horses between the Volga River and the Ural were actually feral. However, others thought that this was too speculative and assumed that wild, undomesticated horses still lived into the 19th century. Domestic horses used in warfare often were turned loose when they were not needed. Also, remaining wild stallions could steal domestic mares. There are some accounts from the 18th and 19th centuries of wild herds with typical wild horse features such as large heads, pinned ears, short frizzy mane and tail, but mentioned animals with domestic influence as well.\nThe only known individual to be photographed was the so-called Cherson-tarpan, which was caught as a foal near Novovorontsovka in 1866. It died in 1887 in the Moscow Zoo. The nature of this horse was dubious in its lifetime, because it showed almost none of the wild horse features described in the historic sources. Today it is assumed this individual either was a hybrid or a feral domestic horse.\nThree attempts have been made to use selective breeding to create a type of horse that resembles the tarpan phenotype, though recreating an extinct subspecies is not genetically possible with current technology. In 1936, Polish university professor Tadeusz Vetulani selected Polish farm horses that he believed resembled the historic tarpan and started a selective breeding program. This horse breed is now called the Konik, which clusters genetically with other domestic horse breeds, including those as diverse as the Mongolian horse and the Thoroughbred. In the early 1930s, Berlin Zoo Director Lutz Heck and Heinz Heck of the Munich Zoo began a program crossbreeding Koniks with Przewalski horses, Gotland Ponies, and Icelandic horses. By the 1960s they produced the Heck horse. In the mid-1960s, Harry Hegard started a similar program in the United States using Mustangs and local working ranch horses that has resulted in the Hegardt or Stroebel's Horse.\n\nWhile all three breeds have a primitive look that resembles the wild type tarpan in some respects, they are not genetically tarpans and the wild, predomestic European horse remains extinct. However, this does not prevent some modern breeders from marketing horses with these features as a \"tarpan\". In spite of sharing primitive external features, the Konik and Hucul horses have markedly different conformation with differently-proportioned body measurements, thought in part to be linked to living in different habitats. Other breeds sometimes alleged to be surviving tarpans include the Exmoor pony and the Dülmen pony. However, genetic studies do not set any of these breeds apart from other domestic horses. On the other hand, there has not yet been a study comparing domestic breeds directly with the European wild horse.\n\n\n",
                "The Phantom Stallion\n\nThe Phantom Stallion books, first published in 2002 by Avon Books, are a series written for young adult readers by American Terri Farley.\n\nThe main character is a girl named Samantha \"Sam\" Forster who shares a unique bond with a wild horse called The Phantom Stallion. Having spent two years away from her family's Las Vegas, Nevada ranch to recover from a riding accident, Sam returns home to find that things are never easy where horses are concerned.\n\nThere are 24 books in the series with one million copies sold worldwide. Almost every book has a new equine character as its focus and Sam and her friends battle horse thieves, cougars, earthquakes and more to keep their horses safe.\n\nUsually called Sam, she is the main character of the series. Sam is the daughter of Louise Forster, who died when Sam was young, and Wyatt Forster. She lives with Wyatt and Grace (Gram). Ever since she was very young, Sam has had a special bond with a horse that has grown up from a black colt named Blackie, into a wild gray stallion known as the Phantom. When Sam was younger, she fell off Blackie when her horse spooked beneath and struck her in the head, knocking Sam unconscious. Since the doctors warned Wyatt that Sam could suffer from complications due to her accident he sent Sam to live with Aunt Sue in San Francisco to keep her safe and so she could be near a hospital, despite her begging. After returning from her stay in California for two years, Sam feels out of place on River Bend Ranch and struggles with this for most of the series. Sam found out that \"Blackie\" had become the new herd leader, the Phantom, during her leave in California, and she makes a connection with the Phantom, reminding him how much she used to care for him and love him. Sam is known for being stubborn, kindhearted towards animals, loyal to her friends, and doing anything for the horses she loves; these qualities land her in trouble throughout the books. Her natural friend is Jacob(Jake)Ely and she made a new friend, Jennifer(Jen)Kenworthy. Sam has auburn hair, brown eyes and is just over five feet tall. She is thirteen, but by the end of the series she has turned fourteen. Sam also loves photography, winning various awards and being an editor for the \"Darton Dialogue\", her high school's newspaper.\n\nAlways referred to as Jake, unless someone is angry with or teasing him. He is half Shoshone on his father's side. Arguably Sam's best friend. Jake is known for being shy and trying to explain his thoughts in as few words as possible. He knows a lot about horses and Sam often turns to him for advice about a horse she is dealing with at the time. He is an expert tracker, and wants to work on the police force when he gets older. Jake is sixteen years old, turning seventeen later in the series, and often plays the role of Sam's chauffeur/guardian as he feels very protective of her. When Sam returns home from San Francisco, he tells her that she was hurt last time because he wasn't watching her close enough, and that from now on he was going to \"stick to her like glue\". He lives on Three Ponies Ranch with his parents and his brothers.\n\nUsually called Jen. Sam's best friend. Jen is intelligent, sarcastic, and possibly a slightly better rider than Sam. She dreams of someday becoming a vet. She strives to keep A's on her report card to earn a scholarship for college because she knows her family won't be able to afford college otherwise. She lives on Gold Dust Ranch, her family's small house in the shadow of Linc Slocum's huge mansion. Although Jen heartily dislikes Linc and Rachel Slocum, she later develops a crush on Ryan Slocum, and they have a flirtatious kind of relationship. Jen was home schooled until middle school. She has white-blonde hair often worn in braids, blue eyes, and wears black-rimmed glasses. She often wears loud clothing which aggrivates Jake. Jen and Jake have this never ending rivalry,which often makes sam uncomfortable. Jen dreams of someday owning Gold Dust Ranch, and after Linc is arrested in \"Run Away Home\", Ryan and the Kenworthys start a working ranch on the same grounds as the Gold Dust with the new name, \"Harmony Ranch\".\n\nSam and Cody's overprotective father. Louise's husband, and remarried to Brynna. He is known for being strict and just as stubborn as Sam. Wyatt, much like other cowboys in the series, speaks in as few words as possible. He's tall and has dark hair and brown eyes. He often rides Strawberry or Jeepers-Creepers, but later in the series Brynna and Sam get him his own horse, named Blue Wings. Blue isn't mentioned very often.\n\nSam's step-mother and Wyatt's second wife. Grace's new daughter-in-law. She works at the Bureau of Land Management and loves wild horses. She's an excellent rider. She has long wavy red hair and blue eyes. She marries Wyatt in the seventh book, and announces her pregnancy in the sixteenth book. In the twenty-fourth book she gives birth to her son Cody. Her horse is Penny, a little sorrel mustang mare who is blind. She is a little worried about fitting in and overdoes her role as a step mom for Sam causing her too lose her temper at times. Brynna changes lots of stuff in her life; like Algebra, cleaning her room in 'vacation', banning her from riding, saving wild horses, bringing HARP, ganging with her Dad getting her in trouble, getting new horses ...etc... Sam counts herself lucky that she has a stepmom that loves horses like her.\n\nSam's half brother. He was born in December at River Bend Ranch during a snow storm in \"Run Away Home\" while Gram and Wyatt are trapped in town by the storm. Stranded alone at river bend with a labouring Brynna, Sam calls Maxine Ely to come and help. Almost immediately after calling Maxine, the phone line goes down. Together Sam and Maxine help deliver the baby. Cody was an early Christmas present for Sam and her family. Sam thinks Cody is the name of a strong cowboy, and she loves her brother. Cody has red hair and blue eyes like his mother.\n\nSam and Cody's paternal grandmother, called Gram throughout the series. She is Wyatt's mom. Gram is the bookkeeper of River Bend Ranch, cooks, cleans, and tends her garden. Her favorite horse is a paint mare named Sweetheart, although she hardly ever rides. Grace has lived on the ranch her whole life. She believes nearly any form of emotional upset can be cured by talking it out over some good food and is renowned for her delicious recipes. Grace always tags along on the cattle drives, taking a big van out ahead of the hands and setting up \"chuck wagon\" style meals each day.\n\nThe main antagonist in the series. Linc has a reputation of playing cowboy. He is convinced he can buy his way into anything, and sometimes, it works. The one thing he can't get with money is the Phantom. He uses cruel bits and sharp spurs on his mounts, and wears fancy, expensive clothes that make him look like a Hollywood cowboy. Linc thinks of many schemes to make money and capture the Phantom, trying to prove he's a cowboy and not just a Western-wannabe throughout the entire series. He often uses Champ, a palomino gelding previously owned by the Kenworthys, as a riding horse. He is outsmarted by Brynna and Sam many times. In book 24, \"Run Away Home\", Linc gets arrested for not paying his taxes. Linc and his wife are divorced.\n\nLinc Slocum's daughter, rich and set on ruining Sam's school life as a freshman, and Ryan's twin sister. Popular and spoiled, Rachel wears fashionable clothes and looks wonderful in everything she wears. She also has a boyfriend names Kris Cameron . She thinks of horses as dumb beasts.

He stays on as The Gold Dust Ranch's foreman. He is sometimes cold and very strict about the way he treats both horses and people, often causing Sam to wonder how Jen can stand him. This has caused friction between the girls before. Money troubles and having to work under the Slocums make Jed even angrier, occasionally causing the relationship with his wife Lila to falter. Despite his gruff exterior, he genuinely loves his wife and daughter. His greatest wish is to get out from under Slocum's thumb and re-create his \"Fire and Ice\" Palomino breeding program. In \"Run Away Home,\" he regains ownership of the ranch and renames it the Harmony Ranch. Jed is friends with Sam's father, Wyatt.\n\nJake's mother, and Sam's history teacher at Darton High.

Kit often refers to Jake as 'Baby Bear,' which irritates Jake to no end. Jake is cold to his eldest brother because he is worried Kit is going to take over Three Ponies Ranch, when Jake feels like it should be him. Jake relaxes upon finding out Kit is moving to Hawaii to work on his friends ranch. Their relationship is restored after this. Kit works for Darby's grandfather in \"The Phantom Stallion: Wild Horse Island\" series.\n\nQuinn is the only Ely brother besides Jake and Kit that plays a fairly large part in the series.

Near the end of the series, Darrell makes a habit of calling Sam darlin', which annoys Jake and Sam who already has to put up with \"Brat\" even though that doesn't annoy her much as'darlin\" so she punches him in one part!! Sam gets annoyed with him the way Jake gets annoyed with Jen.\n\nCallie has bright blonde hair with a pierced nose, though she often dyes her hair many other colors in the series. Callie goes to Darton High the same school as Sam and Jen. Callie lives by herself in an apartment with a back yard surrounded by barbed wire. Jen thinks that Callie is weird.

Sam doesn't remember her mom very well, but she cherishes the memories she has of her. Wyatt and Gram have told her more and more about her mother as the series progresses and Sam ages. They mentioned how she used to come out and sit by La Charla at night to soothe Sam to sleep when she was pregnant with her, and again when Sam was an infant. Apparently, Louise wasn't much of a cook, but she could make one thing really well and that was lasagna. Gram insists that she will teach Sam how to make it one day, just like her mother.

Gabe develops a close bond with Pirate, whom he renames Firefly. He eventually adopts the colt and takes him home. Gabe is also a little hot headed, cranky and has a temper.\n\nThe Phantom Stallion is a silver stallion, half Quarter Horse and Half Mustang.\nAs a colt he lived with humans and was solid black (hence the name Blackie). His original owner was Samantha Anne Forster, but an accident separated them forever and freed The Phantom into the wild. His dam was a sorrel purebred Quarter Horse mare named Princess Kitty, and his sire was Smoke, a purebred wild Mustang stallion.\nNow, wild and free, The Phantom still shares a firm bond with Sam.\nUnfortunately, The Phantom is hunted by Linc Slocum(a multi-millionaire and a cowboy wannabe), thankfully, The Phantom has the wits to outsmart Linc Slocum, but not without a few scars for life. The Phantom, in the wild, has to not only dodge humans, but cougars, coyotes, and other mustang stallions looking for mares. With Sam's help he lives happily out there, wild and free.\n\nA bay mustang gelding who lives on River Bend Ranch with Sam for an owner. Ace replaced Blackie after Sam's near fatal accident. He was given to Sam as a welcome home present by Wyatt, which was a huge surprise to Jake. Except when she's grounded Sam usually rides Ace every day.\n\nThe Phantom and Hoku's sire and a purebred grey Mustang stallion, Smoke lived on River Bend Ranch until he died. Wyatt claims that Smoke wasn't smart, he just knew how to handle cattle, though Sam knows differently. Wyatt never thought he could tame the stallion and train him to handle cattle, and he couldn't, not until he learned to work together with Smoke. Then Smoke became a great cattle horse.\n\nA blue roan paint gelding with \"wing\" markings on his withers. Blue is a Spanish mustang given to Wyatt as a gift from Brynna. He is proud and stubborn, acting like humans aren't worth his time unless they can give him something he wants. Once they got him home, Wyatt tries to \"break\" rather than \"gentle\" the gelding, hoping to have him ready for work sooner. Pepper tries and fails numerous times to ride out Blue's bucks and rears, but eventually Wyatt decides that gentling him makes more sense. He works with the gelding in the same way that Jake did with Star Shower, following him when he walks away and stopping when he stops. After a time, Blue begins to trust Wyatt and accepts him as a rider. Although he isn't as dependable as some of the other horses on the ranch, Wyatt trusts him to learn the work of a cow horse.\n\nA Red dun mare with \"zebra stripes\" on her legs and a dorsal stripe along her spine. She's sassy, beautiful,and she used to be the Phantom's lead mare. The BLM took her off the range after she suffered a split hoof.

While the Phantom is recovering from an injury on Mrs. Allen's lands, Queen spends some time with him again, but when he returns to the wild she stays with Callie.\n\nMr. Martinez's curly-coated, brown colt who was being schooled by Jake and Wyatt. His half-Bashkir heritage gives him his curly hair. Mr. Martinez rode Teddy in the desensitization course organized by Trudy Allen and Mr. Preston.\n\nA saddle horse gelding from River Bend.

He spends half of his time at another home.\n\nA \"rat-tailed\" fleabitten Appaloosa gelding, living on River Bend. Pepper usually rides him. Wyatt was riding him when the dog pack attacked and caused Jeep to fall, giving Wyatt a sore back for a several days.\n\nBrynna's blind, copper-chestnut mustang mare. Formerly wild, the little horse is a very hard worker. Her previous owners gentled her well enough, but then she developed a habit of rearing. To fix this, they trusted an unsavory trainer to stop her rearing by bowling her completely over backward whenever she attempted it. Penny hit her head many times, and suffered severe nerve damage, making her go blind. Now she is in Brynna's care and has come to trust humans again, but she needs a careful and skilled rider to reach her full potential.\n\nAs River Bend's loyal ranchdog,Blaze is a tricolored border collie.He barks at unfamiliar cars and usually sleeps in the bunkhouse with the ranch-hands.He,later in the series,starts leaving the house at night,and it is revealed in the book \"Gypsy Gold\" that he has a coyote mate which is unfortunately shot by Linc Slocum.Sam later gives Singer,Blaze's son,to Jake Ely as a birthday present.\n\nSam saves this calf from drowning in quicksand out on \"Cow Killer Caldera\", and she later becomes Sam's. Sam bonds with the tiny calf and begs her father not to butcher her, which he accepts, but he makes Sam brand the calf for Buddy's own safety. When she is almost full grown Sam returns Buddy to one of the River Bend herds. In later books, Sam sees Buddy as a yearling and an adult, traveling with the herds out on the range.\n\nSam later saves the life of a small yellow calf named Daisy. Sam had her for only a few books, when a River Bend heifer who had a stillborn calf adopts her.\n\nSam's brown tabby cat. He was a gift from Jake in \"The Challenger,\" and named for the adolescent cougar that attacked Sam while riding Strawberry earlier in the book. He is most often seen racing Sam down the stairs in her ranch home or snuggling deep into her covers on cold nights. Everyone on the ranch, including Wyatt and the hands have to keep constant watch that he doesn't slip out the door with them. The cat enjoys the outdoors, but Sam worries a coyote could kill him.\nCougar develops a friendship with the draft horse mustang Tinkerbell(Tinker)and Cougar would often sleep on Tinker's back in the barn.\n\nDarrell's fighting Rooster that he rescues in \"Wild Honey\". He pleads with Sam to keep the rooster at her home, in order to save him from a bloody death in illegal cock fights. Sam reluctantly agrees, but is worried that the rooster will fight with Gram's established rooster, Rusty. Surprisingly, Gram is delighted to have another rooster to create a new flock and accepts Fluffy with no problem. Rusty and Fluffy seem territorial at first, but soon settle into a calm truce.\n\nA black and white rooster confined at the site of the illegal cock fights. When Sam and Preston ride to investigate on a hint from Darrel, Lucky jumps on top of his enclosure and acts like a guard dog. After Flick threatens Sam and Preston with a rifle, he shoots at the bird, who falls to the ground in a flurry of feathers. Somehow, he isn't actually hit and Preston later gives him to Trudy Allen as an engagement present.\n\nJake's Coydog puppy. Singer is Blaze's son.\n\nThe big, golden-honey colored mare who takes over after Queen as lead mare for the Phantom. In \"Wild Honey,\" Sam finds the mare on her own with an injured leg. Fearing that the mare will be attacked while she's injured, Sam ropes her and takes her to Mrs. Allen's ranch, begging her to keep her secret. It turns out that she is actually Phineas Preston's police horse, stolen from his corrals at least 2 years prior to \"Wild Honey.\" Preston believes that she was turned loose onto the range because the man who stole her didn't want her killed. Once her leg is healed, she stays on Deerpath Ranch/Blind Faith Mustang Sanctuary lands as his horse.\n\nThe Buckskin mare that Sam saves in the book \"Dark Sunshine\". She was being used as a Judas horse to lure other mustangs into a trap for horse rustlers, who were selling the animals for meat. They blindfolded her so she is extremely sensitive to light, and at first can only be gentled at night. During the fire at River Bend Ranch she escapes and runs with the Phantom's herd for a little while. Afterward, she becomes pregnant with the Phantom's foal and returns to the ranch, seeming to choose it as the safest place for her baby to be born. After her filly, Tempest, is born she becomes calmer, but Sam still struggles with training the mare to accept strangers and any sort of tack besides her halter. Sam chooses to focus on gentling Tempest instead, hoping her contact with the filly will teach Dark Sunshine that humans can be kind. In \"Run Away Home\" Sunny is penned in Clara's pasture behind her diner while Tempest is weaned. One day, a truck accidentally backs into the fence and brings down several of the rails. Seeing her opportunity for freedom, Sunny escapes and returns to the Phantom's band. As an adopted and branded horse, she is not legally allowed to remain on the range, but the avalanche traps her and the rest of the herd inside their secret valley. Later on, Sam is told that the territory the Phantom's herd lives on is part of Rive Bend's land, so as long as they stay within the area owned by the Forster's, the Phantom's family can run free until the end of their days.\n\nA reddish bay colt with a white patch over his right eye. Sam first spots him romping with other foals in the Phantom's band, and she loves his bold spirit and markings, giving him the name Pirate. She sees him off and on for several more months, before he follows his band into the area around the mustang sanctuary to escape a brush fire. The Phantom tries to herd him away from danger, but paint cans Sam left out by the fence explode in the fire and severely burn the colt and temporarily deafens his father. Dr. Scott manages to save the colt's life, but he is badly burned and traumatized by the event, suffering strange \"attacks\" where he sweats profusely and acts \"loco.\" Sam takes on the task of working with the colt for a week at Mrs. Allen's place to try to get through to him, but he only makes real progress when Gabe (Mrs. Allen's grandson) gets involved. The injured boy and colt form a bond and eventually Gabe convinces his parents to let him adopt the colt, who he continues to work with, for both of their sakes. Dr. Scott, the vet, and Brynna, Samantha's pregnant step-mother, decide that Pirate is a paint before Dr. Scott trailers him over to Mrs. Allen's ranch.\n\nAn albino mustang gelding, used in the HARP program. He starts off as a very skittish horse, but soon learns to trust Mikki Small (the first HARP girl) and bond with her. After that, he is used often and is very quiet and accepting of the girls, even those who don't know how to act around horses.\n\nThe Phantom's dam, a sorrel Quarter Horse once owned by the Forsters. Wyatt sold the mare to the Kenworthys right after Sam's accident, almost as if he blamed her for Blackie kicking Sam in the head by mistake. She was bred twice more while under her new ownership, once to Smoke a second time that produced the Phantom's sister (Hoku), and again to Golden Champagne (Champ). The second pregnancy did not come to term, and most people think she aborted the baby due to stress. Kitty ended up in Linc's pastures after he bought the Kenworthy's ranch, where she lived mostly by herself until she was chosen as a friend and foster mother for Boots.\n\nA tall, well-muscled bay Thoroughbred gelding owned by Linc Slocum. Linc rode him after the Phantom, attempting to tire the wild stallion long enough to capture him, but he only succeeded in winding Sky. Ryan rides Sky at some points as well, including his initial attempts to recapture Hotspot. Sky is a good, strong horse who runs tirelessly, but as a hotblooded breed he spooks easily. Jen was thrown from his back during the \"Superbowl of Horsemanship\" when a crazed bison burst into the horse's path on the race track.\n\nJen's palomino Quarter Horse mare, whom she nicknames \"Silly\". Jen calls her neurotic for the way she freaks out to things she knows are not dangerous. One of the Kenworthy Palominos, she has beautiful conformation and coloring, given her name for the pure white \"stockings\" on her legs. She is the horse most often ridden by Jen, for all of her trail rides with Sam, for work, etc.\n\nAnother of the Kenworthy Palominos. He is a tall, beautiful horse who Linc Slocum has chosen as his personal mount, but Linc rides very badly and often hurts Champ's mouth. Linc also insisted he was gelded.\n\nOne of the Kenworthy palominos, a stallion. Jed wants to restart their \"Fire and Ice\" breeding program with Sundance and Rose.He is well built and is very well-mannered.\n\nA lovely, rosy-gold colored Palomino mare who was part of the Kenworthy \"Fire and Ice\" breeding program. She escaped years ago and was only found after Sam and Jen ride out to a ghost town called \"Nugget\" for a history project. For a time, Ryan Slocum was hiding the mare in a makeshift stall inside the town, intending to keep her. Jen asks for Sam's help to recapture her, but it causes problems between the two girls, with Sam thinking all Jen cares about is finding the horse. After a while, Jen manages to lead Rose home to her dumbstruck parents and her actions seem to heal their relationship. Jed intends to restart his breeding program with Rose and Sundance. She is Lila's horse.\n\nAnother of the Kenworthy's Palominos, a mare.\nLilla rides Mantilla when Golden Rose goes missing.\n\nA grullo mustang gelding with chocolate coloring around his legs and head, thought to be \"cursed\" by his previous owners. Used at one time as a bucking horse and abused, all Jinx really wanted was to run. Sam worked with him long enough to enter him in a claiming race, where Sheriff Ballard won him. He now uses Jinx for search and rescue work.\n\nA bay bachelor stallion with a black mane that stands up along his neck like a Mohawk. He is usually seen running with Yellow Tail, and used to run with New Moon before he found his own mares.\n\nA chestnut bachelor stallion with a flaxen tail. He runs with Spike.\n\nA golden-chestnut filly with a white star on her chest. She is the Phantom's full sister and was actually born on the Kenworthy's ranch, but then sold to Shan Stonerow. He couldn't handle her sassy, proud attitude and called her a \"monster.\" No one knew she had gone wild until she is struck by the school bus carrying Darby Carter and Sam to Blind Faith Mustang Sanctuary for its new Dream Catcher Wild Horse camp. Darby makes an unbelievable connection with the young horse, keeping her calm while Sam and others get help for her. Hoku is taken to Mrs. Allen's place to heal, and then she is later transported to Hawaii to stay with Darby in the next series of books; \"Phantom Stallion: Wild Horse Island.\"\n\nThe Ely's big German shepherd dog. Sam hints that she weighs around 130 pounds, but she is a big softy and loves to play with Singer. The only time she is mentioned is in the last book, \"Run Away Home.\"\n\nA red roan, Quarter Horse mare. The leader of the herd at River Bend Ranch, she tends to be bossy and snappish with new horses. Sam was riding her when she was pounced on by the young orphan cougar in \"The Challenger\". A good work horse, she is sometimes ridden by Wyatt, but is most often \"seen\" in the ten acre pasture keeping the other horses in line.\nIn \"Mustang Moon\" Diablo (Hammer) tries to steal Strawberry when Sam is riding her but is saved by the phantom.\n\nGram's old American Paint Horse. She used to be Louise's, but was given to Gram after her death. She is a dark brown pinto mare with a white heart-shaped patch on her side. Gram asks Sam for permission to give her a new home in town, to be used for therapy work. Sam is reluctant and sad, but eventually allows Gram to move her there, knowing she will get the attention she deserves from the children. Sweetheart is gentle and kind, allowing anyone to do just about anything to her, and is the perfect mount for people who are not used to interacting with horses.\n\nSam's black filly, sired by the Phantom. Her dam is Dark Sunshine. She was born on a stormy night in \"Rain Dance\", and is known as the princess of River Bend Ranch, partly because of her father's status as \"King\" of horses. The little filly has warm, chocolate brown eyes and a coat as sleek and black as her father's was as a colt. As a result, Sam expects the night-black filly will slowly turn white as she ages, just like her sire. Sam gives Tempest a secret name and starts the gentling process with her using Native American techniques just like she did with the Phantom. Tempest has already proven that she has mustang blood, with a fiery attitude and plenty of energy to spare. The little filly is not fearless, but she takes interest in many things considered dangerous for her, including much larger horses. She showed a particular interest in the stunt stallion Bayfire, while he stayed for a few days on River Bend Ranch during a film shoot.\n\nA tall, strong bay stunt stallion with a white star. His owner and trainer brings him to River Bend for some TLC before trying to get the jumping shot they need for the movie. Bayfire has been acting strangely and sometimes aggressively towards her all of a sudden.\n\nJake's big black Quarter Horse mare. Witch has a bit of an attitude, thinking she is the queen of mares. According to Sam's father, \"the only safe place is on her back,\" and Sam is admittedly somewhat afraid of Witch. All forms of baby talk just tend to irritate the mare, since her owner Jake is a \"no-nonsense\" type who would never coddle his horse. The words \"fast and quick-tempered\" were once used to describe the black mare. She tends to bully other horses out of her way, but for some reason gets along with Ace just fine after their first few rides together. Witch is Chocolate Chip's sister, sharing identical conformation, if not temperaments. Despite her demeanor, Jake often doesn't halter her, knowing she'll follow him anywhere Jake would never trade Witch for another horse.\n\nQuinn's dark bay Quarter Horse gelding. He is Witch's full brother, with identical conformation, although his attitude is much better. Whereas Witch is very cranky and generally won't tolerate other horses, Chip is sweet to almost everyone.\nSam and Jake Ride Chip while they Try to catch Star shower and lasts through it all even though he was ridden day and most nights.\n\nNate's horse. It is not specified, but he is probably a gelding. Sam remembers him as a clean-limbed, brown horse with a white chin spot. He is not mentioned or described except in the last book; \"Run Away Home.\" Nate jokes with Kit, who has just returned home from rodeo, that Digger thinks he's a bronc, but is generally a good horse. Kit tells his younger brother to, \"brace [his] arms, keep [Digger's] head up and drive him forward.\"\n\nA bay Appaloosa mare with a broad swathe of white across her body and a mostly white tail. She was purchased before Ryan arrives, intended to be the beginning of Linc's latest breeding scheme. In \"Mustang Moon\" she was stolen by the blue roan hammer-headed stallion, Diablo and became pregnant to him. She ran free with the Phantom's herd after having her colt, Shy Boots, for a few books, but she was always a little spooked by the range. Ryan Slocum accepts her estrangement for a while, but soon decides he needs to get her back for Boots' well being. He recaptures Hotspot in \"Dawn Runner\".Is on the cover of \"Dawn Runner\".\n\nHotspot's foal, sired by the blue roan hammer-headed stallion, Diablo. He is bay with a white blanket and two front stockings. Timid by nature, he is nevertheless a spirited young horse and has fun when Ryan brings him to play with Tempest at River Bend. Temporarily hidden in Lost Canyon with his mother when Ryan thought Linc would have him killed, the little colt was stolen by Karl Mannix and sold illegally to a petting zoo. Sam finds and reunites him with Ryan, though his mother is running wild at the time so he is fostered by a Jenny (female donkey) from the same petting zoo, but not for long. The woman refuses to sell the Jenny to Ryan and he is left without a mother for Boots. In \"Dawn Runner,\" Boots is listless and shows no interest in food. Concerned that he needs the companionship of other horses, Dr. Scott, Sam, and Jen convince Ryan to turn the colt out with Princess Kitty. She turns out to be a gentle, caring foster mother for him and Boots thrives once again. When Ryan brings Hotspot home he is worried that the mares will fight over the colt, but once he releases the Appaloosa into the pasture everything goes just fine. The two females seem content to share mothering of Shy Boots. He is on the cover of the book \"Kidnapped Colt\".\n\nDiablo is a huge, broad-chested blue roan stallion. Sam immediately notices his massive head and \"bullish\" attitude, nicknaming him \"Hammer\". He escaped from his original owner, and appeared in Nevada. He challenged the Phantom for his mares, but was defeated. Wanting to gather a harem, he trespassed onto several ranches looking for mares. Briefly, he managed to steal Sweetheart and Apache Hotspot, from River Bend and Gold Dust Ranches respectively. Linc Slocum was convinced that the Phantom had stolen his mare, but Sam knew better. Sam hides out one night and snaps a photo of Diablo attempting to steal mares, effectively clearing the Phantom's name. Diablo is captured and reunited with his owner who is delighted to have him (the mares are also returned home), but Sam soon learns that Hotspot is in foal to the roan. Their resulting offspring is Shy Boots, the bay Appaloosa colt. Diablo is on the cover of \"Mustang Moon.\"\n\nA black and white, Tobiano pinto filly who was running free on Shoshone land. Jake catches and gentles her for a race in \"Red Feather Filly\" as a rite of passage initiated by his grandfather. She has a variegated mane and tail and dozens of white speckles on her chest. The name of the book comes from the beautiful Red-tailed Hawk feather Sam gives Jake to braid into her mane. After the race, Jake returns her to the wild.\n\nA massive black draft horse gelding. Thought to be a Clydesdale. Over 17 hands tall. He was described by Jake as being \"big enough to shade an elephant\" and \"not having a mean bone in his body.\" Smart and good-natured. He was a mustang in the far past. Rescued by Sam at an auction from being made into dog food. While being tested by Ryan Slocum he was discovered to be an experienced jumping horse. Sam sold him to Sterling Stables as Wyatt would not allow her to keep him. Is on the cover of \"Gift Horse.\"\n\nTwo chestnut pinto mares and a bay gelding, they are Trudy Allen's personal saddle horses. Old and relatively calm, they accept most new horses without any problem and greet Sam whenever she comes to visit. Sam even rode Calico into a blizzard to rescue Faith, the blind Medicine Hat filly who wandered away from Blind Faith Mustang Sanctuary.\nJudge is sent overseas to Hawaii with Hoku, the Phantom's full sister.\n\nA liver chestnut mustang gelding with a pronounced \"Roman nose,\" and one of the fourteen \"un-adoptable\" mustangs living at Mrs. Allen's sanctuary. He believes he is the boss of the captive mustang herd on Blind Faith Mustang Sanctuary's lands. Ryan gentled and rode him in the \"Superbowl of Horsemanship,\" but the gelding never lost his attitude. While the Phantom was staying on Mrs. Allen's lands, recovering from his injuries in the brush fire, Roman challenged him for leadership of the wild bands.\n\nBelle is one of the fourteen \"un-adoptable\" mustangs that Mrs. Allen saved from euthanasia at the B.L.M. corrals. She is a paint mare and the mother of Faith, the blind \"Medicine Hat\" filly who gave the sanctuary its name.\n\nThe delicate-looking, blind mustang filly who lives at Blind Faith Mustang Sanctuary. She is a palomino pinto with \"Medicine Hat\" horse markings including, but not limited to a \"hat\" of color on her head and a \"shield\" across her chest. Despite her blindness, she is extremely curious and confident, and even made friends with the Phantom while he was recovering from his fire injuries on the sanctuary lands.Is on the cover of \"Free Again\"\n\nNamed as such because she was the fourteenth horse chosen by Norman White to go home with Mrs. Allen to her newly created mustang sanctuary. Trudy told him to choose her a fourteenth horse, thinking taking thirteen with her would be unlucky. Fourteen is later referred to as a mare, in The Wildest Heart.\n\nA solid black mare and her bay colt from the \"un-adoptable\" herd at the mustang sanctuary. Licorice seemed to always be grumpy for the first few weeks she was there, but eventually softened.\n\nA big, beautiful Gypsy Vanner mare. She is a black and white pinto with a variegated mane and tail and black tufts of hair in her ears. Belonging to Nicolas, she is trained to drive, pulling his \"vardo\" cart for his trip across the western states. Along the way, Lace adopts a dun colt who tags along with her and Nicolas. Is on the cover of \"Gypsy Gold\".\n\nRachel Slocum's beautiful coffee-colored Morgan mare, whom she bought solely because the horse's coloring matched her hair. Ryan rides her on the last leg of his quest to recapture Apache Hotspot, taking Sam's advice to ride a less dominant horse than Sky Ranger. After Ryan takes off for home on Hotspot, Sam approaches Mocha and rides her back to Gold Dust Ranch. She would have ridden Ace, but he ran off without her after she made a failed attempt to slide from his back to the Phantom's. Mocha is wary of new riders, but Sterling Stables taught her exceptionally well and Sam rides her with no problems. She is trained under both English and Western saddles.\n\nThere is also another series The Phantom Stallion:Wild Horse Island\n\n"

                "T-bone steak\n\nThe T-bone and porterhouse are steaks of beef cut from the short loin (called the sirloin in Commonwealth countries). Both steaks include a \"T-shaped\" bone with meat on each side. Porterhouse steaks are cut from the rear end of the short loin and thus include more tenderloin steak, along with (on the other side of the bone) a large strip steak. T-bone steaks are cut closer to the front, and contain a smaller section of tenderloin. The smaller portion of a T-bone, when sold alone, is known as a filet mignon, especially if it's cut from the small forward end of the tenderloin.\n\nThere is little agreement among experts on how large the tenderloin must be to differentiate a T-bone steak from porterhouse. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's \"Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications\" state that the tenderloin of a porterhouse must be at least thick at its widest, while that of a T-bone must be at least . However, steaks with a large tenderloin are often called a \"T-bone\" in restaurants and steakhouses despite technically being porterhouse.\n\nOwing to their large size and the fact that they contain meat from two of the most prized cuts of beef (the short loin and the tenderloin), T-bone steaks are generally considered one of the highest quality steaks, and prices at steakhouses are accordingly high. Porterhouse steaks are even more highly valued owing to their larger tenderloin.\n\nIn the United States, the T-bone has the meat-cutting classification IMPS 1174; the porterhouse is IMPS 1173.\n\nIn British usage, followed in Commonwealth countries, \"porterhouse\" often means a UK sirloin steak (i.e. US strip steak) on the bone, i.e. without the tenderloin on the other side of T-bone. However, nowadays some British on-line butchers also offer American style porterhouse steaks.\n\nThe origin of the term \"porterhouse\" is contentious, with several cities and establishments claiming to have coined it. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the etymology from proprietor Martin Morrison serving large T-bones in his Pearl Street (Manhattan) \"Porter House\" around 1814, while noting the lack of contemporary evidence to support the tale. This origin story gained traction in the late 19th century, but others contend a Cambridge, Massachusetts hotel and restaurant proprietor named Zachariah B. Porter lent his name to the cut of beef, and others claim the steak takes its name from various 19th Century U.S. hotels or restaurants called Porter House, such as the Porter House Hotel in Flowery Branch, Georgia.\n\nTo cut a T-bone from butchered cattle, a lumbar vertebra is sawn in half through the vertebral column. The downward prong of the 'T' is a transverse process of the vertebra, and the flesh surrounding it is the spinal muscles. The small semicircle at the top of the 'T' is half of the vertebral foramen.\n\nT-bone and porterhouse steaks are suited to fast, dry heat cooking methods, such as grilling or broiling. Since they contain a small amount of collagen relative to other cuts, longer cooking times are not necessary to tenderize the meat. The bone also conducts heat within the meat so that it cooks more evenly and prevents meat drying out and shrinking during cooking. The meat near the bone will cook more slowly than the rest of the steak, and the tenderloin will tend to reach the desired temperature before the strip.\n\n\"Bistecca alla fiorentina\", or 'beefsteak Florentine style', consists of a T-bone traditionally sourced from either the Chianina or Maremmana breeds of cattle. A favorite of Tuscan cuisine, the steak is grilled over a wood or charcoal fire, seasoned with salt, sometimes with black pepper, and olive oil, applied immediately after the meat is retired from the heat. Thickly cut and very large, \"Bistecca\" are often shared between two or more persons, and traditionally served very rare, sometimes garnished with lemon wedges, if not accompanied by red wine, and accompanied by Tuscan beans as a side dish.\n\nThe same cut of meat, but from a calf, is used for \"Cotoletta alla milanese\", which consists of 1.5 cm-thick cuts which are battered in breadcrumbs and fried in clarified butter with salt.\n\n\n",
                "Strip steak\n\nThe strip steak is a cut of beef steaks from the short loin from a cow. It consists of a muscle that does little work, the longissimus, making the meat particularly tender; although not as tender as the nearby psoas major or tenderloin. Fat content of the strip is somewhere between the two cuts. Unlike the tenderloin, the longissimus is a sizable muscle, allowing it to be cut into larger portions.\n\nAccording to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the steak is marketed in the United States under various names, including Ambassador Steak, Boneless Club Steak, Hotel-Style Steak, Kansas City Steak, New York Steak, Top Loin, and Veiny Steak.\n\nIn New Zealand and Australia, it is known as Porterhouse and Sirloin (striploin steak) and can be found in the \"Handbook of Australian Meat\" under codes 2140 to 2143.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland it is called sirloin.\n\nIn Canada, most meat purveyors refer to this cut as a strip loin; in French it is known as \"contre-filet\".\n\nDelmonico's Restaurant, an operation opened in New York City in 1827, offered as one of its signature dishes a cut from the short loin called a Delmonico steak. Due to its association with the city, it is often referred to as a New York strip steak.\n\nWhen still attached to the bone, and with a piece of the tenderloin also included, the strip steak becomes a T-bone steak or a porterhouse steak, the difference being that the porterhouse has a larger portion of tenderloin included. The strip steak may be sold with or without the bone. Strip steaks may be substituted for most recipes calling for T-bone and porterhouse steaks, and sometimes for fillet and rib eye steaks.\n\nA bone-in strip steak with no tenderloin attached is sometimes referred to as a shell steak.\n\n",
                "Sirloin steak\n\nThe sirloin steak is cut from the back of the animal.\n\nIn a common U.S. butchery, the steak is cut from the rear back portion of the animal, continuing off the short loin from which T-bone, porterhouse, and club steaks are cut. The sirloin is actually divided into several types of steak. The top sirloin is the most prized of these and is specifically marked for sale under that name. The bottom sirloin, which is less tender and much larger, is typically marked for sale simply as \"sirloin steak\". The bottom sirloin in turn connects to the sirloin tip roast.\n\nIn a common British, South African, and Australian butchery, the word \"sirloin\" refers to cuts of meat from the upper middle of the animal, similar to the American short loin, while the American \"sirloin\" is called the rump. Because of this difference in terminology, in these countries, the T-bone steak is regarded as a cut of the sirloin.\n\nThe word sirloin derives from the Middle English \"surloine\", itself derived from the Old French word \"surloigne\" (variant of \"surlonge\"), that is, \"sur\" for 'above' and \"longe\" for 'loin'. In Modern French, the cut of meat is called \"aloyau\" or \"faux-filet\".\nA commonly-repeated anecdote claims that the name is derived from an occasion when King James I of England, while being entertained at Hoghton Tower during his return from Scotland in 1617, was so impressed by the quality of his steak that he knighted the loin of beef, which was referred to thereafter as \"Sir loin\". There is no reliable evidence for this explanation and scholars generally hold it to be a myth.\n\n"
