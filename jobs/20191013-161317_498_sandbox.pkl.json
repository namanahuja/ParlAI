                "William G. Bennett (gaming executive)\n\nWilliam G. Bennett (November 16, 1924-December 22, 2002) was an American gaming executive and real estate developer. Noted for pioneering Las Vegas as a destination for middle-class tourists and their families, he is best remembered for his establishment of gaming giant Circus Circus Enterprises in 1974. He served as chairman of Circus Circus between 1974 and 1994. Under his leadership Circus Circus would go on to develop numerous additional properties throughout Nevada, including the Excalibur and Luxor casinos in Las Vegas. Following his departure from Circus Circus, Bennett purchased the Sahara Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 1995 and operated it until his death in 2002.\n\nWilliam Gordon Bennett was born on November 16, 1924 in Glendale, Arizona to Allen Milton \"Jack\" Bennett, a local rancher, and Marjorie Dean Williams. Bennett's grandfather Archilbald W. Bennett came to Arizona from Kansas in 1898, settling in Peoria before moving to Glendale. Archibald constructed and operated the Glenwood Hotel in Glendale and became the town's first mayor upon incorporation in 1910. William attended Glendale High School and Phoenix College and served as a Navy dive-bomber during World War II. Following his return from the war, he established a chain of furniture stores in Phoenix. Bennett's stores were successful and he lived a lavish lifestyle with a home on Exeter Boulevard in the upscale Arcadia neighborhood of Phoenix and membership in the prestigious Phoenix Country Club. On March 15, 1962, Bennett's wife Barbara died whilst on vacation with him in Guaymas, Sonora; he sold the furniture store to focus on alternative investments and remarried to Lynn Hummel, an administrative clerk at the store, later that same year. A friend of Bennett's established a financial corporation for his investments. Mismanagement of the company caused the value of Bennett's considerable stake to plummet, bankrupting him.\n\nThrough his connections in Phoenix, Bennett had become acquainted with Del Webb Corporation president L.C. Jacobsen. Jacobsen had facilitated the construction and development-centered Del Webb Corporation's diversification into the field of gaming and hospitality. Jacobsen wanted to recruit individuals with business backgrounds into the Del Webb Corporation with the hopes that their experiences would help in the management of its hotel and casino properties. In 1965, Jacobsen hired Bennett to work at Del Webb's Sahara Tahoe property in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.\nDuring this time, his wife Lynn worked as a cashier in the Cage at the Sahara Tahoe. Bennett worked as a casino host at night and worked in a variety of the hotel's various other departments during the day, slowly learning the operations of the various different departments of the property. After six months he was named \"night general manager.\"\n\nApproximately five months after his promotion to night general manager of the Sahara Tahoe, he was transferred to Webb's Mint property in downtown Las Vegas. The property had been losing $4.5 million per year. Bennett managed to improve conditions at the property, eventually managing to turn an annual profit of over $10 million. Webb himself eventually asked Bennett to manage both the Mint and the Sahara Tahoe properties in 1967. Bennett responded by requesting a corporate plane to transport him between Reno and Las Vegas. Webb, a frugal survivor of the Great Depression, responded, \"No damned airplanes, Air West has all kinds of them.\" Bennett took the job anyway without any additional pay. \n\nDuring his time at the Webb Corporation, Bennett had noticed a high turnover rate for Webb's managers. He attributed this to the company's pay structure; Despite managing two of the firm's most profitable properties, Bennett was paid the same $150,000 salary as the company's other lesser-burdened managers. However, Bennett's performance was rewarded by Webb with stock options and upon leaving the company in 1971, Bennett realized $5 million from his sale of Del Webb stock.\n\nWhile managing the Mint, Bennett became acquainted with liquor salesman Steve Wynn, who, like Bennett, would later go on to become one of Las Vegas's most legendary casino owners. Bennett and Wynn conducted business together and often fraternized in the Mint's Zodiac Bar. Following his departure from Del Webb, Wynn offered him a high ranking position at the Golden Nugget Companies; however, Bennett declined the offer in order to pursue his dream of owning his own property. Years later, in 1983, Wynn would successfully persuade Bennett to take Circus Circus Enterprises public.\n\nFollowing his departure from the Webb Corporation, Bennett partnered with William Pennington in a corporation that leased novelty electronic gambling machines to casinos. In May 1974, he and Pennington leased the Circus Circus Hotel and Casino from owners Jay Sarno and Stanley Mallin, forming Circus Circus Enterprises. Bennett became chairman of the corporation upon its formation. The pair would eventually exercise an option to purchase the property in a complex transaction completed in 1983. Bennett and Pennington brought about sweeping changes to the property, including the construction of the casino's first 395-room tower and bringing the casino's corrupt carnival-style midway under corporate management. Unlike most properties at the time attempting to appeal to a mature, upscale clientele, Bennett and Pennington marketed the property to middle-class families.\n\nThe business plan proved extraordinarily successful and Circus Circus Enterprises opened an additional Circus Circus property in Reno in 1978, where Pennington became on-site manager while Bennett continued to focus on the Las Vegas property. In 1983, they purchased the Edgewater Hotel and Casino in Laughlin. Circus Circus Enterprises was taken public on October 25, 1983, opening at $15.00 a share and closing at $16.87. The underwriting was led by Michael Milken and the prominent investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert. Pennington retired from the corporation in 1988. Bennett opened his first new property in 1990, with the revolutionary new $300 million 4000-room Excalibur Hotel and Casino at the southwest corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue. In 1993, the company again made history with the opening of the iconic $375 million Luxor Hotel and Casino, immediately south of the Excalibur. With the opening of the property, Circus Circus Enterprises became Nevada's largest employer, with 18,000 employees. In 1991, Bennett announced he would step down as CEO of Circus Circus Enterprises. With the announcement, Bennett sold 900,000 of his Circus Circus shares for $60.25 a share, or $54.2 million. The sale was handled by Salomon Brothers.\n\nFollowing the first decline in annual income in the company's history, Bennett stepped down as chairman of Circus Circus Enterprises in 1994. The decline in earnings was attributed to the exorbitant costs associated with the construction of Luxor's signature pyramid-shaped structure and the new Grand Slam Canyon at Circus Circus. Following this, Bennett became embroiled in a controversy after personally purchasing the Hacienda Resort and Casino immediately south of the Luxor despite Circus Circus Enterprises' own interest in doing so. Following a 1995 lawsuit settlement, Bennett was forced to relinquish the Hacienda property to Circus Circus and resign his seat on the board. Bennett was able to sell his stock in Circus Circus for $230 million.\n\nIn 1995, Bennett purchased the Sahara Hotel and Casino for $193 million. The following year, Bennett suffered a heart-attack at age 71. Despite this, Bennett proceeded to extensively remodel the property, enlarging the casino and adding a variety of family friendly attractions. Many former Circus Circus employees followed Bennett to the Sahara with the promise of matched compensation and benefits. Bennett continued to actively manage the property until his death at Desert Hot Springs Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada on December 27, 2002.\n",
                "Mandalay Resort Group\n\nMandalay Resort Group (formerly Circus Circus Enterprises) was a hotel-casino operator based in Paradise, Nevada. Its major properties included Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur and Circus Circus, as well as half of the Monte Carlo. In terms of market capitalization, it was one of the largest casino operators in the world. Its stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol \"CIR\" and \"MBG\".\n\nThe Group was originally known as Circus Circus Enterprises and originated with Jay Sarno's 1968 opening of the Circus Circus as well as a Circus Circus in Reno, which opened in 1978.\n\nThe Group incorporated as Circus Circus Enterprises (CCE) in 1974 to purchase Circus Circus from Sarno at a time when the casino was experiencing financial difficulties. \n\nCircus Circus Enterprises purchased the Silver City Casino and Slots-A-Fun Casino in 1979 for $30 million, then refurbished both the interior and exterior. \n\nThe company went public in 1983 and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The original majority owners of CCE were William Pennington, a former oil lease speculator and William Bennett, a former furniture salesman and the manager of The Mint Las Vegas casino. The Group's properties found success in the 1980s offering a Las Vegas experience to families subsequently experimented upon by its competitors. Its converted Circus Circus (originally developed for the upmarket) and later Excalibur properties offered gaming opportunities for adults and separate non-gambling games and theme-park-style experiences for underage visitors under the same roof.\n\nThe Colorado Belle, described as unprofitable, was sold in 1984 to Circus Circus Enterprises for $4 million by Advanced Patent Technology and John Fulton, a Southern California restaurateur, and made plans to move it to make room for an expansion of its neighboring Edgewater Hotel & Casino.\n\nThe group subsequently developed the Excalibur in 1990, the Luxor in 1993 and the Mandalay Bay in 1999 for which the group was renamed.\n\nThe group entered into a joint venture in 1993 with Don Carano of Eldorado in Reno to develop and build Reno's largest and tallest megaresort titled Silver Legacy. The $350 million hotel opened on July 28, 1995.\nCircus Circus Enterprises then turned Mandalay Resort Group held majority stake in that Reno resort.\n\nCircus Circus Tunica opened on August 29, 1994. The casino was rebranded in 1997 as the Gold Strike Casino Resort and given a more upscale theme. The total cost for the remodel was estimated to be $125 million.\n\nOn March 20, 1995, Circus Circus Enterprises announced that it had agreed to acquire Gold Strike Resorts, a closely held budget casino owner and operator, in a deal valued at more than $600 million. At the time of the acquisition Jean, Nevada based Gold Strike Resorts owned the Gold Strike Hotel and Gambling Hall, 50% of Monte Carlo Resort and Casino, Nevada Landing Hotel and Casino, and Railroad Pass Hotel and Casino. The acquisition did not include the original Gold Strike near Boulder City, because the owners wanted to pass it on to their children.\n\nIn 1995, the Hacienda was purchased by Circus Circus Enterprises from Lowden's Archon Corporation. By this time, it was dwarfed by the many new megaresorts that were being built, in particular the Luxor which had just been recently completed. On December 10, 1996, the Hacienda was closed to the public after 40 years, and imploded later that month. This implosion was broadcast on the Fox Network as a part of their New Year's Eve 1996 telecast. Despite the implosion, parts of the old resort still stood, due to the building not falling into its footprint, but toppling into its parking lot. The next day a wrecking crew was brought in to bring down the remaining parts. In March 1999, it was replaced by the Mandalay Bay.\n\nThe group was also a partner with Mirage Resorts on the 1996 opening of the nearby Monte Carlo Resort and Casino.\n\nCircus Circus Enterprises closed the Silver City Casino on October 31, 1999.\n\nFollowing the completion of Mandalay Bay in 1999 the name of the company was changed to Mandalay Resorts Group.\n\nOn December 14, 1999, MotorCity Casino Hotel opened.\n\nOn May 23, 2002, the Mandalay Resort Group announced a second 1,122-room hotel tower, with a cost of at least $200 million. Construction began on the tower in September 2002. The name of the tower, THEhotel at Mandalay Bay, was chosen in September 2003. The tower opened on December 17, 2003.\n\nOn June 4, 2004, one of Mandalay Resort Group's largest competitors, MGM Mirage, announced a bid to acquire it for $68 per share plus assumption of debt. The stock closed at $60.27 per share on June 4. Although the proposal was announced after the close of trading on June 4, the volume of trading in Mandalay Resort Group stock on that day was quadruple the normal, with the stock closing at $60.27 per share. The ensuing negotiations between the two companies included at one point an announcement that the Mandalay board was rejecting the offer because of antitrust concerns. On June 15, 2004, however, both companies' boards approved a revised offer of $71 per share. The agreement called for MGM Mirage to pay $4.8 billion and to assume $2.5 billion in debt. The transaction was completed on April 26, 2005 for $7.9 billion.\n\nMGM executives were confident that antitrust regulators would not require the sale of any of the two companies' properties. Michigan law, however, forbade one company from owning multiple casinos, requiring the sale of either the MGM Grand Detroit or Mandalay's 54% stake in the MotorCity Casino. After some vacillation about which property to sell, Mandalay accepted a $525-million offer for its interest in MotorCity from Marian Ilitch, the casino's second largest shareholder.\n\n\n\n",

Architects Rissman and Rissman Associates designed a giant circus tent shaped main structure, which was built by R.C. Johnson Construction of Las Vegas.\n\nAt its opening, the $15 million facility only included a casino. The lack of a hotel resulted in financial problems, as the casino was not able to attract high rollers. Sarno obtained a $23 million loan from the Teamsters Pension Fund to construct a hotel. As part of the arrangement, the Chicago Outfit's enforcer, Anthony Spilotro (under the name of Tony Stuart) was granted a gift shop concession in the hotel. In addition to a government investigation into the organized-crime connections, Sarno and Mallin were\nalso being investigated for tax code violations. The casino's financial problems also continued and Sarno, along with his partner Stanley Mallin, decided to sell out.\n\nIn 1974, ownership changed with the sale of the casino to William Bennett and William Pennington for $25 million. The facility was expanded with hotel tower additions in 1972, 1980, 1985, 1986 and 1996.\n\nA blog reported that on July 1, 2009, Slots-A-Fun would begin the re-branding process in order to be incorporated into Circus Circus.\n\nThe hotel rooms are located in several buildings including:\n\nCircus Circus offers:\n\nThe hotel's famous midway was featured in the 1971 James Bond film \"Diamonds Are Forever\".\n\nIn his journalistic novel of the early 1970s, \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\", Hunter S. Thompson wrote, \"The Circus-Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday night if the Nazis had won the war. This is the sixth Reich. The ground floor is full of gambling tables, like all the other casinos . . . but the place is about four stories high, in the style of a circus tent, and all manner of strange County-Fair/Polish Carnival madness is going on up in this space.\" When the Thompson work was adapted to film in 1998, the fictional \"Bazooko Circus\" was a thinly veiled stand-in for the world-famed resort, which had refused permission for the filmmakers to shoot on their property.\n\nThe Adventuredome Theme Park and the Canyon Blaster roller coaster were featured in the 1999 movie \"Baby Geniuses\". The theme park was known as Joyworld in the movie.\n\nCharacters in 1977's post-apocalyptic \"Damnation Alley\" seek out at the abandoned Circus Circus to play.\n\nIn \"\", Austin and Vanessa sneak into the Circus Circus.\n\nIn the 1992 movie \"Honey, I Blew Up the Kid\", the oversized child Adam is shown laughing and smiling at the Lucky the Clown pylon.\n\nThe Midway was featured in the 1978 film \"Corvette Summer\", when Mark Hamill was being lured into a scam by a \"salesman\".\n\nIn the game \"\", Circus Circus is featured as The Clown's Pocket.\n\nA recreation of the hotel called \"Ringmaster\" can be found in the 2014 racing video game \"The Crew\", near the northern end of the strip.\n\nIn the TV series \"Vega$\", private detective Dan Tanna (Robert Urich) lived in a converted warehouse next to Circus Circus, and was often shown driving past the resort in his classic Ford Thunderbird.\n\n",
                "Circus Circus Reno\n\nCircus Circus Reno is a hotel and casino located in Downtown Reno, Nevada. It anchors a network of connected hotel-casinos in the downtown Reno core that includes Silver Legacy Reno and Eldorado Reno and are owned and operated by Eldorado Resorts. It includes a 1,572 room hotel and a casino which features free circus acts on a regular basis throughout the day over the midway which also offers 33 carnival games.\n\nIt is the second-largest hotel in downtown Reno (and third-largest in the Reno area overall) by number of rooms.\n\nPrevious owners of Circus Circus Reno were Mandalay Resort Group, formerly known as Circus Circus Enterprises (1978–2005) and MGM Resorts International, formerly known as MGM Mirage (2005–2015).\n\nThe main structure was originally built as a Gray, Reid & Wright department store which, at the time, was the only department store in the state of Nevada. Originally opened on November 7, 1957, the structure replaced a prior store location which was destroyed by a gas explosion on February 5, 1957, and is now the site of the Palladio condominiums. The new store contained of retail space and of storage space in a basement and 2 retail floors accessible by escalators, and had 45 departments including an electronics shop selling televisions and radios, a bookstore, record store, and wine shop, as well as a restaurant, beauty salon, and cobbler.\n\n1977 brought about plans to enlarge the store, adding 2 additional floors, 102 hotel rooms, and a casino. The casino would have been known as Camp 14, and would have had a logging theme. The south portion of the first floor would have remained under the name Grey Reid's, but would sell only woman's clothing, and would contain an expanded beauty salon. The plan never materialized, and Grey Reid's moved to a new location in the Old Town Mall (now known as the Reno Town Mall) in July of that year. Instead, the owners were approached by Circus Circus Enterprises, the operating company of Circus Circus Las Vegas. After about a year of renovations, the casino opened on July 1, 1978, about a decade after its Las Vegas counterpart, and on the same day as the opening of the Sahara Reno and the expanded Money Tree Casino. Circus Circus Reno was inspired by the gaming boom spurred by the new MGM Grand Reno, casino companies wanted to gain some of that momentum. The Reno Circus opened with a small hotel and very similar attractions to its Las Vegas counterpart.\n\nIt has three hotel towers: The North Tower, the Casino Tower and the Sky Tower. The North Tower, with 625 rooms, was opened in 1981 and has a height of 225 ft (68 m) and 22 floors. The Sky Tower, with 905 rooms, was opened in 1985 and has a height of 278 ft (84 m) and 27 floors. In 1995, extensive renovations were completed, including the remodel of the mezzanine level where the restaurants are located, the midway, and a sky bridge connecting to the Silver Legacy.\n\nIn 2008, It had planned on adding an indoor swimming pool. Until the opening of the Silver Legacy in 1995, guests at Circus Circus did not have access to swimming facilities. According to a rendering on the Circus Circus website, the pool would have been under a glass canopy, placed atop the sky bridge tram station. As of July 2010, construction has yet to begin, and all references to the project on the resort's website have been removed.\n\nThe Topsy The Clown sign was designed by Gordon Tietjen and manufactured by Young Electric Sign Company.\n\nOn July 7, 2015, MGM Resorts International agreed to sell its properties in Reno (Circus Circus Reno and a 50% stake in the Silver Legacy) to Eldorado Resorts for $72.5 million. The sale was approved and completed in November later that year.\n\nOn September 5, 2016, Eldorado Resorts permanently closed the Courtyard Buffet (formerly Big Top Buffet). It was replaced with a contemporary fast casual food court which is similar to Station Casinos and other places. The Courtyard Buffet name was used from 1999 to 2016.\n\n"

                "William G. Bennett (gaming executive)\n\nWilliam G. Bennett (November 16, 1924-December 22, 2002) was an American gaming executive and real estate developer. Noted for pioneering Las Vegas as a destination for middle-class tourists and their families, he is best remembered for his establishment of gaming giant Circus Circus Enterprises in 1974. He served as chairman of Circus Circus between 1974 and 1994. Under his leadership Circus Circus would go on to develop numerous additional properties throughout Nevada, including the Excalibur and Luxor casinos in Las Vegas. Following his departure from Circus Circus, Bennett purchased the Sahara Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 1995 and operated it until his death in 2002.\n\nWilliam Gordon Bennett was born on November 16, 1924 in Glendale, Arizona to Allen Milton \"Jack\" Bennett, a local rancher, and Marjorie Dean Williams. Bennett's grandfather Archilbald W. Bennett came to Arizona from Kansas in 1898, settling in Peoria before moving to Glendale. Archibald constructed and operated the Glenwood Hotel in Glendale and became the town's first mayor upon incorporation in 1910. William attended Glendale High School and Phoenix College and served as a Navy dive-bomber during World War II. Following his return from the war, he established a chain of furniture stores in Phoenix. Bennett's stores were successful and he lived a lavish lifestyle with a home on Exeter Boulevard in the upscale Arcadia neighborhood of Phoenix and membership in the prestigious Phoenix Country Club. On March 15, 1962, Bennett's wife Barbara died whilst on vacation with him in Guaymas, Sonora; he sold the furniture store to focus on alternative investments and remarried to Lynn Hummel, an administrative clerk at the store, later that same year. A friend of Bennett's established a financial corporation for his investments. Mismanagement of the company caused the value of Bennett's considerable stake to plummet, bankrupting him.\n\nThrough his connections in Phoenix, Bennett had become acquainted with Del Webb Corporation president L.C. Jacobsen. Jacobsen had facilitated the construction and development-centered Del Webb Corporation's diversification into the field of gaming and hospitality. Jacobsen wanted to recruit individuals with business backgrounds into the Del Webb Corporation with the hopes that their experiences would help in the management of its hotel and casino properties. In 1965, Jacobsen hired Bennett to work at Del Webb's Sahara Tahoe property in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.\nDuring this time, his wife Lynn worked as a cashier in the Cage at the Sahara Tahoe. Bennett worked as a casino host at night and worked in a variety of the hotel's various other departments during the day, slowly learning the operations of the various different departments of the property. After six months he was named \"night general manager.\"\n\nApproximately five months after his promotion to night general manager of the Sahara Tahoe, he was transferred to Webb's Mint property in downtown Las Vegas. The property had been losing $4.5 million per year. Bennett managed to improve conditions at the property, eventually managing to turn an annual profit of over $10 million. Webb himself eventually asked Bennett to manage both the Mint and the Sahara Tahoe properties in 1967. Bennett responded by requesting a corporate plane to transport him between Reno and Las Vegas. Webb, a frugal survivor of the Great Depression, responded, \"No damned airplanes, Air West has all kinds of them.\" Bennett took the job anyway without any additional pay. \n\nDuring his time at the Webb Corporation, Bennett had noticed a high turnover rate for Webb's managers. He attributed this to the company's pay structure; Despite managing two of the firm's most profitable properties, Bennett was paid the same $150,000 salary as the company's other lesser-burdened managers. However, Bennett's performance was rewarded by Webb with stock options and upon leaving the company in 1971, Bennett realized $5 million from his sale of Del Webb stock.\n\nWhile managing the Mint, Bennett became acquainted with liquor salesman Steve Wynn, who, like Bennett, would later go on to become one of Las Vegas's most legendary casino owners. Bennett and Wynn conducted business together and often fraternized in the Mint's Zodiac Bar. Following his departure from Del Webb, Wynn offered him a high ranking position at the Golden Nugget Companies; however, Bennett declined the offer in order to pursue his dream of owning his own property. Years later, in 1983, Wynn would successfully persuade Bennett to take Circus Circus Enterprises public.\n\nFollowing his departure from the Webb Corporation, Bennett partnered with William Pennington in a corporation that leased novelty electronic gambling machines to casinos. In May 1974, he and Pennington leased the Circus Circus Hotel and Casino from owners Jay Sarno and Stanley Mallin, forming Circus Circus Enterprises. Bennett became chairman of the corporation upon its formation. The pair would eventually exercise an option to purchase the property in a complex transaction completed in 1983. Bennett and Pennington brought about sweeping changes to the property, including the construction of the casino's first 395-room tower and bringing the casino's corrupt carnival-style midway under corporate management. Unlike most properties at the time attempting to appeal to a mature, upscale clientele, Bennett and Pennington marketed the property to middle-class families.\n\nThe business plan proved extraordinarily successful and Circus Circus Enterprises opened an additional Circus Circus property in Reno in 1978, where Pennington became on-site manager while Bennett continued to focus on the Las Vegas property. In 1983, they purchased the Edgewater Hotel and Casino in Laughlin. Circus Circus Enterprises was taken public on October 25, 1983, opening at $15.00 a share and closing at $16.87. The underwriting was led by Michael Milken and the prominent investment bank Drexel Burnham Lambert. Pennington retired from the corporation in 1988. Bennett opened his first new property in 1990, with the revolutionary new $300 million 4000-room Excalibur Hotel and Casino at the southwest corner of Las Vegas Boulevard and Tropicana Avenue. In 1993, the company again made history with the opening of the iconic $375 million Luxor Hotel and Casino, immediately south of the Excalibur. With the opening of the property, Circus Circus Enterprises became Nevada's largest employer, with 18,000 employees. In 1991, Bennett announced he would step down as CEO of Circus Circus Enterprises. With the announcement, Bennett sold 900,000 of his Circus Circus shares for $60.25 a share, or $54.2 million. The sale was handled by Salomon Brothers.\n\nFollowing the first decline in annual income in the company's history, Bennett stepped down as chairman of Circus Circus Enterprises in 1994. The decline in earnings was attributed to the exorbitant costs associated with the construction of Luxor's signature pyramid-shaped structure and the new Grand Slam Canyon at Circus Circus. Following this, Bennett became embroiled in a controversy after personally purchasing the Hacienda Resort and Casino immediately south of the Luxor despite Circus Circus Enterprises' own interest in doing so. Following a 1995 lawsuit settlement, Bennett was forced to relinquish the Hacienda property to Circus Circus and resign his seat on the board. Bennett was able to sell his stock in Circus Circus for $230 million.\n\nIn 1995, Bennett purchased the Sahara Hotel and Casino for $193 million. The following year, Bennett suffered a heart-attack at age 71. Despite this, Bennett proceeded to extensively remodel the property, enlarging the casino and adding a variety of family friendly attractions. Many former Circus Circus employees followed Bennett to the Sahara with the promise of matched compensation and benefits. Bennett continued to actively manage the property until his death at Desert Hot Springs Hospital in Las Vegas, Nevada on December 27, 2002.\n",
                "Mandalay Resort Group\n\nMandalay Resort Group (formerly Circus Circus Enterprises) was a hotel-casino operator based in Paradise, Nevada. Its major properties included Mandalay Bay, Luxor, Excalibur and Circus Circus, as well as half of the Monte Carlo. In terms of market capitalization, it was one of the largest casino operators in the world. Its stock traded on the New York Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol \"CIR\" and \"MBG\".\n\nThe Group was originally known as Circus Circus Enterprises and originated with Jay Sarno's 1968 opening of the Circus Circus as well as a Circus Circus in Reno, which opened in 1978.\n\nThe Group incorporated as Circus Circus Enterprises (CCE) in 1974 to purchase Circus Circus from Sarno at a time when the casino was experiencing financial difficulties. \n\nCircus Circus Enterprises purchased the Silver City Casino and Slots-A-Fun Casino in 1979 for $30 million, then refurbished both the interior and exterior. \n\nThe company went public in 1983 and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The original majority owners of CCE were William Pennington, a former oil lease speculator and William Bennett, a former furniture salesman and the manager of The Mint Las Vegas casino. The Group's properties found success in the 1980s offering a Las Vegas experience to families subsequently experimented upon by its competitors. Its converted Circus Circus (originally developed for the upmarket) and later Excalibur properties offered gaming opportunities for adults and separate non-gambling games and theme-park-style experiences for underage visitors under the same roof.\n\nThe Colorado Belle, described as unprofitable, was sold in 1984 to Circus Circus Enterprises for $4 million by Advanced Patent Technology and John Fulton, a Southern California restaurateur, and made plans to move it to make room for an expansion of its neighboring Edgewater Hotel & Casino.\n\nThe group subsequently developed the Excalibur in 1990, the Luxor in 1993 and the Mandalay Bay in 1999 for which the group was renamed.\n\nThe group entered into a joint venture in 1993 with Don Carano of Eldorado in Reno to develop and build Reno's largest and tallest megaresort titled Silver Legacy. The $350 million hotel opened on July 28, 1995.\nCircus Circus Enterprises then turned Mandalay Resort Group held majority stake in that Reno resort.\n\nCircus Circus Tunica opened on August 29, 1994. The casino was rebranded in 1997 as the Gold Strike Casino Resort and given a more upscale theme. The total cost for the remodel was estimated to be $125 million.\n\nOn March 20, 1995, Circus Circus Enterprises announced that it had agreed to acquire Gold Strike Resorts, a closely held budget casino owner and operator, in a deal valued at more than $600 million. At the time of the acquisition Jean, Nevada based Gold Strike Resorts owned the Gold Strike Hotel and Gambling Hall, 50% of Monte Carlo Resort and Casino, Nevada Landing Hotel and Casino, and Railroad Pass Hotel and Casino. The acquisition did not include the original Gold Strike near Boulder City, because the owners wanted to pass it on to their children.\n\nIn 1995, the Hacienda was purchased by Circus Circus Enterprises from Lowden's Archon Corporation. By this time, it was dwarfed by the many new megaresorts that were being built, in particular the Luxor which had just been recently completed. On December 10, 1996, the Hacienda was closed to the public after 40 years, and imploded later that month. This implosion was broadcast on the Fox Network as a part of their New Year's Eve 1996 telecast. Despite the implosion, parts of the old resort still stood, due to the building not falling into its footprint, but toppling into its parking lot. The next day a wrecking crew was brought in to bring down the remaining parts. In March 1999, it was replaced by the Mandalay Bay.\n\nThe group was also a partner with Mirage Resorts on the 1996 opening of the nearby Monte Carlo Resort and Casino.\n\nCircus Circus Enterprises closed the Silver City Casino on October 31, 1999.\n\nFollowing the completion of Mandalay Bay in 1999 the name of the company was changed to Mandalay Resorts Group.\n\nOn December 14, 1999, MotorCity Casino Hotel opened.\n\nOn May 23, 2002, the Mandalay Resort Group announced a second 1,122-room hotel tower, with a cost of at least $200 million. Construction began on the tower in September 2002. The name of the tower, THEhotel at Mandalay Bay, was chosen in September 2003. The tower opened on December 17, 2003.\n\nOn June 4, 2004, one of Mandalay Resort Group's largest competitors, MGM Mirage, announced a bid to acquire it for $68 per share plus assumption of debt. The stock closed at $60.27 per share on June 4. Although the proposal was announced after the close of trading on June 4, the volume of trading in Mandalay Resort Group stock on that day was quadruple the normal, with the stock closing at $60.27 per share. The ensuing negotiations between the two companies included at one point an announcement that the Mandalay board was rejecting the offer because of antitrust concerns. On June 15, 2004, however, both companies' boards approved a revised offer of $71 per share. The agreement called for MGM Mirage to pay $4.8 billion and to assume $2.5 billion in debt. The transaction was completed on April 26, 2005 for $7.9 billion.\n\nMGM executives were confident that antitrust regulators would not require the sale of any of the two companies' properties. Michigan law, however, forbade one company from owning multiple casinos, requiring the sale of either the MGM Grand Detroit or Mandalay's 54% stake in the MotorCity Casino. After some vacillation about which property to sell, Mandalay accepted a $525-million offer for its interest in MotorCity from Marian Ilitch, the casino's second largest shareholder.\n\n\n\n",

It is owned and operated by MGM Resorts International. Circus Circus features circus acts and carnival type games daily on the Midway.\n\nCircus Circus is the largest permanent big top in the world. The Lucky The Clown marquee at the entrance was provided by Young Electric Sign Company and was constructed in 1976.\n\nPrevious owners of Circus Circus Las Vegas were Jay Sarno and Stanley Mallin (1968–1974) and Mandalay Resort Group, formerly known as Circus Circus Enterprises (1974–2005)\n\nCircus Circus was opened on October 18, 1968 by Jay Sarno and Stanley Mallin, becoming the flagship casino for Circus Circus Enterprises. Architects Rissman and Rissman Associates designed a giant circus tent shaped main structure, which was built by R.C. Johnson Construction of Las Vegas.\n\nAt its opening, the $15 million facility only included a casino. The lack of a hotel resulted in financial problems, as the casino was not able to attract high rollers. Sarno obtained a $23 million loan from the Teamsters Pension Fund to construct a hotel. As part of the arrangement, the Chicago Outfit's enforcer, Anthony Spilotro (under the name of Tony Stuart) was granted a gift shop concession in the hotel. In addition to a government investigation into the organized-crime connections, Sarno and Mallin were\nalso being investigated for tax code violations. The casino's financial problems also continued and Sarno, along with his partner Stanley Mallin, decided to sell out.\n\nIn 1974, ownership changed with the sale of the casino to William Bennett and William Pennington for $25 million. The facility was expanded with hotel tower additions in 1972, 1980, 1985, 1986 and 1996.\n\nA blog reported that on July 1, 2009, Slots-A-Fun would begin the re-branding process in order to be incorporated into Circus Circus.\n\nThe hotel rooms are located in several buildings including:\n\nCircus Circus offers:\n\nThe hotel's famous midway was featured in the 1971 James Bond film \"Diamonds Are Forever\".\n\nIn his journalistic novel of the early 1970s, \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\", Hunter S. Thompson wrote, \"The Circus-Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday night if the Nazis had won the war. This is the sixth Reich. The ground floor is full of gambling tables, like all the other casinos . . . but the place is about four stories high, in the style of a circus tent, and all manner of strange County-Fair/Polish Carnival madness is going on up in this space.\" When the Thompson work was adapted to film in 1998, the fictional \"Bazooko Circus\" was a thinly veiled stand-in for the world-famed resort, which had refused permission for the filmmakers to shoot on their property.\n\nThe Adventuredome Theme Park and the Canyon Blaster roller coaster were featured in the 1999 movie \"Baby Geniuses\".

                "Circus Circus Reno\n\nCircus Circus Reno is a hotel and casino located in Downtown Reno, Nevada. It anchors a network of connected hotel-casinos in the downtown Reno core that includes Silver Legacy Reno and Eldorado Reno and are owned and operated by Eldorado Resorts. It includes a 1,572 room hotel and a casino which features free circus acts on a regular basis throughout the day over the midway which also offers 33 carnival games.\n\nIt is the second-largest hotel in downtown Reno (and third-largest in the Reno area overall) by number of rooms.\n\nPrevious owners of Circus Circus Reno were Mandalay Resort Group, formerly known as Circus Circus Enterprises (1978–2005) and MGM Resorts International, formerly known as MGM Mirage (2005–2015).\n\nThe main structure was originally built as a Gray, Reid & Wright department store which, at the time, was the only department store in the state of Nevada. Originally opened on November 7, 1957, the structure replaced a prior store location which was destroyed by a gas explosion on February 5, 1957, and is now the site of the Palladio condominiums. The new store contained of retail space and of storage space in a basement and 2 retail floors accessible by escalators, and had 45 departments including an electronics shop selling televisions and radios, a bookstore, record store, and wine shop, as well as a restaurant, beauty salon, and cobbler.\n\n1977 brought about plans to enlarge the store, adding 2 additional floors, 102 hotel rooms, and a casino. The casino would have been known as Camp 14, and would have had a logging theme. The south portion of the first floor would have remained under the name Grey Reid's, but would sell only woman's clothing, and would contain an expanded beauty salon. The plan never materialized, and Grey Reid's moved to a new location in the Old Town Mall (now known as the Reno Town Mall) in July of that year. Instead, the owners were approached by Circus Circus Enterprises, the operating company of Circus Circus Las Vegas. After about a year of renovations, the casino opened on July 1, 1978, about a decade after its Las Vegas counterpart, and on the same day as the opening of the Sahara Reno and the expanded Money Tree Casino. Circus Circus Reno was inspired by the gaming boom spurred by the new MGM Grand Reno, casino companies wanted to gain some of that momentum. The Reno Circus opened with a small hotel and very similar attractions to its Las Vegas counterpart.\n\nIt has three hotel towers: The North Tower, the Casino Tower and the Sky Tower. The North Tower, with 625 rooms, was opened in 1981 and has a height of 225 ft (68 m) and 22 floors. The Sky Tower, with 905 rooms, was opened in 1985 and has a height of 278 ft (84 m) and 27 floors. In 1995, extensive renovations were completed, including the remodel of the mezzanine level where the restaurants are located, the midway, and a sky bridge connecting to the Silver Legacy.\n\nIn 2008, It had planned on adding an indoor swimming pool. Until the opening of the Silver Legacy in 1995, guests at Circus Circus did not have access to swimming facilities. According to a rendering on the Circus Circus website, the pool would have been under a glass canopy, placed atop the sky bridge tram station. As of July 2010, construction has yet to begin, and all references to the project on the resort's website have been removed.\n\nThe Topsy The Clown sign was designed by Gordon Tietjen and manufactured by Young Electric Sign Company.\n\nOn July 7, 2015, MGM Resorts International agreed to sell its properties in Reno (Circus Circus Reno and a 50% stake in the Silver Legacy) to Eldorado Resorts for $72.5 million. The sale was approved and completed in November later that year.\n\nOn September 5, 2016, Eldorado Resorts permanently closed the Courtyard Buffet (formerly Big Top Buffet). It was replaced with a contemporary fast casual food court which is similar to Station Casinos and other places. The Courtyard Buffet name was used from 1999 to 2016.\n\n"

                "PlayStation (console)\n\nThe PlayStation (officially abbreviated to PS, and commonly known as the PS1 or PSX) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. The console was released on 3 December in Japan, 9 September 1995 in North America, 29 September 1995 in Europe, and for 15 November 1995 in Australia. The console was the first of the PlayStation lineup of home video game consoles. It primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn as part of the fifth generation of video game consoles.\n\nThe PlayStation is the first \"computer entertainment platform\" to ship 100 million units, which it had reached 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. In 2000, a redesigned, \"slim\" version called the PS one was released, replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor, the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with the PlayStation's DualShock controller and games, was announced in 1999 and launched in 2000. The last PS one units were sold in winter 2004 before it was officially discontinued in 2006, for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch 11 years earlier. Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of both the PlayStation and PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 – over 11 years after it had been released, and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe inception of what would become the released PlayStation dates back to 1986 with a joint venture between Nintendo and Sony. Nintendo had already produced floppy disk technology to complement cartridges, in the form of the Family Computer Disk System, and wanted to continue this complementary storage strategy for the Super Famicom. Nintendo approached Sony to develop a CD-ROM add-on, tentatively titled the \"Play Station\" or \"SNES-CD\". A contract was signed, and work began. Nintendo's choice of Sony was due to a prior dealing: Ken Kutaragi, the person who would later be dubbed \"The Father of the PlayStation\", was the individual who had sold Nintendo on using the Sony SPC-700 processor for use as the eight-channel ADPCM sound set in the Super Famicom/SNES console through an impressive demonstration of the processor's capabilities.\n\nKutaragi was nearly fired by Sony because he was originally working with Nintendo on the side without Sony's knowledge (while still employed by Sony). It was then-CEO, Norio Ohga, who recognised the potential in Kutaragi's chip, and in working with Nintendo on the project. Ohga kept Kutaragi on at Sony, and it was not until Nintendo cancelled the project that Sony decided to develop its own console.\n\nSony also planned to develop a Super NES-compatible, Sony-branded console, but one which would be more of a home entertainment system playing both Super NES cartridges and a new CD format which Sony would design. This was also to be the format used in SNES-CDs, giving a large degree of control to Sony despite Nintendo's leading position in the video gaming market.\n\nThe product, dubbed the \"Play Station\" was to be announced at the May 1991 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). However, when Nintendo's Hiroshi Yamauchi read the original 1988 contract between Sony and Nintendo, he realised that the earlier agreement essentially handed Sony complete control over any and all titles written on the SNES CD-ROM format. Yamauchi decided that the contract was totally unacceptable and he secretly cancelled all plans for the joint Nintendo-Sony SNES CD attachment. Instead of announcing a partnership between Sony and Nintendo, at 9 am the day of the CES, Nintendo chairman Howard Lincoln stepped onto the stage and revealed that Nintendo was now allied with Philips, and Nintendo was planning on abandoning all the previous work Nintendo and Sony had accomplished. Lincoln and Minoru Arakawa had, unbeknownst to Sony, flown to Philips' global headquarters in the Netherlands and formed an alliance of a decidedly different nature—one that would give Nintendo total control over its licenses on Philips machines.\n\nAfter the collapse of the joint-Nintendo project, Sony briefly considered allying itself with Sega to produce a stand-alone console. The Sega CEO at the time, Tom Kalinske, took the proposal to Sega's Board of Directors in Tokyo, who promptly vetoed the idea. Kalinske, in a 2013 interview recalled them saying \"that’s a stupid idea, Sony doesn't know how to make hardware. They don’t know how to make software either. Why would we want to do this?\". This prompted Sony into halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what it had developed so far with both Nintendo and Sega to make it into a complete console based upon the Super Famicom. As a result, Nintendo filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in US federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of what was originally christened the \"Play Station\", on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction and, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the aforementioned brand new game system was revealed. However, it is theorised that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.\n\nBy the end of 1992, Sony and Nintendo reached a deal whereby the \"Play Station\" would still have a port for SNES games, but Nintendo would own the rights and receive the bulk of the profits from the games, and the SNES would continue to use the Sony-designed audio chip. However, Sony decided in early 1993 to begin reworking the \"Play Station\" concept to target a new generation of hardware and software. As part of this process the SNES cartridge port was dropped and the space between the names \"Play Station\" was removed becoming \"PlayStation\", thereby ending Nintendo's involvement with the project. According to a Sony engineer, all work on the console from the time of the partnership with Nintendo was eventually scrapped, and the PlayStation design was restarted from scratch. Sony's North American division, known as Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), originally planned to market the new console under the alternative branding \"PSX\" following the negative feedback regarding \"PlayStation\" in focus group studies. Early advertising prior to the console's launch in North America referenced PSX, but the term was scrapped before launch.\n\nAccording to SCE's producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, there was uncertainty over whether the console should primarily focus on 2D sprite graphics or 3D polygon graphics. It was only after witnessing the success of Sega's \"Virtua Fighter\" in Japanese arcades that \"the direction of the PlayStation became instantly clear\" and 3D polygon graphics became the console's primary focus.\n\nUnlike Sega, Sony had no arcade division from which to draw console-selling ports, or any in-house development to speak of. To solve this problem, Sony acquired studios such as Psygnosis and signed exclusivity deals with hot arcade publishers Namco and Williams Entertainment.\n\nIndustry hype for the console spread quickly, and in early 1994 \"GamePro\" reported that \"many video game companies [feel] that in the near future, the video game platforms to contend with will be from Nintendo, Sega... and \"Sony\".\" [emphasis in original]\n\nThe PlayStation was released in Japan on 3 December 1994, North America on 9 September 1995, Europe on 29 September 1995, and Oceania on 15 November 1995. The console was an immediate success in Japan, selling over 2 million units within its first six months on the market. In the US, 800,000 were sold in 1995 (i.e. four months on the market), giving the PlayStation a commanding lead over the other consoles of its generation, though it was still being outsold by the older Super NES and Sega Genesis. The launch price in the US market was US$299 and Sony enjoyed a very successful launch with titles of almost every genre, including \"Battle Arena Toshinden\", \"Warhawk\", \"Air Combat\", \"Philosoma\", \"Ridge Racer\" and \"Rayman\". Unlike the vast majority of gaming consoles of the time, the PlayStation did not include a pack-in game at launch. Sony reported strong software sales in the months following launch, with an attach rate of 4:1.\n\nThen Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, preferred Sony's console to the competition from Sega, saying \"Our game designer likes the Sony machine.\" Microsoft would later compete with Sony with its Xbox console. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" would score the PlayStation console a 19 out of 40. The staff of \"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation a few weeks after its North American launch. They commented that while the CPU is \"fairly average\", the supplementary custom hardware such as the GPU and sound processor is stunningly powerful. They particularly praised its focus on 3D, and also remarked positively on the comfort of the controller and the convenience of the memory cards. Giving the system 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, they concluded, \"To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war.\" An advertisement slogan used in marketing the console was, \"\"Live in your world. Play in ours.\"\" It is stylised as, \"LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS.\" Another briefly used advertising campaign was titled \"You Are Not Ready\" or \"U R NOT .\" Sony's CCO Lee Clow explained that \"it's the ultimate challenge. Gamers love to respond to that tag line and say 'Bullshit. Let me show you how ready I am.'\"\n\nOne of the key factors in the PlayStation's success was Sony's approach to third party developers. Whereas Sega and Nintendo took an isolationist approach, focusing on first party development while generally leaving third party developers to their own devices, Sony took efforts to streamline game production by providing a range of programming libraries which were constantly updated online, organising third party technical support teams, and in some cases giving direct development support to third party companies.\n\nWhile the Sega Saturn was marketed towards 18 to 34 year-olds, the PlayStation was marketed roughly, but not exclusively, towards 12 to 24 year-olds. Both Sega and Sony reasoned that because younger players typically look up to older, more experienced players, they would be drawn in by advertising targeted at teens and adults. Additionally, Sony found that adults are best targeted by advertising geared towards teenagers; according to Lee Clow, \"One of the first things we resolved early on was that everyone is 17 when they play videogames. The young people look up to the best gamer who is usually a little older and more practiced and talented. Then there are people who start working and grow up, but when they go into their room and sit down with their videogames, they're regressing and becoming 17 again.\" Initially PlayStation demographics were skewed towards adults, but after the first price drop the audience began broadening.\n\nIn 1996, the high demand for PlayStation games contributed to Sony's decision to expand their CD production facilities in Springfield, Oregon, increasing their monthly output from 4 million discs to 6.5 million discs. PlayStation sales were running at twice the rate of Saturn sales, and dramatically increased their lead when both the PlayStation and Saturn dropped in price to $199 in May, in large part because some retailers (such as KB Toys) did not stock the Saturn. The PlayStation was outselling the Saturn at a similar ratio in Europe as well during 1996.\n\nThe PlayStation took more time to achieve dominance in Japan. After the PlayStation and Saturn had been on the market for nearly two years, Sony Computer Entertainment president Teruhisa Tokunaka said the competition between them was still \"very close\", and that neither console had yet held the lead in sales for any meaningful length of time.\n\nIn addition to playing games, select PlayStation models have the ability to play audio CDs; further, Asian model SCPH-5903 can also play Video CDs. Like most domestic CD players, the PlayStation has the ability to shuffle the playback order, play the songs in a programmed order, and repeat one song or the entire disc. Later PlayStation models can utilise a music visualisation function called SoundScope. This function, as well as a memory card manager, can be accessed by starting the console either without inserting a game or keeping the CD tray open, thereby accessing a GUI for the PlayStation BIOS.\n\nThe actual GUI for both PS one and PlayStation differ graphically depending on firmware versions: the original PlayStation GUI had a dark blue background with rainbow graffiti used as buttons; the early PAL PlayStation and PS one GUI had a grey blocked background with 2 icons in the middle, different on each version. If the CD lid is closed with a game inside at any time while at the menu, the game will immediately start.\n\nAs of 30 June 2007, a total of 7,918 software titles have been released worldwide (counting games released in multiple regions as separate titles). As of 31 March 2007, the cumulative software shipment was at 962 million units. The last game for the system released in the United States was \"FIFA Football 2005\". However, several reprinted and remastered editions were released in later years. \"Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection\" was released on 26 July 2007, which contained \"Metal Gear Solid\" in the original PlayStation format. In 2011, Capcom released the \"Resident Evil 15th Anniversary Collection\", and in 2012, Square Enix released the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" in Japan containing all of the \"Final Fantasy\" titles, a majority of which were also in the original PlayStation format.\n\nThe \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons on most of the Japanese PlayStation games are reversed in their North American and European releases. In Japan, the button (\"maru\", right) is used as the OK button, while the button (\"batsu\", wrong) is used as Cancel. North American and European releases have the button or the buttons as the OK button, while either the or the button is used as Cancel (some titles like \"Xenogears\" used the button for cancelling actions and selections, along with the PlayStation 2 system browser and the XrossMedia Bar on the PlayStation 3 and the PSP). However, a few games, such as Square's \"Vagrant Story\", \"Final Fantasy VII\" (which used the button as cancel) and \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", Namco's \"Ridge Racer Type 4\", and Konami's \"Metal Gear Solid\", use the Japanese button layout worldwide. Some other games, like the Japanese version of \"Gran Turismo\", had used different controls that are similar to North American games. These Japanese button layouts still apply to other PlayStation consoles. This is because in the early years Sony America (SCEA), Sony Europe (SCEE), and Sony Japan (SCEJ) had different development and testing documents (TRCs) for their respective territories.\n\nHardware designer Ken Kutaragi stated, \"The technology came from an original idea to create a synthesizer for graphics, something that takes a basic graphic and then adds various effects to it quickly and easily.\"\n\nWith the early units, particularly the early 1000 models, many gamers experience skipping full-motion video or physical \"ticking\" noises coming from their PlayStation units. The problem appears to have come from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments—the plastic mouldings inside the console can warp very slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly. The solution is to ensure that the console sits on a surface which dissipates heat efficiently in a well vented area, or raise the unit up slightly from its resting surface.\nThe first batch of PlayStations used a KSM-440AAM laser unit whose case and all movable parts were completely made out of plastic. Over time, friction causes the plastic lens sled rail to wear out—usually unevenly. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerated wear because of the additional heat, which makes the plastic even more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, one side of the lens sled can become so worn that the laser can tilt, no longer pointing directly at the CD. This would cause data read errors and games would no longer load. One common fix is to turn the PlayStation upside down, making the lens sled rest on the unworn top rails. Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the sled out of die-cast metal and placing the laser unit slightly farther away from the power supply on later models of the PlayStation.\n\nDue to an engineering oversight, the PlayStation does not produce a proper signal on several older models of televisions, causing the display to flicker or bounce around the screen. Since only a small percentage of PlayStation owners used such televisions, Sony decided not to change the console design, and instead gave consumers the option of sending their PlayStation unit to a Sony service centre to have an official modchip installed, which would allow it to play on older televisions.\n\nPrior to the PlayStation, the reproduction of copyrighted material for game consoles was restricted to either enthusiasts with exceptional technical ability, or others that had access to CD manufacturers. However, the increased availability of cheap CD burners at this time led Sony to modify the shape of the first portion of the data track on PlayStation formatted discs: A normal data track follows a smooth spiral path around a disc, whereas the modified portion of the data track followed wavy spiral path. As a result, any discs that did not contain the modified data track such as CD-R copies or standard pirated discs could not boot on the console. This modified portion of the data path was used to encode the disc \"region\", for example a disc destined for distribution in the NTSC-U/C region would encode the letters \"SCEA\"; in Europe, \"SCEE\"; in Japan, \"SCEI\". This served as copy protection as well as region-locking.\n\nThe installation of an unofficial modchip allowed the PlayStation to play games recorded on a regular CD-R. Since it worked by injecting the correct region data into the stream it also allowed the console to play games from any region.\n\nSeveral open source modchips were designed using readily available electronic parts, by the end of the system's life cycle almost anyone with minimal soldering experience was able to perform these modifications. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using free, unofficial tools, as well as the reproduction of original discs. With the introduction of such devices the console became very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers alike, as well as those who merely wished to protect the lifespan of their lawful, original discs. In 1996 Sony filed lawsuits against a number of companies which advertised such modchips and pirated games, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\nSome companies (notably Datel) did manage to produce discs that booted on unmodified retail units while using special equipment.\n\nInstead of a D-pad, which is used for directional movement in nearly every other console then on the market, the PlayStation controller uses four directional buttons.\n\nPeripherals released for the PlayStation include memory cards, the PlayStation Mouse, the PlayStation Analog Joystick, the PlayStation Link Cable, the Multiplayer Adapter (a four-player multitap), the Memory Drive (a disk drive for 3.5 inch floppy disks), the GunCon (a light gun), and the Glasstron (a monoscopic head-mounted display).\n\n\nThe PlayStation went through a number of variants during its production run. From an external perspective, the most notable change between variants was the reduction in the number of connectors. The RCA jacks were removed in the first revision, and the Parallel I/O port was removed in the final revision.\n\nSony marketed a development kit for hobbyists and developers also known as the Net Yaroze, which launched in June 1996 in Japan and in 1997 in other countries. Sold only through an ordering service, the development console came with the necessary documentation and software to program PlayStation games and applications.\n\nOn 7 July 2000, Sony released the PS one, a smaller, redesigned version of the original PlayStation. It was the highest-selling console through the end of the year, outselling all other consoles - including Sony's own PlayStation 2. A total of 28.15 million PS one units had been sold by the time it was discontinued in March 2006.\nA version of the PS one included a LCD screen, referred to as the \"Combo pack\".\n\nSony's successor to the PlayStation is the PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with its predecessor in that it can play almost every original PlayStation game.\n\nThe third generation of the PlayStation, the PlayStation 3, was launched on 11 November 2006 in Japan, 17 November 2006 in North America, and 23 March 2007 in Europe. The backward compatibility of the PlayStation 3 differs by model. The newer PlayStation 3 models, like the Slim, are only backwards compatible with original PlayStation games; however, the older 60 GB model (the first PS3 model released) will play PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games through either having the Emotion Engine and/or Reality Synthesizer and emulating one or the other. While PlayStation 3 games are not region-locked, PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games are only playable on PlayStation 3 consoles from the same region.\n\nA third successor, the PlayStation 4, was announced by Sony on 20 February 2013 and was released in the US on 15 November, Europe on 29 November 2013, and Japan and Asia on 22 February 2014. However, it is backwards compatible with select PS3 Games through a download service dubbed PlayStation Now.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable, or PSP, is a handheld game console first released in late 2004. The PSP is capable of playing PlayStation games downloaded via Sony's online store, and can also play any PlayStation game by using the PlayStation 3's remote play feature while the disc is in the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe successor to the PSP, the PlayStation Vita, was introduced as a part of the 8th generation of video game consoles, and is backwards compatible with original PSP as well as original PlayStation games downloaded from the PlayStation Store.\n\nSony Computer Entertainment was an upstart in the video game industry in late 1994, as the early 1990s were dominated by Nintendo and Sega. Nintendo had been the clear leader in the video game industry since the introduction of the NES in 1985 and the Nintendo 64 was initially expected to maintain this position for Nintendo. The PlayStation's target audience included 15- to 17-year-olds who were not the primary focus of Nintendo, and 18- to 29-year-olds, who represented the first generation to grow up playing video games. By the late 1990s, Sony became a highly regarded console brand due to the PlayStation, with a significant lead over second-place Nintendo, while Sega was relegated to a distant third.\n\nThe PlayStation's lead in installed base and developer support paved the way for the success of the next-generation PlayStation 2, which overcame an early launch from the Sega Dreamcast and then fended off competition from the Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube.\n\nThe success of the PlayStation is widely believed to have influenced the demise of the cartridge-based home console. While not the first system to utilise an optical disc format, it is the first highly successful one, and ended up going head-to-head with the last major home console to rely on proprietary cartridges—the Nintendo 64. Sony Computer Entertainment president Teruhisa Tokunaka remarked in 1996: \n\nNintendo was very public about its scepticism toward using CDs and DVDs to store games, citing longer load times and durability issues. It was widely speculated that the company was even more concerned with the proprietary cartridge format's ability to help enforce copy protection, given its substantial reliance on licensing and exclusive titles for its revenue. Piracy was rampant on the PlayStation due to the relative ease of the installation of a modchip, allowing the PlayStation to play games region free and/or recorded on a regular CD-R, making the console very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers.\n\nThe increasing complexity of games (in content, graphics, and sound) pushed cartridges to their storage limits and this gradually turned off some third-party developers. Part of the CD format's appeal to publishers was that they could be produced at a significantly lower cost and offered more production flexibility to meet demand. As a result, some third-party developers switched to the PlayStation, such as Squaresoft, whose \"Final Fantasy VII\", and Enix (later merged with Squaresoft to create Square Enix), whose \"Dragon Quest VII\" titles were initially pre-planned for the N64; while some who remained released fewer games to the Nintendo 64 (Konami, releasing only thirteen N64 games but over fifty on the PlayStation). While new games were coming out rapidly for the PlayStation, new Nintendo 64 game releases were less frequent and that system's biggest successes were developed by either Nintendo itself or by second-parties, such as Rare. The lower production costs also allowed publishers an additional source of profit: budget-priced reissues of titles which had already recouped their development costs.\n",

                "Cytus\n\nCytus is a rhythm game developed by Rayark Games, an independent game developer in Taiwan. It was first released on the iOS platform on January 12, 2012. The game was later released on Android on August 7, 2012. A port for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Mobile, titled Cytus: Lambda, was released on June 26, 2013. An arcade version titled Cytus: Omega in collaboration with Capcom is revealed at JAEPO in February 2015 and is set for location testing in July 2015.\n\nThe name \"Cytus\" is taken from Cocytus, the Greek mythological river of wailing or lamentation. \"Cytus\" features a story plot that is carried through its 10 main chapters as well as a prologue. The story revolves around the protagonist, Vanessa, who lives in a 22nd-century world where robots with human memories are the only remaining sentient beings while living humans are killed by a mutant virus. Due to limited memory space, human emotions are stored in the form of music in \"Cytus\", and by playing the songs, the robots are able to revive their human emotions. The plot features the disaster and the protagonist's struggle with identity. The story is told in-game through various cut-scenes that are unique to the chapter title songs; in comparison, the other individual songs within each chapter are at most only marginally relevant to the plot, except for a limited few.\n\nEven though it is a mobile game, it needs high specification. It requires 950MB of storage space. (9.X version). The data of the songs not purchased have to be downloaded together even though it’s not needed. And after the update to Cytus 10.0, the storage amount increased to 1.54GB in iOS.\n\nThe game needs at least iOS 7.0 on the basis of 2016/09/06 Cytus 10.0 update. An iPhone must be at least iPhone 5, and it will not work under iOS 7. If older versions of the game were previously installed, then it can be played normally. This app is a 64-bit app, which means it is also compatible with iOS 11 and later.\n\nThe game needs at least 600MB of storage and 1GHz of CPU and 140MB of relaxation in memory of 512MB RAM on Android 2.2. Playing the game on power save mode is almost impossible. Specifically, in Galaxy S3, auto haptic is released.\n\nThe game was released on 2013/6/26. It is a Play Station game, and can be downloaded in PSM store (A store for PS games). The game is optimized well, but it takes a long time to load. 0.5 seconds~ 3 seconds is taken to load, affected by the environment of the Play Station.\nThe storage amount is 599MB (Version 5.00). Almost nothing is different from the phone game Cytus. The price is 1,234￥(Japan), 9.69￡(England), 18.95 (Australia Dollar), 11.99 (American Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro). One of the uncomfortable parts of the game is update. The game cannot be updated by just downloading the patch file. The whole game file has to be downloaded again.\n\nThe game was revealed in 2015 February. It was revealed in the event ‘crossbeats REV.’ However, the game isn’t released yet. It isn’t much different from the phone game cytus, but it shows the note that has to be touched first. Also, notes that have to be touched at the same time have small horns to be distinguished easily.\n\nThe game was revealed in 2015 December. It was revealed at RayarkCon 2015. As of January 18, 2018, the game is now available to the public. Cytus II features similar game mechanics to the previous title.\n\nThe main gameplay of \"Cytus\" features the Active Scan Line, a black line that move up and down across the screen. The player taps circular objects, referred to as Notes, as the Active Scan Line passes over them, following the music.\n\nThree types of Notes are used. The Click Note, a single circular note, requires tapping the object in time. The Drag Note, a continuous track of notes, requires dragging along the track. The Hold Note, a note with an extended ribbon meter, requires holding over the note until the meter is filled. Notes to be hit as the line rises are colored blue and purple, while those as the line drops are colored yellow and green.\n\nEach Note is judged by the accuracy to be either Perfect, Good, Bad or Miss. The better the accuracy, the higher score is given. The maximum score is 1,000,000, and a minimum of 700,000 is required to clear a stage. Basic score is 900,000, the score is divided equally into every note. Combo score is 100,000, the score is proportional to square of the maximum combo. Also, the maximum TP score is 100, and TP Perfect, NM Perfect, Good, Bad, Miss is calculated 100%, 70%, 30%, 0%, 0%, respectively. After a stage ends, various metrics are provided to show the player's performance, including score, TP, a letter grade, and numbers of hits in each type of judgement. Score system is referred: Fail below 700,000, C below 800,000, B below 900,000, A below 950,000, S below 1,000,000, Million Master at 1,000,000.\n\n\"Cytus\" includes more than 100 songs available for play in the game, spanning a variety of genres including pop music, trance music and drum and bass. The music is composed and performed by independent composers and artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. Vocaloid engines are also used. A number of songs also has alternate version(s) in addition to the normal version. These can be called upon by interacting with the song artwork in the song selection screen. Gestures used includes tapping, swiping and holding at a specific timing and location.\n\n\"Cytus\" also includes a series of songs in image of the overarching plot, collectively named Cytus: Alive, added in version 6.0 in July 2014. Unlike normal songs, \"Cytus: Alive\" songs contains added plot animation during gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll composed by VGO(Video Game Orchestra).\n\n\n\nAll composed by Ice & gaQden. tap \"L\" silhouette to play insane mode each song.\n\n\nAll composed by Night Keepers, except Times Difference War.\n\n\n\"Cytus\" is available through the Apple App Store and Google Play. The full game charges a base price plus optional in-app purchases for players to purchase additional chapters of playable songs.\n\nThe release on Google Play is free but features a cooldown timer before starting each song. The cooldown will be removed when the full price is paid.\n\nThe PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Mobile port \"Cytus: Lambda\" includes the then-exclusive chapter Prologue: Live, otherwise identical to its smartphone releases. A teaser video was released onto YouTube prior to release on June 7, 2013.\n\nRayark Games announced the Million Downloads Plan () in the wake of \"illegal piracy harming the sales figures of \"Cytus\"\". Starting from Version 2.0.0, a 10-song chapter will be made available to all players for free for each 100,000 paid downloads achieved, up to a million paid downloads or ten chapters. The plan is completed with Version 8.0, released in July 2015, opening ten chapters for free, including the special Chapter Million featuring remixes of past songs.\n\n\nMultiple \"Cytus\" soundtracks have been released both on iTunes and as physical CD, featuring playable music and background composition from the game. Cytus -Prologue-, was released on April 1, 2012, Cytus -Hindsight- on December 10, 2013 and Cytus -Foresight- on December 28, 2013. A story album called Cytus -Alive- has also been released on August 20, 2012; the album features songs composed by Sta and Cranky with the same names as the ten chapters of the game. Each song corresponds to each chapter in the story plot.\n\nCode: Cytus () is a multimedia video game music stage production based on the story of \"Cytus\", produced by Divertimento Media () as commissioned by Quanta Arts Foundation (). The production ran four shows in November 2014 in Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Final Fantasy X\n\nSet in the fantasy world of Spira, the game's story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging monster known as Sin. The player character is Tidus, a star athlete in the fictional sport of blitzball, who finds himself in the world Spira after his home city of Zanarkand is destroyed by Sin. Shortly after arriving to Spira, Tidus joins the summoner Yuna on her pilgrimage to destroy Sin.\n\nDevelopment of \"Final Fantasy X\" began in 1999, with a budget of more than US$32.3 million (US$ million in dollars) and a team of more than 100 people. The game was the first in the main series not entirely scored by Nobuo Uematsu; Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano were signed as Uematsu's fellow composers. \"Final Fantasy X\" was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 8 million units worldwide. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time. On March 3, 2003, it was followed by \"Final Fantasy X-2\", making it the first \"Final Fantasy\" game to have a direct game sequel. Square Enix announced in 2013 that the \"Final Fantasy X\" series has sold over 14 million copies worldwide.\n\nLike previous games in the series, \"Final Fantasy X\" is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Final Fantasy X\" differs from that of previous \"Final Fantasy\" games in its lack of a top-down perspective world map. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In \"Final Fantasy X\", almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game's locations, though an airship becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, \"Final Fantasy X\" features numerous minigames, most notably the fictional underwater sport \"blitzball\".\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" introduces the \"Conditional Turn-Based Battle\" system in place of the series' traditional \"Active Time Battle\" system first used in \"Final Fantasy IV\". Whereas the ATB concept features real-time elements, the CTB system is a turn-based format that pauses the battle during each of the player's turns. Thus, the CTB design allows the player to select an action without time pressure. A graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen details who will be receiving turns next, and how various actions taken will affect the subsequent order of turns. The ordering of turns can be affected by a number of spells, items, and abilities that inflict status effects upon the controlled characters or the enemies. The player can control up to three characters in battle, though a swapping system allows the player to replace them with a character outside the active party at any time. \"Limit Breaks\", highly damaging special attacks, reappear in \"Final Fantasy X\" as \"Overdrives\". In this new incarnation of the feature, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness. While initially the Overdrives can be used when the character receives a significant amount of damage, the player is able to modify the requirements to unlock them.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" introduces an overhaul of the summoning system employed in previous games of the series. Whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive, perform one action, and then depart, the \"Aeons\" of \"Final Fantasy X\" arrive and entirely replace the battle party, fighting in their place until either the aeon wins the battle, is defeated itself, or is dismissed by the player. Aeons have their own statistics, commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives. The player acquires five aeons over the course of the game through the completion of Cloister of Trials puzzles, but three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various side-quests.\n\nAs with previous titles in the series, players have the opportunity to develop and improve their characters by defeating enemies and acquiring items, though the traditional experience point system is replaced by a new system called the \"Sphere Grid\". Instead of characters gaining pre-determined statistic bonuses for their attributes after leveling up, each character gains \"Sphere Levels\" after collecting enough Ability Points (AP). Sphere Levels allow players to move around the Sphere Grid, a pre-determined grid of interconnected nodes consisting of various statistic and ability bonuses. \"Spheres\" are applied to these nodes, unlocking its function for the selected character.\n\nThe Sphere Grid system also allows players to fully customize characters in contrast to their intended battle roles, such as turning the White Mage-roled Yuna into a physical powerhouse and the swordsman Auron into a healer. The \"International\" and PAL versions of the game include an optional \"Expert\" version of the Sphere Grid; in these versions, all of the characters start in the middle of the grid and may follow whichever path the player chooses. As a trade-off, the Expert grid has fewer nodes in total, thus decreasing the total statistic upgrades available during the game.\n\nBlitzball is a minigame that requires strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is played in a large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay is similar to that of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.\n\nBlitzball is first introduced in the beginning of the game during one of the early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role in the overall plot line as it is not only a main part of Tidus's character, but it's also in the first scene where the game's main antagonist, Sin is shown. Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" is set in the fictional world of Spira, consisting of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi'ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Although predominantly populated by humans, Spira features a variety of races. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language. The Guado, which are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other arboreal features. Still less human are the lion-like Ronso and the frog-like Hypello. A subset of Spira's sentient races are the \"unsent\", the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into \"fiends\", the monsters that are encountered throughout the game; however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form. Other fauna in Spira, aside from those drawn from real animals, such as cats, dogs, birds, and butterflies, include the gigantic, amphibious shoopufs (which are similar to elephants); and the emu-like chocobo, which appears in most \"Final Fantasy\" games. Spira is very different from the mainly European-style worlds found in previous \"Final Fantasy\" games, being much more closely modeled on Southeast Asia, most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names.\n\nThere are seven main playable characters in \"Final Fantasy X\", starting with Tidus, a cheerful young teenager and a star blitzball player from Zanarkand, who seeks a way home after an encounter with Sin transported him to Spira. To do so, he joins Yuna , a summoner on a journey to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat the enormous whale-like \"Sin\". Journeying with them are: Kimahri Ronso, a young warrior of the Ronso tribe who watched over Yuna during her childhood; Wakka, a blitzball player whose younger brother was killed by Sin; and Lulu, a stoic black mage close to Yuna and Wakka. During the journey, they are joined by Auron, a former warrior monk, who worked with both Tidus' and Yuna's fathers to defeat Sin 10 years prior; and Rikku, Yuna's cousin, a perky Al Bhed girl and the first friendly person Tidus meets upon arriving in Spira.\n\nThe main protagonist Tidus waits with his allies outside the ruins of an ancient city. Tidus narrates the events that led to the present, spanning most of the game's storyline. It begins in Tidus's home city, the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand, where he is a renowned star of the underwater sport blitzball, and son of the famous blitzball star, Jecht. During a blitzball tournament, the city is attacked by an immense creature that Auron, a man not originally from Zanarkand, calls \"Sin\". Sin destroys Zanarkand, taking Tidus and Auron to the world of Spira.\n\nUpon arriving in Spira, Tidus is rescued by Al Bhed salvagers in the area, who speak a language that is foreign to Tidus. Upon asking him where he is from, one of them, Rikku, who speaks the same language as Tidus, tells him that Sin destroyed Zanarkand 1,000 years ago. After Sin attacks again, Tidus is separated from the divers and drifts to the tropical island of Besaid, where he meets Wakka, captain of the local blitzball team, when he impresses them with his blitzball skills. Wakka introduces Tidus to Yuna, a young summoner about to go on a pilgrimage to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat Sin with her guardians Lulu, a mage of black magic, and Kimahri, a member of the Ronso tribe. Meanwhile, Tidus joins to help Wakka in the upcoming blitzball tournament to find a way back home. The party travels across Spira to gather aeons, defending against attacks by Sin and its \"offspring\"—fiends called Sinspawn. After the tournament, they are joined by Auron, who convinces Tidus to become Yuna's guardian. He reveals to Tidus that Yuna's father, Lord Braska; Tidus's father, Jecht; and himself made the same pilgrimage to defeat Sin ten years ago. Tidus thought his father had died at sea ten years earlier. Following another attack from Sin, they are joined by Rikku, later revealed to be Yuna's cousin.\n\nWhen the party arrives in the city of Guadosalam, the leader of the Guado, Seymour Guado, proposes to Yuna, saying that it will ease Spira's sorrow. At Macalania Temple, the group sees a message from Seymour's father Jyscal's spirit, who declares he was killed by his son, who now aims to destroy Spira. The group reunites with Yuna to engage Seymour in battle, killing him; soon afterward, Sin attacks, separating Yuna from the others. While searching for her on Bikanel Island, the homeland of the Al Bhed where they had surfaced, Tidus has an emotional breakdown when he learns that summoners die after summoning the Final Aeon, leading to his desire to find a way to defeat Sin while keeping Yuna alive. The group finds Yuna in Bevelle, where she is being forced to marry the unsent Seymour. They crash the wedding and escape with Yuna. The group is captured at the Bevelle temple, and are ordered to stand trial. After escaping from their sentence, the group heads towards the ruins of Zanarkand, seen in the introduction of the game.\n\nOn the way there, Tidus learns that he, Jecht, and the Zanarkand they hail from are summoned entities akin to aeons based on the original Zanarkand and its people. Long ago, the original Zanarkand battled Bevelle in a machina war, in which the former was defeated. Zanarkand's survivors became \"fayth\" so that they could use their memories of Zanarkand to create a new city in their image, removed from the reality of Spira. One thousand years after its creation, the fayth have become exhausted from \"dreaming\" their Zanarkand, but are unable to stop due to Sin's influence.\n\nOnce they reach Zanarkand, Yunalesca—the first summoner to defeat Sin and unsent ever since—tells the group that the Final Aeon is created from the fayth of one close to the summoner. After defeating Sin, the Final Aeon kills the summoner and transforms into a new Sin, which has caused its cycle of rebirth to continue. Yuna decides against using the Final Aeon, due to the futile sacrifices it carries and the fact that Sin would still be reborn. Disappointed by their resolution, Yunalesca tries to kill Tidus' group, but she is defeated and vanishes, ending hope of ever attaining the Final Aeon. After the fight, the group learns that Yu Yevon, a summoner who lost his humanity and mind, is behind Sin's cycle of rebirth. This leads the group to infiltrate Sin's body to battle Seymour, and Jecht's imprisoned spirit. With Sin's host defeated, Tidus' group battles and defeats Yu Yevon. Sin's cycle of rebirth ends, and the spirits of Spira's fayth are freed from their imprisonment. Auron, who had earlier been revealed to be unsent, goes to the Farplane. Just then, Dream Zanarkand and Tidus disappear, now that the freed fayth stopped the summoning. Afterward, in a speech to the citizens of Spira, Yuna resolves to help rebuild their world now that it is free of Sin. In a post-credits scene, Tidus awakens under water. He then swims towards the ocean surface, and the screen fades to white.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\"s development began in 1999, costing approximately ¥4 billion (approximately US$ million in dollars) with a crew of over 100 people, most of whom worked on previous games in the series. Executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that although he had concerns about the transition from 2D to 3D backgrounds, the voice acting, and the transition to real-time story-telling, the success of the \"Final Fantasy\" series can be attributed to constantly challenging the development team to try new things. Producer Yoshinori Kitase was also the chief director of \"Final Fantasy X\", while the direction of events, maps and battles was split up between Motomu Toriyama, Takayoshi Nakazato and Toshiro Tsuchida, respectively. The development of the script for the game took three to four months, with the same amount of time dedicated to the voice recording afterwards. Kazushige Nojima collaborated with Daisuke Watanabe, Toriyama and Kitase on writing the scenario for \"Final Fantasy X\". Nojima was particularly concerned with establishing a connection in the relationship between player and main character. Thus, he penned the story such that the player's progress through the world and growing knowledge about it is reflected in Tidus' own understanding and narration.\n\nCharacter designer Tetsuya Nomura has identified the South Pacific, Thailand and Japan as major influences on the cultural and geographic design of Spira, particularly concerning the geographic location of the southern Besaid and Kilika islands. He has also said that Spira deviates from the worlds of past \"Final Fantasy\" games in the level of detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Kitase felt that if the setting went back to a medieval European fantasy, it would not seem to help the development team advance. While he was thinking of different world environments, Nojima suggested a fantasy world that incorporated Asian elements. Sub-character chief designer Fumi Nakashima's focus was to ensure that characters from different regions and cultures bore distinctive characteristics in their clothing styles, so that they could be quickly and easily identified as members of their respective sub-groups. For example, she has said that the masks and goggles of the Al Bhed give the group a \"strange and eccentric\" appearance, while the attire of the Ronso lend to them being able to easily engage in battle. Tidus' relationship with his father Jecht was based \"stories throughout the ages, such as the ancient Greek legends.\" This would eventually reveal the key of Sin's weakness and eventual defeat.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" features innovations in the rendering of characters' facial expressions, achieved through motion capture and skeletal animation technology. This technology allowed animators to create realistic lip movements, which were then programmed to match the speech of the game's voice actors. Nojima has revealed that the inclusion of voice acting enabled him to express emotion more powerfully than before, and he was therefore able to keep the storyline simple. He also said that the presence of voice actors led him to make various changes to the script, in order to match the voice actors' personalities with the characters they were portraying. The inclusion of voice, however, led to difficulties. With the game's cutscenes already programmed around the Japanese voice work, the English localization team faced the difficulty of establishing English-oriented dialogue and the obstacle of incorporating this modified wording with the rhythm and timing of the characters' lip movements. Localization specialist Alexander O. Smith noted that they had to keep the localized sound file within the duration of the original Japanese, as longer files would cause the game to crash. He described the process of fitting natural-sounding English speech into the game as \"something akin to writing four or five movies' worth of dialogue entirely in haiku form [and] of course the actors had to act, and act well, within those restraints.\"\n\nThe game was initially going to feature online elements, offered through Square's PlayOnline service. The features, however, were dropped during production, and online gaming would not become part of the \"Final Fantasy\" series until \"Final Fantasy XI\". Map director Nakazato wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional \"Final Fantasy\" game, in line with the realism of the game's 3D backgrounds, as opposed to pre-rendered backgrounds. As a player of the games in the \"Final Fantasy\" series, battle director Tsuchida wanted to recreate elements he found interesting or entertaining, which eventually led to the removal of the \"Active Time Battle\" system, and instead, incorporated the strategy-focused \"Conditional Turn-Based Battle\" system. Originally, \"Final Fantasy X\" was going to feature wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters. Battle art director Shintaro Takai has explained that it was his intention that battles in \"Final Fantasy X\" come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element. However, due to hardware limitations, this idea was not used. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field map to the battle map were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect that would happen at the end of an event scene. The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game. Kitase has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters' attributes, such that they will be able to observe the development of those attributes firsthand. The developers experienced difficulty with the scene of Tidus and Yuna kissing, as they were not used to animating romance scenes. Visual Works director Kazuyuki Ikumori stated that this was due to the use of 3D models in the scene. Because of the negative response from female members of staff, the scene was remade multiple times.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" marks the first time regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu has had any assistance in composing the score for a game in the main series. His fellow composers for \"Final Fantasy X\" were Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. They were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different from Uematsu's style while still being able to work together. PlayOnline.com first revealed that the game's theme song was completed in November 2000. As Square still had not revealed who would sing the song, GameSpot personally asked Uematsu, who jokingly answered \"It's going to be Rod Stewart.\"\n\nThe game features three songs with vocalized elements, including the J-pop ballad \"Suteki da ne\", which translates to \"Isn't it Wonderful?\". The lyrics were written by Kazushige Nojima, and the music was written by Uematsu. The song is performed by Japanese folk singer Rikki, whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an Okinawan atmosphere. \"Suteki da ne\" is also sung in Japanese in the English version of \"Final Fantasy X\". Like \"Eyes on Me\" from \"Final Fantasy VIII\" and \"Melodies of Life\" from \"Final Fantasy IX\", an orchestrated version of \"Suteki da ne\" is used as part of the ending theme. The other songs with lyrics are the heavy metal opening theme, \"Otherworld\", sung in English by Bill Muir; and \"Hymn of the Fayth\", a recurring piece sung using Japanese syllabary.\n\nThe original soundtrack spanned 91 tracks on four discs. It was first released in Japan on August 1, 2001, by DigiCube, and was re-released on May 10, 2004, by Square Enix. In 2002, Tokyopop released a version of \"Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack\" in North America entitled \"Final Fantasy X Official Soundtrack\", which contained 17 tracks from the original album on a single disc. Other related CDs include \"feel/Go dream: Yuna & Tidus\" which, released in Japan by DigiCube on October 11, 2001, featured tracks based on Tidus' and Yuna's characters. \"Piano Collections Final Fantasy X\", another collection of music from the game, and \"Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection\", a compilations of exclusive character dialogues and songs were both in Japan in 2002.\n\nThe Black Mages, a band led by Nobuo Uematsu that arranges music from \"Final Fantasy\" video games into a rock music style, have arranged three pieces from \"Final Fantasy X\". These are \"Fight With Seymour\" from their self-titled album, published in 2003, and \"Otherworld\" and \"The Skies Above\", both of which can be found on the album \"\", published in 2004. Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his \"Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy\" concert series. The music of \"Final Fantasy X\" has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as \"20020220 Music from Final Fantasy\", a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including several pieces from the game. An odd note; the unreleased/promo CD-R (Instrumental) version of Madonna's \"What It Feels Like For A Girl\" done by Tracy Young was used in the blitzball sequences. Additionally, \"Swing de Chocobo\" was performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra for the \"Distant Worlds – Music from Final Fantasy\" concert tour, while \"Zanarkand\" was performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in the \"Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy\" concert series. Independent but officially licensed releases of \"Final Fantasy X\" music have been composed by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music. Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called \"dojin music\", and on English remixing websites.\n\nThe Japanese version of \"Final Fantasy X\" included an additional disc entitled \"The Other Side of Final Fantasy\", which featured interviews, storyboards, and trailers for \"Blue Wing Blitz\", \"Kingdom Hearts\", and \"\", as well as the first footage of \"Final Fantasy XI\". An international version of the game was released in Japan as \"Final Fantasy X International\" in January 2002, and in PAL regions under its original title. It features content not available in the original NTSC releases, including battles with \"Dark\" versions of the game's aeons and an airship fight with the superboss \"Penance\". The Japanese release of \"Final Fantasy X International\" also includes \"Eternal Calm\", a 14-minute video clip bridging the story of \"Final Fantasy X\" with that of its sequel, \"Final Fantasy X-2\". The video clip was included in a bonus DVD for \"Unlimited Saga Collector's Edition\" under the name \"Eternal Calm, Final Fantasy X-2: Prologue\". It was first released in Europe on October 31, 2003, and featured English voice-overs.\n\nThe international and PAL versions include a bonus DVD called \"Beyond Final Fantasy\", a disc including interviews with the game's developers, and two of the game's English voice actors, James Arnold Taylor (Tidus) and Hedy Burress (Yuna). Also included are trailers for \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Kingdom Hearts\", a concept and promotional art gallery for the game, and a music video of \"Suteki da ne\" performed by Rikki. In 2005, a compilation featuring \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Final Fantasy X-2\" was released in Japan as \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 Ultimate Box\".\n\nSquare also produced various types of merchandise and several books, including \"The Art of Final Fantasy X\" and three \"Ultimania\" guides, a series of artbooks/strategy guides published by DigiCube in Japan. They feature original artwork from \"Final Fantasy X\", offer gameplay walkthroughs, expand upon many aspects of the game's storyline and feature several interviews with the game's designers. There are three books in the series: \"Final Fantasy X Scenario Ultimania\", \"Final Fantasy X Battle Ultimania\", and \"Final Fantasy X Ultimania Ω\". On December 18, 2012 the game was re-released as part of the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" release.\n\nOn September 13, 2011, Square Enix announced that \"Final Fantasy X\" would be re-released in high-definition for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, in celebration of the game's 10-year anniversary. In January 2012, production of the game had started. Producer Yoshinori Kitase was once again involved in the production of the game, wishing to work on its quality. On February 18, 2013 the first footage of the PlayStation Vita version of \"Final Fantasy X HD\" was released, showing off HD models of Tidus, Yuna, Bahamut and Yojimbo. On March 19, it was confirmed that the PS3 version of the game would also include its sequel \"X-2\", and that it would be remastered in HD. The two HD remastered games for the PS3 were released under the title \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster\" on a single Blu-ray disc game, and was sold separately on game cartridges on Vita in Japan and sold together in North America, Europe & Australia as a set, with \"FFX\" being on a cartridge and \"FFX-2\" being included as a download voucher. Downloadable versions are available for both systems. Square Enix launched an official website for the two HD remastered titles in March 2013. The games contain all the content found in the \"International\" version, including \"Eternal Calm\" and \"Last Mission\". During the PlayStation China press conference that took place in Shanghai on December 11, 2014, Square Enix confirmed \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster\" would be released for the PlayStation 4 in Spring 2015. It was released in North America on May 12, Australia & Japan on May 14 and Europe on May 15, 2015. It included enhanced graphics in full HD (1080p), the option to switch to the original soundtrack and the ability to transfer save files from the PS3 & PS Vita versions. One year later on May 12, 2016, it was released for Microsoft Windows via Steam. It includes an auto-save feature, 5 game boosters, 3 parameter changes, the option to skip FMVs/cinematics, 4K resolution support, audio settings and graphic options.\n\nSquare expected the game to sell at least two million copies worldwide owing to the reduced PlayStation 2's fanbase, making it smaller than the last three released titles. However, within four days of its release in Japan, the game had sold over 1.4 million copies in pre-orders, which set a record for the fastest-selling console RPG. These figures exceeded the performances of \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"IX\" in a comparable period, and \"Final Fantasy X\" became the first PlayStation 2 game to reach two million and four million sold copies. In October 2007, the game was listed as the 8th best-selling game for the PlayStation 2. \"Final Fantasy X\" sold over 2.26 million copies in Japan alone in 2001, and sold 6.6 million copies worldwide by January 2004. By July 2006, it had sold 2.3 million copies and earned $95 million in the United States(US$ million in ). \"Next Generation\" ranked it as the 11th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country.\n\nThe \"Ultimate Hits\" bargain reissue of the game in September 2005 sold over 131,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006. In October 2013, Square Enix announced \"Final Fantasy X\" and its sequel \"Final Fantasy X-2\" have together sold over 14 million copies worldwide on PlayStation 2.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" received critical acclaim by the media. The Japanese video game magazine \"Famitsu\" and \"Famitsu PS2\" awarded the game a near-perfect 39/40 score. Another Japanese gaming magazine, \"The Play Station\", gave the game a score of 29/30. \"Famitsu\", \"Famitsu PS2\", and \"The Play Station\" expressed particularly favorable responses toward the game's storyline, graphics, and movies. The game maintains a 92 out of 100 on Metacritic. Producer Shinji Hashimoto stated that the overall reception to the game was \"excellent\", having received praise and awards from the media.\n\nIGN's David Smith offered praise for the voice actors and the innovations in gameplay, particularly with the revised battle and summon systems, the option to change party members during battle, and the character development and inventory management systems. They also felt that the game's graphics had improved on its predecessors in every way possible, and that the game as a whole was \"the best-looking game of the series [and] arguably the best-playing as well\". Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the game's storyline, calling it surprisingly complex, its ending satisfying, and its avoidance of role-playing game clichés commendable with Tidus viewed as an appealing protagonist. He also lauded the music, feeling it was \"diverse and well suited to the various scenes in the game\". Similarly, \"GamePro\" described its character building system and battle system as \"two of the best innovations in the series\". The visuals of the game were commended by GameSpy's Raymond Padilla, who referred to them as \"top-notch\", as well as giving praise to the character models, backgrounds, cutscenes, and animations. The voice casting was praised by Game Revolution who noted most of them were \"above average\" and called the music \"rich\".\n\n\"Edge\" rated the game considerably lower, criticizing many aspects of the game for being tedious and uninnovative and describing the dialogue as \"nauseating\", particularly panning Tidus. Andrew Reiner of \"Game Informer\" criticized the game's linearity and that players were no longer able to travel the world by chocobo or control the airship. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell noted that the game's puzzle segments were \"depressing\" and \"superfluous\", and that although the Sphere Grid was \"a nice touch\", it took up too much of the game. The linearity of the game was positively commented on by \"GamePro\" who stated that a player would not be required to participate in side-quests or the mini-game to reach the game's conclusion, finding some of them unappealing. Game Revolution complained that cutscenes could not be skipped, some even being too long.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" received the Best Game Award from the Japan Game Awards for 2001–2002. In GameSpot's \"Best and Worst Awards\" from 2001, it came seventh in the category \"Top 10 Video Games of the Year\". Readers of \"Famitsu\" magazine voted it the best game of all time in early 2006. \"Final Fantasy X\" came in fifth on IGN's \"Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time\" list in 2007 and sixth in \"The Top 10 Best Looking PS2 Games of All Time\". In a similar list by GameSpy, the game took the 21st place. 1UP.com listed its revelation during the ending as the third-biggest video game spoiler, while IGN ranked the ending as the fifth best pre-rendered cutscene. In a Reader's Choice made in 2006 by IGN, it ranked as the 60th-best video game. It was also named one of the 20 essential Japanese role-playing games by Gamasutra. It also placed 43rd in \"Game Informer\"s list of \"The Top 200 Games of All Time\". In 2004, \"Final Fantasy X\" was listed as one of the best games ever made by GameFAQs, while in November 2005 it was voted as the 12th \"Best Game Ever\". In a general overview of the series, both GamesRadar and IGN listed \"Final Fantasy X\" as the fourth best game. At the sixth annual Interactive Achievement Awards in 2003, it was nominated for \"Outstanding Achievement in Animation\" and \"Console Role-Playing Game of the Year\". At the end of 2007, it was named the ninth best-selling RPG by \"Guinness World Records\". Readers from GameFaqs also voted it as Game of the Year during 2001. In 2008, readers of \"Dengeki\" magazine voted it the second best game ever made. It was voted first place in \"Famitsu\"s and \"Dengeki\"s polls of most tear-inducing games of all time. Both Tidus and Yuna have been popular characters in games in general due to their personalities and their romantic relationship.\n\nDue to its commercial and critical success, Square Enix released a direct sequel to \"Final Fantasy X\" in 2003, titled \"Final Fantasy X-2\". The sequel is set two years after the conclusion of \"Final Fantasy X\", establishing new conflicts and dilemmas and resolving loose ends left by the original game. Although the sequel did not sell as well as the original, 5.29 million units versus 8 million units, it can still be considered a commercial success. As a result of the title's popularity, Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima decided to establish a plot-related connection between \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Final Fantasy VII\", another well-received\" Final Fantasy\" game. In 2013, after the release of the HD Remaster, Nojima stated that he would like to see a second sequel to \"X\", and if there were demand for it, it could happen. The minigame of blitzball has made it into other games, such as \"Final Fantasy X-2\", and was mentioned as a possibility for \"\".\n\nThe advancements in portraying realistic emotions achieved with \"Final Fantasy X\" through voice-overs and detailed facial expressions have since become a staple of the series, with \"Final Fantasy X-2\" and other subsequent titles (such as \"\", \"Final Fantasy XII\", \"XIII\" and its sequels, and \"XV\") also featuring this development. Traversing real-time 3D environments instead of an overworld map has also become a standard of the series, as demonstrated in \"Final Fantasy XI\", \"XII\", \"XIII\" and its sequels, \"XIV\" and \"XV\". Final Fantasy X can be considered a pioneer in 3-D RPG maps.\n\n"

                "PlayStation (console)\n\nThe PlayStation (officially abbreviated to PS, and commonly known as the PS1 or PSX) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. The console was released on 3 December in Japan, 9 September 1995 in North America, 29 September 1995 in Europe, and for 15 November 1995 in Australia. The console was the first of the PlayStation lineup of home video game consoles. It primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn as part of the fifth generation of video game consoles.\n\nThe PlayStation is the first \"computer entertainment platform\" to ship 100 million units, which it had reached 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. In 2000, a redesigned, \"slim\" version called the PS one was released, replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor, the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with the PlayStation's DualShock controller and games, was announced in 1999 and launched in 2000. The last PS one units were sold in winter 2004 before it was officially discontinued in 2006, for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch 11 years earlier. Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of both the PlayStation and PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 – over 11 years after it had been released, and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe inception of what would become the released PlayStation dates back to 1986 with a joint venture between Nintendo and Sony. Nintendo had already produced floppy disk technology to complement cartridges, in the form of the Family Computer Disk System, and wanted to continue this complementary storage strategy for the Super Famicom. Nintendo approached Sony to develop a CD-ROM add-on, tentatively titled the \"Play Station\" or \"SNES-CD\". A contract was signed, and work began. Nintendo's choice of Sony was due to a prior dealing: Ken Kutaragi, the person who would later be dubbed \"The Father of the PlayStation\", was the individual who had sold Nintendo on using the Sony SPC-700 processor for use as the eight-channel ADPCM sound set in the Super Famicom/SNES console through an impressive demonstration of the processor's capabilities.\n\nKutaragi was nearly fired by Sony because he was originally working with Nintendo on the side without Sony's knowledge (while still employed by Sony). It was then-CEO, Norio Ohga, who recognised the potential in Kutaragi's chip, and in working with Nintendo on the project. Ohga kept Kutaragi on at Sony, and it was not until Nintendo cancelled the project that Sony decided to develop its own console.\n\nSony also planned to develop a Super NES-compatible, Sony-branded console, but one which would be more of a home entertainment system playing both Super NES cartridges and a new CD format which Sony would design. This was also to be the format used in SNES-CDs, giving a large degree of control to Sony despite Nintendo's leading position in the video gaming market.\n\nThe product, dubbed the \"Play Station\" was to be announced at the May 1991 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). However, when Nintendo's Hiroshi Yamauchi read the original 1988 contract between Sony and Nintendo, he realised that the earlier agreement essentially handed Sony complete control over any and all titles written on the SNES CD-ROM format. Yamauchi decided that the contract was totally unacceptable and he secretly cancelled all plans for the joint Nintendo-Sony SNES CD attachment. Instead of announcing a partnership between Sony and Nintendo, at 9 am the day of the CES, Nintendo chairman Howard Lincoln stepped onto the stage and revealed that Nintendo was now allied with Philips, and Nintendo was planning on abandoning all the previous work Nintendo and Sony had accomplished. Lincoln and Minoru Arakawa had, unbeknownst to Sony, flown to Philips' global headquarters in the Netherlands and formed an alliance of a decidedly different nature—one that would give Nintendo total control over its licenses on Philips machines.\n\nAfter the collapse of the joint-Nintendo project, Sony briefly considered allying itself with Sega to produce a stand-alone console. The Sega CEO at the time, Tom Kalinske, took the proposal to Sega's Board of Directors in Tokyo, who promptly vetoed the idea. Kalinske, in a 2013 interview recalled them saying \"that’s a stupid idea, Sony doesn't know how to make hardware. They don’t know how to make software either. Why would we want to do this?\". This prompted Sony into halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what it had developed so far with both Nintendo and Sega to make it into a complete console based upon the Super Famicom. As a result, Nintendo filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in US federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of what was originally christened the \"Play Station\", on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction and, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the aforementioned brand new game system was revealed. However, it is theorised that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.\n\nBy the end of 1992, Sony and Nintendo reached a deal whereby the \"Play Station\" would still have a port for SNES games, but Nintendo would own the rights and receive the bulk of the profits from the games, and the SNES would continue to use the Sony-designed audio chip. However, Sony decided in early 1993 to begin reworking the \"Play Station\" concept to target a new generation of hardware and software. As part of this process the SNES cartridge port was dropped and the space between the names \"Play Station\" was removed becoming \"PlayStation\", thereby ending Nintendo's involvement with the project. According to a Sony engineer, all work on the console from the time of the partnership with Nintendo was eventually scrapped, and the PlayStation design was restarted from scratch. Sony's North American division, known as Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), originally planned to market the new console under the alternative branding \"PSX\" following the negative feedback regarding \"PlayStation\" in focus group studies. Early advertising prior to the console's launch in North America referenced PSX, but the term was scrapped before launch.\n\nAccording to SCE's producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, there was uncertainty over whether the console should primarily focus on 2D sprite graphics or 3D polygon graphics. It was only after witnessing the success of Sega's \"Virtua Fighter\" in Japanese arcades that \"the direction of the PlayStation became instantly clear\" and 3D polygon graphics became the console's primary focus.\n\nUnlike Sega, Sony had no arcade division from which to draw console-selling ports, or any in-house development to speak of. To solve this problem, Sony acquired studios such as Psygnosis and signed exclusivity deals with hot arcade publishers Namco and Williams Entertainment.\n\nIndustry hype for the console spread quickly, and in early 1994 \"GamePro\" reported that \"many video game companies [feel] that in the near future, the video game platforms to contend with will be from Nintendo, Sega... and \"Sony\".\" [emphasis in original]\n\nThe PlayStation was released in Japan on 3 December 1994, North America on 9 September 1995, Europe on 29 September 1995, and Oceania on 15 November 1995. The console was an immediate success in Japan, selling over 2 million units within its first six months on the market. In the US, 800,000 were sold in 1995 (i.e. four months on the market), giving the PlayStation a commanding lead over the other consoles of its generation, though it was still being outsold by the older Super NES and Sega Genesis. The launch price in the US market was US$299 and Sony enjoyed a very successful launch with titles of almost every genre, including \"Battle Arena Toshinden\", \"Warhawk\", \"Air Combat\", \"Philosoma\", \"Ridge Racer\" and \"Rayman\". Unlike the vast majority of gaming consoles of the time, the PlayStation did not include a pack-in game at launch. Sony reported strong software sales in the months following launch, with an attach rate of 4:1.\n\nThen Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, preferred Sony's console to the competition from Sega, saying \"Our game designer likes the Sony machine.\" Microsoft would later compete with Sony with its Xbox console. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" would score the PlayStation console a 19 out of 40. The staff of \"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation a few weeks after its North American launch. They commented that while the CPU is \"fairly average\", the supplementary custom hardware such as the GPU and sound processor is stunningly powerful. They particularly praised its focus on 3D, and also remarked positively on the comfort of the controller and the convenience of the memory cards. Giving the system 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, they concluded, \"To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war.\" An advertisement slogan used in marketing the console was, \"\"Live in your world. Play in ours.\"\" It is stylised as, \"LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS.\" Another briefly used advertising campaign was titled \"You Are Not Ready\" or \"U R NOT .\" Sony's CCO Lee Clow explained that \"it's the ultimate challenge. Gamers love to respond to that tag line and say 'Bullshit. Let me show you how ready I am.'\"\n\nOne of the key factors in the PlayStation's success was Sony's approach to third party developers. Whereas Sega and Nintendo took an isolationist approach, focusing on first party development while generally leaving third party developers to their own devices, Sony took efforts to streamline game production by providing a range of programming libraries which were constantly updated online, organising third party technical support teams, and in some cases giving direct development support to third party companies.\n\nWhile the Sega Saturn was marketed towards 18 to 34 year-olds, the PlayStation was marketed roughly, but not exclusively, towards 12 to 24 year-olds. Both Sega and Sony reasoned that because younger players typically look up to older, more experienced players, they would be drawn in by advertising targeted at teens and adults. Additionally, Sony found that adults are best targeted by advertising geared towards teenagers; according to Lee Clow, \"One of the first things we resolved early on was that everyone is 17 when they play videogames. The young people look up to the best gamer who is usually a little older and more practiced and talented. Then there are people who start working and grow up, but when they go into their room and sit down with their videogames, they're regressing and becoming 17 again.\" Initially PlayStation demographics were skewed towards adults, but after the first price drop the audience began broadening.\n\nIn 1996, the high demand for PlayStation games contributed to Sony's decision to expand their CD production facilities in Springfield, Oregon, increasing their monthly output from 4 million discs to 6.5 million discs. PlayStation sales were running at twice the rate of Saturn sales, and dramatically increased their lead when both the PlayStation and Saturn dropped in price to $199 in May, in large part because some retailers (such as KB Toys) did not stock the Saturn. The PlayStation was outselling the Saturn at a similar ratio in Europe as well during 1996.\n\nThe PlayStation took more time to achieve dominance in Japan. After the PlayStation and Saturn had been on the market for nearly two years, Sony Computer Entertainment president Teruhisa Tokunaka said the competition between them was still \"very close\", and that neither console had yet held the lead in sales for any meaningful length of time.\n\nIn addition to playing games, select PlayStation models have the ability to play audio CDs; further, Asian model SCPH-5903 can also play Video CDs. Like most domestic CD players, the PlayStation has the ability to shuffle the playback order, play the songs in a programmed order, and repeat one song or the entire disc. Later PlayStation models can utilise a music visualisation function called SoundScope. This function, as well as a memory card manager, can be accessed by starting the console either without inserting a game or keeping the CD tray open, thereby accessing a GUI for the PlayStation BIOS.\n\nThe actual GUI for both PS one and PlayStation differ graphically depending on firmware versions: the original PlayStation GUI had a dark blue background with rainbow graffiti used as buttons; the early PAL PlayStation and PS one GUI had a grey blocked background with 2 icons in the middle, different on each version. If the CD lid is closed with a game inside at any time while at the menu, the game will immediately start.\n\nAs of 30 June 2007, a total of 7,918 software titles have been released worldwide (counting games released in multiple regions as separate titles). As of 31 March 2007, the cumulative software shipment was at 962 million units. The last game for the system released in the United States was \"FIFA Football 2005\". However, several reprinted and remastered editions were released in later years. \"Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection\" was released on 26 July 2007, which contained \"Metal Gear Solid\" in the original PlayStation format. In 2011, Capcom released the \"Resident Evil 15th Anniversary Collection\", and in 2012, Square Enix released the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" in Japan containing all of the \"Final Fantasy\" titles, a majority of which were also in the original PlayStation format.\n\nThe \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons on most of the Japanese PlayStation games are reversed in their North American and European releases. In Japan, the button (\"maru\", right) is used as the OK button, while the button (\"batsu\", wrong) is used as Cancel. North American and European releases have the button or the buttons as the OK button, while either the or the button is used as Cancel (some titles like \"Xenogears\" used the button for cancelling actions and selections, along with the PlayStation 2 system browser and the XrossMedia Bar on the PlayStation 3 and the PSP). However, a few games, such as Square's \"Vagrant Story\", \"Final Fantasy VII\" (which used the button as cancel) and \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", Namco's \"Ridge Racer Type 4\", and Konami's \"Metal Gear Solid\", use the Japanese button layout worldwide. Some other games, like the Japanese version of \"Gran Turismo\", had used different controls that are similar to North American games. These Japanese button layouts still apply to other PlayStation consoles. This is because in the early years Sony America (SCEA), Sony Europe (SCEE), and Sony Japan (SCEJ) had different development and testing documents (TRCs) for their respective territories.\n\nHardware designer Ken Kutaragi stated, \"The technology came from an original idea to create a synthesizer for graphics, something that takes a basic graphic and then adds various effects to it quickly and easily.\"\n\nWith the early units, particularly the early 1000 models, many gamers experience skipping full-motion video or physical \"ticking\" noises coming from their PlayStation units. The problem appears to have come from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments—the plastic mouldings inside the console can warp very slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly. The solution is to ensure that the console sits on a surface which dissipates heat efficiently in a well vented area, or raise the unit up slightly from its resting surface.\nThe first batch of PlayStations used a KSM-440AAM laser unit whose case and all movable parts were completely made out of plastic. Over time, friction causes the plastic lens sled rail to wear out—usually unevenly. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerated wear because of the additional heat, which makes the plastic even more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, one side of the lens sled can become so worn that the laser can tilt, no longer pointing directly at the CD. This would cause data read errors and games would no longer load. One common fix is to turn the PlayStation upside down, making the lens sled rest on the unworn top rails. Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the sled out of die-cast metal and placing the laser unit slightly farther away from the power supply on later models of the PlayStation.\n\nDue to an engineering oversight, the PlayStation does not produce a proper signal on several older models of televisions, causing the display to flicker or bounce around the screen. Since only a small percentage of PlayStation owners used such televisions, Sony decided not to change the console design, and instead gave consumers the option of sending their PlayStation unit to a Sony service centre to have an official modchip installed, which would allow it to play on older televisions.\n\nPrior to the PlayStation, the reproduction of copyrighted material for game consoles was restricted to either enthusiasts with exceptional technical ability, or others that had access to CD manufacturers. However, the increased availability of cheap CD burners at this time led Sony to modify the shape of the first portion of the data track on PlayStation formatted discs: A normal data track follows a smooth spiral path around a disc, whereas the modified portion of the data track followed wavy spiral path. As a result, any discs that did not contain the modified data track such as CD-R copies or standard pirated discs could not boot on the console. This modified portion of the data path was used to encode the disc \"region\", for example a disc destined for distribution in the NTSC-U/C region would encode the letters \"SCEA\"; in Europe, \"SCEE\"; in Japan, \"SCEI\". This served as copy protection as well as region-locking.\n\nThe installation of an unofficial modchip allowed the PlayStation to play games recorded on a regular CD-R. Since it worked by injecting the correct region data into the stream it also allowed the console to play games from any region.\n\nSeveral open source modchips were designed using readily available electronic parts, by the end of the system's life cycle almost anyone with minimal soldering experience was able to perform these modifications. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using free, unofficial tools, as well as the reproduction of original discs. With the introduction of such devices the console became very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers alike, as well as those who merely wished to protect the lifespan of their lawful, original discs. In 1996 Sony filed lawsuits against a number of companies which advertised such modchips and pirated games, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\nSome companies (notably Datel) did manage to produce discs that booted on unmodified retail units while using special equipment.\n\nInstead of a D-pad, which is used for directional movement in nearly every other console then on the market, the PlayStation controller uses four directional buttons.\n\nPeripherals released for the PlayStation include memory cards, the PlayStation Mouse, the PlayStation Analog Joystick, the PlayStation Link Cable, the Multiplayer Adapter (a four-player multitap), the Memory Drive (a disk drive for 3.5 inch floppy disks), the GunCon (a light gun), and the Glasstron (a monoscopic head-mounted display).\n\n\nThe PlayStation went through a number of variants during its production run. From an external perspective, the most notable change between variants was the reduction in the number of connectors. The RCA jacks were removed in the first revision, and the Parallel I/O port was removed in the final revision.\n\nSony marketed a development kit for hobbyists and developers also known as the Net Yaroze, which launched in June 1996 in Japan and in 1997 in other countries. Sold only through an ordering service, the development console came with the necessary documentation and software to program PlayStation games and applications.\n\nOn 7 July 2000, Sony released the PS one, a smaller, redesigned version of the original PlayStation. It was the highest-selling console through the end of the year, outselling all other consoles - including Sony's own PlayStation 2. A total of 28.15 million PS one units had been sold by the time it was discontinued in March 2006.\nA version of the PS one included a LCD screen, referred to as the \"Combo pack\".\n\nSony's successor to the PlayStation is the PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with its predecessor in that it can play almost every original PlayStation game.\n\nThe third generation of the PlayStation, the PlayStation 3, was launched on 11 November 2006 in Japan, 17 November 2006 in North America, and 23 March 2007 in Europe. The backward compatibility of the PlayStation 3 differs by model. The newer PlayStation 3 models, like the Slim, are only backwards compatible with original PlayStation games; however, the older 60 GB model (the first PS3 model released) will play PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games through either having the Emotion Engine and/or Reality Synthesizer and emulating one or the other. While PlayStation 3 games are not region-locked, PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games are only playable on PlayStation 3 consoles from the same region.\n\nA third successor, the PlayStation 4, was announced by Sony on 20 February 2013 and was released in the US on 15 November, Europe on 29 November 2013, and Japan and Asia on 22 February 2014. However, it is backwards compatible with select PS3 Games through a download service dubbed PlayStation Now.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable, or PSP, is a handheld game console first released in late 2004. The PSP is capable of playing PlayStation games downloaded via Sony's online store, and can also play any PlayStation game by using the PlayStation 3's remote play feature while the disc is in the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe successor to the PSP, the PlayStation Vita, was introduced as a part of the 8th generation of video game consoles, and is backwards compatible with original PSP as well as original PlayStation games downloaded from the PlayStation Store.\n\nSony Computer Entertainment was an upstart in the video game industry in late 1994, as the early 1990s were dominated by Nintendo and Sega. Nintendo had been the clear leader in the video game industry since the introduction of the NES in 1985 and the Nintendo 64 was initially expected to maintain this position for Nintendo. The PlayStation's target audience included 15- to 17-year-olds who were not the primary focus of Nintendo, and 18- to 29-year-olds, who represented the first generation to grow up playing video games. By the late 1990s, Sony became a highly regarded console brand due to the PlayStation, with a significant lead over second-place Nintendo, while Sega was relegated to a distant third.\n\nThe PlayStation's lead in installed base and developer support paved the way for the success of the next-generation PlayStation 2, which overcame an early launch from the Sega Dreamcast and then fended off competition from the Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube.\n\nThe success of the PlayStation is widely believed to have influenced the demise of the cartridge-based home console. While not the first system to utilise an optical disc format, it is the first highly successful one, and ended up going head-to-head with the last major home console to rely on proprietary cartridges—the Nintendo 64. Sony Computer Entertainment president Teruhisa Tokunaka remarked in 1996: \n\nNintendo was very public about its scepticism toward using CDs and DVDs to store games, citing longer load times and durability issues. It was widely speculated that the company was even more concerned with the proprietary cartridge format's ability to help enforce copy protection, given its substantial reliance on licensing and exclusive titles for its revenue. Piracy was rampant on the PlayStation due to the relative ease of the installation of a modchip, allowing the PlayStation to play games region free and/or recorded on a regular CD-R, making the console very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers.\n\nThe increasing complexity of games (in content, graphics, and sound) pushed cartridges to their storage limits and this gradually turned off some third-party developers. Part of the CD format's appeal to publishers was that they could be produced at a significantly lower cost and offered more production flexibility to meet demand. As a result, some third-party developers switched to the PlayStation, such as Squaresoft, whose \"Final Fantasy VII\", and Enix (later merged with Squaresoft to create Square Enix), whose \"Dragon Quest VII\" titles were initially pre-planned for the N64; while some who remained released fewer games to the Nintendo 64 (Konami, releasing only thirteen N64 games but over fifty on the PlayStation). While new games were coming out rapidly for the PlayStation, new Nintendo 64 game releases were less frequent and that system's biggest successes were developed by either Nintendo itself or by second-parties, such as Rare. The lower production costs also allowed publishers an additional source of profit: budget-priced reissues of titles which had already recouped their development costs.\n",
                "1995–96 in English football\n\nThe 1995–96 season was the 116th season of competitive football in England.\n\nNewcastle United were at one stage twelve points clear of Manchester United at the top of the table, but Alex Ferguson's relatively young and inexperienced side overhauled them during the second half of the season to win the title. Manchester United were England's entrants for the Champions League, while Newcastle United were joined in the UEFA Cup by Liverpool, the League Cup winners Aston Villa and Arsenal.\n\nThe teams relegated were Manchester City, Queens Park Rangers and Bolton Wanderers.\n\nSunderland and Derby County returned to the Premiership after a five-year exile, joined by Division One play-off winners Leicester City.\n\nWatford and Luton Town, who had both been established top division sides a decade earlier, were relegated to the league's third tier. On the last day of the season they were joined by Millwall, who had been top of the division five months earlier but slumped dramatically after Mick McCarthy's departure for the Republic of Ireland manager's job.\n\nSwindon Town returned to Division One at the first attempt after lifting the Division Two championship trophy. They were joined by runners-up Oxford United, who were enjoying their first successful season since the mid-1980s, and playoff winners Bradford City.\n\nGoing down were Carlisle United, Swansea City (who got through five managers in a season), Brighton & Hove Albion (sinking further into a financial crisis) and Hull City.\n\nPreston North End, Gillingham, Bury and playoff winners Plymouth Argyle won promotion to Division Two. Preston's win made them the third club to win all four top tiers of English football, next to Wolverhampton Wanderers and Burnley.\n\nTorquay United finished at the bottom of Division Three, having won just five games all season, but were saved from demotion because Conference champions Stevenage Borough did not meet the league's required minimum stadium capacity.\n\nAlex Ferguson guided Manchester United to a unique second double of the league title and FA Cup.\n\nBrian Little guided Aston Villa to victory in the League Cup as well as a fourth-place finish in the Premiership.\n\nPeter Reid brought some long-awaited success to Sunderland as they finished champions of Division One and won promotion to the Premiership.\n\nExperienced manager Jim Smith achieved another managerial success by winning promotion to the Premiership with Derby County.\n\nMartin O'Neill achieved his third promotion in four seasons by winning promotion to the Premiership with Leicester City.\n\nSteve McMahon succeeded in getting Swindon Town back into Division One at the first attempt as they were crowned champions of Division Two.\n\nDenis Smith built on the success he achieved earlier in his career (with York City and later Sunderland) by gaining promotion to Division One with Oxford United.\n\nGary Peters had a dream start to his reign as Preston North End manager as they were crowned champions of Division Three.\n\nStan Ternent finally enjoyed some success in his long management and coaching career by winning promotion to Division Two with Bury.\n\nNeil Warnock achieved the fifth promotion of his managerial career (and his fourth via the playoffs) by winning the Division Three playoffs with Plymouth Argyle.\n\nChris Kamara got Bradford City promoted via the Division 2 play offs just 6 months after taking over as manager. The feat was all the more amazing considering they lost 0-2 at home to Blackpool in the 1st leg of the play off semi final. A 3-0 victory in the 2nd leg saw Bradford City reach Wembley for the first ever time defeating Notts County 2-0 in the final with goals from 19-year-old local boy Des Hamilton and Kamara's first signing Mark Stallard.\n\nTony Pulis guided Gillingham F.C.out of Division Three and was named the Manager of the Season.\n\nAlan Shearer topped the Premiership scoring charts with 31 goals, the highest number of goals in the league charted at the time. Shearer was followed closely by Robbie Fowler on 28, Ian Wright and Les Ferdinand, who won the PFA Players' Player of the Year award.\n\nSteve McManaman led the assists chart with 25 assists this season, also a new record for the league.\n\nEric Cantona was awarded the FWA Footballer of the Year for his comeback and galvanising influence over a successful young Manchester United side.\n\nManchester United made history as the first English club to win the double of the league title and FA Cup twice. They did so despite having sold key players Paul Ince, Mark Hughes and Andrei Kanchelskis before the start of the season. Manager Alex Ferguson selected young players like Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt, David Beckham, Gary Neville and Phil Neville, alongside more experienced players Steve Bruce, Gary Pallister and Eric Cantona. Cantona, who returned from his suspension to spearhead United's chase for trophies, was voted the FWA Footballer of the Year.\n\nAt Christmas, United trailed Newcastle United by 12 points. On 27 December they beat Newcastle 2–0 to cut the gap to seven points, and a 1–0 win at St. James' Park on 4 March cut the gap to a single point. A 1–0 win against Tottenham Hotspur on 24 March put United on top of the Premiership and they remained in that position for the rest of the season. On the final day of the season they confirmed their status as Premiership champions for the third time in four seasons thanks to a 3-0 away win over Middlesbrough, who were managed by former United captain Bryan Robson.\n\nOn 11 May, United faced Liverpool in the FA Cup final at Wembley. A late goal from Cantona saw United make history and lift the FA Cup as England's first 'double double' winners.\n\nTerry Venables announced in January that he would not be continuing as England manager after the 1996 European Championships, so the FA began their hunt for his successor. The likes of Alex Ferguson, Howard Kendall, Steve Coppell, Gerry Francis and Kevin Keegan were all linked with the job, but all quickly ruled themselves out either because of club commitments or a lack of experience.\n\nIn the end, the 39-year-old Chelsea manager Glenn Hoddle agreed to take charge of the England team on a four-year contract. Hoddle's successor at Chelsea was the 33-year-old Dutch legend Ruud Gullit.\n\nIn 1996 England hosted the European Championships for the first time. They went through to the quarter-finals after drawing with Switzerland and beating Scotland and the Netherlands in the group stages. They drew 0-0 with Spain in the quarter finals but England went through on penalties. A goal by Alan Shearer gave them an early lead over Germany in the semi-finals, but the Germans forced extra-time and England lost the ensuing penalty shoot-out. Germany went on to beat Czech Republic 2-1 in the final.\n\nEnglish clubs endured a tough time in European competition during the 1995-96 season. Manchester United, Liverpool and Leeds United suffered early exits from the UEFA Cup, while Blackburn Rovers were eliminated from the Champions League at the group stages and Everton were dumped out of the Cup Winners Cup in the Second Round. That left Nottingham Forest as the only English club still in Europe after Christmas.\n\nForest took on Bayern Munich in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals and lost 2-1 away in the first leg. Jürgen Klinsmann scored twice as the German side defeated Forest 5–1 at the City ground and went on to win the competition.\n\nA legal challenge in the European Court of Human Rights by the Belgian midfielder Jean-Marc Bosman gave out-of-contract players aged 23 or above the right to become free agents and move to other clubs for no fee. There was widespread controversy following the announcement, as many clubs feared that they would lose expensively signed players for nothing. The Bosman ruling also saw an end to the \"three foreigner\" rule which restricted teams to fielding a maximum of three players born outside the country that they were employed in. In the Premiership, the limit of three foreigners in a match squad had covered Welsh, Scottish and Northern and Southern Irish players. The Bosman ruling allowed clubs in EU countries to field an unlimited number of players who were of EU nationalities, although they were still restricted to fielding 3 players of non-EU nationalities.\n\nAs England was hosting the 1996 UEFA European Football Championship the English national team did not play any competitive fixtures up until the championships themselves but played a number of friendlies this season.\n\n\nManchester United were Premiership champions for the third time in four seasons, after Newcastle United led for most of the season, the Tyneside club's lead having peaked at 10 points just before Christmas. United also won the FA Cup to complete the double. The star of their season was undoubtedly striker Eric Cantona, who returned from his eight-month suspension at the beginning of October to spearhead United's attack with 19 goals in all competitions, several of them in crucial late season games as they took the initiative in the title race, and the last being the winning goal in the FA Cup final.\n\nLiverpool continued to show signs of a return to their former glory by finishing third and ending the season as runners-up in the FA Cup final. Aston Villa, enjoying a revival with a reshaped squad under Brian Little, finished fourth and won the Football League Cup. Arsenal built the foundations for a revival under new manager Bruce Rioch by finishing fifth and coming within a goal of reaching the League Cup final. However, their Rioch was gone by the start of the following season after a dispute with the club's directors.\n\nFA Cup winners Everton failed to retain the cup and finished in sixth place in the league one place outside of a UEFA Cup place.\n\nBlackburn Rovers failed to retain their league title and finished seventh in the league, with Alan Shearer finding the net more than 30 times for the third season in a row.\n\nNottingham Forest finished ninth in the league and were the only English side to progress to the last eight of any of the European competitions doing so in reaching the quarter-final UEFA Cup. 1995-96 was indeed one of the worst seasons ever for English clubs in European competitions.\n\nBolton Wanderers, Queens Park Rangers and Manchester City were relegated, while Coventry City and Southampton stayed up on goal difference.\n\nLeading goalscorer: Alan Shearer (Blackburn Rovers) - 31\n\nSunderland gave their best performance in years by clinching the Division One title, and were joined among the elite by runners-up Derby County and play-off winners Leicester City. Crystal Palace conceded a last-minute Leicester winner at Wembley, and would have gone up automatically had it not been for their dismal first half of the season.\n\nLuton Town, Watford and Millwall, who had all played in the top flight at some stage in the last nine seasons, went down to Division Two. Millwall had been top of the league five months before going down on the final day of the season before a 6-0 defeat at Sunderland signaled a dramatic decline in their fortunes.\n\nOldham Athletic narrowly avoided a second relegation in three seasons, while Wolverhampton Wanderers finished 20th and the last safe place was secured by Portsmouth. Norwich City and Birmingham City finished in the bottom half of the table after both enjoying spells at the top during the first half of the season. West Bromwich Albion finished 12th after a dramatic season where they had looked like promotion contenders in the autumn, before enduring a 14-match winless run where they picked up just one point and dropped into the relegation zone.\n\nLeading goalscorer: John Aldridge (Tranmere Rovers) - 27\n\nSwindon Town secured an immediate return to Division One by winning the Division Two title. They were joined by local rivals and runners-up Oxford United, while the final promotion place went to playoff winners Bradford City whose Wembley glory gave Chris Kamara a dream start in management. \n\nBlackpool, who missed out on automatic promotion by one place, attained their highest league finish for more than 20 years but a playoff semi-final failure cost them a place in Division One and cost Sam Allardyce his job. Crewe Alexandra were defeated in the playoffs for the second season running, while beaten finalists Notts County had been relegated the season before.\n\nCarlisle United, Swansea City, Brighton & Hove Albion and Hull City were relegated to Division Three. York City, who made headlines by knocking Manchester United out of the League Cup early in the season, avoided relegation by three points after beating Brighton in their delayed final fixture of the season, sending Carlisle down.\n\nLeading goalscorer: Marcus Stewart (Bristol Rovers) - 21\n\nPreston North End got on the right path towards better days by sealing the Division Three title. Joining them in Division Two were runners-up Gillingham (after seven years in the league's basement division), third placed Bury and playoff winners Plymouth Argyle.\n\nTorquay United finished at the bottom of the league by quite a margin, but avoided relegation because Conference champions Stevenage Borough did not meet the required Football League stadium capacity standards. Scarborough endured another torrid season, finishing second from bottom in the league for the second season in succession.\n\nLincoln City climbed up to 18th place under John Beck, who took over in October after the club had propped up the Football League. Fulham suffered the lowest finish of their history by finishing 17th, and weeks before the end of the season they appointed Micky Adams as player-manager in hope that the former Coventry and Southampton defender could revive the club after a decade of decline. Cambridge United finished 16th in the table, a mere four years after narrowly missing out on promotion to the inaugural Premier League.\n\nLeading goalscorers: Steve White (Hereford United) - 30\n\n30 June 1995: Tottenham Hotspur paid a club-record £4.5 million for striker Chris Armstrong from relegated Crystal Palace.\n\n1 July 1995: Nottingham Forest paid a club-record £2.5 million for Sheffield Wednesday midfielder Chris Bart-Williams, the day they sold striker Stan Collymore to Liverpool for a national-record £8.5 million.

                "Sega Saturn\n\nThe Sega Saturn is a 32-bit fifth-generation home video game console that was developed by Sega and released on November 22, 1994 in Japan, May 11, 1995 in North America, and July 8, 1995 in Europe. The successor to the successful Sega Genesis, the Saturn has a dual-CPU architecture and eight processors. Its games are in CD-ROM format, and its game library contains several arcade ports as well as original games.\n\nDevelopment of the Saturn began in 1992, the same year Sega's groundbreaking 3D Model 1 arcade hardware debuted. Designed around a new CPU from Japanese electronics company Hitachi, another video display processor was incorporated into the system's design in early 1994 to better compete with Sony's forthcoming PlayStation. The Saturn was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell in large numbers in the United States after its surprise May 1995 launch, four months before its scheduled release date. After the debut of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., where it was discontinued in 1998. Having sold 9.26 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series, known in development as \"Sonic X-treme\", has been considered a factor in the console's poor performance.\n\nAlthough the Saturn is remembered for several well-regarded games, including \"Nights into Dreams\", the \"Panzer Dragoon\" series, and the \"Virtua Fighter\" series, its reputation is mixed due to its complex hardware design and limited third-party support. Sega's management has been criticized for its decision-making during the system's development and discontinuation.\n\nReleased in 1988, the Genesis (known as the Mega Drive in Europe and Japan) was Sega's entry into the fourth generation of video game consoles. In mid-1990, Sega CEO Hayao Nakayama hired Tom Kalinske as president and CEO of Sega of America. Kalinske developed a four-point plan for sales of the Genesis: lower the price of the console, create a U.S.-based team to develop games targeted at the American market, continue aggressive advertising campaigns, and sell \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" with the console. The Japanese board of directors initially disapproved of the plan, but all four points were approved by Nakayama, who told Kalinske, \"I hired you to make the decisions for Europe and the Americas, so go ahead and do it.\" Magazines praised \"Sonic\" as one of the greatest games yet made, and Sega's console finally took off as customers who had been waiting for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) decided to purchase a Genesis instead. However, the release of a CD-based add-on for the Genesis, the Sega CD (known as Mega-CD outside of North America), had been commercially disappointing.\n\nSega also experienced success with arcade games. In 1992 and 1993, the company's new Sega Model 1 arcade system board showcased Sega AM2's \"Virtua Racing\" and \"Virtua Fighter\" (the first 3D fighting game), which played a crucial role in popularizing 3D polygonal graphics. In particular, \"Virtua Fighter\" garnered praise for its simple three-button control scheme, with strategy coming from the intuitively observed differences between characters that felt and acted differently rather than the more ornate combos of two-dimensional competitors. Despite its crude visuals—with characters composed of fewer than 1,200 polygons—\"Virtua Fighter\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s fluid animation and relatively realistic depiction of distinct fighting styles gave its combatants a lifelike presence considered impossible to replicate with sprites. The Model 1 was an expensive system board, and bringing home releases of its games to the Genesis required more than its hardware could handle. Several alternatives helped to bring Sega's newest arcade games to the console, such as the Sega Virtua Processor chip used for \"Virtua Racing\", and eventually the Sega 32X add-on.\n\nDevelopment of the Saturn was supervised by Hideki Sato, Sega's director and deputy general manager of research and development. According to Sega project manager Hideki Okamura, the Saturn project started over two years before the system was showcased at the Tokyo Toy Show in June 1994. The name \"Saturn\" was the system's codename during development in Japan, but was chosen as the official product name. \"Computer Gaming World\" in March 1994 reported a rumor that \"the Sega \"Saturn\" ... will release in Japan before the end of the year\" for $250-300.\n\nIn 1993, Sega and Japanese electronics company Hitachi formed a joint venture to develop a new CPU for the Saturn, which resulted in the creation of the \"SuperH RISC Engine\" (or SH-2) later that year. The Saturn was designed around a dual-SH2 configuration. According to Kazuhiro Hamada, Sega's section chief for Saturn development during the system's conception, \"the SH-2 was chosen for reasons of cost and efficiency. The chip has a calculation system similar to a DSP [digital signal processor], but we realized that a single CPU would not be enough to calculate a 3D world.\" Although the Saturn's design was largely finished before the end of 1993, reports in early 1994 of the technical capabilities of Sony's upcoming PlayStation console prompted Sega to include another video display processor (VDP) to improve the system's 2D performance and texture-mapping. CD-ROM-based and cartridge-only versions of the Saturn hardware were considered for simultaneous release during the system's development, but this idea was discarded due to concerns over the lower quality and higher price of cartridge-based games.\n\nAccording to Kalinske, Sega of America \"fought against the architecture of Saturn for quite some time\". Seeking an alternative graphics chip for the Saturn, Kalinske attempted to broker a deal with Silicon Graphics, but Sega of Japan rejected the proposal. Silicon Graphics subsequently collaborated with Nintendo on the Nintendo 64. Kalinske, Sony Electronic Publishing's Olaf Olafsson, and Sony America's Micky Schulhof had discussed development of a joint \"Sega/Sony hardware system\", which never came to fruition due to Sega's desire to create hardware that could accommodate both 2D and 3D visuals and Sony's competing notion of focusing on 3D technology. Publicly, Kalinske defended the Saturn's design: \"Our people feel that they need the multiprocessing to be able to bring to the home what we're doing next year in the arcades.\"\n\nIn 1993, Sega restructured its internal studios in preparation for the Saturn's launch. To ensure high-quality 3D games would be available early in the Saturn's life, and to create a more energetic working environment, developers from Sega's arcade division were asked to create console games. New teams, such as \"Panzer Dragoon\" developer Team Andromeda, were formed during this time.\n\nIn January 1994, Sega began to develop an add-on for the Genesis, the Sega 32X, which would serve as a less expensive entry into the 32-bit era. The decision to create the add-on was made by Nakayama and widely supported by Sega of America employees. According to former Sega of America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that the Saturn would not be available until after 1994 and that the recently released Atari Jaguar would reduce Sega's hardware sales. As a result, Nakayama ordered his engineers to have the system ready for launch by the end of the year. The 32X would not be compatible with the Saturn, but Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis games, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn. This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the more expensive Saturn. According to Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller, the 32X served a role in assisting development teams to familiarize themselves with the dual SH-2 architecture also used in the Saturn. Because both machines shared many of the same parts and were preparing to launch around the same time, tensions emerged between Sega of America and Sega of Japan when the Saturn was given priority.\n\nSega released the Saturn in Japan on November 22, 1994, at a price of JP¥44,800. \"Virtua Fighter\", a faithful port of the popular arcade game, sold at a nearly one-to-one ratio with the Saturn console at launch and was crucial to the system's early success in Japan. The only other first-party game available on launch day was \"Wan Chai Connection\". Sega had wanted the launch to include both \"Clockwork Knight\" and \"Panzer Dragoon\", but the latter was not ready in time. Fueled by the popularity of \"Virtua Fighter\", Sega's initial shipment of 200,000 Saturn units sold out on the first day. Sega waited until the December 3 launch of the PlayStation to ship more units; when both were sold side-by-side, the Saturn proved to be the more popular system. Meanwhile, Sega released the 32X on November 21, 1994 in North America, December 3, 1994 in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at less than half of the Saturn's launch price. After the holiday season, however, interest in the 32X rapidly declined. 500,000 Saturn units were sold in Japan by the end of 1994 (compared to 300,000 PlayStation units), and sales exceeded 1 million within the following six months. There were conflicting reports that the PlayStation enjoyed a higher sell-through rate, and the system gradually began to overtake the Saturn in sales during 1995. Sony attracted many third-party developers to the PlayStation with a liberal $10 licensing fee, excellent development tools, and the introduction of a 7- to 10-day order system that allowed publishers to meet demand more efficiently than the 10- to 12-week lead times for cartridges that had previously been standard in the Japanese video game industry.\n\nIn March 1995, Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske announced that the Saturn would be released in the U.S. on \"Saturnday\" (Saturday) September 2, 1995.<ref name=\"Saturnday/1:1\"></ref> However, Sega of Japan mandated an early launch to give the Saturn an advantage over the PlayStation. At the first Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) in Los Angeles on May 11, 1995, Kalinske gave a keynote presentation in which he revealed the release price of US$399 (including a copy of \"Virtua Fighter\"), and described the features of the console. Kalinske also revealed that, due to \"high consumer demand\", Sega had already shipped 30,000 Saturns to Toys \"R\" Us, Babbage's, Electronics Boutique, and Software Etc. for immediate release. The announcement upset retailers who were not informed of the surprise release, including Best Buy and Walmart; KB Toys responded by dropping Sega from its lineup. Sony subsequently unveiled the retail price for the PlayStation: Sony Computer Entertainment America president Steve Race took the stage, said \"$299\", and then walked away to applause. The Saturn's release in Europe also came before the previously announced North American date, on July 8, 1995, at a price of ₤399.99. European retailers and press did not have time to promote the system or its games, harming sales. After the PlayStation's European launch on September 29, it had already outsold the Saturn by a factor of three in the United Kingdom by early November 1995, where it was reported that Sony allocated ₤20 million to market the system during the holiday season compared to Sega's ₤4 million.\n\nThe Saturn's U.S. launch was accompanied by a reported $50 million advertising campaign that included coverage in publications such as \"Wired\" and \"Playboy\". Early advertising for the system was targeted at a more mature, adult audience than the Sega Genesis ads. Because of the early launch, the Saturn had only six games (all published by Sega) available to start as most third-party games were slated to be released around the original launch date. \"Virtua Fighter\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s relative lack of popularity in the West, combined with a release schedule of only two games between the surprise launch and September 1995, prevented Sega from capitalizing on the Saturn's early timing. Within two days of its September 9, 1995 launch in North America, the PlayStation (backed by a large marketing campaign) sold more units than the Saturn had in the five months following its surprise launch, with almost all of the initial shipment of 100,000 units being presold in advance, and the rest selling out across the U.S.\n\nA high-quality port of the Namco arcade game \"Ridge Racer\" contributed to the PlayStation's early success, and garnered favorable comparisons in the media to the Saturn version of Sega's \"Daytona USA\", which was considered inferior to its arcade counterpart. Namco, a longtime arcade competitor with Sega, also unveiled the Namco System 11 arcade board, based on raw PlayStation hardware. Although the System 11 was technically inferior to Sega's Model 2 arcade board, its lower price made it attractive to smaller arcades. Following a 1994 acquisition of Sega developers, Namco released \"Tekken\" for the System 11 and PlayStation. Directed by former \"Virtua Fighter\" designer Seiichi Ishii, \"Tekken\" was intended to be fundamentally similar, with the addition of detailed textures and twice the frame rate. \"Tekken\" surpassed \"Virtua Fighter\" in popularity due to its superior graphics and nearly arcade-perfect console port, becoming the first million-selling PlayStation game. On October 2, 1995 Sega announced a Saturn price reduction to $299. Moreover, high-quality Saturn ports of the Sega Model 2 arcade hits \"Sega Rally Championship\", \"Virtua Cop\", and \"Virtua Fighter 2\" (running at 60 frames per second at a high resolution) were available by the end of the year, and were generally regarded as superior to competitors on the PlayStation. Notwithstanding a subsequent increase in Saturn sales during the 1995 holiday season, these games were not enough to reverse the PlayStation's decisive lead. By 1996, the PlayStation had a considerably larger library than the Saturn, although Sega hoped to generate increased interest in the Saturn with upcoming exclusives such as \"Nights into Dreams\". An informal survey of retailers showed that the Saturn and PlayStation sold in roughly equal numbers during the first quarter of 1996. Within its first year, the PlayStation secured over 20% of the entire U.S. video game market. On the first day of the May 1996 E3 show, Sony announced a PlayStation price reduction to $199, a reaction to the release of the Model 2 Saturn in Japan at a price roughly equivalent to $199. On the second day, Sega announced it would match this price, though Saturn hardware was more expensive to manufacture.\n\nIn spite of the launch of the PlayStation and the Saturn, sales of 16-bit hardware/software continued to account for 64% of the video game market in 1995. Sega underestimated the continued popularity of the Genesis, and did not have the inventory to meet demand for the product. Sega was able to capture 43% of the dollar share of the U.S. video game market and sell more than 2 million Genesis units in 1995, but Kalinske estimated that \"we could have sold another 300,000 Genesis systems in the November/December timeframe.\" Nakayama's decision to focus on the Saturn over the Genesis, based on the systems' relative performance in Japan, has been cited as the major contributing factor in this miscalculation.\n\nDue to long-standing disagreements with Sega of Japan, Kalinske lost most of his interest in his work as CEO of Sega of America. By the spring of 1996, rumors were circulating that Kalinske planned to leave Sega, and a July 13 article in the press reported speculation that Sega of Japan was planning significant changes to Sega of America's management team. On July 16, 1996, Sega announced that Shoichiro Irimajiri had been appointed chairman and CEO of Sega of America, while Kalinske would be leaving Sega after September 30 of that year. A former Honda executive, Irimajiri had been actively involved with Sega of America since joining Sega in 1993. Sega also announced that David Rosen and Nakayama had resigned from their positions as chairman and co-chairman of Sega of America, though both men remained with the company. Bernie Stolar, a former executive at Sony Computer Entertainment of America, was named Sega of America's executive vice president in charge of product development and third-party relations. Stolar, who had arranged a six-month PlayStation exclusivity deal for \"Mortal Kombat 3\" and helped build close relations with Electronic Arts while at Sony, was perceived as a major asset by Sega officials. Finally, Sega of America made plans to expand its PC software business.\n\nStolar was not supportive of the Saturn due to his belief that the hardware was poorly designed, and publicly announced at E3 1997 that \"The Saturn is not our future.\" While Stolar had \"no interest in lying to people\" about the Saturn's prospects, he continued to emphasize quality games for the system, and subsequently reflected that \"we tried to wind it down as cleanly as we could for the consumer.\" At Sony, Stolar opposed the localization of certain Japanese PlayStation games that he felt would not represent the system well in North America, and advocated a similar policy for the Saturn during his time at Sega, although he later sought to distance himself from this perception. These changes were accompanied by a softer image that Sega was beginning to portray in its advertising, including removing the \"Sega!\" scream and holding press events for the education industry. Marketing for the Saturn in Japan also changed with the introduction of \"Segata Sanshiro\" (played by Hiroshi Fujioka) as a character in a series of TV advertisements starting in 1997; the character would eventually star in a Saturn video game.\n\nTemporarily abandoning arcade development, Sega AM2 head Yu Suzuki began developing several Saturn-exclusive games, including a role-playing game in the \"Virtua Fighter\" series. Initially conceived as an obscure prototype \"The Old Man and the Peach Tree\" and intended to address the flaws of contemporary Japanese RPGs (such as poor non-player character artificial intelligence routines), \"Virtua Fighter RPG\" evolved into a planned 11-part, 45-hour \"revenge epic in the tradition of Chinese cinema\", which Suzuki hoped would become the Saturn's killer app. The game was eventually released as \"Shenmue\" for the Saturn's successor, the Dreamcast.\n\nAs Sonic Team was working on \"Nights into Dreams\", Sega tasked the U.S.-based Sega Technical Institute (STI) with developing what would have been the first fully 3D entry in its popular \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series. The game, \"Sonic X-treme\", was moved to the Saturn after several prototypes for other hardware (including the 32X) were discarded. It featured a fisheye lens camera system that rotated levels with Sonic's movement. After Nakayama ordered the game be reworked around the engine created for its boss battles, the developers were forced to work between 16 and 20 hours a day to meet their December 1996 deadline. Weeks of development time proved fruitless after Stolar rescinded STI's access to Sonic Team's \"Nights into Dreams\" engine following an ultimatum by \"Nights\" programmer Yuji Naka. After programmer Ofer Alon quit and designers Chris Senn and Chris Coffin became ill, the project was cancelled in early 1997. Sonic Team started work on an original 3D \"Sonic\" game for the Saturn, but development was shifted to the Dreamcast and the game became \"Sonic Adventure\". STI was disbanded in 1996 as a result of changes in management at Sega of America.\n\nJournalists and fans have speculated about the impact a completed \"X-treme\" might have had on the market. David Houghton of GamesRadar described the prospect of \"a good 3D \"Sonic\" game\" on the Saturn as \"a 'What if...' situation on a par with the dinosaurs not becoming extinct.\" IGN's Tavis Fahs called \"X-treme\" \"the turning point not only for Sega's mascot and their 32-bit console, but for the entire company\", but noted that the game served as \"an empty vessel for Sega's ambitions and the hopes of their fans\". Dave Zdyrko, who operated a prominent Saturn fan website during the system's lifespan, said: \"I don't know if [\"X-treme\"] could've saved the Saturn, but ... \"Sonic\" helped make the Genesis and it made absolutely no sense why there wasn't a great new \"Sonic\" title ready at or near the launch of the [Saturn]\". In a 2007 retrospective, producer Mike Wallis maintained that \"X-treme\" \"definitely would have been competitive\" with Nintendo's \"Super Mario 64\". By contrast, \"Next Generation\" reported in late 1996 that the game did not compare well to contemporary competition, and would have harmed Sega's reputation if it had been completed and released. Naka stated that he was relieved by the cancellation, as the game \"wasn't looking very good from my perspective\".\n\nFrom 1993 to early 1996, although Sega's revenue declined as part of an industry-wide slowdown, the company retained control of 38% of the U.S. video game market (compared to Nintendo's 30% and Sony's 24%). 800,000 PlayStation units were sold in the U.S. by the end of 1995, compared to 400,000 Saturn units. In part due to an aggressive price war, the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by two-to-one in 1996, while Sega's 16-bit sales declined markedly. By the end of 1996, the PlayStation had sold 2.9 million units in the U.S., more than twice the 1.2 million units sold by the Saturn. After the launch of the Nintendo 64 in 1996, sales of the Saturn and Sega's 32-bit software were sharply reduced, while the PlayStation outsold the Saturn by three-to-one in the U.S. market in 1997. The 1997 release of \"Final Fantasy VII\" significantly increased the PlayStation's popularity in Japan. As of August 1997, Sony controlled 47% of the console market, Nintendo controlled 40%, and Sega controlled only 12%. Neither price cuts nor high-profile game releases were proving helpful to the Saturn's success. Reflecting decreased demand for the system, worldwide Saturn shipments during March to September 1997 declined from 2.35 million to 600,000 versus the same period in 1996; shipments in North America declined from 800,000 to 50,000. Due to the Saturn's poor performance in North America, 60 of Sega of America's 200 employees were laid off in the fall of 1997.\n\nAs a result of the company's deteriorating financial situation, Nakayama resigned as president of Sega in January 1998 in favor of Irimajiri. Stolar would subsequently accede to president of Sega of America. Following five years of generally declining profits, in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998 Sega suffered its first parent and consolidated financial losses since its 1988 listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Due to a 54.8% decline in consumer product sales (including a 75.4% decline overseas), the company reported a net loss of ¥43.3 billion (US$327.8 million) and a consolidated net loss of ¥35.6 billion (US$269.8 million). Shortly before announcing its financial losses, Sega revealed that it was discontinuing the Saturn in North America, with the goal of preparing for the launch of its successor. Only 12 Saturn games were released in North America in 1998 (\"Magic Knight Rayearth\" being the final official release), compared to 119 in 1996. The Saturn would last longer in Japan and Europe. Rumors about the upcoming Dreamcast—spread mainly by Sega itself—were leaked to the public before the last Saturn games were released. The Dreamcast was released on November 27, 1998 in Japan and on September 9, 1999 in North America. The decision to abandon the Saturn effectively left the Western market without Sega games for over one year. Sega suffered an additional ¥42.881 billion consolidated net loss in the fiscal year ending March 1999, and the company announced plans to eliminate 1,000 jobs, or nearly one-fourth of its workforce.\n\nWorldwide Saturn sales include at least the following amounts in each territory: 5.75 million in Japan (surpassing the Genesis' sales of 3.58 million in the country), 1.8 million in the United States, 1 million in Europe, and 530,000 elsewhere. With lifetime sales of 9.26 million units, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure, although its install base in Japan surpassed the Nintendo 64's 5.54 million. Lack of distribution has been cited as a significant factor contributing to the Saturn's failure, as the system's surprise launch damaged Sega's reputation with key retailers. Conversely, Nintendo's long delay in releasing a 3D console and damage caused to Sega's reputation by poorly supported add-ons for the Genesis are considered major factors allowing Sony to gain a foothold in the market.\n\nFeaturing a total of eight processors the Saturn's main central processing units are two Hitachi SH-2 microprocessors clocked at 28.6 MHz and capable of 56 MIPS. The system contains a Motorola 68EC000 running at 11.3 MHz as a sound controller, a custom sound processor with an integrated Yamaha FH1 DSP running at 22.6 MHz capable of up to 32 sound channels with both FM synthesis and 16-bit PCM sampling at a maximum rate of 44.1 kHz, and two video display processors, the VDP1 (which handles sprites, textures and polygons) and the VDP2 (which handles backgrounds). Its double-speed CD-ROM drive is controlled by a dedicated Hitachi SH-1 processor to reduce load times. The Saturn's System Control Unit (SCU), which controls all buses and functions as a co-processor of the main SH-2 CPU, has an internal DSP running at 14.3 MHz. The Saturn contains a cartridge slot for memory expansion, 16 Mbit of work random-access memory (RAM), 12 Mbit of video RAM, 4 Mbit of RAM for sound functions, 4 Mbit of CD buffer RAM and 256 Kbit (32 KB) of battery backup RAM. Its video output, provided by a stereo AV cable, displays at resolutions from 320×224 to 704×224 pixels, and is capable of displaying up to 16.77 million colors simultaneously. Physically, the Saturn measures . The Saturn was sold packaged with an instruction manual, one control pad, a stereo AV cable, and its 100V AC power supply, with a power consumption of approximately 15W.\n\nThe Saturn had technically impressive hardware at the time of its release, but its complexity made harnessing this power difficult for developers accustomed to conventional programming. The greatest disadvantage was that both CPUs shared the same bus and were unable to access system memory at the same time. Making full use of the 4 kB of cache memory in each CPU was critical to maintaining performance. For example, \"Virtua Fighter\" used one CPU for each character, while \"Nights\" used one CPU for 3D environments and the other for 2D objects. The Saturn's Visual Display Processor 2 (VDP2), which can generate and manipulate backgrounds, has also been cited as one of the system's most important features.\n\nThe Saturn's design elicited mixed commentary among game developers and journalists. Developers quoted by \"Next Generation\" in December 1995 described the Saturn as \"a real coder's machine\" for \"those who love to get their teeth into assembly and really hack the hardware\", with \"more flexibility\" and \"more calculating power than the PlayStation\". The Saturn's sound board was also widely praised. By contrast, Lobotomy Software programmer Ezra Dreisbach described the Saturn as significantly slower than the PlayStation, whereas Kenji Eno of WARP observed little difference between the two systems. In particular, Dreisbach criticized the Saturn's use of quadrilaterals as its basic geometric primitive, in contrast to the triangles rendered by the PlayStation and the Nintendo 64. Ken Humphries of Time Warner Interactive remarked that compared to the PlayStation, the Saturn was markedly worse at generating polygons but markedly better at sprite-based graphics. Third-party development was initially hindered by the lack of useful software libraries and development tools, requiring developers to write in assembly language to achieve good performance. During early Saturn development, programming in assembly could offer a two-to-fivefold speed increase over higher-level languages like C. The Saturn hardware is considered extremely difficult to emulate. Sega responded to complaints about the difficulty of programming for the Saturn by writing new graphics libraries which were claimed to make development easier. Sega of America also purchased a United Kingdom-based development firm, Cross Products, to produce the Saturn's official development system. Despite these challenges, Treasure CEO Masato Maegawa stated that the Nintendo 64 was more difficult to develop for than the Saturn. Traveller's Tales' Jon Burton opined that while the PlayStation was easier \"to get started on ... you quickly reach [its] limits\", whereas the Saturn's \"complicated\" hardware had the ability to \"improve the speed and look of a game when all used together correctly.\" A major point of criticism was the Saturn's use of 2D sprites to generate polygons and simulate 3D space. The PlayStation functioned in a similar manner, but also featured a dedicated \"Geometry Transfer Engine\" that rendered additional polygons. As a result, several analysts described the Saturn as an \"essentially\" 2D system.\n\nSeveral models of the Saturn were produced in Japan. An updated model in a recolored light gray (officially white) was released in Japan at a price of ¥20,000 in order to reduce the system's cost and raise its appeal among women and younger children. Two models were released by third parties: Hitachi released a model known as the Hi-Saturn (a smaller Saturn model equipped with a car navigation function), while JVC released the V-Saturn. Saturn controllers came in various color schemes to match different models of the console. The system also supports several accessories. A wireless controller powered by AA batteries utilizes infrared signal to connect to the Saturn. Designed to work with \"Nights\", the Saturn 3D Pad includes both a control pad and an analog stick for directional input. Sega also released several versions of arcade sticks as peripherals, including the Virtua Stick, the Virtua Stick Pro, the Mission Analog Stick, and the Twin Stick. Sega also created a light gun peripheral known as the \"Virtua Gun\" for use with shooting games such as \"Virtua Cop\" and \"The Guardian\", as well as the Arcade Racer, a wheel for racing games. The Play Cable allows for two Saturn consoles to be connected for multiplayer gaming across two screens, while a multitap allows up to six players to play games on the same console. The Saturn was designed to support up to 12 players on a single console, by using two multitaps. RAM cartridges expand the amount of memory in the system. Other accessories include a keyboard, mouse, floppy disk drive, and movie card.\n\nLike the Genesis, the Saturn had an Internet-based gaming service. The Sega NetLink was a 28.8k modem that fit into the cartridge slot in the Saturn for direct dial multiplayer. In Japan, a now defunct pay-to-play service was used. It could also be used for web browsing, sending email, and online chat. Because the NetLink was released before the Saturn keyboard, Sega produced a series of CDs containing hundreds of website addresses so that Saturn owners could browse with the joypad. The NetLink functioned with five games: \"Daytona USA\", \"Duke Nukem 3D\", \"Saturn Bomberman\", \"Sega Rally\", and \"\". In 1995 Sega announced it was developing a variant of the Saturn featuring a built-in NetLink modem under the code name \"Sega Pluto\", but it was never released.\n\nSega developed an arcade board based on the Saturn's hardware, called the Sega ST-V (or Titan), which was intended as an affordable alternative to Sega's Model 2 arcade board as well as a testing ground for upcoming Saturn software. The Titan was criticized for its comparatively weak performance by Sega AM2's Yu Suzuki and was overproduced by Sega's arcade division. Because Sega already possessed the \"Die Hard\" license, members of Sega AM1 working at the Sega Technical Institute developed \"Die Hard Arcade\" for the Titan, in order to clear out excess inventory. This goal was achieved, as \"Die Hard\" became the most successful Sega arcade game produced in the United States at that point. Other games released for the Titan include \"\" and \"Virtua Fighter Kids\".\n\nMuch of the Saturn's library comes from Sega's arcade ports, including \"Daytona USA\", \"The House of the Dead\", \"Last Bronx\", \"Sega Rally Championship\", the \"Virtua Cop\" series, the \"Virtua Fighter\" series, and \"Virtual-On\". The Saturn ports of 2D Capcom fighting games including \"Darkstalkers 3\", \"Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter\", and \"Street Fighter Alpha 3\" were noted for their faithfulness to their arcade counterparts. \"Fighters Megamix\", developed by Sega AM2 for the Saturn rather than arcades, combined characters from \"Fighting Vipers\" and \"Virtua Fighter\" to positive reviews. Highly rated Saturn exclusives include \"Panzer Dragoon Saga\", \"Dragon Force\", \"Guardian Heroes\", \"Nights\", \"Panzer Dragoon II Zwei\", and \"Shining Force III\". Although originally made for the PlayStation, games such as \"\", \"Resident Evil\", and \"Wipeout 2097\" received Saturn ports with mixed results. \"Tomb Raider\" was created with the Saturn in mind, but the PlayStation version ultimately became better known to the public. Lobotomy Software's \"PowerSlave\" featured some of the most impressive 3D graphics on the system, leading Sega to contract the developer to produce Saturn ports of \"Duke Nukem 3D\" and \"Quake\". While Electronic Arts' limited support for the Saturn and Sega's failure to develop a football game for the 1996 fall season allowed Sony to take the lead in the sports genre, \"Sega Sports\" published Saturn sports games including the well-regarded \"World Series Baseball\" and \"Sega Worldwide Soccer\" series. With about 600 official releases, the Saturn's library is nearly twice as large as the Nintendo 64's.\n\nDue to the cancellation of \"Sonic X-treme\", the Saturn lacks an exclusive \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" platformer; instead it received a graphically enhanced port of the Genesis game \"Sonic 3D Blast\", the compilation \"Sonic Jam\", and a racing game, \"Sonic R\". The platformer \"Bug!\" received attention for its eponymous main character being a potential mascot for the Saturn, but it failed to catch on as the \"Sonic\" series had. Considered one of the most important Saturn releases, Sonic Team developed \"Nights into Dreams\", a score attack game that attempted to simulate both the joy of flying and the fleeting sensation of dreams. The gameplay of \"Nights\" involves steering the imp-like androgynous protagonist, Nights, as it flies on a mostly 2D plane across surreal stages broken into four segments each. The levels repeat for as long as an in-game time limit allows, while flying over or looping around various objects in rapid succession earns additional points. Although it lacked the fully 3D environments of Nintendo's \"Super Mario 64\", \"Nights\"<nowiki>'</nowiki> emphasis on unfettered movement and graceful acrobatic techniques showcased the intuitive potential of analog control. Sonic Team's \"Burning Rangers\", a fully 3D action-adventure game involving a team of outer-space firefighters, garnered praise for its transparency effects and distinctive art direction, but was released in limited quantities late in the Saturn's lifespan and criticized for its short length.\n\nSome of the games that made the Saturn popular in Japan, such as \"Grandia\" and the \"Sakura Wars\" series, never saw a Western release due to Sega of America's policy of not localizing RPGs and other Japanese games that might have damaged the system's reputation in North America. Despite appearing first on the Saturn, games such as \"Dead or Alive\", \"Grandia\", and \"\" only saw a Western release on the PlayStation. Working Designs localized several Japanese Saturn games before a public feud between Sega of America's Bernie Stolar and Working Designs president Victor Ireland resulted in the company switching their support to the PlayStation. \"Panzer Dragoon Saga\" was praised as perhaps the finest RPG for the system due to its cinematic presentation, evocative plot, and unique battle system—with a tactical emphasis on circling around opponents to identify weak points and the ability to \"morph\" the physical attributes of the protagonist's dragon companion during combat—but Sega released fewer than 20,000 retail copies of the game in North America in what IGN's Levi Buchanan characterized as one example of the Saturn's \"ignominious send-off\" in the region. Similarly, only the first of three installments of \"Shining Force III\" was released outside Japan. The Saturn's library also garnered criticism for its lack of sequels to high-profile Genesis-era Sega franchises, with Sega of Japan's cancellation of a planned third installment in Sega of America's popular \"Eternal Champions\" series cited as a significant source of controversy.\n\nLater ports of Saturn games including \"Guardian Heroes\", \"Nights\", and \"\" continued to garner positive reviews. Partly due to rarity, Saturn games such as \"Panzer Dragoon Saga\" and \"Radiant Silvergun\" have been noted for their cult following. Due to the system's commercial failure and hardware limitations, planned Saturn releases such as \"Resident Evil 2\", \"Shenmue\", \"Sonic Adventure\", and \"Virtua Fighter 3\" were cancelled and moved to the Dreamcast.\n\nAt the time of its release, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" awarded the Saturn console 24 out of 40 possible points, higher than the PlayStation's 19 out of 40. In June 1995, Dennis Lynch of the \"Chicago Tribune\" and Albert Kim of \"Entertainment Weekly\" both praised the Saturn as the most advanced gaming console available, with the former complimenting its double-speed CD-ROM drive and \"intense surround-sound capabilities\" and the latter citing \"Panzer Dragoon\" as a \"lyrical and exhilarating epic\" demonstrating the ability of new technology to \"transform\" the industry. In December 1995, \"Next Generation\" evaluated the system with three and a half stars out of a possible five, highlighting Sega's marketing and arcade background as strengths but the system's complexity as a weakness. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s December 1996 Buyer's Guide had four reviewers rate the Saturn 8, 6, 7, and 8 out of 10; these ratings were inferior to those of the PlayStation, which was scored 9, 10, 9, and 9 in the same review. By December 1998, \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s reviews were more mixed, with reviewers citing the lack of games for the system as a major issue. According to \"EGM\" reviewer Crispin Boyer, \"the Saturn is the only system that can thrill me one month and totally disappoint me the next.\"\n\nRetrospective feedback of the Saturn is mixed, but generally praises its game library. According to Greg Sewart of 1UP.com, \"the Saturn will go down in history as one of the most troubled, and greatest, systems of all time.\" In 2009, IGN chose the Saturn to be their 18th best video game console of all time, praising its unique game library. According to the reviewers, \"While the Saturn ended up losing the popularity contest to both Sony and Nintendo ... \"Nights into Dreams\", the \"Virtua Fighter\" and \"Panzer Dragoon\" series are all examples of exclusive titles that made the console a fan favorite.\" The staff of \"Edge\" noted \"hardened loyalists continue to reminisce about the console that brought forth games like \"Burning Rangers\", \"Guardian Heroes\", \"Dragon Force\" and \"Panzer Dragoon Saga\".\" In 2015, \"The Guardian\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Keith Stuart declared \"the Saturn has perhaps the strongest line up of 2D shooters and fighting games in console history.\" \"Retro Gamer\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s Damien McFerran stated \"Even today, despite the widespread availability of sequels and re-releases on other formats, the Sega Saturn is still a worthwhile investment for those who appreciate the unique gameplay styles of the companies that supported it.\" IGN's Adam Redsell wrote \"[Sega's] devil-may-care attitude towards game development in the Saturn and Dreamcast eras is something that we simply do not see outside of the indie scene today.\" Necrosoft Games director Brandon Sheffield expounded that \"The Saturn was a landing point for games that were too 'adult' in content for other systems, as it was the only one that allowed an 18+ rating for content in Japan ... some games, like \"Enemy Zero\" used it to take body horror to new levels, an important step toward the expansion of games and who they served.\" Sewart praised the Saturn's first-party games as \"Sega's shining moment as a game developer\", with Sonic Team demonstrating its creative range and AM2 producing numerous technically impressive arcade ports, but also commented on the many Japan-exclusive Saturn releases, which he connected with a subsequent boom in the game import market. IGN's Travis Fahs was critical of the Saturn library's lack of \"fresh ideas\" and \"precious few high-profile franchises\", in contrast to what he described as Sega's more creative Dreamcast output.\n\nCriticism has befallen Sega's management regarding both the creation and handling of the Saturn. McFerran criticizes Sega's management at the time of the Saturn's development, claiming that it had \"fallen out of touch with both the demands of the market and the industry\". Bernie Stolar has also been criticized for his decision to end support for the Saturn. According to Fahs, \"Stolar's decision to abandon the Saturn made him a villain to many Sega fans, but ... it was better to regroup than to enter the next fight battered and bruised. Dreamcast would be Stolar's redemption.\" Stolar has defended his decision, stating, \"I felt Saturn was hurting the company more than helping it. That was a battle that we weren't going to win.\" Sheffield stated that the Saturn's use of quadrilaterals undermined third-party support for the system, but because \"nVidia invested in quads\" at the same time there is \"a remote possibility\" they could have \"become the standard instead of triangles\"—\"if somehow, magically, the Saturn were the most popular console of that era.\" Speaking more positively of the system, former Working Designs president Victor Ireland described the Saturn as \"the start of the future of console gaming\" because it \"got the better developers thinking and designing with parallel-processing architecture in mind for the first time\". Writing for GamesRadar, Justin Towell noted that the Saturn's 3D Pad \"set the template for every successful controller that followed, with analog shoulder triggers and left thumbstick ... I don't see any three-pronged controllers around the office these days.\"\n\nDouglass C. Perry of Gamasutra notes that, from its surprise launch to its ultimate failure, the Saturn \"soured many gamers on Sega products.\" Sewart and IGN's Levi Buchanan cited the failure of the Saturn as the major reason for Sega's downfall as a hardware manufacturer, but USgamer's Jeremy Parish described the Saturn as \"more a symptom ... than a cause\" of the company's decline, which began with add-ons for the Genesis that fragmented the market and continued with Sega of America's and Sega of Japan's competing designs for the Dreamcast. Sheffield portrayed Sega's mistakes with the Saturn as emblematic of the broader decline of the Japanese gaming industry: \"They thought they were invincible, and that structure and hierarchy were necessary for their survival, but more flexibility, and a greater participation with the West could have saved them.\" According to Stuart, Sega \"didn't see ... the roots of a prevailing trend, away from arcade conversions and traditional role-playing adventures and toward a much wider console development community with fresh ideas about gameplay and structure.\" Pulp365 reviews editor Matt Paprocki concluded \"the Saturn is a relic, but an important one, which represents the harshness of progress and what it can leave in its wake\".\n\n",
                "List of commercial failures in video gaming\n\nAs a hit-driven business, the great majority of the video game industry's software releases have been commercial failures. In the early 21st century, industry commentators made these general estimates: 10% of published games generated 90% of revenue; that around 3% of PC games and 15% of console games have global sales of 100,000+ a year, with even this level insufficient to make high-budget titles profitable; and that about 20% of games make a profit.\n\nSome of these have drastically changed the video game market since its birth in the late 1970s. For example, the failures of \"E.T.\" and \"Pac-Man\" for the Atari 2600 contributed to the video game crash of 1983. Some games, despite being commercial failures, are well received by certain groups of gamers and are considered cult games. Many of these games live on through emulation.\n\nA commercial failure for a video game hardware platform is generally defined as a system that either fails to become adopted by a significant portion of the gaming marketplace or fails to win significant mindshare of the target audience, and may be characterized by significantly poor international sales and general financial unviability of development or support.\n\nCo-designed by R. J. Mical and the team behind the Amiga, and marketed by Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins, this \"multimedia machine\" released in 1993 was marketed as a family entertainment device and not just a video game console. Though it supported a vast library of games including many exceptional third party releases, a refusal to reduce pricing until almost the end of the product's life (699.95 USD at release) hampered sales.\nThe success of subsequent next generation systems led to the platform's demise and the company's exit from the hardware market. This exit also included The 3DO Company's sale of the platform's successor, the M2, to its investor Matsushita.\n\nIn 1990, Amstrad attempted to enter the console gaming market with hardware based on its successful Amstrad CPC range but also capable of playing cartridge-based games with improved graphics and sound. This comprised the Amstrad CPC+ computers, including the same features as the existing CPCs, and the dedicated GX4000 console. However, only a few months later the Mega Drive, a much-anticipated 16-bit console, was released in Europe, and the GX4000's aging 8-bit technology proved unable to compete. Many of the games were also direct ports of existing CPC games (available more cheaply on tape or disc) with few if any graphical improvements. Fewer than thirty games were released on cartridge, and the GX4000's failure ended Amstrad's involvement in the gaming industry. The CPC+ range fared little better, as 8-bit computers had been all but superseded by similarly priced 16-bit machines such as the Amiga, though software hacks now make the advanced console graphics and sound accessible to users.\n\nPippin is a game console designed by Apple Computer and produced by Bandai (now Bandai Namco) in the mid-1990s based around a PowerPC 603e processor and the Mac OS. It featured a 4x CD-ROM drive and a video output that could connect to a standard television monitor. Apple intended to license the technology to third parties; however, only two companies signed on, Bandai and Katz Media, while the only Pippin license to release a product to market was Bandai's. By the time the Bandai Pippin was released ( in Japan, in the United States), the market was already dominated by the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation. The Bandai Pippin also cost US$599 on launch, more expensive than the competition. Total sales were only around 30,000 units.\n\nThe Atari 5200 was created as the successor to the highly successful Atari 2600. Reasons for the console's poor reception include that most of the games were simply enhanced versions of those played on its predecessor and its awkward controller design. The console sold only a little over a million units. When it was discontinued, its predecessor would be marketed for several more years. The failure of the Atari 5200 marked the beginning of Atari's fall in the console business.\n\nReleased by Atari Corporation in 1993, this \"64-bit\" system was more powerful than its contemporaries, the Genesis and the Super NES (hence its \"Do the Math\" slogan); however, its sales were hurt by a lack of software and a number of crippling business practices on the part of Atari senior management. The controller was widely criticized as being too big and unwieldy, with a baffling number of buttons. The system never attained critical mass in the market before the release of the PlayStation and Sega Saturn, and without strong leadership to drive a recovery, it failed and brought the company down with it. Rob Bricken of Topless Robot described the Jaguar as \"an unfortunate system, beleaguered by software droughts, rushed releases, and a lot of terrible, terrible games.\"\n\nReleased in 1989 in North America and Europe; later in Japan in 1990 by Atari Corporation, The Lynx is an 8 bit handheld game console that holds the distinction of being the world's first handheld electronic game system with a color LCD. The Lynx was the second handheld game system to be released with the Atari name. The system was originally developed by Epyx as the Handy Game. The system is also notable for its forward-looking features, advanced graphics, and ambidextrous layout. In late 1991, it was reported that Atari sales estimates were about 800,000, which Atari claimed was within their expected projections. In comparison, the Game Boy sold 16 million units by later that year. Overall lifetime sales were confirmed as being in the region of 3 million, a commercial failure despite positive critical reviews. In 1996, Atari Corporation collapsed due to the failures of the Lynx and Jaguar consoles.\n\nThe Bally Astrocade is a second generation console created by Bally. It was released in 1977 but only through mail order. Due to weak sales, Bally quit the console business. Shortly afterward, another company purchased the rights to the console, and re-released it to weak sales again. Prominent games journalist Shaun Bradley described the Astrocade as \"Worse than The Room\".\n\nReleased only in Europe in 1990 and being Commodore International's first venture in the video game market, the C64GS was basically a Commodore 64 redesigned as a cartridge-based console. Aside from some hardware issues, the console did not get much attention from the public, who preferred to buy the cheaper original computer that had far more possibilities. Also, the console appeared just as the 16-bit era was starting, which left no chance for it to succeed as it was unable to compete with consoles like the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Mega Drive.\n\nThe CDTV was launched by Commodore in 1991. In common with the Philips CD-i and the 3DO, the CDTV was intended as an all-in-one home multimedia appliance that would play games, music, movies, and other interactive content. The name was short for \"Commodore Dynamic Total Vision\". The hardware was based on the Amiga computer with a single-speed CD-ROM drive rather than a floppy disk drive, in a case that was designed to integrate unobtrusively with a home entertainment center. However, the expected market for home multimedia appliances did not materialize, and the CDTV was discontinued in 1993, having sold only 30,000 units. Commodore's next attempt at a CD-based console, the Amiga CD32, was considerably more successful.\n\nThe digiBlast portable console was launched by Nikko at the end of 2005 and promised to be a cheap alternative (selling at approximately $117.86) to the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable. Cartridges for games, cartoon (\"Winx Club\", \"SpongeBob SquarePants\") episodes, and music videos were released on the handheld. A cartridge for MP3 playback and a cartridge with a 1.3-megapixel camera were released as add-ons. However, there was a shortage of chips around the release date and thereafter resulted in a failed launch and loss of consumer interest.\n\nThe Dreamcast, released globally in 1999, was Sega's final console before the company focused entirely on software. Although the console was initially successful and management in the company improved significantly after harsh lessons were learned from the Sega Saturn fiasco, the console also faced stiff competition from the technically superior PlayStation 2 despite being in the market months ahead. The Dreamcast sold less than the Saturn, coming in at 9.13 million units compared to the Saturn's 9.5 million. The console's development was subject to further stress by an economic recession that struck Japan shortly after the console's release, forcing Sega, among other companies, to cut costs to survive.\n\nThe Fairchild Channel F was a second generation console released in 1976, and the first home console unit to use interchangeable video game cartridges. When the Atari 2600, which also used cartridges, was released a year later, the console was completely overshadowed. Only 250,000 Channel F units were sold.\n\nThe FM Towns and FM Towns Marty are fourth and fifth generation consoles manufactured by Fujitsu. Throughout their few years in the market, both consoles sold an underwhelming 45,000 units.\n\nThe Gizmondo, a handheld gaming device featuring GPS and a digital camera, was released by Tiger Telematics in the United Kingdom on 19 March 2005. With poor promotion, few games (only fourteen were ever released), short battery life, a small screen, competition from the cheaper and more reputable Nintendo DS, digiBlast and PSP, and controversy surrounding the company, the system was a commercial failure. On 23 January 2006, the UK arm of Tiger Telematics went into administration. Several high-ranking Tiger executives were subsequently arrested for fraud and other illegal activities related to the Gizmondo. It is so far the world's worst selling handheld console in history, and due to its failure in the European and American video game markets, it was not released in Australia or Japan. Tiger Telematics went bankrupt when it was discontinued in February 2006, just 11 months after it was released.\n\nReleased in late 2006 by Mattel, the HyperScan was the company's first video game console since the Intellivision. It used radio frequency identification (RFID) along with traditional video game technology. The console used UDF format CD-ROMs. Games retailed for $19.99 and the console itself for $69.99 at launch, but at the end of its very short lifespan, prices of the system were down to $9.99, the games $1.99, and booster packs $0.99. The system was sold in two varieties, a cube, and a 2-player value pack. The cube box version was the version sold in stores. It included the system, controller, an X-Men game disc, and 6 X-Men cards. Two player value packs were sold online (but may have been liquidated in stores) and included an extra controller and 12 additional X-Men cards. The system was discontinued in 2007 due to poor console, game, and card pack sales. It is featured as one of the ten worst systems ever by \"PC World\" magazine.\n\nReleased in Japan and Europe in 1994 and a year later in North America, the Neo Geo CD was first unveiled at the 1994 Tokyo Toy Show. Three versions of the Neo Geo CD were released: a front-loading version, only distributed in Japan, with 25,000 total units built; a top-loading version, marketed worldwide, as the most common model; the Neo Geo CDZ, an upgraded, faster-loading version, released in Japan only. The front-loading version was the original console design, with the top-loading version developed shortly before the Neo Geo CD launch as a scaled-down, cheaper alternative model. The CDZ was released on December 29, 1995 as the Japanese market replacement for SNK's previous efforts (the \"\"front loader\"\" and the \"\"top loader\"\"). The Neo Geo CD had met with limited success due to it being plagued with slow loading times that could vary from 30 to 60 seconds between loads, depending on the game. Although SNK's American home entertainment division quickly acknowledged that the system simply was unable to compete with the 3D-able powerhouse systems of the day like Nintendo's 64, Sega's Saturn and Sony's PlayStation, SNK corporate of Japan felt they could continue to maintain profitable sales in the Japanese home market by shortening the previous system's load-times. Their Japanese division had produced an excess number of single speed units and found that modifying these units to double speed was more expensive than they had initially thought, so SNK opted to sell them as they were, postponing production of a double speed model until they had sold off the stock of single speed units. As of March 1997, the Neo Geo CD had sold 570,000 units worldwide. Although this was the last known home console released under SNK's Neo Geo line, the newly reincarnated SNK Playmore relaunched the Neo Geo line with the release of the Neo Geo X in 2012.\n\nThe two handheld video game consoles, created by SNK Playmore (formerly SNK Corporation), were released between 1998-99 through markets dominated by Nintendo. The Neo Geo Pocket is considered to be an unsuccessful console, as it was immediately succeeded by the Color, a full color device allowing the system to compete more easily with the dominant Game Boy Color handheld, and which also saw a western release. Though the system enjoyed only a short life, there were some significant games released on the system. After a good sales start in both the U.S. and Japan with 14 launch titles (a record at the time) subsequent low retail support in the U.S., lack of communication with third-party developers by SNK's American management, the craze about Nintendo's \"Pokémon\" franchise, anticipation of the 32-bit Game Boy Advance, as well as strong competition from Bandai's WonderSwan in Japan, led to a sales decline in both regions. Meanwhile, SNK had been in financial trouble for at least a year – the company soon collapsed, and was purchased by American pachinko manufacturer Aruze in January 2000. Eventually on June 13, 2000, Aruze decided to quit the North American and European markets, marking the end of SNK's worldwide operations and the discontinuation of Neo Geo hardware and software there. The Neo Geo Pocket Color (and other SNK/Neo Geo products) did however, last until 2001 in Japan. It was SNK's last video game console, as the company went bust on October 22, 2001. Despite these failures, the Neo Geo Pocket and Pocket Color had been regarded as influential systems. It also featured an arcade-style microswitched 'clicky stick' joystick, which was praised for its accuracy and being well-suited for fighting games. The Pocket Color system's display and 40-hour battery life were also well received. Although these were the last known systems released under SNK's Neo Geo line, the newly reincarnated SNK Playmore relaunched the Neo Geo line with the release of the Neo Geo X in 2012.\n\nA disk drive add-on and Internet appliance for the Nintendo 64, it was first announced at 1995's Nintendo Shoshinkai game show event (now called Nintendo World); however, the 64DD was delayed until its release in Japan on December 1, 1999. Nintendo, anticipating poor sales, sold the 64DD through its Randnet subscription service rather than directly to retailers or consumers. As a result, the 64DD was only supported by Nintendo for a short period of time and only nine games were released for it. Most 64DD games were either canceled entirely, released as normal Nintendo 64 cartridges, or ported to other systems such as Nintendo's next-generation GameCube. During its lifetime, of a total of 100k sets, 15,000 sets were sold worldwide, while 85,000 sets became scrap.\n\nMade by the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer Nokia, and released in 2003, the N-Gage is a small handheld console, designed to combine a feature-packed mobile/cellular phone with a handheld games console. The system was mocked for its taco-like design, and sales were so poor that the system's price dropped by $100 within a week after its release. Common complaints included the difficulty of swapping games and the fact that its cellphone feature required users to hold the device \"sideways\" (i.e. the long edge of the system) against their cheek. A redesigned version, the N-Gage QD, was released to eliminate these complaints. However, the N-Gage brand still suffered from a poor reputation and the QD did not address the popular complaint that the control layout was \"too cluttered.\" The N-Gage failed to reach the popularity of the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS, or the Sony PSP. In November 2005, Nokia announced the failure of its product, in light of poor sales (fewer than three million units sold during the platform's three-year run, against projections of six million), and while gaming software is still being produced for its Series 60 phones, Nokia ceased to consider gaming a corporate priority until 2007, when it expected improved screen sizes and quality to increase demand. However, Nokia's presence in the cell phone market was soon eclipsed by the iPhone and later Android phones, causing development to gravitate to them and sealing the fate of the N-Gage brand. In 2012, Nokia abandoned development on the Symbian OS which was the base for N-Gage and transitioned to the Windows Phone.\n\nThe Nuon was a DVD decoding chip from VM Labs that was also a fully programmable CPU with graphics and sound capabilities. The idea was that a manufacturer could use the chip instead of existing an MPEG-2 decoder, thus turning a DVD player into a game console. A year after launch only eight games were available. One game, \"Iron Soldier 3\", was recalled for not being compatible with all systems.\n\nThe Ouya is an Android based microconsole released in 2013. Even though the Ouya was a success on Kickstarter, the product was plagued by problems from the beginning. The console was very slow to ship and suffered hardware issues. On top of this, the console had a very limited library of games. The critical reception ranged from lukewarm to outright calling the console a 'scam'. Just two years after its release, the Ouya was in a dire financial situation and negotiated a buyout with Razer.\n\nThe PC-FX is the Japan-exclusive successor to the PC Engine, released by NEC in late 1994. Originally intended to compete with the Super Famicom and the Mega Drive, it instead wound up competing with the PlayStation, Sega Saturn, and Nintendo 64. The console's 32-bit architecture was created in 1992, and by 1994 it was outdated, largely due to the fact that it was unable to create 3D images, instead utilizing an architecture that relied on JPEG video. The PC-FX was severely underpowered compared to other fifth generation consoles and had a very low budget marketing campaign, with the system never managing to gain a foothold against its competition or a significant part of the marketshare. The PC-FX was discontinued in early 1998 so that NEC could focus on providing graphics processing units for the upcoming Sega Dreamcast. Around this time, NEC announced that they had only sold 100,000 units with a library of only 62 titles, most of which were dating sims.\n\nIn 1991, electronics company Philips entered the console gaming business by creating the \"Compact Disc Interactive\" console, better known as the \"CD-i\". Like the 3DO, the CD-i was marketed as not only a video game console, but also a multimedia console. Besides CD-i discs, the console was capable of playing Video CDs. The launch price was $700. It was originally intended to be an add-on for the Super NES, but the deal fell through. Nintendo, however, did give Philips the rights and permission to use five Nintendo characters for the CD-i games. In 1993, Philips released two Zelda games, \"\" and \"\". A year later, Philips released another Zelda game, \"Zelda's Adventure\", and a few months later, a Mario game titled \"Hotel Mario\". All four of these Nintendo-themed games are commonly cited by critics as being among the worst ever made. Much criticism was also aimed at the CD-i's controller. Although it was extensively marketed by Philips, consumer interest remained low. Sales began to slow by 1994, and in 1998, Philips announced that the product had been discontinued. In all, roughly 570,000 units were sold, with 133 games released.\n\nMade by the Pioneer LaserDisc Corporation in 1993 (a clone was produced by NEC as well), the LaserActive employed the trademark LaserDiscs as a medium for presenting games and also played the original LaserDisc movies. The LD-ROMs, as they were called, could hold 540 MB of data and up to 60 minutes of analog audio and video. In addition, expansion modules could be bought which allowed the LaserActive to play Genesis and/or TurboGrafx-16 games, among other things. Very poor marketing combined with a high price tag for both the console itself ($969 in 1993) and the various modules (e.g., $599 for the Genesis module compared to $89 for the base console and $229 for Sega CD add-on to play CD-ROM based games) caused it to be quickly ignored by both the gaming public and the gaming press. Less than 40 games were produced in all (at about $120 each), almost all of which required the purchase of one of the modules, and games built for one module could not be used with another. The LaserActive was quietly discontinued one year later after total sales of roughly 10,000 units.\n\nBuilt upon the PlayStation 2, the PSX enhanced multimedia derivative was touted to bring convergence to the living room in 2003 by including non-gaming features such as a DVD recorder, TV tuner, and multi-use hard drive. The device was considered a failure upon its Japanese release due to its high price and lack of consumer interest, which resulted in the cancellation of plans to release it in the rest of the world. Not only was it an unsuccessful attempt by Sony Computer Entertainment head Ken Kutaragi to revive the ailing consumer electronics division, it also hurt Sony's media convergence plans.\n\nUnveiled by Sega at June 1994's Consumer Electronics Show, the 32X was later described as the \"poor man's entry into 'next generation' games.\" The product was originally conceived as an entirely new console by Sega Enterprises and positioned as an inexpensive alternative for gamers into the 32-bit era, but at the suggestion of Sega of America research and development head Joe Miller, the console was converted into an add-on to the existing Mega Drive/Genesis and made more powerful, with two 32-bit central processing unit chips and a 3D graphics processor. Despite these changes, the console failed to attract either developers or consumers as the Sega Saturn had already been announced for release the next year. In part because of this, and also to rush the 32X to market before the holiday season in 1994, the 32X suffered from a poor library of titles, including Mega Drive/Genesis ports with improvements to the number of colors that appeared on screen. Originally released at US$159, Sega dropped the price to $99 in only a few months and ultimately cleared the remaining inventory at $19.95. About 665,000 units were sold.\n\nThe Nomad, a handheld game console by Sega released in North America in October 1995, is a portable variation of Sega's home console, the Genesis (known as the Mega Drive outside of North America). Designed from the Mega Jet, a portable version of the home console designed for use on airline flights in Japan, Nomad served to succeed the Game Gear and was the last handheld console released by Sega. Released late in the Genesis era, the Nomad had a short lifespan. Sold exclusively in North America, the Nomad was never officially released worldwide, and employs regional lockout. The handheld itself was incompatible with several Genesis peripherals, including the Power Base Converter, the Sega CD, and the Sega 32X. The release was five years into the market span of the Genesis, with an existing library of more than 500 Genesis games. With the Nomad's late release several months after the launch of the Saturn, this handheld is said to have suffered from its poorly timed launch. Sega decided to stop focusing on the Genesis in 1999, several months before the release of the Dreamcast, by which time the Nomad was being sold at less than a third of its original price. Reception for the Nomad is mixed between its uniqueness and its poor timing into the market. Blake Snow of GamePro listed the Nomad as fifth on his list of the \"10 Worst-Selling Handhelds of All Time,\" criticizing its poor timing into the market, inadequate advertising, and poor battery life.\n\nThe Sega Saturn was the successor to the Genesis as a 32-bit fifth-generation console, released in Japan in November 1994 and in Western markets mid-1995. The console was designed as a competitor to Sony's PlayStation, released nearly at the same time. With the system selling well in Japan and Sega wanting to get a head start over the PlayStation in North America, the company decided to release the system in May instead of September 1995, which was the same time the PlayStation was going to be released in North America. This left little time to promote the product and limited quantities of the system available at retail. Sega's release strategy also backfired when, shortly after Sega's announcement, Sony announced the price of the PlayStation as being $100 less than the list price for the Saturn. The console also suffered from behind the scenes management conflicts and a lack of coordination between the Japanese and North American branches of the company, leading to the Saturn to be released shortly after the release of the 32X, which created distribution and retail problems. By the end of 1996, the PlayStation had sold 2.9 million units in the U.S., more than twice the 1.2 million units sold by the Saturn. With the added competition from the subsequent release of the Nintendo 64, the Saturn lost market share in North America and was discontinued by 1999. With lifetime sales estimated at 9.5 million units worldwide, the Saturn is considered a commercial failure. The failure of Sega's development teams to release a game in the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series, known in development as \"Sonic X-treme\", has been considered a factor in the console's poor performance. The impact of the failure of the Saturn carried over into Sega's next console, the Dreamcast. However, the console gained interest in Japan and was not officially discontinued until January 4, 2001.\n\nThe uDraw GameTablet is a graphics tablet developed by THQ for use on seventh generation gaming consoles, which was initially released for the Wii in late 2010. Versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were released in late 2011. THQ also invested in several games that would uniquely use the tablet, such as \"uDraw Pictionary\". The Wii version had positive sales, with more than 1.7 million units sold, prompting the introduction of the unit for the other console systems. These units did not share the same popularity; 2011 holiday sales in North America fell $100 million below company targets with more than 1.4 million units left unsold by February 2012. THQ commented that if they had not attempted to sell these versions of uDraw, the company would have been profitable that respective quarter, but instead suffered an overall $56 million loss. Because of this failure, THQ was forced to shelve some of its less-successful franchises, such as the \"Red Faction\" series. THQ would eventually file for bankruptcy and sell off its assets in early 2013.\n\nThis is perhaps the most critically acclaimed \"failure\" console. Though its independent monitor could display only monochrome visuals, the console's vector-based graphics and arcade-style controller with analog joystick allowed developers to create a strong games library with faithful conversions of arcade hits and critically praised exclusives. However, its release shortly before the North American video game crash of 1983 doomed it to an early grave.\n\n This red monochromatic 3-D \"virtual reality\" system failed due to issues related to players getting eye strain, stiff necks, and headaches when trying to play it, along with the console's price and unportability. It came out in 1995 and was Nintendo's first failed console release. Gunpei Yokoi, the designer of the platform and the person largely credited for the success of the original Game Boy handheld and the \"Metroid\" series of games, resigned from the company shortly after the Virtual Boy ceased sales in order to start his own company, although for reasons unrelated to the console's success. The Virtual Boy was included in a \"Time\" \"50 Worst Inventions\" list published in May 2010.\n\nNintendo's Wii U was released in November 2012. It was designed as successor to the Wii as to provide a more challenging experience as to draw back \"core\" gamers that had dismissed the Wii as they felt it was aimed for casual gameplay. The Wii U features the Wii U GamePad, the unit's primary controller that had a touchscreen that allowed for dual-screen play similar to the Nintendo DS line, or could be used to remotely play games on the GamePad away from the television screen. While the Wii U received positive coverage, it failed to gain significant consumer draw, selling less than 14 million units compared to the Wii's 101 million units by the end of 2016. Nintendo executives attributed the poor sales of the Wii U to a combination of factors. They felt their messaging of the Wii U's abilities was not clear, leading to a general perception that the unit was primarily a tablet system and not a home console. They also recognized that they did not manage their release schedule for games well, nor had significant support from third-party publishers and developers, leaving the Wii U with gaps in software releases. Nintendo stated they had expected to sell 100 million Wii U units, and this over-estimation of sales contributed to several financial quarters of losses through 2016, making the Wii U a commercial failure. The development and marketing of their next console, the Nintendo Switch, was intended to avoid several of the pitfalls that occurred for the Wii U. The Wii U was discontinued in January 2017.\n\nThe following is an incomplete list of software that have been deemed commercial failures by industry sources.\n\n\"APB: All Points Bulletin\" was a multiplayer online game developed by Realtime Worlds in 2010. The game, incorporating concepts from their previous title \"Crackdown\" and past work by its lead developer David Jones, who had helped create the \"Grand Theft Auto\" series, was set around the idea of a large-scale urban battle between Enforcers and Criminals; players would be able to partake in large-scale on-going missions between the two sides. The game was originally set as both a Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 title and as Realtime Worlds' flagship title for release in 2008, but instead the company set about developing \"Crackdown\" first, and later focused \"APB\" as a Windows-only title, potentially porting the game to the Xbox 360 later. Upon launch in June 2010, the game received lukewarm reviews, hampered by the existence of a week-long review embargo, and did not attract the expected number of subscribers to maintain its business model. Realtime Worlds, suffering from the commercial failure of the game, sold off a second project, Project MyWorld, and subsequently reduced its operations to administration and a skeleton crew to manage the \"APB\" servers while they attempted to find a buyer, including possibly Epic Games who had expressed interest in the title. However, without any acceptable offers, the company was forced to shut down \"APB\" in September 2010. Eventually, the game was sold to K2 Network, a company that has brought other Asian massive-multiplayer online games to the Western markets as free-to-play titles, and similar changes occurred to \"APB\" when it was relaunched by K2.\n\nOne of the most notorious PC gaming failures, \"Battlecruiser 3000AD\" (shortened \"BC3K\") was hyped for almost a decade before its disastrous release in the U.S. and Europe. The game was the brainchild of Derek Smart, an independent game developer renowned for lengthy and aggressive online responses to perceived criticism. The concept behind \"BC3K\" was ambitious, giving the player the command of a large starship with all the requisite duties, including navigation, combat, resource management, and commanding crew members. Advertisements appeared in the gaming press in the mid-1990s hyping the game as, \"The Last Thing You'll Ever Desire.\" Computer bulletin boards and Usenet groups were abuzz with discussion about the game. As time wore on and numerous delays were announced, excitement turned to frustration in the online community. Smart exacerbated the negative air by posting liberally on Usenet. The posts ignited one of the largest flame wars in Usenet history. During the development cycle, Smart refused to let other programmers have full access to his code and continued to change directions as new technology became available, causing the game to be in development for over seven years.\n\nIn November 1996, Take-Two Interactive finally released the game, reportedly over protests from Smart. The game was buggy and only partially finished, with outdated graphics, MIDI music, a cryptic interface, and almost no documentation. Critics and the gaming community reacted poorly to the release. Eventually, a stable, playable version of the game was released as \"Battlecruiser 3000AD v2.0\". Smart eventually released \"BC3K\" as freeware and went on to create several sequels under the \"Battlecruiser\" and \"Universal Combat\" titles. \n\nAlthough critically acclaimed and planned as the first part of a trilogy, \"Beyond Good & Evil\" (released in 2003) flopped commercially. Former Ubisoft employee Owen Hughes stated that it was felt that the simultaneous releases of internationally competing titles \"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell\" and \"\" and in Europe, \"XIII\" (all three published by Ubisoft and all of which had strong brand identity in their markets), made an impact on \"Beyond Good & Evil\"s ability to achieve interest with the public. The game's commercial failure led Ubisoft to postpone plans for any subsequent titles in the series. A sequel was announced at the end of the Ubidays opening conference, and an HD version of the original was released for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 via download in 2011. Alain Corre, Ubisoft's Executive Director of EMEA Territories, commented that the Xbox 360 release \"did extremely well\", but considered this success \"too late\" to make a difference in the game's poor sales. Despite this, \"Beyond Good & Evil 2\" was announced at Ubisoft's press conference at E3 2017, fourteen years after the release of the original game.\n\n\"Brütal Legend\" is Double Fine Productions' second major title. The game is set in a world based on heavy metal music, includes a hundred-song soundtrack across numerous metal subgenres, and incorporates a celebrity voice cast including Jack Black, Lemmy Kilmister, Rob Halford, Ozzy Osbourne, Lita Ford, and Tim Curry. The game was originally to be published by Vivendi Games via Sierra Entertainment prior to its merger with Activision. Following the merger, Activision declined to publish \"Brütal Legend\", and Double Fine turned to Electronic Arts as their publishing partner, delaying the game's release. Activision and Double Fine counter-sued each other for breach of contract, ultimately settling out of court. The game was designed as an action adventure/real-time strategy game similar to \"Herzog Zwei\"; as games in the real-time strategy genre generally do not perform well on consoles, Double Fine was told by both Vivendi and Electronic Arts to avoid stating this fact and emphasize other elements of the game. Despite positive reviews from critics, the game got criticized for its real-time strategy elements that were not mentioned within the pre-release marketing, making it a difficult game to sell to players. Furthermore, its late-year release in October 2009 buried the title among many top-tier games, including \"Uncharted 2\", \"\" and \"\". It only sold about 215,000 units within the first month, making it a \"retail failure\", and though Double Fine had begun on a sequel, Electronic Arts cancelled further development. According to Tim Schafer, president and lead developer of Double Fine, 1.4 million copies of the game had been sold by February 2011.\n\nOne of the more infamous failures in modern PC gaming was \"Daikatana\", which was drastically hyped due to creator John Romero's popular status as one of the key designers behind \"Doom\". However, after being wrought with massive over-spending and serious delays, the game finally launched to incredibly poor critical reaction because of bugs, lackluster enemies, poor gameplay, and terrible production values, all of which were made worse by its heavy marketing campaign proclaiming it as the next \"big thing\" in first person shooters.\n\nThe first title released by Ion Storm, \"Dominion\" was a real time strategy title similar to \"Command & Conquer\" and \"Warcraft\", based as a spin-off to the \"G-Nome\" canon. The game was originally developed by 7th Level, but was purchased by Ion Storm for US$1.8 million. The project originally had a budget of US$50,000 and was scheduled to be finished in three months with two staff members. Due to mismanagement and Ion Storm's inexperience, the project took over a year, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars. \"Dominion\" was released in July 1998. It received bad reviews and sold poorly, falling far short of recouping its purchase price, let alone the cost of finishing it. The game divided employees working on Ion's marquee title, \"Daikatana\", arguably leading to the walkout of several key development team members. It put a strain on Ion Storm's finances, leading the once well-funded startup to scramble for cash as \"Daikatana\"'s development extended over several years.\n\n\"Duke Nukem Forever\" was an entry in the successful \"Duke Nukem\" series, initially announced in 1997, but spent fifteen years in development, and was frequently listed as a piece of vaporware video game software. The initial development with the Quake II Engine began in 1996, and the final game was developed by Gearbox Software and released in 2011. The game was heavily criticized and was named by several sites as their \"most disappointing\" game for the year. Because of its tangled development process, it is very hard to know which companies made and which lost money over the game. According to Gearbox head Randy Pitchford, the game cost 3D Realms head George Broussard US$20–30 million of his own money. The sales were poorer than expected, causing Take-Two to reduce their profit estimate for the quarter, though later in 2011 stated that \"Duke Nukem Forever\" would prove to be profitable for the company.\n\nA sequel to the successful Wii-exclusive platformer \"Epic Mickey\", \"Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two\" was developed by Junction Point Studios and published by Disney Interactive Studios for the Wii, Wii U, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and Microsoft Windows. Despite being heavily advertised and being released on multiple consoles, \"Epic Mickey 2\" only sold 270,000 copies in North America, barely a quarter of the original's sales of 1.3 million. The game's failure led to the shutdown of Junction Point and the cancellation of future entries in the \"Epic Mickey\" series.\n\nBased on Steven Spielberg's popular 1982 movie of the same name and reportedly coded in just five weeks, this Atari 2600 game was rushed to the market for the 1982 holiday season.\n\nDespite selling 1.5 million copies, the sales figures came nowhere near Atari's expectations; it had ordered production of five million copies, and many of the sold games were returned to Atari for refunds by consumers who were dissatisfied with the game. It had become an urban legend that Atari had dumped the unsold cartridges of \"E.T.\" and other games in a landfill in Alamogordo, New Mexico; this was confirmed in 2014 when the site was allowed to be excavated, with former Atari personnel affirming they had dumped about 800,000 cartridges total including \"E.T.\" and other poorly-selling (and best-selling) games. The financial figures and business tactics surrounding this product are emblematic of the video game crash of 1983 and contributed to Atari's bankruptcy. Atari paid $25 million for the license to produce the game, which further contributed to a debt of $536 million (equivalent to $ billion today). The company was divided and sold in 1984.\n\nKnown for being the first adventure game by LucasArts to use three-dimensional graphics, \"Grim Fandango\" received positive reviews and won numerous awards. It was originally thought that the game sold well during the holiday season. However, the game's sales appeared to be crowded out by other titles released during the late 1998 season, including \"Half-Life\", \"Metal Gear Solid\" and \"\". Based on data provided by PC Data (now owned by NPD Group), the game sold about 95,000 copies up to 2003 in North America, excluding online sales. Worldwide sales are estimated between 100,000 and 500,000 units. Developer Tim Schafer along with others of the \"Grim Fandango\" development team would leave LucasArts after this project to begin a new studio (Double Fine Productions). \"Grim Fandango\"s relatively modest sales are often cited as a contributing factor to the decline of the adventure game genre in the late 1990s, though the title's reputation as a \"flop\" is to an extent a case of perception over reality, as Schafer has pointed out that the game turned a profit, with the royalty check he eventually received being proof. His perspective is that the adventure genre did not so much lose its audience as fail to grow it while production costs continued to rise. This made adventure games less attractive an investment for publishers; in contrast, the success of first-person shooters caused the console market to boom. The emergence of new distribution channels that did not rely on the traditional retail model would ultimately re-empower the niche genre. Double Fine has since remastered the game for high definition graphics and re-released it through these channels.\n\nAlthough reviews for Jazz Jackrabbit 2 were positive, sales were insufficient and resulted a loss for its publisher Gathering of Developers. This prevented the developers from finding a publisher, thus leading to the cancelation of Jazz Jackrabbit 3 which could have been the franchise's first 3D game.\n\nReleased in 1997 after five years in development, this $6 million adventure game was the brainchild of Jordan Mechner, the creator of \"Prince of Persia\". The game was noted for taking place in almost complete real-time, using Art Nouveau-style characters that were rotoscoped from a 22-day live-action video shoot, and featuring intelligent writing and levels of character depth that were not often seen in computer games. Despite rave reviews, Brøderbund, the game's publisher, did little to promote the game, apart from a brief mention in a press release and enthusiastic statements by Brøderbund executives, in part due to the entire Brøderbund marketing team quitting in the weeks before its release. Released in April, the game was not a success, selling only about 100,000 copies, a million copies short of breaking even.\n\nAfter the release of the game, Mechner's company Smoking Car Productions quietly folded, and Brøderbund was acquired by The Learning Company, who were only interested in Brøderbund's educational software, effectively putting the game out of print. Mechner was later able to reacquire the rights to the game, and in 2012, worked with DotEmu to release an iOS port of the title, before making it to Android as well.\n\n\"MadWorld\" is a beat 'em up title for the Wii developed by PlatinumGames and distributed by Sega in March 2009. The game was purposely designed as an extremely violent video game. The game features a distinctive black-and-white graphic style that borrows from both Frank Miller's \"Sin City\" and other Japanese and Western comics. This monotone coloring is only broken by blood that comes from attacking and killing foes in numerous, gruesome, and over-the-top manners. Though there had been violent games available for the Wii from the day it was launched (e.g. \"Red Steel\"), many perceived \"MadWorld\" as one of the first mature titles for the system, causing some initial outrage from concerned consumers about the normally family-friendly system. \"MadWorld\" was well received by critics, but this did not translate into commercial sales; only 123,000 units of the game sold in the United States during its first six months on the market. Sega considered these sales to be \"disappointing\".\n\n\"Ōkami\" was a product of Clover Studios with direction by Hideki Kamiya, previously known for his work on the \"Resident Evil\" and \"Devil May Cry\" series. The game is favorably compared to a \"Zelda\"-type adventure, and is based on the quest of the goddess-wolf Amaterasu using a \"celestial brush\" to draw in magical effects on screen and to restore the cursed land of ancient Nippon. Released first in 2006 on the PlayStation 2, it later received a port to the Wii system, where the brush controls were reworked for the motion controls of the Wii Remote. The game was well received by critics, with Metacritic aggregate scores of 93% and 90% for the PlayStation 2 and Wii versions, respectively, and was considered one of the best titles for 2006; IGN named it their Game of the Year. Despite strong praise from critics, the game sold fewer than 600,000 units by March 2009. These factors have led for \"Ōkami\" to be called the \"least commercially successful winner of a game of the year award\" in the 2010 version of the \"Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition\". Shortly after its release, Capcom disbanded Clover Studios, though many of its employees went on to form PlatinumGames and produce \"Madworld\" and the more successful \"Bayonetta\". Strong fan support of the game led to a sequel, \"Ōkamiden\", on the Nintendo DS, a high-definition remake for the PlayStation 3, and a remaster for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and Microsoft Windows.\n\n The home version of the highly popular \"Pac-Man\" arcade game was eagerly anticipated, but was a commercial disappointment for Atari despite being a best-selling game. The game was rushed to make the 1981 Christmas season. In 1982, Atari created 12 million cartridges, even though there were only 10 million Atari 2600s sold at the time, in hopes of the game boosting system sales. \"Pac-Man\" did sell close to seven million cartridges, but consumers and critics alike gave it low ratings. The high number of unsold units (over five million), coupled with the expense of a large marketing campaign, led to large losses for Atari. This game and \"E.T.\" are often blamed for sparking the video game crash of 1983. Shortly after the disappointment of \"Pac-Man\", Atari reported a huge quarterly loss, prompting parent company Warner Communications to sell the division off in 1984. Atari never regained a prominent position in the home console market.\n\nDespite achieving notable critical success, including GameSpot's 2005 \"Best Game No One Played\" award, \"Psychonauts\" sold fewer than 100,000 copies during its initial release. The game led to troubles at publisher Majesco Entertainment, including the resignation of its CEO and the plummeting of the company's stock, prompting a class-action lawsuit by the company's stockholders. At the time of its release in 2005, the game was considered the \"poster child\" for failures in innovative games. Its poor sales have also been blamed on a lack of marketing. However, today the game remains a popular title on various digital download services. The creator of \"Psychonauts\", Tim Schafer, has a cult following due to his unique and eccentric style. Eventually, Double Fine would go on to acquire the full rights to publishing the game, and, with funding from Dracogen, created a Mac OS X and Linux port of the game, which was sold as part of a Humble Bundle in 2012 with nearly 600,000 bundles sold; according to Schafer, \"We made more on \"Psychonauts\" [in 2012] than we ever have before.\" In August 2015, Steam Spy estimated approximately 1,157,000 owners of the game on the digital distributor Steam.\n\n\"Shenmue\" on the Dreamcast is more notorious for its overambitious budget than its poor sales figures. At the time of release in 1999, the game had the record for the most expensive production costs (over US$70 million), and its five-year production time. In comparison, the games' total sale was 1.2 million copies. \"Shenmue\", however, was a critical hit, earning an average review score of 89%. The game was supposed to be the initial installment of a trilogy. The second installment was eventually released in 2001, but by this time the Dreamcast was floundering, so the game only saw a release in Japan and Europe. Sega eventually released it for North American players for the Xbox, but the poor performance of both titles combined with restructuring have made Sega reluctant to complete the trilogy for fear of failure to return on the investment. However, a Kickstarter campaign has received record support for a third title, with a release set for 2018.\n\n\"Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric\" is a spin-off from the \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" series, released in 2014 and developed by Big Red Button Entertainment and IllFonic for Sega and Sonic Team, along with its handheld counterpart \"\", which was developed by Sanzaru Games. \"Rise of Lyric\" for the Wii U is considered one of the worst video games of all time due to many glitches, poor gameplay and weak writing. Both games failed commercially, selling only 490,000 copies as of February 2015, making them the lowest-selling games in the \"Sonic\" franchise.\n\n\"Sunset\", a first-person exploration adventure game involving a housekeeper working for a dictator of a fictional country, was developed by two-person Belgian studio Tale of Tales, who previously had created several acclaimed arthouse style games and other audio-visual projects such as \"The Path\". They wanted to make \"Sunset\" a \"game for gamers\" while still retaining their arthouse-style approach, and in addition to planning on a commercial release, used Kickstarter to gain funding. \"Sunset\" only sold about 4000 copies on its release, including those to Kickstarter backers. Tale of Tales opted to close their studio after sinking the company's finances into the game, and believed that if they did release any new games in the future, they would likely shy away from commercial release.\n\nThe fourth game in the popular Myst series, released in 2003. It was developed by Cyan Worlds shortly after \"Riven\" was completed. The game took Cyan Worlds more than five years and $12 million to complete and was codenamed DIRT (\"D'ni in real time\"), then MUDPIE (meaning \"Multi-User DIRT, Persistent / Personal Interactive Entertainment / Experience / Exploration / Environment\"). Though it had generally positive reception, the sales were disappointing. In comparison, the first three \"Myst\" games had sold more than 12 million units collectively before \"Uru\"s release. \"Uru\"s poor sales were also considered a factor in financially burdening Cyan, contributing to the company's near closure in 2005.\n\nReleased by Atari in 1983, \"I, Robot\" was the first video game to use 3-D polygon graphics, and the first that allowed the player to change camera angles. It also had gameplay that rewarded planning and stealth as much as reflexes and trigger speed, and included a non-game mode called \"Doodle City,\" where players could make artwork using the polygons. Production estimates vary, but all agree that there were no more than 1500 units made.\n\nIn 1982, the President of Cinematronics arranged a one-time purchase of 5000 printed circuit boards from Japan. The boards were used in the manufacture of several games, but the majority of them were reserved for the new arcade game \"Jack the Giantkiller\", based on the classic fairy tale \"Jack and the Beanstalk\". Between the purchase price of the boards and other expenses, Cinematronics invested almost two million dollars into \"Jack the Giantkiller\". It completely flopped in the arcade and many of the boards went unsold, costing the company a huge amount of money at a time when it was already having financial difficulties.\n\n\"Radar Scope\" was one of the first arcade games released by Nintendo. It was released in Japan first, and a brief run of success there led Nintendo to order 3,000 units for the American market in 1980. American operators were unimpressed, however, and Nintendo of America was stuck with about 2,000 unsold \"Radar Scope\" machines sitting in the warehouse.\n\nFacing a potential financial disaster, Nintendo assigned the game's designer, Shigeru Miyamoto, to revamp the game. Instead he designed a brand new game that could be run in the same cabinets and on the same hardware as \"Radar Scope\". That new game was the smash hit \"Donkey Kong\", and Nintendo was able to recoup its investment in 1981 by converting the remaining unsold \"Radar Scope\" units to \"Donkey Kong\" and selling those.\n\n\"Sundance\" was an arcade vector game, released in 1979. Producer Cinematronics planned to manufacture about 1000 \"Sundance\" units, but sales suffered from a combination of poor gameplay and an abnormally high rate of manufacturing defects. The fallout rate in production was about 50%, the vector monitor (made by an outside vendor) had a defective picture tube that would arc and burn out if the game was left in certain positions during shipping, and according to programmer Tim Skelly, the circuit boards required a lot of cut-and-jumpering between mother and daughter boards that also made for a very fragile setup. The units that survived to reach arcade floors were not a hit with gamers—Skelly himself reportedly felt that the gameplay lacked the \"anxiety element\" necessary in a good game and asked Cinematronics not to release it, and in an April 1983 interview with \"Video Games\" Magazine he referred to \"Sundance\" as \"a total dog\".\n\n\n"

                "PlayStation (console)\n\nThe PlayStation (officially abbreviated to PS, and commonly known as the PS1 or PSX) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. The console was released on 3 December in Japan, 9 September 1995 in North America, 29 September 1995 in Europe, and for 15 November 1995 in Australia. The console was the first of the PlayStation lineup of home video game consoles. It primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn as part of the fifth generation of video game consoles.\n\nThe PlayStation is the first \"computer entertainment platform\" to ship 100 million units, which it had reached 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. In 2000, a redesigned, \"slim\" version called the PS one was released, replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor, the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with the PlayStation's DualShock controller and games, was announced in 1999 and launched in 2000. The last PS one units were sold in winter 2004 before it was officially discontinued in 2006, for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch 11 years earlier. Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of both the PlayStation and PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 – over 11 years after it had been released, and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe inception of what would become the released PlayStation dates back to 1986 with a joint venture between Nintendo and Sony. Nintendo had already produced floppy disk technology to complement cartridges, in the form of the Family Computer Disk System, and wanted to continue this complementary storage strategy for the Super Famicom. Nintendo approached Sony to develop a CD-ROM add-on, tentatively titled the \"Play Station\" or \"SNES-CD\". A contract was signed, and work began. Nintendo's choice of Sony was due to a prior dealing: Ken Kutaragi, the person who would later be dubbed \"The Father of the PlayStation\", was the individual who had sold Nintendo on using the Sony SPC-700 processor for use as the eight-channel ADPCM sound set in the Super Famicom/SNES console through an impressive demonstration of the processor's capabilities.\n\nKutaragi was nearly fired by Sony because he was originally working with Nintendo on the side without Sony's knowledge (while still employed by Sony). It was then-CEO, Norio Ohga, who recognised the potential in Kutaragi's chip, and in working with Nintendo on the project. Ohga kept Kutaragi on at Sony, and it was not until Nintendo cancelled the project that Sony decided to develop its own console.\n\nSony also planned to develop a Super NES-compatible, Sony-branded console, but one which would be more of a home entertainment system playing both Super NES cartridges and a new CD format which Sony would design. This was also to be the format used in SNES-CDs, giving a large degree of control to Sony despite Nintendo's leading position in the video gaming market.\n\nThe product, dubbed the \"Play Station\" was to be announced at the May 1991 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). However, when Nintendo's Hiroshi Yamauchi read the original 1988 contract between Sony and Nintendo, he realised that the earlier agreement essentially handed Sony complete control over any and all titles written on the SNES CD-ROM format. Yamauchi decided that the contract was totally unacceptable and he secretly cancelled all plans for the joint Nintendo-Sony SNES CD attachment. Instead of announcing a partnership between Sony and Nintendo, at 9 am the day of the CES, Nintendo chairman Howard Lincoln stepped onto the stage and revealed that Nintendo was now allied with Philips, and Nintendo was planning on abandoning all the previous work Nintendo and Sony had accomplished. Lincoln and Minoru Arakawa had, unbeknownst to Sony, flown to Philips' global headquarters in the Netherlands and formed an alliance of a decidedly different nature—one that would give Nintendo total control over its licenses on Philips machines.\n\nAfter the collapse of the joint-Nintendo project, Sony briefly considered allying itself with Sega to produce a stand-alone console. The Sega CEO at the time, Tom Kalinske, took the proposal to Sega's Board of Directors in Tokyo, who promptly vetoed the idea. Kalinske, in a 2013 interview recalled them saying \"that’s a stupid idea, Sony doesn't know how to make hardware. They don’t know how to make software either. Why would we want to do this?\". This prompted Sony into halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what it had developed so far with both Nintendo and Sega to make it into a complete console based upon the Super Famicom. As a result, Nintendo filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in US federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of what was originally christened the \"Play Station\", on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction and, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the aforementioned brand new game system was revealed. However, it is theorised that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.\n\nBy the end of 1992, Sony and Nintendo reached a deal whereby the \"Play Station\" would still have a port for SNES games, but Nintendo would own the rights and receive the bulk of the profits from the games, and the SNES would continue to use the Sony-designed audio chip. However, Sony decided in early 1993 to begin reworking the \"Play Station\" concept to target a new generation of hardware and software. As part of this process the SNES cartridge port was dropped and the space between the names \"Play Station\" was removed becoming \"PlayStation\", thereby ending Nintendo's involvement with the project. According to a Sony engineer, all work on the console from the time of the partnership with Nintendo was eventually scrapped, and the PlayStation design was restarted from scratch. Sony's North American division, known as Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), originally planned to market the new console under the alternative branding \"PSX\" following the negative feedback regarding \"PlayStation\" in focus group studies. Early advertising prior to the console's launch in North America referenced PSX, but the term was scrapped before launch.\n\nAccording to SCE's producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, there was uncertainty over whether the console should primarily focus on 2D sprite graphics or 3D polygon graphics. It was only after witnessing the success of Sega's \"Virtua Fighter\" in Japanese arcades that \"the direction of the PlayStation became instantly clear\" and 3D polygon graphics became the console's primary focus.\n\nUnlike Sega, Sony had no arcade division from which to draw console-selling ports, or any in-house development to speak of. To solve this problem, Sony acquired studios such as Psygnosis and signed exclusivity deals with hot arcade publishers Namco and Williams Entertainment.\n\nIndustry hype for the console spread quickly, and in early 1994 \"GamePro\" reported that \"many video game companies [feel] that in the near future, the video game platforms to contend with will be from Nintendo, Sega... and \"Sony\".\" [emphasis in original]\n\nThe PlayStation was released in Japan on 3 December 1994, North America on 9 September 1995, Europe on 29 September 1995, and Oceania on 15 November 1995. The console was an immediate success in Japan, selling over 2 million units within its first six months on the market. In the US, 800,000 were sold in 1995 (i.e. four months on the market), giving the PlayStation a commanding lead over the other consoles of its generation, though it was still being outsold by the older Super NES and Sega Genesis. The launch price in the US market was US$299 and Sony enjoyed a very successful launch with titles of almost every genre, including \"Battle Arena Toshinden\", \"Warhawk\", \"Air Combat\", \"Philosoma\", \"Ridge Racer\" and \"Rayman\". Unlike the vast majority of gaming consoles of the time, the PlayStation did not include a pack-in game at launch. Sony reported strong software sales in the months following launch, with an attach rate of 4:1.\n\nThen Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, preferred Sony's console to the competition from Sega, saying \"Our game designer likes the Sony machine.\" Microsoft would later compete with Sony with its Xbox console. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" would score the PlayStation console a 19 out of 40. The staff of \"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation a few weeks after its North American launch. They commented that while the CPU is \"fairly average\", the supplementary custom hardware such as the GPU and sound processor is stunningly powerful. They particularly praised its focus on 3D, and also remarked positively on the comfort of the controller and the convenience of the memory cards. Giving the system 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, they concluded, \"To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war.\" An advertisement slogan used in marketing the console was, \"\"Live in your world. Play in ours.\"\" It is stylised as, \"LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS.\" Another briefly used advertising campaign was titled \"You Are Not Ready\" or \"U R NOT .\" Sony's CCO Lee Clow explained that \"it's the ultimate challenge. Gamers love to respond to that tag line and say 'Bullshit. Let me show you how ready I am.'\"\n\nOne of the key factors in the PlayStation's success was Sony's approach to third party developers. Whereas Sega and Nintendo took an isolationist approach, focusing on first party development while generally leaving third party developers to their own devices, Sony took efforts to streamline game production by providing a range of programming libraries which were constantly updated online, organising third party technical support teams, and in some cases giving direct development support to third party companies.\n\nWhile the Sega Saturn was marketed towards 18 to 34 year-olds, the PlayStation was marketed roughly, but not exclusively, towards 12 to 24 year-olds. Both Sega and Sony reasoned that because younger players typically look up to older, more experienced players, they would be drawn in by advertising targeted at teens and adults. Additionally, Sony found that adults are best targeted by advertising geared towards teenagers; according to Lee Clow, \"One of the first things we resolved early on was that everyone is 17 when they play videogames. The young people look up to the best gamer who is usually a little older and more practiced and talented. Then there are people who start working and grow up, but when they go into their room and sit down with their videogames, they're regressing and becoming 17 again.\" Initially PlayStation demographics were skewed towards adults, but after the first price drop the audience began broadening.\n\nIn 1996, the high demand for PlayStation games contributed to Sony's decision to expand their CD production facilities in Springfield, Oregon, increasing their monthly output from 4 million discs to 6.5 million discs. PlayStation sales were running at twice the rate of Saturn sales, and dramatically increased their lead when both the PlayStation and Saturn dropped in price to $199 in May, in large part because some retailers (such as KB Toys) did not stock the Saturn. The PlayStation was outselling the Saturn at a similar ratio in Europe as well during 1996.\n\nThe PlayStation took more time to achieve dominance in Japan. After the PlayStation and Saturn had been on the market for nearly two years, Sony Computer Entertainment president Teruhisa Tokunaka said the competition between them was still \"very close\", and that neither console had yet held the lead in sales for any meaningful length of time.\n\nIn addition to playing games, select PlayStation models have the ability to play audio CDs; further, Asian model SCPH-5903 can also play Video CDs. Like most domestic CD players, the PlayStation has the ability to shuffle the playback order, play the songs in a programmed order, and repeat one song or the entire disc. Later PlayStation models can utilise a music visualisation function called SoundScope. This function, as well as a memory card manager, can be accessed by starting the console either without inserting a game or keeping the CD tray open, thereby accessing a GUI for the PlayStation BIOS.\n\nThe actual GUI for both PS one and PlayStation differ graphically depending on firmware versions: the original PlayStation GUI had a dark blue background with rainbow graffiti used as buttons; the early PAL PlayStation and PS one GUI had a grey blocked background with 2 icons in the middle, different on each version. If the CD lid is closed with a game inside at any time while at the menu, the game will immediately start.\n\nAs of 30 June 2007, a total of 7,918 software titles have been released worldwide (counting games released in multiple regions as separate titles). As of 31 March 2007, the cumulative software shipment was at 962 million units. The last game for the system released in the United States was \"FIFA Football 2005\". However, several reprinted and remastered editions were released in later years. \"Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection\" was released on 26 July 2007, which contained \"Metal Gear Solid\" in the original PlayStation format. In 2011, Capcom released the \"Resident Evil 15th Anniversary Collection\", and in 2012, Square Enix released the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" in Japan containing all of the \"Final Fantasy\" titles, a majority of which were also in the original PlayStation format.\n\nThe \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons on most of the Japanese PlayStation games are reversed in their North American and European releases. In Japan, the button (\"maru\", right) is used as the OK button, while the button (\"batsu\", wrong) is used as Cancel. North American and European releases have the button or the buttons as the OK button, while either the or the button is used as Cancel (some titles like \"Xenogears\" used the button for cancelling actions and selections, along with the PlayStation 2 system browser and the XrossMedia Bar on the PlayStation 3 and the PSP). However, a few games, such as Square's \"Vagrant Story\", \"Final Fantasy VII\" (which used the button as cancel) and \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", Namco's \"Ridge Racer Type 4\", and Konami's \"Metal Gear Solid\", use the Japanese button layout worldwide. Some other games, like the Japanese version of \"Gran Turismo\", had used different controls that are similar to North American games. These Japanese button layouts still apply to other PlayStation consoles. This is because in the early years Sony America (SCEA), Sony Europe (SCEE), and Sony Japan (SCEJ) had different development and testing documents (TRCs) for their respective territories.\n\nHardware designer Ken Kutaragi stated, \"The technology came from an original idea to create a synthesizer for graphics, something that takes a basic graphic and then adds various effects to it quickly and easily.\"\n\nWith the early units, particularly the early 1000 models, many gamers experience skipping full-motion video or physical \"ticking\" noises coming from their PlayStation units. The problem appears to have come from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments—the plastic mouldings inside the console can warp very slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly. The solution is to ensure that the console sits on a surface which dissipates heat efficiently in a well vented area, or raise the unit up slightly from its resting surface.\nThe first batch of PlayStations used a KSM-440AAM laser unit whose case and all movable parts were completely made out of plastic. Over time, friction causes the plastic lens sled rail to wear out—usually unevenly. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerated wear because of the additional heat, which makes the plastic even more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, one side of the lens sled can become so worn that the laser can tilt, no longer pointing directly at the CD. This would cause data read errors and games would no longer load. One common fix is to turn the PlayStation upside down, making the lens sled rest on the unworn top rails. Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the sled out of die-cast metal and placing the laser unit slightly farther away from the power supply on later models of the PlayStation.\n\nDue to an engineering oversight, the PlayStation does not produce a proper signal on several older models of televisions, causing the display to flicker or bounce around the screen. Since only a small percentage of PlayStation owners used such televisions, Sony decided not to change the console design, and instead gave consumers the option of sending their PlayStation unit to a Sony service centre to have an official modchip installed, which would allow it to play on older televisions.\n\nPrior to the PlayStation, the reproduction of copyrighted material for game consoles was restricted to either enthusiasts with exceptional technical ability, or others that had access to CD manufacturers. However, the increased availability of cheap CD burners at this time led Sony to modify the shape of the first portion of the data track on PlayStation formatted discs: A normal data track follows a smooth spiral path around a disc, whereas the modified portion of the data track followed wavy spiral path. As a result, any discs that did not contain the modified data track such as CD-R copies or standard pirated discs could not boot on the console. This modified portion of the data path was used to encode the disc \"region\", for example a disc destined for distribution in the NTSC-U/C region would encode the letters \"SCEA\"; in Europe, \"SCEE\"; in Japan, \"SCEI\". This served as copy protection as well as region-locking.\n\nThe installation of an unofficial modchip allowed the PlayStation to play games recorded on a regular CD-R. Since it worked by injecting the correct region data into the stream it also allowed the console to play games from any region.\n\nSeveral open source modchips were designed using readily available electronic parts, by the end of the system's life cycle almost anyone with minimal soldering experience was able to perform these modifications. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using free, unofficial tools, as well as the reproduction of original discs. With the introduction of such devices the console became very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers alike, as well as those who merely wished to protect the lifespan of their lawful, original discs. In 1996 Sony filed lawsuits against a number of companies which advertised such modchips and pirated games, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\nSome companies (notably Datel) did manage to produce discs that booted on unmodified retail units while using special equipment.\n\nInstead of a D-pad, which is used for directional movement in nearly every other console then on the market, the PlayStation controller uses four directional buttons.\n\nPeripherals released for the PlayStation include memory cards, the PlayStation Mouse, the PlayStation Analog Joystick, the PlayStation Link Cable, the Multiplayer Adapter (a four-player multitap), the Memory Drive (a disk drive for 3.5 inch floppy disks), the GunCon (a light gun), and the Glasstron (a monoscopic head-mounted display).\n\n\nThe PlayStation went through a number of variants during its production run. From an external perspective, the most notable change between variants was the reduction in the number of connectors. The RCA jacks were removed in the first revision, and the Parallel I/O port was removed in the final revision.\n\nSony marketed a development kit for hobbyists and developers also known as the Net Yaroze, which launched in June 1996 in Japan and in 1997 in other countries. Sold only through an ordering service, the development console came with the necessary documentation and software to program PlayStation games and applications.\n\nOn 7 July 2000, Sony released the PS one, a smaller, redesigned version of the original PlayStation. It was the highest-selling console through the end of the year, outselling all other consoles - including Sony's own PlayStation 2. A total of 28.15 million PS one units had been sold by the time it was discontinued in March 2006.\nA version of the PS one included a LCD screen, referred to as the \"Combo pack\".\n\nSony's successor to the PlayStation is the PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with its predecessor in that it can play almost every original PlayStation game.\n\nThe third generation of the PlayStation, the PlayStation 3, was launched on 11 November 2006 in Japan, 17 November 2006 in North America, and 23 March 2007 in Europe. The backward compatibility of the PlayStation 3 differs by model. The newer PlayStation 3 models, like the Slim, are only backwards compatible with original PlayStation games; however, the older 60 GB model (the first PS3 model released) will play PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games through either having the Emotion Engine and/or Reality Synthesizer and emulating one or the other. While PlayStation 3 games are not region-locked, PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games are only playable on PlayStation 3 consoles from the same region.\n\nA third successor, the PlayStation 4, was announced by Sony on 20 February 2013 and was released in the US on 15 November, Europe on 29 November 2013, and Japan and Asia on 22 February 2014. However, it is backwards compatible with select PS3 Games through a download service dubbed PlayStation Now.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable, or PSP, is a handheld game console first released in late 2004. The PSP is capable of playing PlayStation games downloaded via Sony's online store, and can also play any PlayStation game by using the PlayStation 3's remote play feature while the disc is in the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe successor to the PSP, the PlayStation Vita, was introduced as a part of the 8th generation of video game consoles, and is backwards compatible with original PSP as well as original PlayStation games downloaded from the PlayStation Store.\n\nSony Computer Entertainment was an upstart in the video game industry in late 1994, as the early 1990s were dominated by Nintendo and Sega. Nintendo had been the clear leader in the video game industry since the introduction of the NES in 1985 and the Nintendo 64 was initially expected to maintain this position for Nintendo. The PlayStation's target audience included 15- to 17-year-olds who were not the primary focus of Nintendo, and 18- to 29-year-olds, who represented the first generation to grow up playing video games. By the late 1990s, Sony became a highly regarded console brand due to the PlayStation, with a significant lead over second-place Nintendo, while Sega was relegated to a distant third.\n\nThe PlayStation's lead in installed base and developer support paved the way for the success of the next-generation PlayStation 2, which overcame an early launch from the Sega Dreamcast and then fended off competition from the Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube.\n\nThe success of the PlayStation is widely believed to have influenced the demise of the cartridge-based home console. While not the first system to utilise an optical disc format, it is the first highly successful one, and ended up going head-to-head with the last major home console to rely on proprietary cartridges—the Nintendo 64. Sony Computer Entertainment president Teruhisa Tokunaka remarked in 1996: \n\nNintendo was very public about its scepticism toward using CDs and DVDs to store games, citing longer load times and durability issues. It was widely speculated that the company was even more concerned with the proprietary cartridge format's ability to help enforce copy protection, given its substantial reliance on licensing and exclusive titles for its revenue. Piracy was rampant on the PlayStation due to the relative ease of the installation of a modchip, allowing the PlayStation to play games region free and/or recorded on a regular CD-R, making the console very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers.\n\nThe increasing complexity of games (in content, graphics, and sound) pushed cartridges to their storage limits and this gradually turned off some third-party developers. Part of the CD format's appeal to publishers was that they could be produced at a significantly lower cost and offered more production flexibility to meet demand. As a result, some third-party developers switched to the PlayStation, such as Squaresoft, whose \"Final Fantasy VII\", and Enix (later merged with Squaresoft to create Square Enix), whose \"Dragon Quest VII\" titles were initially pre-planned for the N64; while some who remained released fewer games to the Nintendo 64 (Konami, releasing only thirteen N64 games but over fifty on the PlayStation). While new games were coming out rapidly for the PlayStation, new Nintendo 64 game releases were less frequent and that system's biggest successes were developed by either Nintendo itself or by second-parties, such as Rare. The lower production costs also allowed publishers an additional source of profit: budget-priced reissues of titles which had already recouped their development costs.\n",

                "Cytus\n\nCytus is a rhythm game developed by Rayark Games, an independent game developer in Taiwan. It was first released on the iOS platform on January 12, 2012. The game was later released on Android on August 7, 2012. A port for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Mobile, titled Cytus: Lambda, was released on June 26, 2013. An arcade version titled Cytus: Omega in collaboration with Capcom is revealed at JAEPO in February 2015 and is set for location testing in July 2015.\n\nThe name \"Cytus\" is taken from Cocytus, the Greek mythological river of wailing or lamentation. \"Cytus\" features a story plot that is carried through its 10 main chapters as well as a prologue. The story revolves around the protagonist, Vanessa, who lives in a 22nd-century world where robots with human memories are the only remaining sentient beings while living humans are killed by a mutant virus. Due to limited memory space, human emotions are stored in the form of music in \"Cytus\", and by playing the songs, the robots are able to revive their human emotions. The plot features the disaster and the protagonist's struggle with identity. The story is told in-game through various cut-scenes that are unique to the chapter title songs; in comparison, the other individual songs within each chapter are at most only marginally relevant to the plot, except for a limited few.\n\nEven though it is a mobile game, it needs high specification. It requires 950MB of storage space. (9.X version). The data of the songs not purchased have to be downloaded together even though it’s not needed. And after the update to Cytus 10.0, the storage amount increased to 1.54GB in iOS.\n\nThe game needs at least iOS 7.0 on the basis of 2016/09/06 Cytus 10.0 update. An iPhone must be at least iPhone 5, and it will not work under iOS 7. If older versions of the game were previously installed, then it can be played normally. This app is a 64-bit app, which means it is also compatible with iOS 11 and later.\n\nThe game needs at least 600MB of storage and 1GHz of CPU and 140MB of relaxation in memory of 512MB RAM on Android 2.2. Playing the game on power save mode is almost impossible. Specifically, in Galaxy S3, auto haptic is released.\n\nThe game was released on 2013/6/26. It is a Play Station game, and can be downloaded in PSM store (A store for PS games). The game is optimized well, but it takes a long time to load. 0.5 seconds~ 3 seconds is taken to load, affected by the environment of the Play Station.\nThe storage amount is 599MB (Version 5.00). Almost nothing is different from the phone game Cytus. The price is 1,234￥(Japan), 9.69￡(England), 18.95 (Australia Dollar), 11.99 (American Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro). One of the uncomfortable parts of the game is update. The game cannot be updated by just downloading the patch file. The whole game file has to be downloaded again.\n\nThe game was revealed in 2015 February. It was revealed in the event ‘crossbeats REV.’ However, the game isn’t released yet. It isn’t much different from the phone game cytus, but it shows the note that has to be touched first. Also, notes that have to be touched at the same time have small horns to be distinguished easily.\n\nThe game was revealed in 2015 December. It was revealed at RayarkCon 2015. As of January 18, 2018, the game is now available to the public. Cytus II features similar game mechanics to the previous title.\n\nThe main gameplay of \"Cytus\" features the Active Scan Line, a black line that move up and down across the screen. The player taps circular objects, referred to as Notes, as the Active Scan Line passes over them, following the music.\n\nThree types of Notes are used. The Click Note, a single circular note, requires tapping the object in time. The Drag Note, a continuous track of notes, requires dragging along the track. The Hold Note, a note with an extended ribbon meter, requires holding over the note until the meter is filled. Notes to be hit as the line rises are colored blue and purple, while those as the line drops are colored yellow and green.\n\nEach Note is judged by the accuracy to be either Perfect, Good, Bad or Miss. The better the accuracy, the higher score is given. The maximum score is 1,000,000, and a minimum of 700,000 is required to clear a stage. Basic score is 900,000, the score is divided equally into every note. Combo score is 100,000, the score is proportional to square of the maximum combo. Also, the maximum TP score is 100, and TP Perfect, NM Perfect, Good, Bad, Miss is calculated 100%, 70%, 30%, 0%, 0%, respectively. After a stage ends, various metrics are provided to show the player's performance, including score, TP, a letter grade, and numbers of hits in each type of judgement. Score system is referred: Fail below 700,000, C below 800,000, B below 900,000, A below 950,000, S below 1,000,000, Million Master at 1,000,000.\n\n\"Cytus\" includes more than 100 songs available for play in the game, spanning a variety of genres including pop music, trance music and drum and bass. The music is composed and performed by independent composers and artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. Vocaloid engines are also used. A number of songs also has alternate version(s) in addition to the normal version. These can be called upon by interacting with the song artwork in the song selection screen. Gestures used includes tapping, swiping and holding at a specific timing and location.\n\n\"Cytus\" also includes a series of songs in image of the overarching plot, collectively named Cytus: Alive, added in version 6.0 in July 2014. Unlike normal songs, \"Cytus: Alive\" songs contains added plot animation during gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll composed by VGO(Video Game Orchestra).\n\n\n\nAll composed by Ice & gaQden. tap \"L\" silhouette to play insane mode each song.\n\n\nAll composed by Night Keepers, except Times Difference War.\n\n\n\"Cytus\" is available through the Apple App Store and Google Play. The full game charges a base price plus optional in-app purchases for players to purchase additional chapters of playable songs.\n\nThe release on Google Play is free but features a cooldown timer before starting each song. The cooldown will be removed when the full price is paid.\n\nThe PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Mobile port \"Cytus: Lambda\" includes the then-exclusive chapter Prologue: Live, otherwise identical to its smartphone releases. A teaser video was released onto YouTube prior to release on June 7, 2013.\n\nRayark Games announced the Million Downloads Plan () in the wake of \"illegal piracy harming the sales figures of \"Cytus\"\". Starting from Version 2.0.0, a 10-song chapter will be made available to all players for free for each 100,000 paid downloads achieved, up to a million paid downloads or ten chapters. The plan is completed with Version 8.0, released in July 2015, opening ten chapters for free, including the special Chapter Million featuring remixes of past songs.\n\n\nMultiple \"Cytus\" soundtracks have been released both on iTunes and as physical CD, featuring playable music and background composition from the game. Cytus -Prologue-, was released on April 1, 2012, Cytus -Hindsight- on December 10, 2013 and Cytus -Foresight- on December 28, 2013. A story album called Cytus -Alive- has also been released on August 20, 2012; the album features songs composed by Sta and Cranky with the same names as the ten chapters of the game. Each song corresponds to each chapter in the story plot.\n\nCode: Cytus () is a multimedia video game music stage production based on the story of \"Cytus\", produced by Divertimento Media () as commissioned by Quanta Arts Foundation (). The production ran four shows in November 2014 in Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Final Fantasy X\n\nSet in the fantasy world of Spira, the game's story revolves around a group of adventurers and their quest to defeat a rampaging monster known as Sin. The player character is Tidus, a star athlete in the fictional sport of blitzball, who finds himself in the world Spira after his home city of Zanarkand is destroyed by Sin. Shortly after arriving to Spira, Tidus joins the summoner Yuna on her pilgrimage to destroy Sin.\n\nDevelopment of \"Final Fantasy X\" began in 1999, with a budget of more than US$32.3 million (US$ million in dollars) and a team of more than 100 people. The game was the first in the main series not entirely scored by Nobuo Uematsu; Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano were signed as Uematsu's fellow composers. \"Final Fantasy X\" was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 8 million units worldwide. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time. On March 3, 2003, it was followed by \"Final Fantasy X-2\", making it the first \"Final Fantasy\" game to have a direct game sequel. Square Enix announced in 2013 that the \"Final Fantasy X\" series has sold over 14 million copies worldwide.\n\nLike previous games in the series, \"Final Fantasy X\" is presented in a third-person perspective, with players directly navigating the main character, Tidus, around the world to interact with objects and people. Unlike previous games, however, the world and town maps have been fully integrated, with terrain outside of cities rendered to scale. As Tidus explores the world, he randomly encounters enemies. When an enemy is encountered, the environment switches to a turn-based battle area where characters and enemies await their turn to attack.\n\nThe gameplay of \"Final Fantasy X\" differs from that of previous \"Final Fantasy\" games in its lack of a top-down perspective world map. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In \"Final Fantasy X\", almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never fade out to a world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game's locations, though an airship becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, \"Final Fantasy X\" features numerous minigames, most notably the fictional underwater sport \"blitzball\".\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" introduces the \"Conditional Turn-Based Battle\" system in place of the series' traditional \"Active Time Battle\" system first used in \"Final Fantasy IV\". Whereas the ATB concept features real-time elements, the CTB system is a turn-based format that pauses the battle during each of the player's turns. Thus, the CTB design allows the player to select an action without time pressure. A graphical timeline along the upper-right side of the screen details who will be receiving turns next, and how various actions taken will affect the subsequent order of turns. The ordering of turns can be affected by a number of spells, items, and abilities that inflict status effects upon the controlled characters or the enemies. The player can control up to three characters in battle, though a swapping system allows the player to replace them with a character outside the active party at any time. \"Limit Breaks\", highly damaging special attacks, reappear in \"Final Fantasy X\" as \"Overdrives\". In this new incarnation of the feature, most of the techniques are interactive, requiring button inputs to increase their effectiveness. While initially the Overdrives can be used when the character receives a significant amount of damage, the player is able to modify the requirements to unlock them.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" introduces an overhaul of the summoning system employed in previous games of the series. Whereas in previous titles a summoned creature would arrive, perform one action, and then depart, the \"Aeons\" of \"Final Fantasy X\" arrive and entirely replace the battle party, fighting in their place until either the aeon wins the battle, is defeated itself, or is dismissed by the player. Aeons have their own statistics, commands, special attacks, spells, and Overdrives. The player acquires five aeons over the course of the game through the completion of Cloister of Trials puzzles, but three additional aeons can be obtained by completing various side-quests.\n\nAs with previous titles in the series, players have the opportunity to develop and improve their characters by defeating enemies and acquiring items, though the traditional experience point system is replaced by a new system called the \"Sphere Grid\". Instead of characters gaining pre-determined statistic bonuses for their attributes after leveling up, each character gains \"Sphere Levels\" after collecting enough Ability Points (AP). Sphere Levels allow players to move around the Sphere Grid, a pre-determined grid of interconnected nodes consisting of various statistic and ability bonuses. \"Spheres\" are applied to these nodes, unlocking its function for the selected character.\n\nThe Sphere Grid system also allows players to fully customize characters in contrast to their intended battle roles, such as turning the White Mage-roled Yuna into a physical powerhouse and the swordsman Auron into a healer. The \"International\" and PAL versions of the game include an optional \"Expert\" version of the Sphere Grid; in these versions, all of the characters start in the middle of the grid and may follow whichever path the player chooses. As a trade-off, the Expert grid has fewer nodes in total, thus decreasing the total statistic upgrades available during the game.\n\nBlitzball is a minigame that requires strategy and tactics. The underwater sport is played in a large, hovering sphere of water surrounded by a larger audience of onlookers. The player controls one character at a time as they swim through the sphere performing passes, tackles, and attempts to score. The gameplay is similar to that of the main game in the way that the controlled character moves through the area until they encounter an enemy. In this case, the enemy is a member of the opposing team. Status effects are also implemented in the minigame as each player can learn techniques that are equivalent to abilities in the main game.\n\nBlitzball is first introduced in the beginning of the game during one of the early cinematic sequences in which Tidus, the main character who is described as a star blitzball player, is part of an intense game. It is the only minigame that plays a role in the overall plot line as it is not only a main part of Tidus's character, but it's also in the first scene where the game's main antagonist, Sin is shown. Unlike with the other minigames, playing blitzball is mandatory near the beginning of the game, but it is later optional.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" is set in the fictional world of Spira, consisting of one large landmass divided into three subcontinents, surrounded by small tropical islands. It features diverse climates, ranging from the tropical Besaid and Kilika islands, to the temperate Mi'ihen region, to the frigid Macalania and Mt. Gagazet areas. Although predominantly populated by humans, Spira features a variety of races. Among them are the Al Bhed, a technologically advanced but disenfranchised sub-group of humans with distinctive green eyes and unique language. The Guado, which are less human in appearance, with elongated fingers and other arboreal features. Still less human are the lion-like Ronso and the frog-like Hypello. A subset of Spira's sentient races are the \"unsent\", the strong-willed spirits of the dead that remain in corporeal form. In Spira, the dead who are not sent to the Farplane by a summoner come to envy the living and transform into \"fiends\", the monsters that are encountered throughout the game; however, unsent with strong attachments to the world of the living may retain their human form. Other fauna in Spira, aside from those drawn from real animals, such as cats, dogs, birds, and butterflies, include the gigantic, amphibious shoopufs (which are similar to elephants); and the emu-like chocobo, which appears in most \"Final Fantasy\" games. Spira is very different from the mainly European-style worlds found in previous \"Final Fantasy\" games, being much more closely modeled on Southeast Asia, most notably with respect to vegetation, topography, architecture, and names.\n\nThere are seven main playable characters in \"Final Fantasy X\", starting with Tidus, a cheerful young teenager and a star blitzball player from Zanarkand, who seeks a way home after an encounter with Sin transported him to Spira. To do so, he joins Yuna , a summoner on a journey to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat the enormous whale-like \"Sin\". Journeying with them are: Kimahri Ronso, a young warrior of the Ronso tribe who watched over Yuna during her childhood; Wakka, a blitzball player whose younger brother was killed by Sin; and Lulu, a stoic black mage close to Yuna and Wakka. During the journey, they are joined by Auron, a former warrior monk, who worked with both Tidus' and Yuna's fathers to defeat Sin 10 years prior; and Rikku, Yuna's cousin, a perky Al Bhed girl and the first friendly person Tidus meets upon arriving in Spira.\n\nThe main protagonist Tidus waits with his allies outside the ruins of an ancient city. Tidus narrates the events that led to the present, spanning most of the game's storyline. It begins in Tidus's home city, the high-tech metropolis of Zanarkand, where he is a renowned star of the underwater sport blitzball, and son of the famous blitzball star, Jecht. During a blitzball tournament, the city is attacked by an immense creature that Auron, a man not originally from Zanarkand, calls \"Sin\". Sin destroys Zanarkand, taking Tidus and Auron to the world of Spira.\n\nUpon arriving in Spira, Tidus is rescued by Al Bhed salvagers in the area, who speak a language that is foreign to Tidus. Upon asking him where he is from, one of them, Rikku, who speaks the same language as Tidus, tells him that Sin destroyed Zanarkand 1,000 years ago. After Sin attacks again, Tidus is separated from the divers and drifts to the tropical island of Besaid, where he meets Wakka, captain of the local blitzball team, when he impresses them with his blitzball skills. Wakka introduces Tidus to Yuna, a young summoner about to go on a pilgrimage to obtain the Final Aeon and defeat Sin with her guardians Lulu, a mage of black magic, and Kimahri, a member of the Ronso tribe. Meanwhile, Tidus joins to help Wakka in the upcoming blitzball tournament to find a way back home. The party travels across Spira to gather aeons, defending against attacks by Sin and its \"offspring\"—fiends called Sinspawn. After the tournament, they are joined by Auron, who convinces Tidus to become Yuna's guardian. He reveals to Tidus that Yuna's father, Lord Braska; Tidus's father, Jecht; and himself made the same pilgrimage to defeat Sin ten years ago. Tidus thought his father had died at sea ten years earlier. Following another attack from Sin, they are joined by Rikku, later revealed to be Yuna's cousin.\n\nWhen the party arrives in the city of Guadosalam, the leader of the Guado, Seymour Guado, proposes to Yuna, saying that it will ease Spira's sorrow. At Macalania Temple, the group sees a message from Seymour's father Jyscal's spirit, who declares he was killed by his son, who now aims to destroy Spira. The group reunites with Yuna to engage Seymour in battle, killing him; soon afterward, Sin attacks, separating Yuna from the others. While searching for her on Bikanel Island, the homeland of the Al Bhed where they had surfaced, Tidus has an emotional breakdown when he learns that summoners die after summoning the Final Aeon, leading to his desire to find a way to defeat Sin while keeping Yuna alive. The group finds Yuna in Bevelle, where she is being forced to marry the unsent Seymour. They crash the wedding and escape with Yuna. The group is captured at the Bevelle temple, and are ordered to stand trial. After escaping from their sentence, the group heads towards the ruins of Zanarkand, seen in the introduction of the game.\n\nOn the way there, Tidus learns that he, Jecht, and the Zanarkand they hail from are summoned entities akin to aeons based on the original Zanarkand and its people. Long ago, the original Zanarkand battled Bevelle in a machina war, in which the former was defeated. Zanarkand's survivors became \"fayth\" so that they could use their memories of Zanarkand to create a new city in their image, removed from the reality of Spira. One thousand years after its creation, the fayth have become exhausted from \"dreaming\" their Zanarkand, but are unable to stop due to Sin's influence.\n\nOnce they reach Zanarkand, Yunalesca—the first summoner to defeat Sin and unsent ever since—tells the group that the Final Aeon is created from the fayth of one close to the summoner. After defeating Sin, the Final Aeon kills the summoner and transforms into a new Sin, which has caused its cycle of rebirth to continue. Yuna decides against using the Final Aeon, due to the futile sacrifices it carries and the fact that Sin would still be reborn. Disappointed by their resolution, Yunalesca tries to kill Tidus' group, but she is defeated and vanishes, ending hope of ever attaining the Final Aeon. After the fight, the group learns that Yu Yevon, a summoner who lost his humanity and mind, is behind Sin's cycle of rebirth. This leads the group to infiltrate Sin's body to battle Seymour, and Jecht's imprisoned spirit. With Sin's host defeated, Tidus' group battles and defeats Yu Yevon. Sin's cycle of rebirth ends, and the spirits of Spira's fayth are freed from their imprisonment. Auron, who had earlier been revealed to be unsent, goes to the Farplane. Just then, Dream Zanarkand and Tidus disappear, now that the freed fayth stopped the summoning. Afterward, in a speech to the citizens of Spira, Yuna resolves to help rebuild their world now that it is free of Sin. In a post-credits scene, Tidus awakens under water. He then swims towards the ocean surface, and the screen fades to white.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\"s development began in 1999, costing approximately ¥4 billion (approximately US$ million in dollars) with a crew of over 100 people, most of whom worked on previous games in the series. Executive producer Hironobu Sakaguchi has stated that although he had concerns about the transition from 2D to 3D backgrounds, the voice acting, and the transition to real-time story-telling, the success of the \"Final Fantasy\" series can be attributed to constantly challenging the development team to try new things. Producer Yoshinori Kitase was also the chief director of \"Final Fantasy X\", while the direction of events, maps and battles was split up between Motomu Toriyama, Takayoshi Nakazato and Toshiro Tsuchida, respectively. The development of the script for the game took three to four months, with the same amount of time dedicated to the voice recording afterwards. Kazushige Nojima collaborated with Daisuke Watanabe, Toriyama and Kitase on writing the scenario for \"Final Fantasy X\". Nojima was particularly concerned with establishing a connection in the relationship between player and main character. Thus, he penned the story such that the player's progress through the world and growing knowledge about it is reflected in Tidus' own understanding and narration.\n\nCharacter designer Tetsuya Nomura has identified the South Pacific, Thailand and Japan as major influences on the cultural and geographic design of Spira, particularly concerning the geographic location of the southern Besaid and Kilika islands. He has also said that Spira deviates from the worlds of past \"Final Fantasy\" games in the level of detail incorporated, something he has expressed to have made a conscious effort to maintain during the design process. Kitase felt that if the setting went back to a medieval European fantasy, it would not seem to help the development team advance. While he was thinking of different world environments, Nojima suggested a fantasy world that incorporated Asian elements. Sub-character chief designer Fumi Nakashima's focus was to ensure that characters from different regions and cultures bore distinctive characteristics in their clothing styles, so that they could be quickly and easily identified as members of their respective sub-groups. For example, she has said that the masks and goggles of the Al Bhed give the group a \"strange and eccentric\" appearance, while the attire of the Ronso lend to them being able to easily engage in battle. Tidus' relationship with his father Jecht was based \"stories throughout the ages, such as the ancient Greek legends.\" This would eventually reveal the key of Sin's weakness and eventual defeat.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" features innovations in the rendering of characters' facial expressions, achieved through motion capture and skeletal animation technology. This technology allowed animators to create realistic lip movements, which were then programmed to match the speech of the game's voice actors. Nojima has revealed that the inclusion of voice acting enabled him to express emotion more powerfully than before, and he was therefore able to keep the storyline simple. He also said that the presence of voice actors led him to make various changes to the script, in order to match the voice actors' personalities with the characters they were portraying. The inclusion of voice, however, led to difficulties. With the game's cutscenes already programmed around the Japanese voice work, the English localization team faced the difficulty of establishing English-oriented dialogue and the obstacle of incorporating this modified wording with the rhythm and timing of the characters' lip movements. Localization specialist Alexander O. Smith noted that they had to keep the localized sound file within the duration of the original Japanese, as longer files would cause the game to crash. He described the process of fitting natural-sounding English speech into the game as \"something akin to writing four or five movies' worth of dialogue entirely in haiku form [and] of course the actors had to act, and act well, within those restraints.\"\n\nThe game was initially going to feature online elements, offered through Square's PlayOnline service. The features, however, were dropped during production, and online gaming would not become part of the \"Final Fantasy\" series until \"Final Fantasy XI\". Map director Nakazato wanted to implement a world map concept with a more realistic approach than that of the traditional \"Final Fantasy\" game, in line with the realism of the game's 3D backgrounds, as opposed to pre-rendered backgrounds. As a player of the games in the \"Final Fantasy\" series, battle director Tsuchida wanted to recreate elements he found interesting or entertaining, which eventually led to the removal of the \"Active Time Battle\" system, and instead, incorporated the strategy-focused \"Conditional Turn-Based Battle\" system. Originally, \"Final Fantasy X\" was going to feature wandering enemies visible on the field map, seamless transitions into battles, and the option for players to move around the landscape during enemy encounters. Battle art director Shintaro Takai has explained that it was his intention that battles in \"Final Fantasy X\" come across as a natural part of the story and not an independent element. However, due to hardware limitations, this idea was not used. Instead, a compromise was made, whereby some transitions from the field map to the battle map were made relatively seamless with the implementation of a motion blur effect that would happen at the end of an event scene. The desire for seamless transitions also led to the implementation of the new summoning system seen in the game. Kitase has explained that the purpose behind the Sphere Grid is to give players an interactive means of increasing their characters' attributes, such that they will be able to observe the development of those attributes firsthand. The developers experienced difficulty with the scene of Tidus and Yuna kissing, as they were not used to animating romance scenes. Visual Works director Kazuyuki Ikumori stated that this was due to the use of 3D models in the scene. Because of the negative response from female members of staff, the scene was remade multiple times.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" marks the first time regular series composer Nobuo Uematsu has had any assistance in composing the score for a game in the main series. His fellow composers for \"Final Fantasy X\" were Masashi Hamauzu and Junya Nakano. They were chosen for the soundtrack based on their ability to create music that was different from Uematsu's style while still being able to work together. PlayOnline.com first revealed that the game's theme song was completed in November 2000. As Square still had not revealed who would sing the song, GameSpot personally asked Uematsu, who jokingly answered \"It's going to be Rod Stewart.\"\n\nThe game features three songs with vocalized elements, including the J-pop ballad \"Suteki da ne\", which translates to \"Isn't it Wonderful?\". The lyrics were written by Kazushige Nojima, and the music was written by Uematsu. The song is performed by Japanese folk singer Rikki, whom the music team contacted while searching for a singer whose music reflected an Okinawan atmosphere. \"Suteki da ne\" is also sung in Japanese in the English version of \"Final Fantasy X\". Like \"Eyes on Me\" from \"Final Fantasy VIII\" and \"Melodies of Life\" from \"Final Fantasy IX\", an orchestrated version of \"Suteki da ne\" is used as part of the ending theme. The other songs with lyrics are the heavy metal opening theme, \"Otherworld\", sung in English by Bill Muir; and \"Hymn of the Fayth\", a recurring piece sung using Japanese syllabary.\n\nThe original soundtrack spanned 91 tracks on four discs. It was first released in Japan on August 1, 2001, by DigiCube, and was re-released on May 10, 2004, by Square Enix. In 2002, Tokyopop released a version of \"Final Fantasy X Original Soundtrack\" in North America entitled \"Final Fantasy X Official Soundtrack\", which contained 17 tracks from the original album on a single disc. Other related CDs include \"feel/Go dream: Yuna & Tidus\" which, released in Japan by DigiCube on October 11, 2001, featured tracks based on Tidus' and Yuna's characters. \"Piano Collections Final Fantasy X\", another collection of music from the game, and \"Final Fantasy X Vocal Collection\", a compilations of exclusive character dialogues and songs were both in Japan in 2002.\n\nThe Black Mages, a band led by Nobuo Uematsu that arranges music from \"Final Fantasy\" video games into a rock music style, have arranged three pieces from \"Final Fantasy X\". These are \"Fight With Seymour\" from their self-titled album, published in 2003, and \"Otherworld\" and \"The Skies Above\", both of which can be found on the album \"\", published in 2004. Uematsu continues to perform certain pieces in his \"Dear Friends: Music from Final Fantasy\" concert series. The music of \"Final Fantasy X\" has also appeared in various official concerts and live albums, such as \"20020220 Music from Final Fantasy\", a live recording of an orchestra performing music from the series including several pieces from the game. An odd note; the unreleased/promo CD-R (Instrumental) version of Madonna's \"What It Feels Like For A Girl\" done by Tracy Young was used in the blitzball sequences. Additionally, \"Swing de Chocobo\" was performed by the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra for the \"Distant Worlds – Music from Final Fantasy\" concert tour, while \"Zanarkand\" was performed by the New Japan Philharmonic Orchestra in the \"Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy\" concert series. Independent but officially licensed releases of \"Final Fantasy X\" music have been composed by such groups as Project Majestic Mix, which focuses on arranging video game music. Selections also appear on Japanese remix albums, called \"dojin music\", and on English remixing websites.\n\nThe Japanese version of \"Final Fantasy X\" included an additional disc entitled \"The Other Side of Final Fantasy\", which featured interviews, storyboards, and trailers for \"Blue Wing Blitz\", \"Kingdom Hearts\", and \"\", as well as the first footage of \"Final Fantasy XI\". An international version of the game was released in Japan as \"Final Fantasy X International\" in January 2002, and in PAL regions under its original title. It features content not available in the original NTSC releases, including battles with \"Dark\" versions of the game's aeons and an airship fight with the superboss \"Penance\". The Japanese release of \"Final Fantasy X International\" also includes \"Eternal Calm\", a 14-minute video clip bridging the story of \"Final Fantasy X\" with that of its sequel, \"Final Fantasy X-2\". The video clip was included in a bonus DVD for \"Unlimited Saga Collector's Edition\" under the name \"Eternal Calm, Final Fantasy X-2: Prologue\". It was first released in Europe on October 31, 2003, and featured English voice-overs.\n\nThe international and PAL versions include a bonus DVD called \"Beyond Final Fantasy\", a disc including interviews with the game's developers, and two of the game's English voice actors, James Arnold Taylor (Tidus) and Hedy Burress (Yuna). Also included are trailers for \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Kingdom Hearts\", a concept and promotional art gallery for the game, and a music video of \"Suteki da ne\" performed by Rikki. In 2005, a compilation featuring \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Final Fantasy X-2\" was released in Japan as \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 Ultimate Box\".\n\nSquare also produced various types of merchandise and several books, including \"The Art of Final Fantasy X\" and three \"Ultimania\" guides, a series of artbooks/strategy guides published by DigiCube in Japan. They feature original artwork from \"Final Fantasy X\", offer gameplay walkthroughs, expand upon many aspects of the game's storyline and feature several interviews with the game's designers. There are three books in the series: \"Final Fantasy X Scenario Ultimania\", \"Final Fantasy X Battle Ultimania\", and \"Final Fantasy X Ultimania Ω\". On December 18, 2012 the game was re-released as part of the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" release.\n\nOn September 13, 2011, Square Enix announced that \"Final Fantasy X\" would be re-released in high-definition for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, in celebration of the game's 10-year anniversary. In January 2012, production of the game had started. Producer Yoshinori Kitase was once again involved in the production of the game, wishing to work on its quality. On February 18, 2013 the first footage of the PlayStation Vita version of \"Final Fantasy X HD\" was released, showing off HD models of Tidus, Yuna, Bahamut and Yojimbo. On March 19, it was confirmed that the PS3 version of the game would also include its sequel \"X-2\", and that it would be remastered in HD. The two HD remastered games for the PS3 were released under the title \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster\" on a single Blu-ray disc game, and was sold separately on game cartridges on Vita in Japan and sold together in North America, Europe & Australia as a set, with \"FFX\" being on a cartridge and \"FFX-2\" being included as a download voucher. Downloadable versions are available for both systems. Square Enix launched an official website for the two HD remastered titles in March 2013. The games contain all the content found in the \"International\" version, including \"Eternal Calm\" and \"Last Mission\". During the PlayStation China press conference that took place in Shanghai on December 11, 2014, Square Enix confirmed \"Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster\" would be released for the PlayStation 4 in Spring 2015. It was released in North America on May 12, Australia & Japan on May 14 and Europe on May 15, 2015. It included enhanced graphics in full HD (1080p), the option to switch to the original soundtrack and the ability to transfer save files from the PS3 & PS Vita versions. One year later on May 12, 2016, it was released for Microsoft Windows via Steam. It includes an auto-save feature, 5 game boosters, 3 parameter changes, the option to skip FMVs/cinematics, 4K resolution support, audio settings and graphic options.\n\nSquare expected the game to sell at least two million copies worldwide owing to the reduced PlayStation 2's fanbase, making it smaller than the last three released titles. However, within four days of its release in Japan, the game had sold over 1.4 million copies in pre-orders, which set a record for the fastest-selling console RPG. These figures exceeded the performances of \"Final Fantasy VII\" and \"IX\" in a comparable period, and \"Final Fantasy X\" became the first PlayStation 2 game to reach two million and four million sold copies. In October 2007, the game was listed as the 8th best-selling game for the PlayStation 2. \"Final Fantasy X\" sold over 2.26 million copies in Japan alone in 2001, and sold 6.6 million copies worldwide by January 2004. By July 2006, it had sold 2.3 million copies and earned $95 million in the United States(US$ million in ). \"Next Generation\" ranked it as the 11th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country.\n\nThe \"Ultimate Hits\" bargain reissue of the game in September 2005 sold over 131,000 copies in Japan by the end of 2006. In October 2013, Square Enix announced \"Final Fantasy X\" and its sequel \"Final Fantasy X-2\" have together sold over 14 million copies worldwide on PlayStation 2.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" received critical acclaim by the media. The Japanese video game magazine \"Famitsu\" and \"Famitsu PS2\" awarded the game a near-perfect 39/40 score. Another Japanese gaming magazine, \"The Play Station\", gave the game a score of 29/30. \"Famitsu\", \"Famitsu PS2\", and \"The Play Station\" expressed particularly favorable responses toward the game's storyline, graphics, and movies. The game maintains a 92 out of 100 on Metacritic. Producer Shinji Hashimoto stated that the overall reception to the game was \"excellent\", having received praise and awards from the media.\n\nIGN's David Smith offered praise for the voice actors and the innovations in gameplay, particularly with the revised battle and summon systems, the option to change party members during battle, and the character development and inventory management systems. They also felt that the game's graphics had improved on its predecessors in every way possible, and that the game as a whole was \"the best-looking game of the series [and] arguably the best-playing as well\". Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised the game's storyline, calling it surprisingly complex, its ending satisfying, and its avoidance of role-playing game clichés commendable with Tidus viewed as an appealing protagonist. He also lauded the music, feeling it was \"diverse and well suited to the various scenes in the game\". Similarly, \"GamePro\" described its character building system and battle system as \"two of the best innovations in the series\". The visuals of the game were commended by GameSpy's Raymond Padilla, who referred to them as \"top-notch\", as well as giving praise to the character models, backgrounds, cutscenes, and animations. The voice casting was praised by Game Revolution who noted most of them were \"above average\" and called the music \"rich\".\n\n\"Edge\" rated the game considerably lower, criticizing many aspects of the game for being tedious and uninnovative and describing the dialogue as \"nauseating\", particularly panning Tidus. Andrew Reiner of \"Game Informer\" criticized the game's linearity and that players were no longer able to travel the world by chocobo or control the airship. Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell noted that the game's puzzle segments were \"depressing\" and \"superfluous\", and that although the Sphere Grid was \"a nice touch\", it took up too much of the game. The linearity of the game was positively commented on by \"GamePro\" who stated that a player would not be required to participate in side-quests or the mini-game to reach the game's conclusion, finding some of them unappealing. Game Revolution complained that cutscenes could not be skipped, some even being too long.\n\n\"Final Fantasy X\" received the Best Game Award from the Japan Game Awards for 2001–2002. In GameSpot's \"Best and Worst Awards\" from 2001, it came seventh in the category \"Top 10 Video Games of the Year\". Readers of \"Famitsu\" magazine voted it the best game of all time in early 2006. \"Final Fantasy X\" came in fifth on IGN's \"Top 25 PS2 Games of All Time\" list in 2007 and sixth in \"The Top 10 Best Looking PS2 Games of All Time\". In a similar list by GameSpy, the game took the 21st place. 1UP.com listed its revelation during the ending as the third-biggest video game spoiler, while IGN ranked the ending as the fifth best pre-rendered cutscene. In a Reader's Choice made in 2006 by IGN, it ranked as the 60th-best video game. It was also named one of the 20 essential Japanese role-playing games by Gamasutra. It also placed 43rd in \"Game Informer\"s list of \"The Top 200 Games of All Time\". In 2004, \"Final Fantasy X\" was listed as one of the best games ever made by GameFAQs, while in November 2005 it was voted as the 12th \"Best Game Ever\". In a general overview of the series, both GamesRadar and IGN listed \"Final Fantasy X\" as the fourth best game. At the sixth annual Interactive Achievement Awards in 2003, it was nominated for \"Outstanding Achievement in Animation\" and \"Console Role-Playing Game of the Year\". At the end of 2007, it was named the ninth best-selling RPG by \"Guinness World Records\". Readers from GameFaqs also voted it as Game of the Year during 2001. In 2008, readers of \"Dengeki\" magazine voted it the second best game ever made. It was voted first place in \"Famitsu\"s and \"Dengeki\"s polls of most tear-inducing games of all time. Both Tidus and Yuna have been popular characters in games in general due to their personalities and their romantic relationship.\n\nDue to its commercial and critical success, Square Enix released a direct sequel to \"Final Fantasy X\" in 2003, titled \"Final Fantasy X-2\". The sequel is set two years after the conclusion of \"Final Fantasy X\", establishing new conflicts and dilemmas and resolving loose ends left by the original game. Although the sequel did not sell as well as the original, 5.29 million units versus 8 million units, it can still be considered a commercial success. As a result of the title's popularity, Yoshinori Kitase and Kazushige Nojima decided to establish a plot-related connection between \"Final Fantasy X\" and \"Final Fantasy VII\", another well-received\" Final Fantasy\" game. In 2013, after the release of the HD Remaster, Nojima stated that he would like to see a second sequel to \"X\", and if there were demand for it, it could happen. The minigame of blitzball has made it into other games, such as \"Final Fantasy X-2\", and was mentioned as a possibility for \"\".\n\nThe advancements in portraying realistic emotions achieved with \"Final Fantasy X\" through voice-overs and detailed facial expressions have since become a staple of the series, with \"Final Fantasy X-2\" and other subsequent titles (such as \"\", \"Final Fantasy XII\", \"XIII\" and its sequels, and \"XV\") also featuring this development. Traversing real-time 3D environments instead of an overworld map has also become a standard of the series, as demonstrated in \"Final Fantasy XI\", \"XII\", \"XIII\" and its sequels, \"XIV\" and \"XV\". Final Fantasy X can be considered a pioneer in 3-D RPG maps.\n\n"
