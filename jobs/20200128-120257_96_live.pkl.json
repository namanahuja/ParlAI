                "Imagine Dragons\n\nImagine Dragons is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, consisting of lead vocalist Dan Reynolds, lead guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist and keyboardist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. The band first gained exposure with the release of single \"It's Time\", followed by their award-winning debut studio album \"Night Visions\" (2012), which resulted in the chart topping singles \"Radioactive\" and \"Demons\". \"Billboard\" placed them at the top of their \"Year In Rock\" rankings for 2013 and 2017 and named them their \"Breakthrough Band of 2013\". and \"Biggest Band of 2017.\" \"Rolling Stone\" named their single \"Radioactive\", which holds the record for most weeks on the Hot 100, from \"Night Visions\" the \"biggest rock hit of the year\", and MTV called them \"the year's biggest breakout band\". The band's second studio album \"Smoke + Mirrors\" (2015) reached number one in the US, Canada and the UK. After a brief hiatus, the band released their third studio album, \"Evolve\" (2017) which resulted in the chart-topping singles, \"Believer\" and \"Thunder\". While all three albums were commercially successful, critical reception was mixed.\n\nImagine Dragons has won three American Music Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, one Grammy Award, and one World Music Award. In May 2014, the band was nominated for fourteen Billboard Music Awards, including Top Artist of the Year and a Milestone Award, which recognizes innovation and creativity of artists across different genres. Imagine Dragons have sold 12 million albums and 35 million singles worldwide.\n\nIn 2008, lead singer Dan Reynolds met drummer Andrew Tolman at Brigham Young University where they were both students. Reynolds and Tolman added Andrew Beck, Dave Lemke, and Aurora Florence to play guitar, bass, and piano respectively for their band. Their name is an anagram for a phrase only known to members of the group, that Reynolds stated each member approved of. The five-piece released an extended play titled \"Speak to Me\" that same year. Beck and Florence would also depart from the band's lineup that year. In 2009, Tolman recruited longtime high school friend Wayne Sermon, who had graduated from Berklee College of Music to play guitar. Tolman later recruited his wife, Brittany Tolman, to sing backup and play keys, and the band began to play shows together again. Lemke left the band later on, leading Sermon to recruit another Berklee music student, Ben McKee, to join the band as their bassist and complete the lineup. The band garnered a large following in their hometown of Provo, Utah, before the members moved to Las Vegas, the hometown of Dan Reynolds, where the band recorded and released their first three EPs.\n\nThe band released EPs titled \"Imagine Dragons\" and \"Hell and Silence\" in 2010, both recorded at Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas. They returned to the studio in 2011. The third EP, \"It's Time\", was made before they signed a record deal.\n\nThey got their first big break when Train's frontman Pat Monahan fell sick just prior to the Bite of Las Vegas Festival 2009. Imagine Dragons were called to fill in and performed to a crowd of more than 26,000 people. Local accolades including \"Best CD of 2011\" (\"Vegas SEVEN\"), \"Best Local Indie Band 2010\" (\"Las Vegas Weekly\"), \"Las Vegas' Newest Must See Live Act\" (\"Las Vegas CityLife\"), Vegas Music Summit Headliner 2010, and more sent the band on a positive trajectory. In November 2011 they signed with Interscope Records and began working with English Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid. Eventually the Tolmans would leave the group and Daniel Platzman would be recruited in August 2011 by invitation from Ben McKee, prior to the signing of band's label deal in November 2011, alongside keyboardist Theresa Flaminio.\n\nTheresa Flaminio departed from Imagine Dragons in early 2012, leaving them as a four-piece. The band worked closely with Alex da Kid, with whom they recorded their first major label release at Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California. An EP entitled \"Continued Silence\" was released on Valentine's Day (February 14, 2012) digitally and peaked at number 40 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The band also released an EP titled \"Hear Me\" in 2012.\n\nShortly after, \"It's Time\" was released as a single and peaked at number 15 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The music video debuted on April 17, 2012 on all MTV affiliates and was subsequently nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the \"Best Rock Video\" category. \"It's Time\" was certified a double platinum single by the RIAA.\n\nThe band finished recording their debut album \"Night Visions\" in the summer of 2012 at Studio X inside Palms Casino Resort and released the album in the United States on the day after Labor Day (September 4, 2012). It peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart with first week sales in excess of 83,000 copies, the highest charting for a debut rock album since 2006. The album also reached No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative and Rock Album charts as well as the top ten on the Australian, Austrian, Canadian, Dutch, German, Irish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Scottish, Spanish, and United Kingdom Albums charts. It won a Billboard Music Award for Top Rock Album and was nominated for the Juno Award for International Album of the Year. \"Night Visions\" is certified platinum by the RIAA as well as in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. The album produced three tracks that reached the \"Billboard\" Top 40, four tracks in the ARIA Top 40, and five tracks charting in the UK Top 40.\n\nThe album's second single \"Radioactive\" reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs, \"Billboard\" Rock Songs, and Swedish singles chart and has sold more than seven million singles in the United States, smashing a record by spending 87 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Radioactive\" stayed at No. 1 on the Hot Rock Songs chart for a record-breaking 23 weeks and ultimately became the genre's biggest hit of 2013. It peaked at No. 3, becoming their first top ten single in the United States and broke the record for the longest run into the top five. It is the best-selling rock song on the Nielsen SoundScan running list of best-selling rock songs in digital history. By the end of 2013, \"Radioactive\" had already sold over 3 million copies. \"Rolling Stone\" called it \"the biggest rock hit of the year\". It was also the most streamed song of 2013 on Spotify in the United States. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, winning the latter of the two. In 2015, it was certified diamond by the RIAA for sales in excess of 10 million copies in the United States.\n\nThird single \"Demons\" reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Pop Songs and No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and has sold more than 5 million copies in the United States to date.\n\n\"Billboard\" listed them as one of \"2012's Brightest New Stars\" and later \"The Breakout Band of 2013\". Imagine Dragons won the 2014 Billboard Music Awards for Top Duo/Group, Top Hot 100 Artist, and Top Rock Artist. Amazon.com called the band their \"Favorite Rock artist of 2012\".\n\nIn 2013, Imagine Dragons returned to Europe and North America with the Night Visions Tour. The band announced 13 additional US summer tour dates which also sold out. The band then announced a North America Amphitheatre tour. The band also confirmed that they were unable to fulfill the request of acting as support for Muse. Pollstar listed the band in their Top 20 Concert Tours list by average box office gross despite their average ticket price being the third lowest on the list.\n\nThe band released a live album, \"Live at Independent Records\", in April 2013.\n\nAt Lollapalooza in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the last date on the Into the Night Tour, the band announced a rest, and complemented saying, \"This is our last show for a while, and had no better place to end this tour\". The conclusion of the Into the Night Tour signaled the end of the \"Night Visions\" album cycle. Lead singer Dan Reynolds joked about the end of the \"Night Visions\" cycle, saying that \"We're always writing on the road, [so] that second album will come, unless we die at the age of 27 next year. Hopefully we don't die and there will be a second album. I don't know when it will be, but it may come\".\n\nThe idea behind the second studio album, dubbed as their \"New Year's resolution\", was to create music and finish it when the band feels that their work is done. Reynolds told MTV in 2014 that the band wanted to \"put out an album that we're really happy with\". He further said that \"we tend to be perfectionists, too hard on ourselves at times, and we don't want to rush anything because we know how we are with things. We don't want to put a record out until we really feel good about it, you know, and who knows how long that will take\". Since the beginning of the Night Visions Tour, the band had been writing new material for an upcoming album, and, even as early as the start of the tour, had been recording demos for the album, before entering the studio. By the time that they entered the studio to work on the album, they had amassed 50 demos to work from. The demos had been described by Reynolds as \"definitely different\", but added that \"it’s still Imagine Dragons, but we’ve got a lot of growth and maturing to do as a band. I think the new material is going to hopefully be a step in the right direction. We’re just trying to create and do what comes out and what feels right\". Drummer Daniel Platzman added that the band are critical of themselves, with \"no room for external pressure\".\n\nInspired greatly by the band's travels on both their previous tours and the Night Visions Tour, the album will explore world culture as a musical item and overall motif in the album. Dan Reynolds told New Orleans-based newspaper \"The Times-Picayune\" that there was \"a lot of inspiration to be drawn from [the world tour]. You kind of realize that you’re a lot smaller than you think\". In addition, Reynolds stated to music magazine \"Rolling Stone\" that the next album will be \"different\" from \"Night Visions\", and that the band intends the album to be \"stripped back quite a bit\". He added that \"we embraced a lot of hip-hop influences with \"Night Visions\", but I think the next record will be more rock-driven. It’s too early to say, but there is some weird stuff going on in these songs\".\n\nPrior to the album's release, Imagine Dragons released a number of singles for other projects including a song for the film \"\", called \"Battle Cry\" (June 2014) and song \"Warriors\" for the 2014 League of Legends World Championship (September 2014).\n\nOn October 24, they revealed the lead single to the upcoming album, \"I Bet My Life\" via several visual snippets on Facebook and Instagram. It was released on October 27. It will be sent to US Alternative radio for adds on November 3.\n\nImagine Dragons performed in Seoul World Cup Stadium, South Korea, at the 2014 League of Legends World Championship and the halftime show at the 102nd Grey Cup in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Imagine Dragons posted on social media a request that fans in the US look around their city for some surprises and post their findings. They also hinted about two locations in Las Vegas. Shortly, billboards featuring artwork, the band's name, a hashtag (\"#smoke+mirrors\"), and an additional titles, presumed to be the track names were discovered.

The half-hour set included the breakthrough songs \"It's Time\" and \"Radioactive\" from \"Night Visions\".

Brian Mansfield from \"USA Today\" gave \"Night Visions\" a favorable review, writing: \"For all the group's musical mastery, it's the flourishes courtesy of producer Alex da Kid that make individual tracks stand out.\" Mansfield praised individual elements such as \"the mandolin hook of 'It's Time', the jaunty whistle of 'On Top of the World', [and] the burbling guitar in 'Demons.'\" and said that \"those creative touches may seem like small details, but it's that imagination that gives these Dragons teeth.\" Gregory Heaney of AllMusic remarked that the album \"sometimes feels as though it lacks depth\", but nonetheless called it \"an album that, at least for a few minutes at a time, will make everyday life seem just a little bit bigger\".\n\nAnnie Zaleski of \"Las Vegas Weekly\" praised \"Night Visions\" for being \"well-crafted and wildly creative, and boasts solid songwriting—three things that are sorely missing on albums by so many younger bands.\" Lisa Kwon of Consequence of Sound gave the album a mixed review and felt that \"Night Visions\" \"fails to match the fresh adrenaline rush that the band's first single had promised us when we first heard it on the radio or in commercials earlier this year.\" Johan Wippsson from \"Melodic\" magazine called \"Night Visions\" \"somewhat shattered, but as a whole this is a very charming and well-crafted album.\" Chris Saunders of musicOMH panned the album as \"so safe and middle of the road that it leaves you with the same hollow feeling that Las Vegas can, without the dizzying high and sensual assault that got you there in the first place.\"\n\nThe album debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the United States, selling more than 83,000 copies within its first week. It also peaked at the summit of the \"Billboard\" Alternative Albums chart and Rock Albums chart. It has appeared in the top ten albums on the \"Billboard\" 200 in 2012, 2013 and 2014 (as well as topping the Alternative Albums chart in each of those years) and has not fallen off the chart once as of February 25, 2015. The album debuted at number two in the United Kingdom, narrowly losing the top slot to Justin Timberlake's \"The 20/20 Experience\".\n\nThe album was the fourth best-selling album in the US in 2013 with over 1.4 million copies sold for the year. As of February 2015, it has sold a total of 2.5 million copies in the US and earned double Platinum status. It was also the third best-selling album in Canada with 179,000 copies sold.\n\nTo date, three singles from the album charted in the \"Billboard\" Top 20, and five have charted on the UK Top 40. In the US, \"It's Time\" has sold more than 2 million copies in the United States, \"Radioactive\" has sold more than 10 million and \"Demons\" has sold more than 5 million. Both \"Radioactive\" and \"Demons\" spent more than 60 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, making Imagine Dragons the first artist to accomplish such a feat.\n\nAll songs written and produced by Imagine Dragons (Ben McKee, Daniel Platzman, Dan Reynolds and Wayne Sermon), except where noted.

                "Aja Volkman\n\nAja Volkman (; born March 4, 1987) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician, best known as the frontwoman of the indie rock band Nico Vega. She has also released an EP titled \"Egyptian\" as a duo with her husband Dan Reynolds (of Imagine Dragons) under the moniker Egyptian.\n\nVolkman is the daughter of James Volkman and artist Rogene Manas. She is a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Volkman does not drink alcohol and is a vegetarian. She married the lead singer of Imagine Dragons, Dan Reynolds, on March 5, 2011. They have three daughters: Arrow Eve (born August 2012) and twin girls Coco Rae and Gia James (born March 2017).\n\nVolkman was approached by Mike Peña after a solo performance in 2005. Although Peña later left the band to pursue acting, Dan Epand (drummer) joined and this formed the basic structure of Nico Vega in 2007. The band released a series of EPs. They signed to now defunct MySpace Records. Two years later the band released their debut eponymous album. Three tracks off of the album were produced by Linda Perry (Pink, Christina Aguilera, Gwen Stefani) and the rest were produced by Tim Edgar. The album was mixed by Tchad Blake (The Black Keys, Sheryl Crow). Nico Vega performed on \"Last Call with Carson Daly\" later that year and then toured for the next couple years. They toured extensively with artists including Gavin Rossdale (of Bush), Manic Street Preachers, Imagine Dragons, She Wants Revenge, and Blondie. They have also opened for No Doubt. During this time the band signed to Five Seven Music. Single \"Beast\" gained popularity in 2013 through BioShock Infinite advertisements, resulting in more than five million combined downloads and streams.\n\nSecond album, \"Lead To Light\", was released on July 22, 2014 and featured production from Dan Reynolds (Imagine Dragons, X Ambassadors), Tony Hoffer (Beck, Fitz and the Tantrums), and Tim Edgar (Nico Vega). Single \"I Believe (Get Over Yourself)\" was co-written by Aja's husband Dan Reynolds. Track \"Lightening\" was co-written with Adam Bravin and Justin Warfield of rock group She Wants Revenge.\n\nInvited to perform an opening set for Nico Vega, Reynolds met Volkman in 2010. He invited her to help him finish some demos he was working on. The two began a collaborative process which they titled Egyptian. They recorded and released independently a four track eponymous EP digitally.\n\nThey have performed this material once at the M Resort in Las Vegas.\n\nIn 2015, Reynolds mentioned that Volkman is working on a solo project. Album \"Sandy\" was released on May 19, 2017 and featured lead single \"My Man\". The album features production by Joshua James and producer Tim Edgar (Nico Vega, Imagine Dragons).\n\n\n\n\n"

                "Imagine Dragons\n\nImagine Dragons is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, consisting of lead vocalist Dan Reynolds, lead guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist and keyboardist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. The band first gained exposure with the release of single \"It's Time\", followed by their award-winning debut studio album \"Night Visions\" (2012), which resulted in the chart topping singles \"Radioactive\" and \"Demons\". \"Billboard\" placed them at the top of their \"Year In Rock\" rankings for 2013 and 2017 and named them their \"Breakthrough Band of 2013\". and \"Biggest Band of 2017.\" \"Rolling Stone\" named their single \"Radioactive\", which holds the record for most weeks on the Hot 100, from \"Night Visions\" the \"biggest rock hit of the year\", and MTV called them \"the year's biggest breakout band\". The band's second studio album \"Smoke + Mirrors\" (2015) reached number one in the US, Canada and the UK. After a brief hiatus, the band released their third studio album, \"Evolve\" (2017) which resulted in the chart-topping singles, \"Believer\" and \"Thunder\". While all three albums were commercially successful, critical reception was mixed.\n\nImagine Dragons has won three American Music Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, one Grammy Award, and one World Music Award. In May 2014, the band was nominated for fourteen Billboard Music Awards, including Top Artist of the Year and a Milestone Award, which recognizes innovation and creativity of artists across different genres. Imagine Dragons have sold 12 million albums and 35 million singles worldwide.\n\nIn 2008, lead singer Dan Reynolds met drummer Andrew Tolman at Brigham Young University where they were both students. Reynolds and Tolman added Andrew Beck, Dave Lemke, and Aurora Florence to play guitar, bass, and piano respectively for their band. Their name is an anagram for a phrase only known to members of the group, that Reynolds stated each member approved of. The five-piece released an extended play titled \"Speak to Me\" that same year. Beck and Florence would also depart from the band's lineup that year. In 2009, Tolman recruited longtime high school friend Wayne Sermon, who had graduated from Berklee College of Music to play guitar. Tolman later recruited his wife, Brittany Tolman, to sing backup and play keys, and the band began to play shows together again. Lemke left the band later on, leading Sermon to recruit another Berklee music student, Ben McKee, to join the band as their bassist and complete the lineup. The band garnered a large following in their hometown of Provo, Utah, before the members moved to Las Vegas, the hometown of Dan Reynolds, where the band recorded and released their first three EPs.\n\nThe band released EPs titled \"Imagine Dragons\" and \"Hell and Silence\" in 2010, both recorded at Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas. They returned to the studio in 2011. The third EP, \"It's Time\", was made before they signed a record deal.\n\nThey got their first big break when Train's frontman Pat Monahan fell sick just prior to the Bite of Las Vegas Festival 2009. Imagine Dragons were called to fill in and performed to a crowd of more than 26,000 people. Local accolades including \"Best CD of 2011\" (\"Vegas SEVEN\"), \"Best Local Indie Band 2010\" (\"Las Vegas Weekly\"), \"Las Vegas' Newest Must See Live Act\" (\"Las Vegas CityLife\"), Vegas Music Summit Headliner 2010, and more sent the band on a positive trajectory. In November 2011 they signed with Interscope Records and began working with English Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid. Eventually the Tolmans would leave the group and Daniel Platzman would be recruited in August 2011 by invitation from Ben McKee, prior to the signing of band's label deal in November 2011, alongside keyboardist Theresa Flaminio.\n\nTheresa Flaminio departed from Imagine Dragons in early 2012, leaving them as a four-piece. The band worked closely with Alex da Kid, with whom they recorded their first major label release at Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California. An EP entitled \"Continued Silence\" was released on Valentine's Day (February 14, 2012) digitally and peaked at number 40 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The band also released an EP titled \"Hear Me\" in 2012.\n\nShortly after, \"It's Time\" was released as a single and peaked at number 15 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The music video debuted on April 17, 2012 on all MTV affiliates and was subsequently nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the \"Best Rock Video\" category. \"It's Time\" was certified a double platinum single by the RIAA.\n\nThe band finished recording their debut album \"Night Visions\" in the summer of 2012 at Studio X inside Palms Casino Resort and released the album in the United States on the day after Labor Day (September 4, 2012). It peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart with first week sales in excess of 83,000 copies, the highest charting for a debut rock album since 2006. The album also reached No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative and Rock Album charts as well as the top ten on the Australian, Austrian, Canadian, Dutch, German, Irish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Scottish, Spanish, and United Kingdom Albums charts. It won a Billboard Music Award for Top Rock Album and was nominated for the Juno Award for International Album of the Year. \"Night Visions\" is certified platinum by the RIAA as well as in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. The album produced three tracks that reached the \"Billboard\" Top 40, four tracks in the ARIA Top 40, and five tracks charting in the UK Top 40.\n\nThe album's second single \"Radioactive\" reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs, \"Billboard\" Rock Songs, and Swedish singles chart and has sold more than seven million singles in the United States, smashing a record by spending 87 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Radioactive\" stayed at No. 1 on the Hot Rock Songs chart for a record-breaking 23 weeks and ultimately became the genre's biggest hit of 2013. It peaked at No. 3, becoming their first top ten single in the United States and broke the record for the longest run into the top five. It is the best-selling rock song on the Nielsen SoundScan running list of best-selling rock songs in digital history. By the end of 2013, \"Radioactive\" had already sold over 3 million copies. \"Rolling Stone\" called it \"the biggest rock hit of the year\". It was also the most streamed song of 2013 on Spotify in the United States. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, winning the latter of the two. In 2015, it was certified diamond by the RIAA for sales in excess of 10 million copies in the United States.\n\nThird single \"Demons\" reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Pop Songs and No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and has sold more than 5 million copies in the United States to date.\n\n\"Billboard\" listed them as one of \"2012's Brightest New Stars\" and later \"The Breakout Band of 2013\". Imagine Dragons won the 2014 Billboard Music Awards for Top Duo/Group, Top Hot 100 Artist, and Top Rock Artist. Amazon.com called the band their \"Favorite Rock artist of 2012\".\n\nIn 2013, Imagine Dragons returned to Europe and North America with the Night Visions Tour. The band announced 13 additional US summer tour dates which also sold out. The band then announced a North America Amphitheatre tour. The band also confirmed that they were unable to fulfill the request of acting as support for Muse. Pollstar listed the band in their Top 20 Concert Tours list by average box office gross despite their average ticket price being the third lowest on the list.\n\nThe band released a live album, \"Live at Independent Records\", in April 2013.\n\nAt Lollapalooza in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the last date on the Into the Night Tour, the band announced a rest, and complemented saying, \"This is our last show for a while, and had no better place to end this tour\". The conclusion of the Into the Night Tour signaled the end of the \"Night Visions\" album cycle. Lead singer Dan Reynolds joked about the end of the \"Night Visions\" cycle, saying that \"We're always writing on the road, [so] that second album will come, unless we die at the age of 27 next year. Hopefully we don't die and there will be a second album. I don't know when it will be, but it may come\".\n\nThe idea behind the second studio album, dubbed as their \"New Year's resolution\", was to create music and finish it when the band feels that their work is done. Reynolds told MTV in 2014 that the band wanted to \"put out an album that we're really happy with\". He further said that \"we tend to be perfectionists, too hard on ourselves at times, and we don't want to rush anything because we know how we are with things. We don't want to put a record out until we really feel good about it, you know, and who knows how long that will take\". Since the beginning of the Night Visions Tour, the band had been writing new material for an upcoming album, and, even as early as the start of the tour, had been recording demos for the album, before entering the studio. By the time that they entered the studio to work on the album, they had amassed 50 demos to work from. The demos had been described by Reynolds as \"definitely different\", but added that \"it’s still Imagine Dragons, but we’ve got a lot of growth and maturing to do as a band. I think the new material is going to hopefully be a step in the right direction. We’re just trying to create and do what comes out and what feels right\". Drummer Daniel Platzman added that the band are critical of themselves, with \"no room for external pressure\".\n\nInspired greatly by the band's travels on both their previous tours and the Night Visions Tour, the album will explore world culture as a musical item and overall motif in the album. Dan Reynolds told New Orleans-based newspaper \"The Times-Picayune\" that there was \"a lot of inspiration to be drawn from [the world tour]. You kind of realize that you’re a lot smaller than you think\". In addition, Reynolds stated to music magazine \"Rolling Stone\" that the next album will be \"different\" from \"Night Visions\", and that the band intends the album to be \"stripped back quite a bit\". He added that \"we embraced a lot of hip-hop influences with \"Night Visions\", but I think the next record will be more rock-driven. It’s too early to say, but there is some weird stuff going on in these songs\".\n\nPrior to the album's release, Imagine Dragons released a number of singles for other projects including a song for the film \"\", called \"Battle Cry\" (June 2014) and song \"Warriors\" for the 2014 League of Legends World Championship (September 2014).\n\nOn October 24, they revealed the lead single to the upcoming album, \"I Bet My Life\" via several visual snippets on Facebook and Instagram. It was released on October 27. It will be sent to US Alternative radio for adds on November 3.\n\nImagine Dragons performed in Seoul World Cup Stadium, South Korea, at the 2014 League of Legends World Championship and the halftime show at the 102nd Grey Cup in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Imagine Dragons posted on social media a request that fans in the US look around their city for some surprises and post their findings. They also hinted about two locations in Las Vegas. Shortly, billboards featuring artwork, the band's name, a hashtag (\"#smoke+mirrors\"), and an additional titles, presumed to be the track names were discovered. The following titles were revealed \"Summer\", \"Shots\", \"Polaroid\", \"I'm So Sorry\", and \"Gold\". Next, the band direct messaged various fans puzzle pieces of the artwork for the album (each file numbered, at least 13 in total). When combined, the puzzle pieces appear to reveal the cover art and album title. The title, cover art, and release date were revealed on social media two days later.\n\nWorking with Metric, which did a three-song acoustic set, Imagine Dragons played at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles on February 5, 2015. The half-hour set included the breakthrough songs \"It's Time\" and \"Radioactive\" from \"Night Visions\". The performance was the live debut for \"Summer\" and \"I'm So Sorry\", along with \"Gold\" and \"I Bet My Life\" from the album \"Smoke + Mirrors\", which was released on February 17, 2015. The band's 2015 North American summer tour began in Portland, Oregon on June 3.\n\nDuring the band's tour, Imagine Dragons released two non-album singles. \"Roots\" was released on August 26, 2015 and \"I Was Me\" on October 12, 2015 via iTunes. The band also released a cover of \"I Love You All the Time\" by Eagles of Death Metal on December 18, 2015, in support of the victims of the November 2015 Paris attacks. The \"Smoke + Mirrors Tour\" ended on February 5, 2016 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n\nIn an interview, Dan Reynolds told \"Billboard\" that the band would be taking a hiatus for the remainder of 2016, stating that \"This is the year we're going to actually take time off. We haven't stopped in, like, six years, so we've forced ourselves to at least take a year off.\" The band released a one night only concert film, \"Imagine Dragons In Concert: Smoke + Mirrors\", in select theaters on March 2, 2016. The film was released on DVD and Blu-Ray under the title \"Imagine Dragons: Smoke + Mirrors Live\". They also released the song \"Not Today\" from the soundtrack for \"Me Before You\" on April 28. The band also appears on the for the film \"Suicide Squad\". The song, titled \"Sucker For Pain\"\"\", features Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa, Logic, Ty Dolla Sign, and X Ambassadors.\n\nThe band recorded the song \"Levitate\" for the science fiction film \"Passengers\". The track was released on November 28, 2016.\n\nOn September 27, 2016, Imagine Dragons began teasing their third studio album with a tweet simply saying \"studio\". The band continued posting cryptic messages on their Twitter account for the next four months. On January 28, 2017, the band started posting a series of videos teasing the album's first single. The time-lapse videos featured lead singer Dan Reynolds drawing surreal images on a drawing pad. Morse code was hidden in the videos and translated to \"objects of same color\". On February 1, 2017, Imagine Dragons released \"Believer\" as the lead single for their next album. \"Believer\" was used as part of the Super Bowl ad for the Nintendo Switch.\n\nImagine Dragons were part of the Wayhome summer 2017 lineup in Oro-Medonte, Ontario. The band also performed in NOS Alive, Portugal on July 8.\n\nOn April 27, 2017, Imagine Dragons released \"Thunder\" as the second single from their third album.\n\nOn May 8, 2017, Imagine Dragons announced their third studio album \"Evolve\", as well as a new track \"Whatever It Takes\", which was released on the same day. A tour in support for the album was also announced within the same day. \"Evolve\" was released on June 23, 2017, worldwide. The album reached the top five in most countries but was met with mixed critical reception.\n\nImagine Dragons' musical style has mainly been described as alternative rock, indie rock, pop rock, indie pop, electronic rock, synth-pop, dance-pop electropop, pop, and arena rock.. Their music also has some influences of folk,\nR&B, hip hop and EDM.\n\nDan Reynolds cites Arcade Fire, Nirvana, Muse, The Beatles, Paul Simon, Coldplay, Harry Nilsson, and U2 as some of his and the band's artistic influences. In terms of success, Reynolds credits bands like Foster the People and Mumford & Sons for bringing alternative pop music to a new level of commercial success in recent years.\n\nImagine Dragons has performed \"It's Time\" live on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" (2012) and \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" (2012) and \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" (2012), and \"Conan\" (2013).

Brian Mansfield from \"USA Today\" gave \"Night Visions\" a favorable review, writing: \"For all the group's musical mastery, it's the flourishes courtesy of producer Alex da Kid that make individual tracks stand out.\" Mansfield praised individual elements such as \"the mandolin hook of 'It's Time', the jaunty whistle of 'On Top of the World', [and] the burbling guitar in 'Demons.'\" and said that \"those creative touches may seem like small details, but it's that imagination that gives these Dragons teeth.\" Gregory Heaney of AllMusic remarked that the album \"sometimes feels as though it lacks depth\", but nonetheless called it \"an album that, at least for a few minutes at a time, will make everyday life seem just a little bit bigger\".\n\nAnnie Zaleski of \"Las Vegas Weekly\" praised \"Night Visions\" for being \"well-crafted and wildly creative, and boasts solid songwriting—three things that are sorely missing on albums by so many younger bands.\" Lisa Kwon of Consequence of Sound gave the album a mixed review and felt that \"Night Visions\" \"fails to match the fresh adrenaline rush that the band's first single had promised us when we first heard it on the radio or in commercials earlier this year.\" Johan Wippsson from \"Melodic\" magazine called \"Night Visions\" \"somewhat shattered, but as a whole this is a very charming and well-crafted album.\" Chris Saunders of musicOMH panned the album as \"so safe and middle of the road that it leaves you with the same hollow feeling that Las Vegas can, without the dizzying high and sensual assault that got you there in the first place.\"\n\nThe album debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the United States, selling more than 83,000 copies within its first week.

                "Rita Hayworth\n\nRita Hayworth (born Margarita Carmen Cansino; October 17, 1918May 14, 1987) was an American actress and dancer. She achieved fame during the 1940s as one of the era's top stars, appearing in a total of 61 films over 37 years. The press coined the term \"The Love Goddess\" to describe Hayworth after she had become the most glamorous screen idol of the 1940s. She was the top pin-up girl for GIs during World War II.\n\nHayworth is perhaps best known for her performance in the 1946 film noir, \"Gilda\", opposite Glenn Ford, in which she played the \"femme fatale\" in her first major dramatic role. Fred Astaire, with whom she made two films, called her his favorite dance partner. Her greatest success was in the Technicolor musical \"Cover Girl\" (1944), with Gene Kelly. She is listed as one of the top 25 female motion picture stars of all time in the American Film Institute's survey, AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars.\n\nIn 1980, Hayworth was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which contributed to her death at age 68. The public disclosure and discussion of her illness drew attention to Alzheimer's, and helped to increase public and private funding for Alzheimer's research.\n\nHayworth was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1918 as Margarita Carmen Cansino, the oldest child of two dancers. Her father, Eduardo Cansino Sr., was from Castilleja de la Cuesta, a little town near Seville, Spain. \n\nHer mother, Volga Hayworth, was an American of Irish-English descent who had performed with the Ziegfeld Follies. The couple married in 1917. They also had two sons: Eduardo Jr. and Vernon.\n\nMargarita's father wanted her to become a professional dancer, while her mother hoped she would become an actress. Her paternal grandfather, Antonio Cansino, was renowned as a classical Spanish dancer. He popularized the bolero, and his dancing school in Madrid was world-famous. Hayworth later recalled, \"From the time I was three and a half … as soon as I could stand on my own feet, I was given dance lessons.\" She noted \"I didn't like it very much … but I didn't have the courage to tell my father, so I began taking the lessons. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse, that was my girlhood\".\n\nShe attended dance classes every day for a few years in a Carnegie Hall complex, where she was taught by her uncle Angel Cansino. She performed publicly from the age of six. In 1926 at the age of eight, she was featured in \"La Fiesta\", a short film for Warner Bros.\n\nIn 1927, her father took the family to Hollywood. He believed that dancing could be featured in the movies and that his family could be part of it. He established his own dance studio, where he taught such stars as James Cagney and Jean Harlow. During the Great Depression, he lost all his investments as commercial interest in his dancing classes waned.\n\nIn 1931, Eduardo Cansino partnered with his 12-year-old daughter to form an act called the Dancing Cansinos. Since under California law Margarita was too young to work in nightclubs and bars, her father took her with him to work across the border in Tijuana, Mexico. In the early 1930s, it was a popular tourist spot for people from Los Angeles. Because she was working, Cansino never graduated from high school, but she completed the ninth grade at Hamilton High in Los Angeles.\n\nCansino (Hayworth) took a bit part in the film \"Cruz Diablo\" (1934) at age 16, which led to another bit part in the film \"In Caliente\" (1935) with the Mexican actress Dolores del Río. She danced with her father in such nightspots as the Foreign and the Caliente clubs. Winfield Sheehan, the head of the Fox Film Corporation, saw her dancing at the Caliente Club and quickly arranged for Hayworth to do a screen test a week later. Impressed by her screen persona, Sheehan signed her for a short-term, six-month contract at Fox, under the name Rita Cansino, the first of two name changes during her film career.\n\nDuring her time at Fox, Hayworth was billed as Rita Cansino and appeared in unremarkable roles, often cast as the exotic foreigner. In late 1934, aged 16, she performed a dance sequence in the Spencer Tracy film \"Dante's Inferno\" (1935), and was put under contract in February 1935. She had her first speaking role as an Argentinian girl in \"Under the Pampas Moon\" (1935). She played an Egyptian girl in \"Charlie Chan in Egypt\" (1935), and a Russian dancer in \"Paddy O'Day\" (1935). Sheehan was grooming her for the lead in the 1936 Technicolor film \"Ramona\", hoping to establish her as Fox Film's new Dolores del Río.\n\nBy the end of her six-month contract, Fox had merged into 20th Century Fox, with Darryl F. Zanuck serving as the executive producer. Dismissing Sheehan's interest in her and giving Loretta Young the lead in \"Ramona\", Zanuck did not renew Cansino's contract. Sensing her screen potential, salesman and promoter Edward C. Judson, with whom she would elope in 1937, got freelance work for her in several small-studio films and a part in the Columbia Pictures feature \"Meet Nero Wolfe\" (1936). Studio head Harry Cohn signed her to a seven-year contract and tried her out in small roles.\n\nCohn argued that her image was too Mediterranean, which limited her to being cast in \"exotic\" roles that were fewer in number. He was heard to say her last name sounded too Spanish. Judson acted on Cohn's advice: Rita Cansino became Rita Hayworth when she adopted her mother's maiden name, to the consternation of her father. With a name that emphasized her British-American ancestry, people were more likely to regard her as a classic \"American\".\n\nWith Cohn and Judson's encouragement, Hayworth changed her hair color to dark red and had electrolysis to raise her hairline and broaden the appearance of her forehead.\n\nHayworth appeared in five minor Columbia pictures and three minor independent movies in 1937. The following year, she appeared in five Columbia B movies. In 1939, Cohn pressured director Howard Hawks to use Hayworth for a small but important role as a man-trap in the aviation drama \"Only Angels Have Wings,\" in which she played opposite Cary Grant and Jean Arthur.\n\nWith this film's box-office success, fan mail for Hayworth began pouring into Columbia's publicity department. Cohn began to see Hayworth as his first and official new star. The studio never officially had stars under contract, except for Jean Arthur, who was trying to break with it.\n\nCohn began to build up Hayworth in 1940 in features such as \"Music in My Heart\", \"The Lady in Question\", and \"Angels Over Broadway\". That year, she was first featured in a \"Life\" magazine cover story. Cohn loaned Hayworth to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to appear in \"Susan and God\" opposite Joan Crawford. While on loan to Warner Bros., Hayworth appeared as the second female lead in \"The Strawberry Blonde\" (1941), opposite James Cagney. Because the film was a big box-office success, Hayworth's popularity rose and she immediately became one of Hollywood's hottest actresses. So impressed was Warner Bros., they tried to buy Hayworth's contract from Columbia, but Cohn refused to release her.\n\nHer success led to a supporting role in \"Blood and Sand\" (1941) opposite Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell with Fox, the studio that had dropped her six years before. In one of her most notable screen roles, Hayworth played Doña Sol des Muire, the first of many screen sirens.\n\nShe returned in triumph to Columbia Pictures and was cast in the musical \"You'll Never Get Rich\" (1941) opposite Fred Astaire in one of the highest-budgeted films Columbia had ever made. The picture was so successful, the studio produced and released another Astaire-Hayworth picture the following year, \"You Were Never Lovelier\". Astaire's biographer Peter Levinson writes that the dancing combination of Astaire and Hayworth was \"absolute magnetism on the screen.\" Although Astaire made 10 films with Ginger Rogers, his other main dancing partner, Hayworth's sensuality surpassed Rogers's cool technical expertise. \"Rita's youthful exuberance meshed perfectly with Fred's maturity and elegance,\" says Levinson.\n\nWhen Astaire was asked who his favorite dance partner was, he tried not answering the question, but later admitted it was Hayworth: \"All right, I'll give you a name,\" he said. \"But if you ever let it out, I'll swear I lied. It was Rita Hayworth.\" Astaire commented that \"Rita danced with trained perfection and individuality … She was better when she was 'on' than at rehearsal.\" Biographer Charlie Reinhart describes the effect she had on Astaire's style:\n\nIn August 1941, Hayworth was featured in an iconic \"Life\" photo in which she posed in a negligee with a black lace bodice.\n\nBob Landry's photo made Hayworth one of the top two pin-up girls of the World War II years; the other was Betty Grable, in a 1943 photograph. For two years, Hayworth's photograph was the most requested pin-up photograph in circulation. In 2002, the satin nightgown Hayworth wore for the photo sold for $26,888.\n\nIn March 1942, Hayworth visited Brazil as a cultural ambassador for the Roosevelt administration's Good Neighbor policy, under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs.\n\nHayworth had top billing in one of her best-known films, the Technicolor musical \"Cover Girl\", released in 1944. The film established her as Columbia's top star of the 1940s, and it gave her the distinction of being the first of only six women to dance on screen with both Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. \"I guess the only jewels of my life,\" Hayworth said in 1970, \"were the pictures I made with Fred Astaire... And \"Cover Girl\", too.\"\n\nFor three consecutive years, starting in 1944, Hayworth was named one of the top movie box-office attractions in the world. She was adept in ballet, tap, ballroom, and Spanish routines. Cohn continued to showcase Hayworth's dance talents. Columbia featured her in the Technicolor films \"Tonight and Every Night\" (1945) with Lee Bowman and \"Down to Earth\" (1947) with Larry Parks.\n\nHer sexy, glamorous appeal was most noted in Charles Vidor's film noir \"Gilda\" (1946) with Glenn Ford, which caused censors some consternation. The role, in which Hayworth wore black satin and performed a legendary one-glove striptease, \"Put The Blame On Mame\", made her into a cultural icon as a \"femme fatale.\"\n\nWhile \"Gilda\" was in release, it was widely reported that an atomic bomb which was scheduled to be tested at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean's Marshall Islands would bear an image of Hayworth, a reference to her bombshell status. Although the gesture was undoubtedly meant as a compliment, Hayworth was deeply offended. Orson Welles, then married to Hayworth, recalled her anger in an interview with biographer Barbara Leaming: \"Rita used to fly into terrible rages all the time, but the angriest was when she found out that they'd put her on the atom bomb. Rita almost went insane, she was so angry... She wanted to go to Washington to hold a press conference, but Harry Cohn wouldn't let her because it would be unpatriotic.\" Welles tried to persuade Hayworth that the whole business was not a publicity stunt on Cohn's part, that it was simply homage to her from the flight crew.\n\nOn the June 30, 1946 broadcast of \"Orson Welles Commentaries\", Welles said of the imminent test, \"I want my daughter to be able to tell her daughter that grandmother's picture was on the last atom bomb ever to explode.\"\n\nThe fourth atomic bomb ever to be detonated was decorated with a photograph of Hayworth cut from the June 1946 issue of \"Esquire\" magazine. Above it was stenciled the device's nickname, \"Gilda\", in two-inch black letters.\n\nHayworth's performance in Welles's 1947 film \"The Lady from Shanghai\" was critically acclaimed. The film's failure at the box office was attributed in part to Hayworth's famous red hair being cut short and bleached platinum blonde for the role. Cohn had not been consulted and was furious that Hayworth's image was changed.\n\nAlso in 1947, Hayworth was featured in a \"Life\" cover story by Winthrop Sargeant that resulted in her being nicknamed \"The Love Goddess\". The term was adopted and used later as the title of a biopic and of a biography about her. In a 1980s interview, Hayworth said, \"Everybody else does nude scenes, but I don't. I never made nude movies. I didn't have to do that. I danced. I was provocative, I guess, in some things. But I was not completely exposed.\"\n\nHer next film, \"The Loves of Carmen\" (1948) with Glenn Ford, was the first film co-produced by Columbia and Hayworth's production company, The Beckworth Corporation (named for Rebecca, her daughter with Welles). It was Columbia's biggest moneymaker that year. She received a percentage of the profits from this and all her subsequent films until 1954, when she dissolved Beckworth to pay off debts.\n\nIn 1948, at the height of her fame, Hayworth traveled to Cannes and was introduced to Prince Aly Khan. They began a year-long courtship, and were married on May 27, 1949. Hayworth left Hollywood and sailed for France, breaking her contract with Columbia.\n\nBecause Hayworth was already one of the most well-known celebrities in the world, the courtship and the wedding received enormous press coverage around the world. Because she was still legally married to second husband Orson Welles, Hayworth also received some negative backlash for her courtship with the prince, causing some American fans to boycott her pictures. The wedding marked the first time a Hollywood actress became a princess. On December 28, 1949, Hayworth gave birth to the couple's only daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan.\n\nThough Hayworth was anxious to start a new life abroad, away from Hollywood, Aly Khan's flamboyant lifestyle and duties proved too difficult for Hayworth. She struggled to fit in with his friends, and found it difficult to learn French. Aly Khan was also known in circles as a playboy, and it was suspected that he had been unfaithful to Hayworth during the marriage.\n\nIn 1951, Hayworth set sail with her two daughters for New York. Although the couple did reconcile for a short time, they officially divorced in 1953.\n\nAfter the collapse of her marriage to Khan, Rita Hayworth was forced to return to Hollywood to star in her \"comeback\" picture, \"Affair in Trinidad\" (1952) which again paired her with Glenn Ford. Director Vincent Sherman recalled that Hayworth seemed \"rather frightened at the approach of doing another picture\". She continued to clash with Columbia boss Harry Cohn, and was placed on suspension during filming. Nevertheless, the picture was highly publicized. The picture ended up grossing $1 million more than her previous blockbuster, \"Gilda\".\n\nShe continued to star in a string of successful pictures. In 1953, she had two films released: \"Salome\" with Charles Laughton and Stewart Granger, and \"Miss Sadie Thompson\" with José Ferrer and Aldo Ray. She was off the big screen for another four years, mainly because of a tumultuous marriage to the singer Dick Haymes. During her marriage to Haymes, she was involved in much negative publicity, which significantly lessened her appeal. By the time she returned to the screen for \"Fire Down Below\" (1957), Kim Novak had become Columbia's top female star. Her last musical was \"Pal Joey\" (1957). After this film, Hayworth left Columbia for good.\n\nShe received good reviews for her performance in \"Separate Tables\" (1958), with Burt Lancaster and David Niven, and \"The Story on Page One\" (1960). She continued working throughout the 1960s. In 1962, her planned Broadway debut in \"Step on a Crack\" was cancelled for undisclosed health reasons. \"The Money Trap\" (1964) paired her, for the last time, with good friend Glenn Ford. She continued to act in films until the early 1970s. She made comedic television appearances on \"Laugh In\" and \"The Carol Burnett Show\" in the 1970s. Her last film was \"The Wrath of God\" (1972).\n\nHayworth had a strained relationship with Columbia Pictures for many years. In 1943, she was suspended without pay for nine weeks because she refused to appear in \"Once Upon a Time\". During this period in Hollywood, contract players could not choose their films; they were on salary rather than receiving a fixed amount per picture.\n\nIn 1947, Hayworth's new contract with Columbia provided a salary of $250,000 plus 50% of film's profits.\n\nIn 1951, Columbia alleged it had $800,000 invested in properties for her, including the film she walked out on that year. Hayworth left Hollywood to marry Prince Aly Khan and was suspended for failing to report to work on the film \"Affair in Trinidad\". In 1952, Hayworth refused to report for work because she objected to the script.\n\nIn 1955, she sued Columbia Pictures to be released from her contract, but asked for her $150,000 salary, alleging that the filming failed to start when agreed. She said, \"I was in Switzerland when they sent me the script for \"Affair in Trinidad\" and I threw it across the room. But I did the picture, and \"Pal Joey\", too. I came back to Columbia because I wanted to work and first, see, I had to finish that goddamn contract, which is how Harry Cohn \"owned\" me!\"\n\n\"Harry Cohn thought of me as one of the people he could exploit, and make a lot of money,\" Hayworth said in 1972. \"And I did make a lot of money for him, but not much for me.\"\n\nYears after her film career had ended and long after Cohn had died, Hayworth still resented her treatment by both him and Columbia. She spoke bluntly in a 1968 interview:\n\nI used to have to punch a time clock at Columbia. Every day of my life. That's what it was like. I was under exclusive contract, like they owned me … I think he had my dressing room bugged … He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him … You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.\n\nHayworth resented the fact that the studio had failed to train her to sing or even to encourage her to learn how to sing. Although she appeared to sing in many of her films, she was usually dubbed. Because the public did not know her secret, she was embarrassed to be asked to sing by troops at USO shows.\n\n\"I wanted to study singing\", Hayworth complained, \"but Harry Cohn kept saying, 'Who needs it?' and the studio wouldn't pay for it. They had me so intimidated that I couldn't have done it anyway. They always said, 'Oh, no, we can't let you do it. There's no time for that; it has to be done right now!' I was under contract, and that was it.\"\n\nHayworth did sing the acoustic guitar version of \"Put the Blame on Mame\" in \"Gilda\". The other songs in the picture were dubbed by Anita Ellis.\n\nCohn had a reputation as a taskmaster, but he had his own criticisms of Hayworth. He had invested heavily in her before she began a reckless affair with the married Aly Khan, and it could have caused a backlash against her career and Columbia's success. For instance, an article in the British periodical \"The People\" called for a boycott of Hayworth's films: \"Hollywood must be told its already tarnished reputation will sink to rock bottom if it restores this reckless woman to a place among its stars.\"\n\nCohn expressed his frustration in a 1957 interview with \"Time\" magazine: \"Hayworth might be worth ten million dollars today easily! She owned 25% of the profits with her own company and had hit after hit and she had to get married and had to get out of the business and took a suspension because she fell in love again! In five years, at two pictures a year, at 25%! Think of what she could have made! But she didn't make pictures! She took two or three suspensions! She got mixed up with different characters! Unpredictable!\"\n\nHayworth was a top glamour girl in the 1940s, a pin-up girl for military servicemen and a beauty icon for women. At and , she was tall enough to be a concern for dancing partners such as Fred Astaire. She reportedly changed her hair color eight times in eight movies.\n\nIn 1949, Hayworth's lips were voted best in the world by the Artists League of America. She had a modeling contract with Max Factor to promote its Tru-Color lipsticks and Pan-Stik make-up.\n\nIn 1941, Hayworth said she was the antithesis of the characters she played. \"I naturally am very shy … and I suffer from an inferiority complex.\" Her provocative role in \"Gilda\", in particular, was responsible for people expecting her to be what she was not. Hayworth once said, with some bitterness, \"Men go to bed with Gilda, but wake up with me.\"\n\nHayworth's two younger brothers, Eduardo Cansino Jr. ((October 13, 1919 – March 11, 1974) and Vernon Cansino, both served in World War II. Vernon left the United States Army in 1946 with several medals, including the Purple Heart, and later married Susan Vail, a dancer. Eduardo Jr. followed Hayworth into acting; he was also under contract with Columbia Pictures. In 1950, he made his screen debut in \"The Great Adventures of Captain Kidd\".\n\nHayworth was married and divorced five times. She said, \"Basically, I am a good, gentle person, but I am attracted to mean personalities.\"\n\nIn 1937, when Hayworth was 18, she married Edward Judson, an oilman turned promoter who was more than twice her age. They married in Las Vegas. He had played a major role in launching her acting career. A shrewd businessman, he was domineering and became her manager for months before he proposed. \"He helped me with my career,\" Hayworth conceded after they divorced, \"and helped himself to my money.\" She alleged that Judson compelled her to transfer a considerable amount of her property to him and she promised to pay him $12,000 under threats that he would do her \"great bodily harm.\" \n\nShe filed for divorce from him on February 24, 1942, with a complaint of cruelty. She noted to the press that his work took him to Oklahoma and Texas while she lived and worked in Hollywood. Judson was as old as her father, who was enraged by the marriage, which caused a rift between Hayworth and her parents until the divorce. Judson had failed to tell Hayworth before they married that he had previously been married twice. When she left him, she literally had no money; she asked her friend Hermes Pan if she could eat at his home.\n\nHayworth married Orson Welles on September 7, 1943, during the run of \"The Mercury Wonder Show\". None of her colleagues knew about the planned wedding (before a judge) until she announced it the day before. For the civil ceremony, she wore a beige suit, a ruffled white blouse, and a veil. A few hours after they got married, they returned to work at the studio. They had a daughter, Rebecca, who was born on December 17, 1944, and died at the age of 59 on October 17, 2004. They struggled in their marriage. Hayworth said that Welles did not want to be tied down:\nDuring the entire period of our marriage, he showed no interest in establishing a home. When I suggested purchasing a home, he told me he didn't want the responsibility. Mr. Welles told me he never should have married in the first place; that it interfered with his freedom in his way of life.\n\nHayworth called Welles the great love of her life. On November 10, 1947, she was granted a divorce that became final the following year.\n\nIn 1948, Hayworth left her film career to marry Prince Aly Khan, a son of Sultan Mahommed Shah, Aga Khan III, the leader of the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam. They were married on May 27, 1949. Her bridal trousseau had been influenced by Dior's \"New Look\", launched in 1947.\n\nAly Khan and his family were heavily involved in horse racing, owning and racing horses. Hayworth had no interest in the sport, but became a member of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club anyway. Her filly, Double Rose, won several races in France and finished second in the 1949 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.\n\nIn 1951, while still married to Hayworth, Khan was spotted dancing with the actress Joan Fontaine in the nightclub where he and Hayworth had met. Hayworth threatened to divorce him in Reno, Nevada. In early May, Hayworth moved to Nevada to establish legal residence to qualify for a divorce. She stayed at Lake Tahoe with their daughter, saying there was a threat the child would be kidnapped. Hayworth filed for divorce from Khan on September 2, 1951, on the grounds of \"extreme cruelty, entirely mental in nature.\"\n\nHayworth once said she might convert to Islam, but did not. During the custody fight over their daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, born , the prince said he wanted her to be raised as a Muslim; Hayworth wanted the child to be raised as a Christian. Hayworth rejected his offer of $1 million if she would rear Yasmin as a Muslim from age seven and allow her to go to Europe to visit with him for two or three months each year, stating:\nNothing will make me give up Yasmin's chance to live here in America among our precious freedoms and habits. While I respect the Muslim faith, and all other faiths, it is my earnest wish that my daughter be raised as a normal, healthy American girl in the Christian faith. There isn't any amount of money in the entire world for which it is worth sacrificing this child's privilege of living as a normal Christian girl here in the United States. There just isn't anything else in the world that can compare with her sacred chance to do that. And I'm going to give it to Yasmin regardless of what it costs.In January 1953 Hayworth was granted a divorce from Aly Khan on the grounds of extreme mental cruelty. Hayworth's daughter Yasmin played about the court while the case was being heard, finally climbing on to the Judge's lap.\n\nWhen Hayworth and Dick Haymes first met, he was still married and his singing career was waning. When she showed up at the clubs, he got a larger audience. Haymes was desperate for money, because two of his former wives were taking legal action against him for unpaid child support. His financial problems were so bad, he could not return to California without being arrested. On July 7, 1954, his ex-wife Nora Haymes got a bench warrant for his arrest, because he owed her $3,800 in alimony. Less than a week earlier, his other ex-wife, Joanne Dru, also got a bench warrant because she said he owed $4,800 in support payments for their three children. Hayworth ended up paying most of Haymes's debts.\n\nHaymes was born in Argentina, and did not have solid proof of American citizenship. Not long after he met Hayworth, U.S. officials initiated proceedings to have him deported to Argentina for being an illegal alien. He hoped Hayworth could influence the government and keep him in the United States. When she assumed responsibility for his citizenship, a bond was formed that led to marriage. The two were married on September 24, 1953, at the Sands Hotel, Las Vegas, and their wedding procession went through the casino.\n\nFrom the start of their marriage, Haymes was deeply indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). When Hayworth took time off from attending his comeback performances in Philadelphia, the audiences sharply declined. Haymes's $5000 weekly salary was attached by the IRS to pay a $100,000 bill, and he was unable to pay his pianist. Haymes' ex-wives demanded money while Hayworth publicly bemoaned her own lack of alimony from Aly Khan. At one point, the couple was effectively imprisoned in a hotel room for 24 hours in Manhattan at the Hotel Madison as sheriff's deputies waited outside threatening to arrest Haymes for outstanding debts. At the same time, Hayworth was fighting a severe custody battle with Khan, during which she reported death threats against their children. While living in New York, Hayworth sent the children to live with their nanny in Westchester County. They were found and photographed by a reporter from \"Confidential\" magazine.\n\nAfter a tumultuous two years together, Haymes struck Hayworth in the face in 1955 in public at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. Hayworth packed her bags, walked out, and never returned. The assault and crisis shook her, and her doctor ordered her to remain in bed for several days.\n\nHayworth was short of money after her marriage to Haymes. She had failed to gain child support from Aly Khan. She sued Orson Welles for back payment of child support which she claimed had never been paid. This effort was unsuccessful and added to her stress.\n\nHayworth began a relationship with film producer James Hill, whom she went on to marry on February 2, 1958. He put her in one of her last major films, \"Separate Tables.\" This film was popular and highly praised, although \"The Harvard Lampoon\" named her the worst actress of 1958 for her performance. On September 1, 1961, Hayworth filed for divorce, alleging extreme mental cruelty. Hill later wrote \"Rita Hayworth: A Memoir\", in which he suggested that their marriage collapsed because he wanted Hayworth to continue making movies, while she wanted them both to retire from Hollywood.\n\nIn his autobiography, Charlton Heston wrote about Hayworth's brief marriage to Hill. One night Heston and his wife Lydia joined the couple for dinner at a restaurant in Spain with the director George Marshall and the actor Rex Harrison, Hayworth's co-star in \"The Happy Thieves\". Heston wrote that the occasion \"turned into the single most embarrassing evening of my life,\" describing how Hill heaped \"obscene abuse\" on Hayworth until she was \"reduced to a helpless flood of tears, her face buried in her hands.\" Heston wrote that the others sat stunned, witnesses to a \"marital massacre\" and, though he was \"strongly tempted to slug him\" (Hill), he left with his wife Lydia after she stood up, almost in tears. Heston wrote, \"I'm ashamed of walking away from Miss Hayworth's humiliation. I never saw her again.\"\n\nOrson Welles noted Hayworth's problem with alcohol during their marriage, but he never believed that her problem was alcoholism. \"It certainly imitated alcoholism in every superficial way,\" he recalled in 1983. \"She'd fly into these rages, never at me, never once, always at Harry Cohn or her father or her mother or her brother. She would break all the furniture and she'd get in a car and I'd have to get in the car and try to control her. She'd drive up in the hills suicidally. Terrible, terrible nights. And I just saw this lovely girl destroying herself. I admire Yasmin so much.\"\n\nYasmin Aga Khan spoke of her mother's long struggle with alcohol:\nI remember as a child that she had a drinking problem. She had difficulty coping with the ups and downs of the business ...As a child, I thought, 'She has a drinking problem and she's an alcoholic.' That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner ... Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.\n\nIn 1972, the 54-year-old Hayworth wanted to retire from acting, but she needed money. At the suggestion of Robert Mitchum, she agreed to film \"The Wrath of God\". The experience exposed her poor health and her worsening mental state. Because she could not remember her lines, her scenes were shot one line at a time. In November, she agreed to complete one more movie, the British film \"Tales That Witness Madness\", but because of her worsening health, she left the set and returned to the United States. She never returned to acting.\n\nIn March 1974, both of her brothers died within a week of each other, which caused her great sadness and led to heavy drinking. In January 1976 at London's Heathrow Airport, Hayworth was removed from a TWA flight after having an angry outburst while traveling with her agent. The event attracted much negative publicity; a disturbing photograph was published in newspapers the next day. Hayworth's alcoholism hid symptoms of what was eventually understood to be Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"It was the outbursts,\" said Yasmin Aga Khan. \"She'd fly into a rage. I can't tell you. I thought it was alcoholism—alcoholic dementia. We all thought that. The papers picked that up, of course. You can't imagine the relief just in getting a diagnosis. We had a name at last, Alzheimer's! Of course, that didn't really come until the last seven or eight years. She wasn't diagnosed as having Alzheimer's until 1980. There were two decades of hell before that.\"\n\nBiographer Barbara Leaming wrote that Hayworth aged prematurely because of her addiction to alcohol and also because of the many stresses in her life. \"Despite the artfully applied make-up and shoulder-length red hair, there was no concealing the ravages of drink and stress,\" she wrote of Hayworth's arrival in New York in May 1956 in order to begin work on \"Fire Down Below\", her first film in three years. \"Deep lines had crept around her eyes and mouth, and she appeared worn, exhausted—older than her thirty-eight years.\"\n\nAlzheimer's disease had been largely forgotten by the medical community since its discovery in 1906. Medical historian Barron H. Lerner wrote that when Hayworth's diagnosis was made public in 1981, she became \"the first public face of Alzheimer's, helping to ensure that future patients did not go undiagnosed...Unbeknownst to her, Hayworth helped to destigmatize a condition that can still embarrass victims and their families.\"\n\nIn July 1981, Hayworth's health had deteriorated to the point that a judge in Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that she should be placed under the care of her daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan of New York City. Hayworth lived in an apartment at The San Remo on Central Park West adjoining that of her daughter, who arranged for her mother's care during her final years. When asked how her mother was doing, Yasmin replied, \"She's still beautiful. But it's a shell.\"\n\nIn 1983, Rebecca Welles arranged to see her mother for the first time in seven years. Speaking to his lifelong friend Roger Hill, Orson Welles expressed his concern about the visit's effect on his daughter. \"Rita barely knows me now,\" Welles said. He recalled seeing Hayworth three years before at an event which the Reagans held for Frank Sinatra. \"When it was over, I came over to her table and I saw that she was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, I could see that she realized who I was, and she began to cry quietly.\"\n\nIn an interview which he gave the evening before his death in 1985, Welles called Hayworth \"one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived\".\n\nHayworth was a lifelong Democrat who was an active member of the Hollywood Democratic Committee and was active in the campaign of Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the 1944 presidential election.\n\nHayworth was a Roman Catholic whose marriage to Prince Aly Khan was deemed \"illicit\" by The Pope.\n\nRita Hayworth lapsed into a semicoma in February 1987. She died at age 68 from complications associated with Alzheimer's disease three months later on May 14, 1987, at her home in Manhattan. President Ronald Reagan, who had been one of Hayworth's contemporaries in Hollywood, issued a statement:\n\nRita Hayworth was one of our country's most beloved stars. Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl. In her later years, Rita became known for her struggle with Alzheimer's disease. Her courage and candor, and that of her family, were a great public service in bringing worldwide attention to a disease which we all hope will soon be cured. Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend who we will miss. We extend our deep sympathy to her family.\n\nA funeral service was held on May 18, 1987, at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Pallbearers included actors Ricardo Montalbán, Glenn Ford, Don Ameche, agent Budd Burton Moss, and the choreographer Hermes Pan. She was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. Her headstone includes Yasmin's sentiment: \"To yesterday's companionship and tomorrow's reunion.\"\n\nHayworth received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama for her performance in \"Circus World\" (1964).\n\nIn 1978 at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, DC, Hayworth was presented with the inaugural National Screen Heritage Award of the National Film Society, a group that published \"American Classic Screen\" magazine (1976–84).\n\nIn 1999, Hayworth was acknowledged as one of the top-25 greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood cinema in the American Film Institute's survey, AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars.\n\nThe public disclosure and discussion of Hayworth's illness drew international attention to Alzheimer's disease, which was little known at the time, and it helped to greatly increase federal funding for Alzheimer's research.\n\nThe Rita Hayworth Gala, a benefit for the Alzheimer's Association, is held annually in Chicago and New York City. The program was founded in 1985 by Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, in honor of her mother. She is the hostess for the events and a major sponsor of Alzheimer's disease charities and awareness programs. , a total of more than $72 million had been raised through events in Chicago, New York and Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nOn October 17, 2016, a press release from the Springer Associates Public Relations Agency announced that Rita Hayworth's former manager and friend, Budd Burton Moss, initiated a campaign to solicit the United States Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp featuring Hayworth. Springer Associates also announced that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would be lobbied in hopes of having an honorary Academy Award issued in memory of Hayworth. The press release added that Hayworth's daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, the Alzheimer's Association of Greater Los Angeles, and numerous prominent personalities of stage and screen were supporting the Moss campaign. The press release stated the target date for fulfillment of the stamp and Academy Award to be on October 17, 2018, on what will be the centennial of Hayworth's birth.\n\nThe film \"I Remember Better When I Paint\" (2009) describes how Hayworth took up painting while struggling with Alzheimer's and produced art.\n\n\n",
                "Orson Welles\n\nGeorge Orson Welles (; May 6, 1915 – October 10, 1985) was an American actor, director, writer, and producer who worked in theatre, radio, and film. He is remembered for his innovative work in all three: in theatre, most notably \"Caesar\" (1937), a Broadway adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\"; in radio, the legendary 1938 broadcast \"The War of the Worlds\"; and in film, \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), consistently ranked as one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nIn his 20s, Welles directed a number of high-profile stage productions for the Federal Theatre Project, including an adaptation of \"Macbeth\" with an entirely African American cast, and the political musical \"The Cradle Will Rock\". In 1937 he and John Houseman founded the Mercury Theatre, an independent repertory theatre company that presented a series of productions on Broadway through 1941. Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel \"The War of the Worlds\" performed for his radio anthology series \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\". It reportedly caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was actually occurring. Although some contemporary sources claim these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to notoriety.\n\nHis first film was \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), which he co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred in as Charles Foster Kane. Welles was an outsider to the studio system and directed only 13 full-length films in his career. He struggled for creative control on his projects early on with the major film studios and later in life with a variety of independent financiers, and his films were either heavily edited or remained unreleased. His distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear narrative forms, uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes. He has been praised as \"the ultimate auteur\".\n\nWelles followed up \"Citizen Kane\" with 12 other feature films, the most acclaimed of which include \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942), \"Touch of Evil\" (1958), and \"Chimes at Midnight\" (1966). Other works of his, such as \"The Lady from Shanghai\" (1947) and \"F for Fake\" (1973), are also well-regarded.\n\nIn 2002, Welles was voted the greatest film director of all time in two British Film Institute polls among directors and critics. Known for his baritone voice, Welles was an actor in radio and film, a Shakespearean stage actor, and a magician noted for presenting troop variety shows in the war years.\n\nGeorge Orson Welles was born May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, son of Richard Head Welles (b. Richard Hodgdon Wells, November 12, 1872, near St. Joseph, Missouri; d. December 28, 1930, Chicago, Illinois) and Beatrice Ives Welles (b. Beatrice Lucy Ives, September 1, 1883, Springfield, Illinois; d. May 10, 1924, Chicago). He was named after his paternal great-grandfather, influential Kenosha attorney Orson S. Head, and his brother George Head. An alternative story of the source of his first and middle names is one told by George Ade, who met Welles's parents on a West Indies cruise toward the end of 1914. Ade was traveling with a friend, Orson Wells (no relation), and the two of them sat at the same table as Mr. and Mrs. Richard Welles. Mrs Welles was pregnant at the time, and when they said good-by, she told them that she had enjoyed their company so much that if the child were a boy, she intended to name it for them - George Orson. Welles's birth announcement and a picture of him as a young boy are among George Ade's papers at Purdue University.\n\nDespite his family's affluence, Welles encountered hardship in childhood. His parents separated and moved to Chicago in 1919. His father, who made a fortune as the inventor of a popular bicycle lamp, became an alcoholic and stopped working. Welles's mother, a pianist, played during lectures by Dudley Crafts Watson at the Art Institute of Chicago to support her son and herself; the oldest Welles boy, \"Dickie\", was institutionalized at an early age because he had learning difficulties. Beatrice died of hepatitis in a Chicago hospital May 10, 1924, just after Welles's ninth birthday. The Gordon String Quartet, which had made its first appearance at her home in 1921, played at Beatrice's funeral.\n\nAfter his mother's death, Welles ceased pursuing music. It was decided that he would spend the summer with the Watson family at a private art colony in Wyoming, New York, established by Lydia Avery Coonley Ward. There he played and became friends with the children of the Aga Khan, including the 12-year-old Prince Aly Khan. Then, in what Welles later described as \"a hectic period\" in his life, he lived in a Chicago apartment with both his father and Dr. Maurice Bernstein, a Chicago physician who had been a close friend of both his parents. Welles briefly attended public school before his alcoholic father left business altogether and took him along on his travels to Jamaica and the Far East. When they returned they settled in a hotel in Grand Detour, Illinois, that was owned by his father. When the hotel burned down, Welles and his father took to the road again.\n\n\"During the three years that Orson lived with his father, some observers wondered who took care of whom\", wrote biographer Frank Brady.\n\n\"In some ways, he was never really a young boy, you know,\" said Roger Hill, who became Welles's teacher and lifelong friend.\n\nWelles briefly attended public school in Madison, Wisconsin, enrolled in the fourth grade. On September 15, 1926, he entered the Todd Seminary for Boys, an expensive independent school in Woodstock, Illinois, that his older brother, Richard Ives Welles, had attended ten years before but was expelled for misbehavior. At Todd School, Welles came under the influence of Roger Hill, a teacher who was later Todd's headmaster. Hill provided Welles with an \"ad hoc\" educational environment that proved invaluable to his creative experience, allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that interested him. Welles performed and staged theatrical experiments and productions there.\n\n\"Todd provided Welles with many valuable experiences\", wrote critic Richard France. \"He was able to explore and experiment in an atmosphere of acceptance and encouragement. In addition to a theater the school's own radio station was at his disposal.\" Welles' first radio experience was on the Todd station, he performed an adaptation of \"Sherlock Holmes\" that was written by him.\n\nOn December 28, 1930, when Welles was 15, his father died of heart and kidney failure at the age of 58, alone in a hotel in Chicago. Shortly before this, Welles had announced to his father that he would stop seeing him, believing it would prompt his father to refrain from drinking. As a result, Orson felt guilty because he believed his father had drunk himself to death because of him. His father's will left it to Orson to name his guardian. When Roger Hill declined, Welles chose Maurice Bernstein.\n\nFollowing graduation from Todd in May 1931, Welles was awarded a scholarship to Harvard University, while his mentor Roger Hill advocated he attend Cornell College in Iowa. Rather than enrolling, he chose travel. He studied for a few weeks at the Art Institute of Chicago with Boris Anisfeld, who encouraged him to pursue painting.\n\nWelles would occasionally return to Woodstock, the place he eventually named when he was asked in a 1960 interview, \"Where is home?\" Welles replied, \"I suppose it's Woodstock, Illinois, if it's anywhere. I went to school there for four years. If I try to think of a home, it's that.\"\n\nAfter his father's death, Welles traveled to Europe using a small portion of his inheritance. Welles said that while on a walking and painting trip through Ireland, he strode into the Gate Theatre in Dublin and claimed he was a Broadway star. The manager of Gate, Hilton Edwards, later said he had not believed him but was impressed by his brashness and an impassioned audition he gave. Welles made his stage debut at the Gate Theatre on October 13, 1931, appearing in Ashley Dukes's adaptation of \"Jew Suss\" as Duke Karl Alexander of Württemberg. He performed small supporting roles in subsequent Gate productions, and he produced and designed productions of his own in Dublin. In March 1932 Welles performed in W. Somerset Maugham's \"The Circle\" at Dublin's Abbey Theatre and travelled to London to find additional work in the theatre. Unable to obtain a work permit, he returned to the U.S.\n\nWelles found his fame ephemeral and turned to a writing project at Todd School that would become the immensely successful, first entitled \"Everybody's Shakespeare\" and subsequently, \"The Mercury Shakespeare\". Welles traveled to North Africa while working on thousands of illustrations for the \"Everybody's Shakespeare\" series of educational books, a series that remained in print for decades.\n\nIn 1933, Roger and Hortense Hill invited Welles to a party in Chicago, where Welles met Thornton Wilder. Wilder arranged for Welles to meet Alexander Woollcott in New York, in order that he be introduced to Katharine Cornell, who was assembling a repertory theatre company. Cornell's husband, director Guthrie McClintic, immediately put Welles under contract and cast him in three plays. \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" and \"Candida\" toured in repertory for 36 weeks beginning in November 1933, with the first of more than 200 performances taking place in Buffalo, New York.\n\nIn 1934, Welles got his first job on radio—on \"The American School of the Air\"—through actor-director Paul Stewart, who introduced him to director Knowles Entrikin. That summer Welles staged a drama festival with the Todd School in Woodstock, Illinois, inviting Micheál Mac Liammóir and Hilton Edwards from Dublin's Gate Theatre to appear along with New York stage luminaries in productions including \"Trilby\", \"Hamlet\", \"The Drunkard\" and \"Tsar Paul\". At the old firehouse in Woodstock he also shot his first film, an eight-minute short titled \"The Hearts of Age\".\n\nOn November 14, 1934, Welles married Chicago socialite and actress Virginia Nicolson (often misspelled \"Nicholson\") in a civil ceremony in New York. To appease the Nicolsons, who were furious at the couple's elopement, a formal ceremony took place December 23, 1934, at the New Jersey mansion of the bride's godmother. Welles wore a cutaway borrowed from his friend George Macready.\n\nA revised production of Katharine Cornell's \"Romeo and Juliet\" opened December 20, 1934, at the Martin Beck Theatre in New York. The Broadway production brought the 19-year-old Welles (now playing Tybalt) to the notice of John Houseman, a theatrical producer who was casting the lead role in the debut production of Archibald MacLeish's verse play, \"Panic\". On March 22, 1935, Welles made his debut on the CBS Radio series \"The March of Time\", performing a scene from \"Panic\" for a news report on the stage production\n\nBy 1935 Welles was supplementing his earnings in the theater as a radio actor in Manhattan, working with many actors who would later form the core of his Mercury Theatre on programs including \"America's Hour\", \"Cavalcade of America\", \"Columbia Workshop\" and \"The March of Time\". \"Within a year of his debut Welles could claim membership in that elite band of radio actors who commanded salaries second only to the highest paid movie stars,\" wrote critic Richard France.\n\nPart of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project (1935–39) was a New Deal program to fund theatre and other live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the United States during the Great Depression. It was created as a relief measure to employ artists, writers, directors and theater workers. Under national director Hallie Flanagan it was shaped into a true national theatre that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation and innovation, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time.\nJohn Houseman, director of the Negro Theatre Unit in New York, invited Welles to join the Federal Theatre Project in 1935. Far from unemployed — \"I was so employed I forgot how to sleep\" — Welles put a large share of his $1,500-a-week radio earnings into his stage productions, bypassing administrative red tape and mounting the projects more quickly and professionally. \"Roosevelt once said that I was the only operator in history who ever illegally siphoned money \"into\" a Washington project,\" Welles said.\n\nThe Federal Theatre Project was the ideal environment in which Welles could develop his art. Its purpose was employment, so he was able to hire any number of artists, craftsmen and technicians, and he filled the stage with performers. The company for the first production, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" with an entirely African-American cast, numbered 150. The production became known as the \"Voodoo Macbeth\" because Welles changed the setting to a mythical island suggesting the Haitian court of King Henri Christophe, with Haitian \"vodou\" fulfilling the rôle of Scottish witchcraft. The play opened April 14, 1936, at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem and was received rapturously. At 20, Welles was hailed as a prodigy. The production then made a 4,000-mile national tour that included two weeks at the Texas Centennial Exposition in Dallas.\n\nNext mounted was the farce \"Horse Eats Hat\", an adaptation by Welles and Edwin Denby of \"The Italian Straw Hat\", an 1851 five-act farce by Eugène Marin Labiche and Marc-Michel. The play was presented September 26 – December 5, 1936, at Maxine Elliott's Theatre, New York, and featured Joseph Cotten in his first starring role. It was followed by an adaptation of \"Dr. Faustus\" that used light as a prime unifying scenic element in a nearly black stage, presented January 8 – May 9, 1937, at Maxine Elliott's Theatre.\n\nOutside the scope of the Federal Theatre Project, American composer Aaron Copland chose Welles to direct \"The Second Hurricane\" (1937), an operetta with a libretto by Edwin Denby. Presented at the Henry Street Settlement Music School in New York for the benefit of high school students, the production opened April 21, 1937, and ran its scheduled three performances.\n\nIn 1937, Welles rehearsed Marc Blitzstein's political operetta, \"The Cradle Will Rock\". It was originally scheduled to open June 16, 1937, in its first public preview. Because of severe federal cutbacks in the Works Progress projects, the show's premiere at the Maxine Elliott Theatre was canceled. The theater was locked and guarded to prevent any government-purchased materials from being used for a commercial production of the work. In a last-minute move, Welles announced to waiting ticket-holders that the show was being transferred to the Venice, 20 blocks away. Some cast, and some crew and audience, walked the distance on foot. The union musicians refused to perform in a commercial theater for lower non-union government wages. The actors' union stated that the production belonged to the Federal Theater Project and could not be performed outside that context without permission. Lacking the participation of the union members, \"The Cradle Will Rock\" began with Blitzstein introducing the show and playing the piano accompaniment on stage with some cast members performing from the audience. This impromptu performance was well received by its audience.\n\nBreaking with the Federal Theatre Project in 1937, Welles and Houseman founded their own repertory company, which they called the Mercury Theatre. The name was inspired by the title of the iconoclastic magazine, \"The American Mercury\". Welles was executive producer, and the original company included such actors as Joseph Cotten, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Arlene Francis, Martin Gabel, John Hoyt, Norman Lloyd, Vincent Price, Stefan Schnabel and Hiram Sherman.\n\n\"I think he was the greatest directorial talent we've ever had in the [American] theater,\" Lloyd said of Welles in a 2014 interview. \"When you saw a Welles production, you saw the text had been affected, the staging was remarkable, the sets were unusual, music, sound, lighting, a totality of everything. We had not had such a man in our theater. He was the first and remains the greatest.\"\n\nThe Mercury Theatre opened November 11, 1937, with \"Caesar\", Welles's modern-dress adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy \"Julius Caesar\" — streamlined into an anti-fascist tour de force that Joseph Cotten later described as \"so vigorous, so contemporary that it set Broadway on its ear.\" The set was completely open with no curtain, and the brick stage wall was painted dark red. Scene changes were achieved by lighting alone. On the stage was a series of risers; squares were cut into one at intervals and lights were set beneath it, pointing straight up to evoke the \"cathedral of light\" at the Nuremberg Rallies. \"He staged it like a political melodrama that happened the night before,\" said Lloyd.\n\nBeginning January 1, 1938, \"Caesar\" was performed in repertory with \"The Shoemaker's Holiday\"; both productions moved to the larger National Theatre. They were followed by \"Heartbreak House\" (April 29, 1938) and \"Danton's Death\" (November 5, 1938). As well as being presented in a pared-down oratorio version at the Mercury Theatre on Sunday nights in December 1937, \"The Cradle Will Rock\" was at the Windsor Theatre for 13 weeks (January 4–April 2, 1938). Such was the success of the Mercury Theatre that Welles appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, in full makeup as Captain Shotover in \"Heartbreak House\", in the issue dated May 9, 1938—three days after his 23rd birthday.\n\nSimultaneously with his work in the theatre, Welles worked extensively in radio as an actor, writer, director and producer, often without credit. Between 1935 and 1937 he was earning as much as $2,000 a week, shuttling between radio studios at such a pace that he would arrive barely in time for a quick scan of his lines before he was on the air. While he was directing the \"Voodoo Macbeth\" Welles was dashing between Harlem and midtown Manhattan three times a day to meet his radio commitments.\n\nIn addition to continuing as a repertory player on \"The March of Time\", in the fall of 1936 Welles adapted and performed \"Hamlet\" in an early two-part episode of CBS Radio's \"Columbia Workshop\". His performance as the announcer in the series' April 1937 presentation of Archibald MacLeish's verse drama \"The Fall of the City\" was an important development in his radio career and made the 21-year-old Welles an overnight star.\n\nIn July 1937, the Mutual Network gave Welles a seven-week series to adapt \"Les Misérables\". It was his first job as a writer-director for radio, the radio debut of the Mercury Theatre, and one of Welles's earliest and finest achievements. He invented the use of narration in radio.\n\n\"By making himself the center of the storytelling process, Welles fostered the impression of self-adulation that was to haunt his career to his dying day,\" wrote critic Andrew Sarris. \"For the most part, however, Welles was singularly generous to the other members of his cast and inspired loyalty from them above and beyond the call of professionalism.\"\n\nThat September, Mutual chose Welles to play Lamont Cranston, also known as \"The Shadow\". He performed the role anonymously through mid-September 1938.\n\nAfter the theatrical successes of the Mercury Theatre, CBS Radio invited Orson Welles to create a summer show for 13 weeks. The series began July 11, 1938, initially titled \"First Person Singular\", with the formula that Welles would play the lead in each show. Some months later the show was called \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\". The weekly hour-long show presented radio plays based on classic literary works, with original music composed and conducted by Bernard Herrmann.\n\nThe Mercury Theatre's radio adaptation of \"The War of the Worlds\" by H. G. Wells October 30, 1938, brought Welles instant fame. The combination of the news bulletin form of the performance with the between-breaks dial spinning habits of listeners was later reported to have created widespread confusion among listeners who failed to hear the introduction, although the extent of this confusion has come into question. Panic was reportedly spread among listeners who believed the fictional news reports of a Martian invasion. The myth of the result created by the combination was reported as fact around the world and disparagingly mentioned by Adolf Hitler in a public speech.\n\nWelles's growing fame drew Hollywood offers, lures that the independent-minded Welles resisted at first. \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air,\" which had been a sustaining show (without sponsorship) was picked up by Campbell Soup and renamed \"The Campbell Playhouse.\" \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" made its last broadcast on December 4, 1938, and \"The Campbell Playhouse\" began five days later.\n\nWelles began commuting from California to New York for the two Sunday broadcasts of \"The Campbell Playhouse\" after signing a film contract with RKO Pictures in August 1939. In November 1939, production of the show moved from New York to Los Angeles.\n\nAfter 20 shows, Campbell began to exercise more creative control and had complete control over story selection. As his contract with Campbell came to an end, Welles chose not to sign on for another season. After the broadcast of March 31, 1940, Welles and Campbell parted amicably.\n\nRKO Radio Pictures president George Schaefer eventually offered Welles what generally is considered the greatest contract offered to a filmmaker, much less to one who was untried. Engaging him to write, produce, direct and perform in two motion pictures, the contract subordinated the studio's financial interests to Welles's creative control, and broke all precedent by granting Welles the right of final cut. After signing a summary agreement with RKO on July 22, Welles signed a full-length 63-page contract August 21, 1939. The agreement was bitterly resented by the Hollywood studios and persistently mocked in the trade press.\n\nRKO rejected Welles's first two movie proposals, but agreed on the third offer—\"Citizen Kane\". Welles co-wrote, produced and directed the film, and performed the lead role. Welles conceived the project with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who was writing radio plays for \"The Campbell Playhouse\". Mankiewicz based the original outline on the life of William Randolph Hearst, whom he knew socially and came to hate after being exiled from Hearst's circle.\n\nAfter agreeing on the storyline and character, Welles supplied Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes and put him under contract to write the first draft screenplay under the supervision of John Houseman. Welles wrote his own draft, then drastically condensed and rearranged both versions and added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, \"At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own.\"\n\nWelles's project attracted some of Hollywood's best technicians, including cinematographer Gregg Toland. For the cast, Welles primarily used actors from his Mercury Theatre. Filming \"Citizen Kane\" took ten weeks.\n\nHearst's newspapers barred all reference to \"Citizen Kane\" and exerted enormous pressure on the Hollywood film community to force RKO to shelve the film. RKO chief George Schaefer received a cash offer from MGM's Louis B. Mayer and other major studio executives if he would destroy the negative and existing prints of the film.\n\nWhile waiting for \"Citizen Kane\" to be released, Welles produced and directed the original Broadway production of \"Native Son\", a drama written by Paul Green and Richard Wright based on Wright's novel. Starring Canada Lee, the show ran March 24 – June 28, 1941, at the St. James Theatre. The Mercury Production was the last time Welles and Houseman worked together.\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" was given a limited release and the film received overwhelming critical praise. It was voted the best picture of 1941 by the National Board of Review and the New York Film Critics Circle. The film garnered nine Academy Award nominations but won only for Best Original Screenplay, shared by Mankiewicz and Welles. \"Variety\" reported that block voting by screen extras deprived \"Citizen Kane\" of Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (Welles), and similar prejudices were likely to have been responsible for the film receiving no technical awards.\n\nThe delay in the film's release and uneven distribution contributed to mediocre results at the box office. After it ran its course theatrically, \"Citizen Kane\" was retired to the vault in 1942. In postwar France, however, the film's reputation grew after it was seen for the first time in 1946. In the United States, it began to be re-evaluated after it began to appear on television in 1956. That year it was also re-released theatrically, and film critic Andrew Sarris described it as \"the great American film\" and \"the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since \"Birth of a Nation\".\" \"Citizen Kane\" is now hailed as one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nWelles's second film for RKO was \"The Magnificent Ambersons\", adapted by Welles from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Booth Tarkington. Toland was not available, so Stanley Cortez was named cinematographer. The meticulous Cortez worked slowly and the film lagged behind schedule and over budget. Prior to production, Welles's contract was renegotiated, revoking his right to control the final cut. \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" was in production October 28, 1941 – January 22, 1942.\n\nThroughout the shooting of the film Welles was also producing a weekly half-hour radio series, \"The Orson Welles Show\". Many of the \"Ambersons\" cast participated in the CBS Radio series, which ran September 15, 1941 – February 2, 1942.\n\nAt RKO's request, Welles worked on an adaptation of Eric Ambler's spy thriller, \"Journey into Fear\", co-written with Joseph Cotten. In addition to acting in the film, Welles was the producer. Direction was credited to Norman Foster. Welles later said that they were in such a rush that the director of each scene was determined by whoever was closest to the camera.\n\n\"Journey into Fear\" was in production January 6–March 12, 1942.\n\nIn late November 1941, Welles was appointed as a goodwill ambassador to Latin America by Nelson Rockefeller, U.S. Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and a principal stockholder in RKO Radio Pictures. The mission of the OCIAA was cultural diplomacy, promoting hemispheric solidarity and countering the growing influence of the Axis powers in Latin America. John Hay Whitney, head of the agency's Motion Picture Division, was asked by the Brazilian government to produce a documentary of the annual Rio Carnival celebration taking place in early February 1942. In a telegram December 20, 1941, Whitney wrote Welles, \"Personally believe you would make great contribution to hemisphere solidarity with this project.\"\n\nThe OCIAA sponsored cultural tours to Latin America and appointed goodwill ambassadors including George Balanchine and the American Ballet, Bing Crosby, Aaron Copland, Walt Disney, John Ford and Rita Hayworth. Welles was thoroughly briefed in Washington, D.C., immediately before his departure for Brazil, and film scholar Catherine L. Benamou, a specialist in Latin American affairs, finds it \"not unlikely\" that he was among the goodwill ambassadors who were asked to gather intelligence for the U.S. government in addition to their cultural duties. She concludes that Welles's acceptance of Whitney's request was \"a logical and patently patriotic choice\".\n\nIn addition to working on his ill-fated film project, \"It's All True\", Welles was responsible for radio programs, lectures, interviews and informal talks as part of his OCIAA-sponsored cultural mission, which was regarded as a success. He spoke on topics ranging from Shakespeare to visual art at gatherings of Brazil's elite, and his two intercontinental radio broadcasts in April 1942 were particularly intended to tell U.S. audiences that President Vargas was a partner with the Allies. Welles's ambassadorial mission was extended to permit his travel to other nations including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. Welles worked for more than half a year with no compensation.\n\nWelles's own expectations for the film were modest. \"\"It's All True\" was not going to make any cinematic history, nor was it intended to,\" he later said. \"It was intended to be a perfectly honorable execution of my job as a goodwill ambassador, bringing entertainment to the Northern Hemisphere that showed them something about the Southern one.\"\n\nIn July 1941, Welles conceived \"It's All True\" as an omnibus film mixing documentary and docufiction in a project that emphasized the dignity of labor and celebrated the cultural and ethnic diversity of North America. It was to have been his third film for RKO, following \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) and \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942). Duke Ellington was put under contract to score a segment with the working title, \"The Story of Jazz\", drawn from Louis Armstrong's 1936 autobiography, \"Swing That Music\". Armstrong was cast to play himself in the brief dramatization of the history of jazz performance, from its roots to its place in American culture in the 1940s. \"The Story of Jazz\" was to go into production in December 1941.\n\nMercury Productions purchased the stories for two other segments—\"My Friend Bonito\" and \"The Captain's Chair\"—from documentary filmmaker Robert J. Flaherty. Adapted by Norman Foster and John Fante, \"My Friend Bonito\" was the only segment of the original \"It's All True\" to go into production. Filming took place in Mexico September–December 1941, with Norman Foster directing under Welles's supervision.\n\nIn December 1941, the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs asked Welles to make a film in Brazil that would showcase the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. With filming of \"My Friend Bonito\" about two-thirds complete, Welles decided he could shift the geography of \"It's All True\" and incorporate Flaherty's story into an omnibus film about Latin America—supporting the Roosevelt administration's Good Neighbor policy, which Welles strongly advocated. In this revised concept, \"The Story of Jazz\" was replaced by the story of samba, a musical form with a comparable history and one that came to fascinate Welles. He also decided to do a ripped-from-the-headlines episode about the epic voyage of four poor Brazilian fishermen, the jangadeiros, who had become national heroes. Welles later said this was the most valuable story.\n\nRequired to film the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro in early February 1942, Welles rushed to edit \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" and finish his acting scenes in \"Journey into Fear\". He ended his lucrative CBS radio show February 2, flew to Washington, D.C., for a briefing, and then lashed together a rough cut of \"Ambersons\" in Miami with editor Robert Wise. Welles recorded the film's narration the night before he left for South America: \"I went to the projection room at about four in the morning, did the whole thing, and then got on the plane and off to Rio—and the end of civilization as we know it.\"\n\nWelles left for Brazil on February 4 and began filming in Rio February 8, 1942. At the time it did not seem that Welles's other film projects would be disrupted, but as film historian Catherine L. Benamou wrote, \"the ambassadorial appointment would be the first in a series of turning points leading—in 'zigs' and 'zags,' rather than in a straight line—to Welles's loss of complete directorial control over both \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" and \"It's All True\", the cancellation of his contract at RKO Radio Studio, the expulsion of his company Mercury Productions from the RKO lot, and, ultimately, the total suspension of \"It's All True\".\n\nIn 1942 RKO Pictures underwent major changes under new management. Nelson Rockefeller, the primary backer of the Brazil project, left its board of directors, and Welles's principal sponsor at RKO, studio president George Schaefer, resigned. RKO took control of \"Ambersons\" and edited the film into what the studio considered a commercial format. Welles's attempts to protect his version ultimately failed. In South America, Welles requested resources to finish \"It's All True\". Given a limited amount of black-and-white film stock and a silent camera, he was able to finish shooting the episode about the jangadeiros, but RKO refused to support further production on the film.\n\n\"So I was fired from RKO,\" Welles later recalled. \"And they made a great publicity point of the fact that I had gone to South America without a script and thrown all this money away. I never recovered from that attack.\" Later in 1942, when RKO Pictures began promoting its new corporate motto, \"Showmanship In Place of Genius: A New Deal at RKO\", Welles understood it as a reference to him.\n\nWelles returned to the United States August 22, 1942, after more than six months in South America. A week after his return he produced and emceed the first two hours of a seven-hour coast-to-coast War Bond drive broadcast titled \"I Pledge America\". Airing August 29, 1942, on the Blue Network, the program was presented in cooperation with the United States Department of the Treasury, Western Union (which wired bond subscriptions free of charge) and the American Women's Voluntary Services. Featuring 21 dance bands and a score of stage and screen and radio stars, the broadcast raised more than $10 million—more than $146 million today—for the war effort.\n\nOn October 12, 1942, \"Cavalcade of America\" presented Welles's radio play, \"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\", an entertaining and factual look at the legend of Christopher Columbus.\n\n\"It belongs to a period when hemispheric unity was a crucial matter and many programs were being devoted to the common heritage of the Americas,\" wrote broadcasting historian Erik Barnouw. \"Many such programs were being translated into Spanish and Portuguese and broadcast to Latin America, to counteract many years of successful Axis propaganda to that area. The Axis, trying to stir Latin America against Anglo-America, had constantly emphasized the differences between the two. It became the job of American radio to emphasize their common experience and essential unity.\"\n\n\"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\", also known as \"Columbus Day\", begins with the words, \"Hello Americans\"—the title Welles would choose for his own series five weeks later.\n\n\"Hello Americans\", a CBS Radio series broadcast November 15, 1942 – January 31, 1943, was produced, directed and hosted by Welles under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator for Inter-American Affairs. The 30-minute weekly program promoted inter-American understanding and friendship, drawing upon the research amassed for the ill-fated film, \"It's All True\". The series was produced concurrently with Welles's other CBS series, \"Ceiling Unlimited\" (November 9, 1942 – February 1, 1943), sponsored by the Lockheed-Vega Corporation. The program was conceived to glorify the aviation industry and dramatize its role in World War II. Welles's shows were regarded as significant contributions to the war effort.\n\nThroughout the war Welles worked on patriotic radio programs including \"Command Performance\", \"G.I. Journal\", \"Mail Call\", \"Nazi Eyes on Canada\", \"Stage Door Canteen\" and \"Treasury Star Parade\".\n\nIn early 1943, the two concurrent radio series (\"Ceiling Unlimited\", \"Hello Americans\") that Orson Welles created for CBS to support the war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on the 1943 film adaptation of \"Jane Eyre\" and that fee, in addition to the income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part circus and part magic show. He offered his services as magician and director, and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he co-produced with his friend Joseph Cotten: \"The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men\". Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay. The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel.\n\nThe development of the show coincided with the resolution of Welles's oft-changing draft status in May 1943, when he was finally declared 4-F—unfit for military service—for a variety of medical reasons. \"I felt guilty about the war,\" Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. \"I was guilt-ridden about my civilian status.\" He had been publicly hounded about his patriotism since \"Citizen Kane\", when the Hearst press began persistent inquiries about why Welles had not been drafted.\n\n\"The Mercury Wonder Show\" ran August 3 – September 9, 1943, in an 80-by-120-foot tent located at 9000 Cahuenga Boulevard, in the heart of Hollywood.\n\nAt intermission September 7, 1943, KMPC radio interviewed audience and cast members of \"The Mercury Wonder Show\"—including Welles and Rita Hayworth, who were married earlier that day. Welles remarked that \"The Mercury Wonder Show\" had been performed for approximately 48,000 members of the U.S. armed forces.\n\nThe idea of doing a radio variety show occurred to Welles after his success as substitute host of four consecutive episodes (March 14 – April 4, 1943) of \"The Jack Benny Program\", radio's most popular show, when Benny contracted pneumonia on a performance tour of military bases. A half-hour variety show broadcast January 26 – July 19, 1944, on the Columbia Pacific Network, \"The Orson Welles Almanac\" presented sketch comedy, magic, mindreading, music and readings from classic works. Many of the shows originated on U.S. military camps, where Welles and his repertory company and guests entertained the troops with a reduced version of \"The Mercury Wonder Show\". The performances of the all-star jazz group Welles brought together for the show were so popular that the band became a regular feature and was an important force in reviving interest in traditional New Orleans jazz.\n\nWelles was placed on the U.S. Treasury payroll on May 15, 1944, as an expert consultant for the duration of the war, with a retainer of $1 a year. On the recommendation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau asked Welles to lead the Fifth War Loan Drive, which opened June 12 with a one-hour radio show on all four networks, broadcast from Texarkana, Texas. Including a statement by the President, the program defined the causes of the war and encouraged Americans to buy $16 billion in bonds to finance the Normandy landings and the most violent phase of World War II. Welles produced additional war loan drive broadcasts on June 14 from the Hollywood Bowl, and June 16 from Soldier Field, Chicago. Americans purchased $20.6 billion in War Bonds during the Fifth War Loan Drive, which ended on July 8, 1944.\n\nWelles campaigned ardently for Roosevelt in 1944. A longtime supporter and campaign speaker for FDR, he occasionally sent the president ideas and phrases that were sometimes incorporated into what Welles characterized as \"less important speeches\". One of these ideas was the joke in what came to be called the Fala speech, Roosevelt's nationally broadcast September 23 address to the International Teamsters Union which opened the 1944 presidential campaign.\n\nWelles campaigned for the Roosevelt–Truman ticket almost full-time in the fall of 1944, traveling to nearly every state to the detriment of his own health and at his own expense. In addition to his radio addresses he filled in for Roosevelt, opposite Republican presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey, at \"The New York Herald Tribune Forum\" broadcast October 18 on the Blue Network. Welles accompanied FDR to his last campaign rally, speaking at an event November 4 at Boston's Fenway Park before 40,000 people, and took part in a historic election-eve campaign broadcast November 6 on all four radio networks.\n\nOn November 21, 1944, Welles began his association with \"This Is My Best\", a CBS radio series he would briefly produce, direct, write and host (March 13 – April 24, 1945). He wrote a political column called \"Orson Welles' Almanac\" (later titled \"Orson Welles Today\") for \"The New York Post\" January–November 1945, and advocated the continuation of FDR's New Deal policies and his international vision, particularly the establishment of the United Nations and the cause of world peace.\n\nOn April 12, 1945, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt died, the Blue-ABC network marshalled its entire executive staff and national leaders to pay homage to the late president. \"Among the outstanding programs which attracted wide attention was a special tribute delivered by Orson Welles\", reported \"Broadcasting\" magazine. Welles spoke at 10:10 p.m Eastern War Time, from Hollywood, and stressed the importance of continuing FDR's work: \"He has no need for homage and we who loved him have no time for tears … Our fighting sons and brothers cannot pause tonight to mark the death of him whose name will be given to the age we live in.\"\n\nWelles presented another special broadcast on the death of Roosevelt the following evening: \"We must move on beyond mere death to that free world which was the hope and labor of his life.\"\n\nHe dedicated the April 17 episode of \"This Is My Best\" to Roosevelt and the future of America on the eve of the United Nations Conference on International Organization. Welles was an advisor and correspondent for the Blue-ABC radio network's coverage of the San Francisco conference that formed the UN, taking place April 24 – June 23, 1945. He presented a half-hour dramatic program written by Ben Hecht on the opening day of the conference, and on Sunday afternoons (April 29 – June 10) he led a weekly discussion from the San Francisco Civic Auditorium.\n\nIn the fall of 1945 Welles began work on \"The Stranger\" (1946), a film noir drama about a war crimes investigator who tracks a high-ranking Nazi fugitive to an idyllic New England town. Edward G. Robinson, Loretta Young and Welles star.\n\nProducer Sam Spiegel initially planned to hire director John Huston, who had rewritten the screenplay by Anthony Veiller. When Huston entered the military, Welles was given the chance to direct and prove himself able to make a film on schedule and under budget—something he was so eager to do that he accepted a disadvantageous contract. One of its concessions was that he would defer to the studio in any creative dispute.\n\n\"The Stranger\" was Welles's first job as a film director in four years. He was told that if the film was successful he could sign a four-picture deal with International Pictures, making films of his own choosing. Welles was given some degree of creative control, and he endeavored to personalize the film and develop a nightmarish tone. He worked on the general rewrite of the script and wrote scenes at the beginning of the picture that were shot but subsequently cut by the producers. He filmed in long takes that largely thwarted the control given to editor Ernest J. Nims under the terms of the contract.\n\n\"The Stranger\" was the first commercial film to use documentary footage from the Nazi concentration camps. Welles had seen the footage in early May 1945 in San Francisco, as a correspondent and discussion moderator at the UN Conference on International Organization. He wrote of the Holocaust footage in his syndicated \"New York Post\" column May 7, 1945.\n\nCompleted a day ahead of schedule and under budget, \"The Stranger\" was the only film made by Welles to have been a \"bona fide\" box office success upon its release. Its cost was $1.034 million; 15 months after its release it had grossed $3.216 million. Within weeks of the completion of the film, International Pictures backed out of its promised four-picture deal with Welles. No reason was given, but the impression was left that \"The Stranger\" would not make money.\n\nIn the summer of 1946, Welles moved to New York to direct the Broadway musical \"Around the World\", a stage adaptation of the Jules Verne novel \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" with a book by Welles and music by Cole Porter. Producer Mike Todd, who would later produce the successful 1956 film adaptation, pulled out from the lavish and expensive production, leaving Welles to support the finances. When Welles ran out of money he convinced Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn to send enough money to continue the show, and in exchange Welles promised to write, produce, direct and star in a film for Cohn for no further fee. The stage show soon failed due to poor box-office, with Welles unable to claim the losses on his taxes.\n\nIn 1946, Welles began two new radio series—\"The Mercury Summer Theatre on the Air\" for CBS, and \"Orson Welles Commentaries\" for ABC. While \"Mercury Summer Theatre\" featured half-hour adaptations of some classic Mercury radio shows from the 1930s, the first episode was a condensation of his \"Around the World\" stage play, and is the only record of Cole Porter's music for the project. Several original Mercury actors returned for the series, as well as Bernard Herrmann. Welles invested his earnings into his failing stage play. \"Commentaries\" was a political vehicle for him, continuing the themes from his \"New York Post\" column. Again, Welles lacked a clear focus, until the NAACP brought to his attention the case of Isaac Woodard. Welles brought significant attention to Woodard's cause.\n\nThe last broadcast of \"Orson Welles Commentaries\" on October 6, 1946, marked the end of Welles's own radio shows.\n\nThe film that Welles was obliged to make in exchange for Harry Cohn's help in financing the stage production \"Around the World\" was \"The Lady from Shanghai\", filmed in 1947 for Columbia Pictures. Intended as a modest thriller, the budget skyrocketed after Cohn suggested that Welles's then-estranged second wife Rita Hayworth co-star.\n\nCohn disliked Welles's rough cut, particularly the confusing plot and lack of close-ups, and was not in sympathy with Welles's Brechtian use of irony and black comedy, especially in a farcical courtroom scene. Cohn ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the studio, approximately one hour of Welles's first cut was removed, including much of a climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse. While expressing displeasure at the cuts, Welles was appalled particularly with the musical score. The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors has since become a touchstone of film noir. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce.\n\nAlthough \"The Lady From Shanghai\" was acclaimed in Europe, it was not embraced in the U.S. until decades later. A similar difference in reception on opposite sides of the Atlantic followed by greater American acceptance befell the Welles-inspired Chaplin film \"Monsieur Verdoux\", originally to be directed by Welles starring Chaplin, then directed by Chaplin with the idea credited to Welles.\n\nPrior to 1948, Welles convinced Republic Pictures to let him direct a low-budget version of \"Macbeth\", which featured highly stylized sets and costumes, and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a pre-recorded soundtrack, one of many innovative cost-cutting techniques Welles deployed in an attempt to make an epic film from B-movie resources. The script, adapted by Welles, is a violent reworking of Shakespeare's original, freely cutting and pasting lines into new contexts via a collage technique and recasting \"Macbeth\" as a clash of pagan and proto-Christian ideologies. Some voodoo trappings of the famous Welles/Houseman Negro Theatre stage adaptation are visible, especially in the film's characterization of the Weird Sisters, who create an effigy of Macbeth as a charm to enchant him. Of all Welles's post-\"Kane\" Hollywood productions, \"Macbeth\" is stylistically closest to \"Citizen Kane\" in its long takes and deep focus photography.\n\nRepublic initially trumpeted the film as an important work but decided it did not care for the Scottish accents and held up general release for almost a year after early negative press reaction, including \"Life\"s comment that Welles's film \"doth foully slaughter Shakespeare.\" Welles left for Europe, while co-producer and lifelong supporter Richard Wilson reworked the soundtrack. Welles returned and cut 20 minutes from the film at Republic's request and recorded narration to cover some gaps. The film was decried as a disaster. \"Macbeth\" had influential fans in Europe, especially the French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, who hailed the film's \"crude, irreverent power\" and careful shot design, and described the characters as haunting \"the corridors of some dreamlike subway, an abandoned coal mine, and ruined cellars oozing with water.\"\n\nIn Italy he starred as Cagliostro in the 1948 film \"Black Magic\". His co-star, Akim Tamiroff, impressed Welles so much that Tamiroff would appear in four of Welles's productions during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe following year, Welles starred as Harry Lime in Carol Reed's \"The Third Man\", alongside Joseph Cotten, his friend and co-star from \"Citizen Kane\", with a script by Graham Greene and a memorable score by Anton Karas.\n\nA few years later, British radio producer Harry Alan Towers would resurrect the Lime character in the radio series \"The Adventures of Harry Lime\".\n\nWelles appeared as Cesare Borgia in the 1949 Italian film \"Prince of Foxes\", with Tyrone Power and Mercury Theatre alumnus Everett Sloane, and as the Mongol warrior Bayan in the 1950 film version of the novel \"The Black Rose\" (again with Tyrone Power).\n\nDuring this time, Welles was channeling his money from acting jobs into a self-financed film version of Shakespeare's play \"Othello\". From 1949 to 1951, Welles worked on \"Othello\", filming on location in Europe and Morocco. The film featured Welles's friends, Micheál Mac Liammóir as Iago and Hilton Edwards as Desdemona's father Brabantio. Suzanne Cloutier starred as Desdemona and Campbell Playhouse alumnus Robert Coote appeared as Iago's associate Roderigo.\n\nFilming was suspended several times as Welles ran out of funds and left for acting jobs, accounted in detail in MacLiammóir's published memoir \"Put Money in Thy Purse\". The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a drop-out of sound at every quiet moment. Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith, restored \"Othello\" in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing Angelo Francesco Lavagnino's original musical score, which was originally inaudible, and adding ambient stereo sound effects, which were not in the original film. The restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America.\n\nIn 1952, Welles continued finding work in England after the success of the \"Harry Lime\" radio show. Harry Alan Towers offered Welles another series, \"The Black Museum\", which ran for 52 weeks with Welles as host and narrator. Director Herbert Wilcox offered Welles the part of the murdered victim in \"Trent's Last Case\", based on the novel by E. C. Bentley. In 1953, the BBC hired Welles to read an hour of selections from Walt Whitman's epic poem \"Song of Myself\". Towers hired Welles again, to play Professor Moriarty in the radio series, \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\", starring John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson.\n\nWelles briefly returned to America to make his first appearance on television, starring in the \"Omnibus\" presentation of \"King Lear\", broadcast live on CBS October 18, 1953. Directed by Peter Brook, the production costarred Natasha Parry, Beatrice Straight and Arnold Moss.\n\nIn 1954, director George More O'Ferrall offered Welles the title role in the 'Lord Mountdrago' segment of \"Three Cases of Murder\", co-starring Alan Badel. Herbert Wilcox cast Welles as the antagonist in \"Trouble in the Glen\" opposite Margaret Lockwood, Forrest Tucker and Victor McLaglen. Old friend John Huston cast him as Father Mapple in his 1956 film adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\", starring Gregory Peck.\n\nWelles's next turn as director was the film \"Mr. Arkadin\" (1955), which was produced by his political mentor from the 1940s, Louis Dolivet. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars Robert Arden, who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles's third wife, Paola Mori, whose voice was dubbed by actress Billie Whitelaw; and guest stars Akim Tamiroff, Michael Redgrave, Katina Paxinou and Mischa Auer. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually five different versions of the film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled \"Confidential Report\". In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the Munich Film Museum oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements.\n\nIn 1955, Welles also directed two television series for the BBC. The first was \"Orson Welles' Sketch Book\", a series of six 15-minute shows featuring Welles drawing in a sketchbook to illustrate his reminiscences for the camera (including such topics as the filming of \"It's All True\" and the Isaac Woodard case), and the second was \"Around the World with Orson Welles\", a series of six travelogues set in different locations around Europe (such as Venice, the Basque Country between France and Spain, and England). Welles served as host and interviewer, his commentary including documentary facts and his own personal observations (a technique he would continue to explore in later works).\n\nIn 1956, Welles completed \"Portrait of Gina\". The film cans would remain in a lost-and-found locker at the hotel for several decades, where they were discovered after Welles's death.\n\nIn 1956, Welles returned to Hollywood.\n\nHe began filming a projected pilot for Desilu, owned by Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz, who had recently purchased the former RKO studios. The film was \"The Fountain of Youth\", based on a story by John Collier. Originally deemed not viable as a pilot, the film was not aired until 1958—and won the Peabody Award for excellence.\n\nWelles guest starred on television shows including \"I Love Lucy\". On radio, he was narrator of \"Tomorrow\" (October 17, 1956), a nuclear holocaust drama produced and syndicated by ABC and the Federal Civil Defense Administration.\n\nWelles's next feature film role was in \"Man in the Shadow\" for Universal Pictures in 1957, starring Jeff Chandler.\n\nWelles stayed on at Universal to direct (and co-star with) Charlton Heston in the 1958 film \"Touch of Evil\", based on Whit Masterson's novel \"Badge of Evil\". Originally only hired as an actor, Welles was promoted to director by Universal Studios at the insistence of Charlton Heston. The film reunited many actors and technicians with whom Welles had worked in Hollywood in the 1940s, including cameraman Russell Metty (\"The Stranger\"), makeup artist Maurice Seiderman (\"Citizen Kane\"), and actors Joseph Cotten, Marlene Dietrich and Akim Tamiroff. Filming proceeded smoothly, with Welles finishing on schedule and on budget, and the studio bosses praising the daily rushes. Nevertheless, after the end of production, the studio re-edited the film, re-shot scenes, and shot new exposition scenes to clarify the plot. Welles wrote a 58-page memo outlining suggestions and objections, stating that the film was no longer his version—it was the studio's, but as such, he was still prepared to help with it.\n\nIn 1978, a longer preview version of the film was discovered and released.\n\nAs Universal reworked \"Touch of Evil\", Welles began filming his adaptation of Miguel de Cervantes' novel \"Don Quixote\" in Mexico, starring Mischa Auer as Quixote and Akim Tamiroff as Sancho Panza.\n\nHe continued shooting \"Don Quixote\" in Spain and Italy, but replaced Mischa Auer with Francisco Reiguera, and resumed acting jobs.\nIn Italy in 1959, Welles directed his own scenes as King Saul in Richard Pottier's film \"David and Goliath\". In Hong Kong he co-starred with Curt Jürgens in Lewis Gilbert's film \"Ferry to Hong Kong\". In 1960, in Paris he co-starred in Richard Fleischer's film \"Crack in the Mirror\". In Yugoslavia he starred in Richard Thorpe's film \"The Tartars\" and Veljko Bulajić's \"Battle of Neretva\".\n\nThroughout the 1960s, filming continued on \"Quixote\" on-and-off until the end of the decade, as Welles evolved the concept, tone and ending several times. Although he had a complete version of the film shot and edited at least once, he would continue toying with the editing well into the 1980s, he never completed a version film he was fully satisfied with, and would junk existing footage and shoot new footage. (In one case, he had a complete cut ready in which Quixote and Sancho Panza end up going to the moon, but he felt the ending was rendered obsolete by the 1969 moon landings, and burned 10 reels of this version.) As the process went on, Welles gradually voiced all of the characters himself and provided narration. In 1992, the director Jesús Franco constructed a film out of the portions of \"Quixote\" left behind by Welles. Some of the film stock had decayed badly. While the Welles footage was greeted with interest, the post-production by Franco was met with harsh criticism.\nIn 1961, Welles directed \"In the Land of Don Quixote\", a series of eight half-hour episodes for the Italian television network RAI. Similar to the \"Around the World with Orson Welles\" series, they presented travelogues of Spain and included Welles's wife, Paola, and their daughter, Beatrice. Though Welles was fluent in Italian, the network was not interested in him providing Italian narration because of his accent, and the series sat unreleased until 1964, by which time the network had added Italian narration of its own. Ultimately, versions of the episodes were released with the original musical score Welles had approved, but without the narration.\n\nIn 1962, Welles directed his adaptation of \"The Trial\", based on the novel by Franz Kafka and produced by Michael and Alexander Salkind. The cast included Anthony Perkins as Josef K, Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Paola Mori and Akim Tamiroff. While filming exteriors in Zagreb, Welles was informed that the Salkinds had run out of money, meaning that there could be no set construction. No stranger to shooting on found locations, Welles soon filmed the interiors in the Gare d'Orsay, at that time an abandoned railway station in Paris. Welles thought the location possessed a \"Jules Verne modernism\" and a melancholy sense of \"waiting\", both suitable for Kafka. To remain in the spirit of Kafka Welles set up the cutting room together with the Film Editor, Frederick Muller (as Fritz Muller), in the old un-used, cold, depressing, station master office. The film failed at the box-office. Peter Bogdanovich would later observe that Welles found the film riotously funny. Welles also told a BBC interviewer that it was his best film. While filming \"The Trial\" Welles met Oja Kodar, who later became his mistress and collaborator for the last 20 years of his life.\n\nWelles played a film director in \"La Ricotta\" (1963), Pier Paolo Pasolini's segment of the \"Ro.Go.Pa.G.\" movie, although his renowned voice was dubbed by Italian writer Giorgio Bassani. He continued taking what work he could find acting, narrating or hosting other people's work, and began filming \"Chimes at Midnight\", which was completed in 1966.\n\nFilmed in Spain, \"Chimes at Midnight\" was based on Welles's play, \"Five Kings\", in which he drew material from six Shakespeare plays to tell the story of Sir John Falstaff (Welles) and his relationship with Prince Hal (Keith Baxter). The cast includes John Gielgud, Jeanne Moreau, Fernando Rey and Margaret Rutherford; the film's narration, spoken by Ralph Richardson, is taken from the chronicler Raphael Holinshed. Welles held the film in high regard: \"It's my favorite picture, yes. If I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up.\"\n\nIn 1966, Welles directed a film for French television, an adaptation of \"The Immortal Story\", by Karen Blixen. Released in 1968, it stars Jeanne Moreau, Roger Coggio and Norman Eshley. The film had a successful run in French theaters. At this time Welles met Oja Kodar again, and gave her a letter he had written to her and had been keeping for four years; they would not be parted again. They immediately began a collaboration both personal and professional. The first of these was an adaptation of Blixen's \"The Heroine\", meant to be a companion piece to \"The Immortal Story\" and starring Kodar. Unfortunately, funding disappeared after one day's shooting. After completing this film, he appeared in a brief cameo as Cardinal Wolsey in Fred Zinnemann's adaptation of \"A Man for All Seasons\"—a role for which he won considerable acclaim.\nIn 1967, Welles began directing \"The Deep\", based on the novel \"Dead Calm\" by Charles Williams and filmed off the shore of Yugoslavia. The cast included Jeanne Moreau, Laurence Harvey and Kodar. Personally financed by Welles and Kodar, they could not obtain the funds to complete the project, and it was abandoned a few years later after the death of Harvey. The surviving footage was eventually edited and released by the Filmmuseum München. In 1968 Welles began filming a TV special for CBS under the title \"Orson's Bag\", combining travelogue, comedy skits and a condensation of Shakespeare's play \"The Merchant of Venice\" with Welles as Shylock. In 1969 Welles called again the Film Editor Frederick Muller to work with him re-editing the material and they set up cutting rooms at the Safa Palatino Studios in Rome. Funding for the show sent by CBS to Welles in Switzerland was seized by the IRS. Without funding, the show was not completed. The surviving film clips portions were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.\n\nIn 1969, Welles authorized the use of his name for a cinema in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Orson Welles Cinema remained in operation until 1986, with Welles making a personal appearance there in 1977. Also in 1969 he played a supporting role in John Huston's \"The Kremlin Letter\". Drawn by the numerous offers he received to work in television and films, and upset by a tabloid scandal reporting his affair with Kodar, Welles abandoned the editing of \"Don Quixote\" and moved back to America in 1970.\n\nWelles returned to Hollywood, where he continued to self-finance his film and television projects. While offers to act, narrate and host continued, Welles also found himself in great demand on television talk shows. He made frequent appearances for Dick Cavett, Johnny Carson, Dean Martin and Merv Griffin.\n\nWelles's primary focus during his final years was \"The Other Side of the Wind\", an unfinished project that was filmed intermittently between 1970 and 1976. Written by Welles, it is the story of an aging film director (John Huston) looking for funds to complete his final film. The cast includes Peter Bogdanovich, Susan Strasberg, Norman Foster, Edmond O'Brien, Cameron Mitchell and Dennis Hopper. Financed by Iranian backers, ownership of the film fell into a legal quagmire after the Shah of Iran was deposed. While there have been several reports of all the legal disputes concerning ownership of the film being settled, enough disputes still exist to prevent its release.\nWelles portrayed Louis XVIII of France in the 1970 film \"Waterloo\", and narrated the beginning and ending scenes of the historical comedy \"Start the Revolution Without Me\" (1970).\n\nIn 1971, Welles directed a short adaptation of \"Moby-Dick\", a one-man performance on a bare stage, reminiscent of his 1955 stage production \"Moby Dick—Rehearsed\". Never completed, it was eventually released by the Filmmuseum München. He also appeared in \"Ten Days' Wonder\", co-starring with Anthony Perkins and directed by Claude Chabrol, based on a detective novel by Ellery Queen. That same year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave him an honorary award \"For superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures\". Welles pretended to be out of town and sent John Huston to claim the award, thanking the Academy on film. Huston criticized the Academy for awarding Welles, even while they refused to give Welles any work.\n\nIn 1972, Welles acted as on-screen narrator for the film documentary version of Alvin Toffler's 1970 book \"Future Shock\". Working again for a British producer, Welles played Long John Silver in director John Hough's \"Treasure Island\" (1972), an adaptation of the Robert Louis Stevenson novel, which had been the second story broadcast by \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" in 1938. This was the last time he played the lead role in a major film. Welles also contributed to the script, his writing credit was attributed to the pseudonym 'O. W. Jeeves'. In some versions of the film Welles's original recorded dialog was redubbed by Robert Rietty.\n\nIn 1973, Welles completed \"F for Fake\", a personal essay film about art forger Elmyr de Hory and the biographer Clifford Irving. Based on an existing documentary by François Reichenbach, it included new material with Oja Kodar, Joseph Cotten, Paul Stewart and William Alland. An excerpt of Welles's 1930s \"War of the Worlds\" broadcast was recreated for this film; however, none of the dialogue heard in the film actually matches what was originally broadcast. Welles filmed a five-minute trailer, rejected in the U.S., that featured several shots of a topless Kodar.\n\nWelles hosted a British syndicated anthology series, \"Orson Welles's Great Mysteries\", during the 1973–74 television season. His brief introductions to the 26 half-hour episodes were shot in July 1973 by Gary Graver. The year 1974 also saw Welles lending his voice for that year's remake of Agatha Christie's classic thriller \"Ten Little Indians\" produced by his former associate, Harry Alan Towers and starring an international cast that included Oliver Reed, Elke Sommer and Herbert Lom.\n\nIn 1975, Welles narrated the documentary \"\", focusing on Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1940s. Also in 1975, the American Film Institute presented Welles with its third Lifetime Achievement Award (the first two going to director John Ford and actor James Cagney). At the ceremony, Welles screened two scenes from the nearly finished \"The Other Side of the Wind\".\n\nIn 1976, Paramount Television purchased the rights for the entire set of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe stories for Orson Welles. Welles had once wanted to make a series of Nero Wolfe movies, but Rex Stout—who was leery of Hollywood adaptations during his lifetime after two disappointing 1930s films—turned him down. Paramount planned to begin with an ABC-TV movie and hoped to persuade Welles to continue the role in a mini-series. Frank D. Gilroy was signed to write the television script and direct the TV movie on the assurance that Welles would star, but by April 1977 Welles had bowed out. In 1980 the Associated Press reported \"the distinct possibility\" that Welles would star in a Nero Wolfe TV series for NBC television. Again, Welles bowed out of the project due to creative differences and William Conrad was cast in the role.\n\nIn 1979, Welles completed his documentary \"Filming Othello\", which featured Michael MacLiammoir and Hilton Edwards. Made for West German television, it was also released in theaters. That same year, Welles completed his self-produced pilot for \"The Orson Welles Show\" television series, featuring interviews with Burt Reynolds, Jim Henson and Frank Oz and guest-starring the Muppets and Angie Dickinson. Unable to find network interest, the pilot was never broadcast. Also in 1979, Welles appeared in the biopic \"The Secret of Nikola Tesla\", and a cameo in \"The Muppet Movie\" as Lew Lord.\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s, Welles participated in a series of famous television commercial advertisements. For two years he was on-camera spokesman for the Paul Masson Vineyards, and sales grew by one third during the time Welles intoned what became a popular catchphrase: \"We will sell no wine before its time.\" He was also the voice behind the long-running Carlsberg \"Probably the best lager in the world\" campaign, promoted Domecq sherry on British television and provided narration on adverts for Findus, though the actual adverts have been overshadowed by a famous blooper reel of voice recordings, known as the Frozen Peas reel. He also did commercials for the Preview Subscription Television Service seen on stations around the country including WCLQ/Cleveland, KNDL/St. Louis and WSMW/Boston. As money ran short, he began directing commercials to make ends meet, including the famous British \"Follow the Bear\" commercials for Hofmeister lager.\n\nIn 1981, Welles hosted the documentary \"The Man Who Saw Tomorrow\", about Renaissance-era prophet Nostradamus. In 1982, the BBC broadcast \"The Orson Welles Story\" in the \"Arena\" series. Interviewed by Leslie Megahey, Welles examined his past in great detail, and several people from his professional past were interviewed as well. It was reissued in 1990 as \"With Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film\". Welles provided narration for the tracks \"Defender\" from Manowar's 1987 album \"Fighting the World\" and \"Dark Avenger\" on their 1982 album, \"Battle Hymns\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, Welles worked on such film projects as \"The Dreamers\", based on two stories by Isak Dinesen and starring Oja Kodar, and \"Orson Welles' Magic Show\", which reused material from his failed TV pilot. Another project he worked on was \"Filming The Trial\", the second in a proposed series of documentaries examining his feature films. While much was shot for these projects, none of them was completed. All of them were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.\n\nIn 1984, Welles narrated the short-lived television series \"Scene of the Crime\". During the early years of \"Magnum, P.I.\", Welles was the voice of the unseen character Robin Masters, a famous writer and playboy. Welles's death forced this minor character to largely be written out of the series. In an oblique homage to Welles, the \"Magnum, P.I.\" producers ambiguously concluded that story arc by having one character accuse another of having hired an actor to portray Robin Masters. He also, in this penultimate year released a music single, titled \"I Know What It Is To Be Young (But You Don't Know What It Is To Be Old)\", which he recorded under Italian label Compagnia Generale del Disco. The song was performed with the Nick Perito Orchestra and the Ray Charles Singers and produced by Jerry Abbott (father of guitarist \"Dimebag Darrell\" Abbott).\n\nThe last film roles before Welles's death included voice work in the animated films \"Enchanted Journey\" (1984) and \"\" (1986), in which he played the planet-eating robot Unicron. His last film appearance was in Henry Jaglom's 1987 independent film \"Someone to Love\", released after his death but produced before his voice-over in \"Transformers: The Movie\". His last television appearance was on the television show \"Moonlighting\". He recorded an introduction to an episode entitled \"The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice\", which was partially filmed in black and white. The episode aired five days after his death and was dedicated to his memory.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Henry Jaglom taped lunch conversations with Welles at Los Angeles's Ma Maison as well as in New York. Edited transcripts of these sessions appear in Peter Biskind's 2013 book \"My Lunches With Orson: Conversations Between Henry Jaglom and Orson Welles\".\n\nOrson Welles and Chicago-born actress and socialite Virginia Nicolson (1916–1996) were married on November 14, 1934. The couple separated in December 1939, and were divorced on February 1, 1940. After bearing with Welles's romances in New York, Virginia had learned that Welles had fallen in love with Mexican actress Dolores del Río.\n\nInfatuated with her since adolescence, Welles met del Río at Darryl Zanuck's ranch soon after he moved to Hollywood in 1939. Their relationship was kept secret until 1941, when del Río filed for divorce from her second husband. They openly appeared together in New York while Welles was directing the Mercury stage production, \"Native Son\". They acted together in the movie \"Journey into Fear\" (1943). Their relationship came to an end, among other things, due to the infidelities of Welles. Del Río returned to México in 1943, shortly before Welles married Rita Hayworth.\n\nWelles married Rita Hayworth on September 7, 1943. They were divorced on November 10, 1947. During his last interview, recorded for \"The Merv Griffin Show\" on the evening before his death, Welles called Hayworth \"one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived … and we were a long time together—I was lucky enough to have been with her longer than any of the other men in her life.\"\n\nIn 1955, Welles married actress Paola Mori (née Countess Paola di Girifalco), an Italian aristocrat who starred as Raina Arkadin in his 1955 film, \"Mr. Arkadin\". The couple began a passionate affair, and they were married at her parents' insistence. They were wed in London May 8, 1955, and never divorced.\n\nCroatian-born artist and actress Oja Kodar became Welles's longtime companion both personally and professionally from 1966 onward, and they lived together for some of the last 20 years of his life.\n\nWelles had three daughters from his marriages: Christopher Welles Feder (born March 27, 1938, with Virginia Nicolson); Rebecca Welles Manning (December 17, 1944 – October 17, 2004, with Rita Hayworth); and Beatrice Welles (born November 13, 1955, with Paola Mori).\n\nWelles is thought to have had a son, British director Michael Lindsay-Hogg (born May 5, 1940), with Irish actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, then the wife of Sir Edward Lindsay-Hogg, 4th baronet. When Lindsay-Hogg was 16 his mother reluctantly divulged that there were pervasive rumors that his father was Welles, and she denied them—but in such detail that he doubted her veracity. Fitzgerald evaded the subject for the rest of her life. Lindsay-Hogg knew Welles, worked with him in the theatre and met him at intervals throughout Welles's life. After he learned that Welles's oldest daughter Chris, his childhood playmate, had long suspected that he was her brother, Lindsay-Hogg initiated a DNA test that proved inconclusive. In his 2011 autobiography Lindsay-Hogg reported that his questions were resolved by his mother's close friend Gloria Vanderbilt, who wrote that Fitzgerald had told her that Welles was his father. A 2015 Welles biography by Patrick McGilligan, however, reports the impossibility of Welles's paternity: Fitzgerald left the U.S. for Ireland in May 1939 and her son was conceived before her return in late October, while Welles did not travel overseas during that period.\n\nAfter the death of Rebecca Welles Manning, a man named Marc McKerrow was revealed to be her son, and therefore the direct descendant of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth. McKerrow's reactions to the revelation and his meeting with Oja Kodar are documented in the 2008 film \"Prodigal Sons\". McKerrow died on June 18, 2010.\n\nDespite an urban legend promoted by Welles, he was not related to Abraham Lincoln's wartime Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles. The myth dates back to the first newspaper feature ever written about Welles—\"Cartoonist, Actor, Poet and only 10\"—in the February 19, 1926, issue of \"The Capital Times\". The article falsely states that he was descended from \"Gideon Welles, who was a member of President Lincoln's cabinet\". As presented by Charles Higham in a genealogical chart that introduces his 1985 biography of Welles, Orson Welles's father was Richard Head Welles (born Wells), son of Richard Jones Wells, son of Henry Hill Wells (who had an uncle named Gideon \"Wells\"), son of William Hill Wells, son of Richard Wells (1734–1801).\n\nPeter Noble's 1956 biography describes Welles as \"a magnificent figure of a man, over six feet tall, handsome, with flashing eyes and a gloriously resonant speaking-voice\". Welles said that a voice specialist once told him he was born to be a heldentenor, a heroic tenor, but that when he was young and working at the Gate Theatre in Dublin he forced his voice down into a bass-baritone.\n\nEven as a baby Welles was prone to illness, including diphtheria, measles, whooping cough and malaria. From infancy he suffered from asthma, sinus headaches, and backache that was later found to be caused by congenital anomalies of the spine. Foot and ankle trouble throughout his life was the result of flat feet. \"As he grew older,\" Brady wrote, \"his ill health was exacerbated by the late hours he was allowed to keep [and] an early penchant for alcohol and tobacco\".\n\nIn 1928, at age 13, Welles was already more than six feet tall and weighed over 180 pounds. His passport recorded his height as six feet three inches, with brown hair and green eyes.\n\n\"Crash diets, drugs, and corsets had slimmed him for his early film roles,\" wrote biographer Barton Whaley. \"Then always back to\ngargantuan consumption of high-caloric food and booze. By summer 1949, when he was 34, his weight had crept up to a stout 230 pounds. In 1953 he ballooned from 250 to 275 pounds. After 1960 he remained permanently obese.\"\n\nWhen Peter Bogdanovich once asked him about his religion, Orson Welles gruffly replied that it was none of his business, then misinformed him that he was raised Catholic.\n\nAlthough the Welles family was no longer devout, it was fourth-generation Protestant Episcopalian and, before that, Quaker and Puritan. Welles's earliest paternal forebear in America, Richard Wells, was a leader of the Quaker community in Pennsylvania. His earliest maternal ancestor in America was John Alden, a crew member on the Pilgrim ship \"Mayflower\".\n\nThe funeral of Welles's father Richard H. Welles was Episcopalian.\n\nIn April 1982, when interviewer Merv Griffin asked him about his religious beliefs, Welles replied, \"I try to be a Christian. I don't pray really, because I don't want to bore God.\" Near the end of his life Welles was dining at Ma Maison, his favorite restaurant in Los Angeles, when proprietor Patrick Terrail conveyed an invitation from the head of the Greek Orthodox Church, who asked Welles to be his guest of honor at divine liturgy at Saint Sophia Cathedral. Welles replied, \"Please tell him I really appreciate that offer, but I am an atheist.\"\n\n\"Orson never joked or teased about the religious beliefs of others,\" wrote biographer Barton Whaley. \"He accepted it as a cultural artifact, suitable for the births, deaths, and marriages of strangers and even some friends—but without emotional or intellectual meaning for himself.\"\n\nWelles was politically active from the beginning of his career. He remained aligned with the left throughout his life, and always defined his political orientation as \"progressive\". He was a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, and often spoke out on radio in support of progressive politics. He campaigned heavily for Roosevelt in the 1944 election.\n\n\"During a White House dinner,\" Welles recalled in a 1983 conversation with his friend Roger Hill, \"when I was campaigning for Roosevelt, in a toast, with considerable tongue in cheek, he said, 'Orson, you and I are the two greatest actors alive today.' In private that evening, and on several other occasions, he urged me to run for a Senate seat either in California or Wisconsin. He wasn't alone.\"\n\nFor several years, he wrote a newspaper column on political issues and considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1946, representing his home state of Wisconsin—a seat that was ultimately won by Joseph McCarthy.\n\nWelles's name and political activities are reported on pages 155–157 of Red Channels, the anti-Communist publication that, in part, fueled the already flourishing Hollywood Blacklist. He was in Europe during the height of the Red Scare, thereby adding one more reason for the Hollywood establishment to ostracize him.\n\nIn 1970, Welles narrated (but did not write) a satirical political record on the administration of President Richard Nixon titled \"The Begatting of the President\".\n\nHe was also an outspoken critic of racism in the United States and the practice of segregation.\n\nOn the evening of October 9, 1985, Welles recorded his final interview on the syndicated TV program, \"The Merv Griffin Show\", appearing with biographer Barbara Leaming. \"Both Welles and Leaming talked of Welles's life and the segment was a nostalgic interlude,\" wrote biographer Frank Brady. Welles returned to his house in Hollywood and worked into the early hours typing stage directions for the project he and Gary Graver were planning to shoot at UCLA the following day. Welles died sometime on the morning of October 10, following a heart attack. He was found by his chauffeur at around 10 a.m.; the first of Welles's friends to arrive was Paul Stewart.\n\nWelles was cremated by prior agreement with the executor of his estate, Greg Garrison, whose advice about making lucrative TV appearances in the 1970s made it possible for Welles to pay off a portion of the taxes he owed the IRS. A brief private funeral was attended by Paola Mori and Welles's three daughters—the first time they had ever been together. Only a few close friends were invited: Garrison, Graver, Roger Hill and Prince Alessandro Tasca di Cuto. Chris Welles Feder later described the funeral as an awful experience.\n\nA public memorial tribute took place November 2, 1985, at the Directors Guild of America Theater in Los Angeles. Host Peter Bogdanovich introduced speakers including Charles Champlin, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Greg Garrison, Charlton Heston, Roger Hill, Henry Jaglom, Arthur Knight, Oja Kodar, Barbara Leaming, Janet Leigh, Norman Lloyd, Dan O'Herlihy, Patrick Terrail and Robert Wise.\n\n\"I know what his feelings were regarding his death,\" Joseph Cotten later wrote. \"He did not want a funeral; he wanted to be buried quietly in a little place in Spain. He wanted no memorial services ...\" Cotten declined to attend the memorial program; instead he sent a short message, ending with the last two lines of a Shakespeare sonnet that Welles had sent him on his most recent birthday:\n\nBut if the while I think on thee, dear friend,All losses are restored and sorrows end.\n\nIn 1987 the ashes of Welles and Mori (killed in a 1986 car crash) were taken to Ronda, Spain, and buried in an old well covered by flowers on the rural estate of a longtime friend, bullfighter Antonio Ordóñez.\n\nWelles's reliance on self-production meant that many of his later projects were filmed piecemeal or were not completed. Welles financed his later projects through his own fundraising activities. He often also took on other work to obtain money to fund his own films.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Welles began work on \"Don Quixote\", initially a commission from CBS television. Welles expanded the film to feature length, developing the screenplay to take Quixote and Sancho Panza into the modern age. Filming stopped with the death of Francisco Reiguera, the actor playing Quixote, in 1969. Orson Welles continued editing the film into the early 1970s. At the time of his death, the film remained largely a collection of footage in various states of editing. The project and more importantly Welles's conception of the project changed radically over time. A version of the film was created from available fragments in 1992 and released to a very negative reception.\n\nA version Oja Kodar supervised, with help from Jess Franco, assistant director during production, was released in 2008 to mixed reactions.\n\nFrederick Muller — the film editor for The \"Trial\", \"Chimes at Midnight\" and the CBS Special \"Orson Bag\" was fortunate to work on editing three reels of the original, unadulterated version — was asked for his opinion in 2013 from a journalist of Time Out, his reply was he felt that if released without image re-editing, but with the addition of \"ad hoc\" sound and music, it probably would have been rather successful.\n\nIn 1969, Welles was given another TV commission to film a condensed adaptation of \"The Merchant of Venice\". Although Welles had actually completed the film by 1970, the finished negative was later mysteriously stolen from his Rome production office. A restored and reconstructed version of the film, made by using the original script and composer's notes, premiered at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival alongside \"Othello\" as part of the pre-opening ceremonies in 2015.\n\nIn 1970, Welles began shooting \"The Other Side of the Wind\". The film relates the efforts of a film director (played by John Huston) to complete his last Hollywood picture and is largely set at a lavish party. By 1972 the filming was reported by Welles as being \"96% complete\", though it is likely that Welles had only edited about 40 minutes of the film by 1979. In that year, legal complications over the ownership of the film forced the negative into a Paris vault. In 2004 director Peter Bogdanovich, who acted in the film, announced his intention to complete the production. As of 2009, legal complications over the Welles estate had kept the film from being finished or released.\n\nOn October 28, 2014, the Los Angeles-based production company Royal Road Entertainment announced that it had negotiated an agreement, with the assistance of producer Frank Marshall, and would purchase the rights to complete and release \"The Other Side of the Wind\". Bogdanovich and Marshall will complete Welles's nearly finished film in Los Angeles, aiming to have it ready for screening May 6, 2015, the 100th anniversary of Welles's birth. Royal Road Entertainment and German producer Jens Koethner Kaul acquired the rights held by Les Films de l'Astrophore and the late Mehdi Boushehri. They reached an agreement with Oja Kodar, who inherited Welles's ownership of the film, and Beatrice Welles, manager of the Welles estate; but at the end of 2015, efforts to complete the film were at an impasse.\n\nIn March 2017, Netflix acquired distribution rights to the film. That same month, the original negative, dallies and other footage arrived in Los Angeles, thus resuming the post-production process.\n\nSome footage is included in the documentaries \"Working with Orson Welles\" (1993) and \"Orson Welles: One Man Band\" (1995).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Black dress of Rita Hayworth\n\nIn the 1946 film \"Gilda\", Rita Hayworth wore a black dress made by American costume designer Jean Louis. It was used in one of the most famous scenes of the film: one in which the character of Gilda sings the song \"Put the Blame on Mame\", improvising a quick striptease, choreographed by Jack Cole. The dress has helped consolidate the image of the \"femme fatale\", as well as being universally recognized as an icon of fashion and cinema. \"The Independent\" named it as one of the Ten Best Fashion Moments in Film.\n\nJean Louis, Columbia Pictures costume designer, collaborated with the actress Rita Hayworth in nine films from the 1945 until 1959. Louis is considered \"an essential ingredient in the formula that created the image of Rita Hayworth\".\n\nTo create clothes for Gilda, Jean Louis was inspired by \"Portrait of Madame X\", the famous socialite in Paris. According to \"Life\" magazine, the wardrobe designed by Jean Louis for Rita Hayworth had a value of about $60,000, a large figure for the time. The dress was said to illustrate that \"extreme sexuality\" in women, hot or cold, is a recipe for catastrophe.\n\nIn 1946, the image of Rita Hayworth in the Gilda black dress was imprinted on the first nuclear bomb to be tested after the Second World War, as part of Operation Crossroads. \nThe bomb, nicknamed \"Gilda\", was decorated with a photograph of Hayworth cut from the June 1946 issue of \"Esquire\" magazine. Above it was stenciled \"Gilda\" in two-inch black letters.\n\nIn April 2009, the dress was to be sold at the auction of the Forrest J. Ackerman estate. In the description of the lot it was specified that the dress still had the label \"property of Columbia Pictures\" and \"Rita Hayworth\" sewn inside. The initial price was estimated between $30,000 and $50,000, but the lot was withdrawn before it reached the auction. Later, in September 2009, the dress appeared mysteriously in an auction on eBay with a starting price of $30,000.\n\nThe famous scene with the black dress has been referenced in numerous films. One of the most remembered is a parody sung by Jessica Rabbit in the Disney film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", in which the character performs \"Why Don't You Do Right?\" in the style of Rita Hayworth in Gilda. For the 23rd \"James Bond\" film \"Skyfall\" (2012), costume designer Jany Temime referenced the black dress while creating an outfit for Bond girl Sévérine.\n\nThe strapless dress is a sheath in black satin with a straight neckline, leaving the shoulders bare. The dress is long and side-slit down to the ground. In the scene in the film \"Gilda\" in which it appears, the dress is paired with a pair of satin long gloves worn up to Hayworth's shoulders. The glove fabric is identical to the dress fabric; not made from cheaper stretch satin. \n\nTo be able to wear the dress, Hayworth had to wear a corset, because just a few months before she had given birth to her daughter, Rebecca, and had not yet regained her pre-pregnancy figure. In addition to the dress, Jean Louis made a harness, worn under the dress. The harness consisted of rigging—one under the breast, one in the middle and one on the side. In addition, the soft plastic had been molded around the top of the skirt.\n"

                "Rita Hayworth\n\nRita Hayworth (born Margarita Carmen Cansino; October 17, 1918May 14, 1987) was an American actress and dancer. She achieved fame during the 1940s as one of the era's top stars, appearing in a total of 61 films over 37 years. The press coined the term \"The Love Goddess\" to describe Hayworth after she had become the most glamorous screen idol of the 1940s. She was the top pin-up girl for GIs during World War II.\n\nHayworth is perhaps best known for her performance in the 1946 film noir, \"Gilda\", opposite Glenn Ford, in which she played the \"femme fatale\" in her first major dramatic role. Fred Astaire, with whom she made two films, called her his favorite dance partner. Her greatest success was in the Technicolor musical \"Cover Girl\" (1944), with Gene Kelly. She is listed as one of the top 25 female motion picture stars of all time in the American Film Institute's survey, AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars.\n\nIn 1980, Hayworth was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which contributed to her death at age 68. The public disclosure and discussion of her illness drew attention to Alzheimer's, and helped to increase public and private funding for Alzheimer's research.\n\nHayworth was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1918 as Margarita Carmen Cansino, the oldest child of two dancers. Her father, Eduardo Cansino Sr., was from Castilleja de la Cuesta, a little town near Seville, Spain. \n\nHer mother, Volga Hayworth, was an American of Irish-English descent who had performed with the Ziegfeld Follies. The couple married in 1917. They also had two sons: Eduardo Jr. and Vernon.\n\nMargarita's father wanted her to become a professional dancer, while her mother hoped she would become an actress. Her paternal grandfather, Antonio Cansino, was renowned as a classical Spanish dancer. He popularized the bolero, and his dancing school in Madrid was world-famous. Hayworth later recalled, \"From the time I was three and a half … as soon as I could stand on my own feet, I was given dance lessons.\" She noted \"I didn't like it very much … but I didn't have the courage to tell my father, so I began taking the lessons. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse, that was my girlhood\".\n\nShe attended dance classes every day for a few years in a Carnegie Hall complex, where she was taught by her uncle Angel Cansino. She performed publicly from the age of six. In 1926 at the age of eight, she was featured in \"La Fiesta\", a short film for Warner Bros.\n\nIn 1927, her father took the family to Hollywood. He believed that dancing could be featured in the movies and that his family could be part of it. He established his own dance studio, where he taught such stars as James Cagney and Jean Harlow. During the Great Depression, he lost all his investments as commercial interest in his dancing classes waned.\n\nIn 1931, Eduardo Cansino partnered with his 12-year-old daughter to form an act called the Dancing Cansinos. Since under California law Margarita was too young to work in nightclubs and bars, her father took her with him to work across the border in Tijuana, Mexico. In the early 1930s, it was a popular tourist spot for people from Los Angeles. Because she was working, Cansino never graduated from high school, but she completed the ninth grade at Hamilton High in Los Angeles.\n\nCansino (Hayworth) took a bit part in the film \"Cruz Diablo\" (1934) at age 16, which led to another bit part in the film \"In Caliente\" (1935) with the Mexican actress Dolores del Río. She danced with her father in such nightspots as the Foreign and the Caliente clubs. Winfield Sheehan, the head of the Fox Film Corporation, saw her dancing at the Caliente Club and quickly arranged for Hayworth to do a screen test a week later. Impressed by her screen persona, Sheehan signed her for a short-term, six-month contract at Fox, under the name Rita Cansino, the first of two name changes during her film career.\n\nDuring her time at Fox, Hayworth was billed as Rita Cansino and appeared in unremarkable roles, often cast as the exotic foreigner. In late 1934, aged 16, she performed a dance sequence in the Spencer Tracy film \"Dante's Inferno\" (1935), and was put under contract in February 1935. She had her first speaking role as an Argentinian girl in \"Under the Pampas Moon\" (1935). She played an Egyptian girl in \"Charlie Chan in Egypt\" (1935), and a Russian dancer in \"Paddy O'Day\" (1935). Sheehan was grooming her for the lead in the 1936 Technicolor film \"Ramona\", hoping to establish her as Fox Film's new Dolores del Río.\n\nBy the end of her six-month contract, Fox had merged into 20th Century Fox, with Darryl F. Zanuck serving as the executive producer. Dismissing Sheehan's interest in her and giving Loretta Young the lead in \"Ramona\", Zanuck did not renew Cansino's contract. Sensing her screen potential, salesman and promoter Edward C. Judson, with whom she would elope in 1937, got freelance work for her in several small-studio films and a part in the Columbia Pictures feature \"Meet Nero Wolfe\" (1936). Studio head Harry Cohn signed her to a seven-year contract and tried her out in small roles.\n\nCohn argued that her image was too Mediterranean, which limited her to being cast in \"exotic\" roles that were fewer in number. He was heard to say her last name sounded too Spanish. Judson acted on Cohn's advice: Rita Cansino became Rita Hayworth when she adopted her mother's maiden name, to the consternation of her father. With a name that emphasized her British-American ancestry, people were more likely to regard her as a classic \"American\".\n\nWith Cohn and Judson's encouragement, Hayworth changed her hair color to dark red and had electrolysis to raise her hairline and broaden the appearance of her forehead.\n\nHayworth appeared in five minor Columbia pictures and three minor independent movies in 1937. The following year, she appeared in five Columbia B movies. In 1939, Cohn pressured director Howard Hawks to use Hayworth for a small but important role as a man-trap in the aviation drama \"Only Angels Have Wings,\" in which she played opposite Cary Grant and Jean Arthur.\n\nWith this film's box-office success, fan mail for Hayworth began pouring into Columbia's publicity department. Cohn began to see Hayworth as his first and official new star. The studio never officially had stars under contract, except for Jean Arthur, who was trying to break with it.\n\nCohn began to build up Hayworth in 1940 in features such as \"Music in My Heart\", \"The Lady in Question\", and \"Angels Over Broadway\". That year, she was first featured in a \"Life\" magazine cover story. Cohn loaned Hayworth to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to appear in \"Susan and God\" opposite Joan Crawford. While on loan to Warner Bros., Hayworth appeared as the second female lead in \"The Strawberry Blonde\" (1941), opposite James Cagney. Because the film was a big box-office success, Hayworth's popularity rose and she immediately became one of Hollywood's hottest actresses. So impressed was Warner Bros., they tried to buy Hayworth's contract from Columbia, but Cohn refused to release her.\n\nHer success led to a supporting role in \"Blood and Sand\" (1941) opposite Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell with Fox, the studio that had dropped her six years before. In one of her most notable screen roles, Hayworth played Doña Sol des Muire, the first of many screen sirens.\n\nShe returned in triumph to Columbia Pictures and was cast in the musical \"You'll Never Get Rich\" (1941) opposite Fred Astaire in one of the highest-budgeted films Columbia had ever made. The picture was so successful, the studio produced and released another Astaire-Hayworth picture the following year, \"You Were Never Lovelier\". Astaire's biographer Peter Levinson writes that the dancing combination of Astaire and Hayworth was \"absolute magnetism on the screen.\" Although Astaire made 10 films with Ginger Rogers, his other main dancing partner, Hayworth's sensuality surpassed Rogers's cool technical expertise. \"Rita's youthful exuberance meshed perfectly with Fred's maturity and elegance,\" says Levinson.\n\nWhen Astaire was asked who his favorite dance partner was, he tried not answering the question, but later admitted it was Hayworth: \"All right, I'll give you a name,\" he said. \"But if you ever let it out, I'll swear I lied. It was Rita Hayworth.\" Astaire commented that \"Rita danced with trained perfection and individuality … She was better when she was 'on' than at rehearsal.\" Biographer Charlie Reinhart describes the effect she had on Astaire's style:\n\nIn August 1941, Hayworth was featured in an iconic \"Life\" photo in which she posed in a negligee with a black lace bodice.\n\nBob Landry's photo made Hayworth one of the top two pin-up girls of the World War II years; the other was Betty Grable, in a 1943 photograph. For two years, Hayworth's photograph was the most requested pin-up photograph in circulation. In 2002, the satin nightgown Hayworth wore for the photo sold for $26,888.\n\nIn March 1942, Hayworth visited Brazil as a cultural ambassador for the Roosevelt administration's Good Neighbor policy, under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs.\n\nHayworth had top billing in one of her best-known films, the Technicolor musical \"Cover Girl\", released in 1944. The film established her as Columbia's top star of the 1940s, and it gave her the distinction of being the first of only six women to dance on screen with both Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. \"I guess the only jewels of my life,\" Hayworth said in 1970, \"were the pictures I made with Fred Astaire... And \"Cover Girl\", too.\"\n\nFor three consecutive years, starting in 1944, Hayworth was named one of the top movie box-office attractions in the world. She was adept in ballet, tap, ballroom, and Spanish routines. Cohn continued to showcase Hayworth's dance talents. Columbia featured her in the Technicolor films \"Tonight and Every Night\" (1945) with Lee Bowman and \"Down to Earth\" (1947) with Larry Parks.\n\nHer sexy, glamorous appeal was most noted in Charles Vidor's film noir \"Gilda\" (1946) with Glenn Ford, which caused censors some consternation. The role, in which Hayworth wore black satin and performed a legendary one-glove striptease, \"Put The Blame On Mame\", made her into a cultural icon as a \"femme fatale.\"\n\nWhile \"Gilda\" was in release, it was widely reported that an atomic bomb which was scheduled to be tested at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean's Marshall Islands would bear an image of Hayworth, a reference to her bombshell status. Although the gesture was undoubtedly meant as a compliment, Hayworth was deeply offended. Orson Welles, then married to Hayworth, recalled her anger in an interview with biographer Barbara Leaming: \"Rita used to fly into terrible rages all the time, but the angriest was when she found out that they'd put her on the atom bomb. Rita almost went insane, she was so angry... She wanted to go to Washington to hold a press conference, but Harry Cohn wouldn't let her because it would be unpatriotic.\" Welles tried to persuade Hayworth that the whole business was not a publicity stunt on Cohn's part, that it was simply homage to her from the flight crew.\n\nOn the June 30, 1946 broadcast of \"Orson Welles Commentaries\", Welles said of the imminent test, \"I want my daughter to be able to tell her daughter that grandmother's picture was on the last atom bomb ever to explode.\"\n\nThe fourth atomic bomb ever to be detonated was decorated with a photograph of Hayworth cut from the June 1946 issue of \"Esquire\" magazine. Above it was stenciled the device's nickname, \"Gilda\", in two-inch black letters.\n\nHayworth's performance in Welles's 1947 film \"The Lady from Shanghai\" was critically acclaimed. The film's failure at the box office was attributed in part to Hayworth's famous red hair being cut short and bleached platinum blonde for the role. Cohn had not been consulted and was furious that Hayworth's image was changed.\n\nAlso in 1947, Hayworth was featured in a \"Life\" cover story by Winthrop Sargeant that resulted in her being nicknamed \"The Love Goddess\". The term was adopted and used later as the title of a biopic and of a biography about her. In a 1980s interview, Hayworth said, \"Everybody else does nude scenes, but I don't. I never made nude movies. I didn't have to do that. I danced. I was provocative, I guess, in some things. But I was not completely exposed.\"\n\nHer next film, \"The Loves of Carmen\" (1948) with Glenn Ford, was the first film co-produced by Columbia and Hayworth's production company, The Beckworth Corporation (named for Rebecca, her daughter with Welles). It was Columbia's biggest moneymaker that year. She received a percentage of the profits from this and all her subsequent films until 1954, when she dissolved Beckworth to pay off debts.\n\nIn 1948, at the height of her fame, Hayworth traveled to Cannes and was introduced to Prince Aly Khan. They began a year-long courtship, and were married on May 27, 1949. Hayworth left Hollywood and sailed for France, breaking her contract with Columbia.\n\nBecause Hayworth was already one of the most well-known celebrities in the world, the courtship and the wedding received enormous press coverage around the world. Because she was still legally married to second husband Orson Welles, Hayworth also received some negative backlash for her courtship with the prince, causing some American fans to boycott her pictures. The wedding marked the first time a Hollywood actress became a princess. On December 28, 1949, Hayworth gave birth to the couple's only daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan.\n\nThough Hayworth was anxious to start a new life abroad, away from Hollywood, Aly Khan's flamboyant lifestyle and duties proved too difficult for Hayworth. She struggled to fit in with his friends, and found it difficult to learn French. Aly Khan was also known in circles as a playboy, and it was suspected that he had been unfaithful to Hayworth during the marriage.\n\nIn 1951, Hayworth set sail with her two daughters for New York. Although the couple did reconcile for a short time, they officially divorced in 1953.\n\nAfter the collapse of her marriage to Khan, Rita Hayworth was forced to return to Hollywood to star in her \"comeback\" picture, \"Affair in Trinidad\" (1952) which again paired her with Glenn Ford. Director Vincent Sherman recalled that Hayworth seemed \"rather frightened at the approach of doing another picture\". She continued to clash with Columbia boss Harry Cohn, and was placed on suspension during filming. Nevertheless, the picture was highly publicized. The picture ended up grossing $1 million more than her previous blockbuster, \"Gilda\".\n\nShe continued to star in a string of successful pictures. In 1953, she had two films released: \"Salome\" with Charles Laughton and Stewart Granger, and \"Miss Sadie Thompson\" with José Ferrer and Aldo Ray. She was off the big screen for another four years, mainly because of a tumultuous marriage to the singer Dick Haymes. During her marriage to Haymes, she was involved in much negative publicity, which significantly lessened her appeal. By the time she returned to the screen for \"Fire Down Below\" (1957), Kim Novak had become Columbia's top female star. Her last musical was \"Pal Joey\" (1957). After this film, Hayworth left Columbia for good.\n\nShe received good reviews for her performance in \"Separate Tables\" (1958), with Burt Lancaster and David Niven, and \"The Story on Page One\" (1960). She continued working throughout the 1960s. In 1962, her planned Broadway debut in \"Step on a Crack\" was cancelled for undisclosed health reasons. \"The Money Trap\" (1964) paired her, for the last time, with good friend Glenn Ford. She continued to act in films until the early 1970s. She made comedic television appearances on \"Laugh In\" and \"The Carol Burnett Show\" in the 1970s. Her last film was \"The Wrath of God\" (1972).\n\nHayworth had a strained relationship with Columbia Pictures for many years. In 1943, she was suspended without pay for nine weeks because she refused to appear in \"Once Upon a Time\". During this period in Hollywood, contract players could not choose their films; they were on salary rather than receiving a fixed amount per picture.\n\nIn 1947, Hayworth's new contract with Columbia provided a salary of $250,000 plus 50% of film's profits.\n\nIn 1951, Columbia alleged it had $800,000 invested in properties for her, including the film she walked out on that year. Hayworth left Hollywood to marry Prince Aly Khan and was suspended for failing to report to work on the film \"Affair in Trinidad\". In 1952, Hayworth refused to report for work because she objected to the script.\n\nIn 1955, she sued Columbia Pictures to be released from her contract, but asked for her $150,000 salary, alleging that the filming failed to start when agreed. She said, \"I was in Switzerland when they sent me the script for \"Affair in Trinidad\" and I threw it across the room. But I did the picture, and \"Pal Joey\", too. I came back to Columbia because I wanted to work and first, see, I had to finish that goddamn contract, which is how Harry Cohn \"owned\" me!\"\n\n\"Harry Cohn thought of me as one of the people he could exploit, and make a lot of money,\" Hayworth said in 1972. \"And I did make a lot of money for him, but not much for me.\"\n\nYears after her film career had ended and long after Cohn had died, Hayworth still resented her treatment by both him and Columbia. She spoke bluntly in a 1968 interview:\n\nI used to have to punch a time clock at Columbia. Every day of my life. That's what it was like. I was under exclusive contract, like they owned me … I think he had my dressing room bugged … He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him … You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.\n\nHayworth resented the fact that the studio had failed to train her to sing or even to encourage her to learn how to sing. Although she appeared to sing in many of her films, she was usually dubbed. Because the public did not know her secret, she was embarrassed to be asked to sing by troops at USO shows.\n\n\"I wanted to study singing\", Hayworth complained, \"but Harry Cohn kept saying, 'Who needs it?' and the studio wouldn't pay for it. They had me so intimidated that I couldn't have done it anyway. They always said, 'Oh, no, we can't let you do it. There's no time for that; it has to be done right now!' I was under contract, and that was it.\"\n\nHayworth did sing the acoustic guitar version of \"Put the Blame on Mame\" in \"Gilda\". The other songs in the picture were dubbed by Anita Ellis.\n\nCohn had a reputation as a taskmaster, but he had his own criticisms of Hayworth. He had invested heavily in her before she began a reckless affair with the married Aly Khan, and it could have caused a backlash against her career and Columbia's success. For instance, an article in the British periodical \"The People\" called for a boycott of Hayworth's films: \"Hollywood must be told its already tarnished reputation will sink to rock bottom if it restores this reckless woman to a place among its stars.\"\n\nCohn expressed his frustration in a 1957 interview with \"Time\" magazine: \"Hayworth might be worth ten million dollars today easily! She owned 25% of the profits with her own company and had hit after hit and she had to get married and had to get out of the business and took a suspension because she fell in love again! In five years, at two pictures a year, at 25%! Think of what she could have made! But she didn't make pictures! She took two or three suspensions! She got mixed up with different characters! Unpredictable!\"\n\nHayworth was a top glamour girl in the 1940s, a pin-up girl for military servicemen and a beauty icon for women. At and , she was tall enough to be a concern for dancing partners such as Fred Astaire. She reportedly changed her hair color eight times in eight movies.\n\nIn 1949, Hayworth's lips were voted best in the world by the Artists League of America. She had a modeling contract with Max Factor to promote its Tru-Color lipsticks and Pan-Stik make-up.\n\nIn 1941, Hayworth said she was the antithesis of the characters she played. \"I naturally am very shy … and I suffer from an inferiority complex.\" Her provocative role in \"Gilda\", in particular, was responsible for people expecting her to be what she was not. Hayworth once said, with some bitterness, \"Men go to bed with Gilda, but wake up with me.\"\n\nHayworth's two younger brothers, Eduardo Cansino Jr. ((October 13, 1919 – March 11, 1974) and Vernon Cansino, both served in World War II. Vernon left the United States Army in 1946 with several medals, including the Purple Heart, and later married Susan Vail, a dancer. Eduardo Jr. followed Hayworth into acting; he was also under contract with Columbia Pictures. In 1950, he made his screen debut in \"The Great Adventures of Captain Kidd\".\n\nHayworth was married and divorced five times. She said, \"Basically, I am a good, gentle person, but I am attracted to mean personalities.\"\n\nIn 1937, when Hayworth was 18, she married Edward Judson, an oilman turned promoter who was more than twice her age. They married in Las Vegas. He had played a major role in launching her acting career. A shrewd businessman, he was domineering and became her manager for months before he proposed. \"He helped me with my career,\" Hayworth conceded after they divorced, \"and helped himself to my money.\" She alleged that Judson compelled her to transfer a considerable amount of her property to him and she promised to pay him $12,000 under threats that he would do her \"great bodily harm.\" \n\nShe filed for divorce from him on February 24, 1942, with a complaint of cruelty. She noted to the press that his work took him to Oklahoma and Texas while she lived and worked in Hollywood. Judson was as old as her father, who was enraged by the marriage, which caused a rift between Hayworth and her parents until the divorce. Judson had failed to tell Hayworth before they married that he had previously been married twice. When she left him, she literally had no money; she asked her friend Hermes Pan if she could eat at his home.\n\nHayworth married Orson Welles on September 7, 1943, during the run of \"The Mercury Wonder Show\". None of her colleagues knew about the planned wedding (before a judge) until she announced it the day before. For the civil ceremony, she wore a beige suit, a ruffled white blouse, and a veil. A few hours after they got married, they returned to work at the studio. They had a daughter, Rebecca, who was born on December 17, 1944, and died at the age of 59 on October 17, 2004. They struggled in their marriage. Hayworth said that Welles did not want to be tied down:\nDuring the entire period of our marriage, he showed no interest in establishing a home. When I suggested purchasing a home, he told me he didn't want the responsibility. Mr. Welles told me he never should have married in the first place; that it interfered with his freedom in his way of life.\n\nHayworth called Welles the great love of her life. On November 10, 1947, she was granted a divorce that became final the following year.\n\nIn 1948, Hayworth left her film career to marry Prince Aly Khan, a son of Sultan Mahommed Shah, Aga Khan III, the leader of the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam. They were married on May 27, 1949. Her bridal trousseau had been influenced by Dior's \"New Look\", launched in 1947.\n\nAly Khan and his family were heavily involved in horse racing, owning and racing horses. Hayworth had no interest in the sport, but became a member of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club anyway. Her filly, Double Rose, won several races in France and finished second in the 1949 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.\n\nIn 1951, while still married to Hayworth, Khan was spotted dancing with the actress Joan Fontaine in the nightclub where he and Hayworth had met. Hayworth threatened to divorce him in Reno, Nevada. In early May, Hayworth moved to Nevada to establish legal residence to qualify for a divorce. She stayed at Lake Tahoe with their daughter, saying there was a threat the child would be kidnapped. Hayworth filed for divorce from Khan on September 2, 1951, on the grounds of \"extreme cruelty, entirely mental in nature.\"\n\nHayworth once said she might convert to Islam, but did not. During the custody fight over their daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, born , the prince said he wanted her to be raised as a Muslim; Hayworth wanted the child to be raised as a Christian. Hayworth rejected his offer of $1 million if she would rear Yasmin as a Muslim from age seven and allow her to go to Europe to visit with him for two or three months each year, stating:\nNothing will make me give up Yasmin's chance to live here in America among our precious freedoms and habits. While I respect the Muslim faith, and all other faiths, it is my earnest wish that my daughter be raised as a normal, healthy American girl in the Christian faith. There isn't any amount of money in the entire world for which it is worth sacrificing this child's privilege of living as a normal Christian girl here in the United States. There just isn't anything else in the world that can compare with her sacred chance to do that. And I'm going to give it to Yasmin regardless of what it costs.In January 1953 Hayworth was granted a divorce from Aly Khan on the grounds of extreme mental cruelty. Hayworth's daughter Yasmin played about the court while the case was being heard, finally climbing on to the Judge's lap.\n\nWhen Hayworth and Dick Haymes first met, he was still married and his singing career was waning. When she showed up at the clubs, he got a larger audience. Haymes was desperate for money, because two of his former wives were taking legal action against him for unpaid child support. His financial problems were so bad, he could not return to California without being arrested. On July 7, 1954, his ex-wife Nora Haymes got a bench warrant for his arrest, because he owed her $3,800 in alimony. Less than a week earlier, his other ex-wife, Joanne Dru, also got a bench warrant because she said he owed $4,800 in support payments for their three children. Hayworth ended up paying most of Haymes's debts.\n\nHaymes was born in Argentina, and did not have solid proof of American citizenship. Not long after he met Hayworth, U.S. officials initiated proceedings to have him deported to Argentina for being an illegal alien. He hoped Hayworth could influence the government and keep him in the United States. When she assumed responsibility for his citizenship, a bond was formed that led to marriage. The two were married on September 24, 1953, at the Sands Hotel, Las Vegas, and their wedding procession went through the casino.\n\nFrom the start of their marriage, Haymes was deeply indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). When Hayworth took time off from attending his comeback performances in Philadelphia, the audiences sharply declined. Haymes's $5000 weekly salary was attached by the IRS to pay a $100,000 bill, and he was unable to pay his pianist. Haymes' ex-wives demanded money while Hayworth publicly bemoaned her own lack of alimony from Aly Khan. At one point, the couple was effectively imprisoned in a hotel room for 24 hours in Manhattan at the Hotel Madison as sheriff's deputies waited outside threatening to arrest Haymes for outstanding debts. At the same time, Hayworth was fighting a severe custody battle with Khan, during which she reported death threats against their children. While living in New York, Hayworth sent the children to live with their nanny in Westchester County. They were found and photographed by a reporter from \"Confidential\" magazine.\n\nAfter a tumultuous two years together, Haymes struck Hayworth in the face in 1955 in public at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. Hayworth packed her bags, walked out, and never returned. The assault and crisis shook her, and her doctor ordered her to remain in bed for several days.\n\nHayworth was short of money after her marriage to Haymes. She had failed to gain child support from Aly Khan. She sued Orson Welles for back payment of child support which she claimed had never been paid. This effort was unsuccessful and added to her stress.\n\nHayworth began a relationship with film producer James Hill, whom she went on to marry on February 2, 1958. He put her in one of her last major films, \"Separate Tables.\" This film was popular and highly praised, although \"The Harvard Lampoon\" named her the worst actress of 1958 for her performance. On September 1, 1961, Hayworth filed for divorce, alleging extreme mental cruelty. Hill later wrote \"Rita Hayworth: A Memoir\", in which he suggested that their marriage collapsed because he wanted Hayworth to continue making movies, while she wanted them both to retire from Hollywood.\n\nIn his autobiography, Charlton Heston wrote about Hayworth's brief marriage to Hill. One night Heston and his wife Lydia joined the couple for dinner at a restaurant in Spain with the director George Marshall and the actor Rex Harrison, Hayworth's co-star in \"The Happy Thieves\". Heston wrote that the occasion \"turned into the single most embarrassing evening of my life,\" describing how Hill heaped \"obscene abuse\" on Hayworth until she was \"reduced to a helpless flood of tears, her face buried in her hands.\" Heston wrote that the others sat stunned, witnesses to a \"marital massacre\" and, though he was \"strongly tempted to slug him\" (Hill), he left with his wife Lydia after she stood up, almost in tears. Heston wrote, \"I'm ashamed of walking away from Miss Hayworth's humiliation. I never saw her again.\"\n\nOrson Welles noted Hayworth's problem with alcohol during their marriage, but he never believed that her problem was alcoholism. \"It certainly imitated alcoholism in every superficial way,\" he recalled in 1983. \"She'd fly into these rages, never at me, never once, always at Harry Cohn or her father or her mother or her brother. She would break all the furniture and she'd get in a car and I'd have to get in the car and try to control her. She'd drive up in the hills suicidally. Terrible, terrible nights. And I just saw this lovely girl destroying herself. I admire Yasmin so much.\"\n\nYasmin Aga Khan spoke of her mother's long struggle with alcohol:\nI remember as a child that she had a drinking problem. She had difficulty coping with the ups and downs of the business ...As a child, I thought, 'She has a drinking problem and she's an alcoholic.' That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner ... Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.\n\nIn 1972, the 54-year-old Hayworth wanted to retire from acting, but she needed money. At the suggestion of Robert Mitchum, she agreed to film \"The Wrath of God\". The experience exposed her poor health and her worsening mental state. Because she could not remember her lines, her scenes were shot one line at a time. In November, she agreed to complete one more movie, the British film \"Tales That Witness Madness\", but because of her worsening health, she left the set and returned to the United States. She never returned to acting.\n\nIn March 1974, both of her brothers died within a week of each other, which caused her great sadness and led to heavy drinking. In January 1976 at London's Heathrow Airport, Hayworth was removed from a TWA flight after having an angry outburst while traveling with her agent. The event attracted much negative publicity; a disturbing photograph was published in newspapers the next day. Hayworth's alcoholism hid symptoms of what was eventually understood to be Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"It was the outbursts,\" said Yasmin Aga Khan. \"She'd fly into a rage. I can't tell you. I thought it was alcoholism—alcoholic dementia. We all thought that. The papers picked that up, of course. You can't imagine the relief just in getting a diagnosis. We had a name at last, Alzheimer's! Of course, that didn't really come until the last seven or eight years. She wasn't diagnosed as having Alzheimer's until 1980. There were two decades of hell before that.\"\n\nBiographer Barbara Leaming wrote that Hayworth aged prematurely because of her addiction to alcohol and also because of the many stresses in her life. \"Despite the artfully applied make-up and shoulder-length red hair, there was no concealing the ravages of drink and stress,\" she wrote of Hayworth's arrival in New York in May 1956 in order to begin work on \"Fire Down Below\", her first film in three years. \"Deep lines had crept around her eyes and mouth, and she appeared worn, exhausted—older than her thirty-eight years.\"\n\nAlzheimer's disease had been largely forgotten by the medical community since its discovery in 1906. Medical historian Barron H. Lerner wrote that when Hayworth's diagnosis was made public in 1981, she became \"the first public face of Alzheimer's, helping to ensure that future patients did not go undiagnosed...Unbeknownst to her, Hayworth helped to destigmatize a condition that can still embarrass victims and their families.\"\n\nIn July 1981, Hayworth's health had deteriorated to the point that a judge in Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that she should be placed under the care of her daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan of New York City. Hayworth lived in an apartment at The San Remo on Central Park West adjoining that of her daughter, who arranged for her mother's care during her final years. When asked how her mother was doing, Yasmin replied, \"She's still beautiful. But it's a shell.\"\n\nIn 1983, Rebecca Welles arranged to see her mother for the first time in seven years. Speaking to his lifelong friend Roger Hill, Orson Welles expressed his concern about the visit's effect on his daughter. \"Rita barely knows me now,\" Welles said. He recalled seeing Hayworth three years before at an event which the Reagans held for Frank Sinatra. \"When it was over, I came over to her table and I saw that she was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, I could see that she realized who I was, and she began to cry quietly.\"\n\nIn an interview which he gave the evening before his death in 1985, Welles called Hayworth \"one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived\".\n\nHayworth was a lifelong Democrat who was an active member of the Hollywood Democratic Committee and was active in the campaign of Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the 1944 presidential election.\n\nHayworth was a Roman Catholic whose marriage to Prince Aly Khan was deemed \"illicit\" by The Pope.\n\nRita Hayworth lapsed into a semicoma in February 1987. She died at age 68 from complications associated with Alzheimer's disease three months later on May 14, 1987, at her home in Manhattan. President Ronald Reagan, who had been one of Hayworth's contemporaries in Hollywood, issued a statement:\n\nRita Hayworth was one of our country's most beloved stars. Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl. In her later years, Rita became known for her struggle with Alzheimer's disease. Her courage and candor, and that of her family, were a great public service in bringing worldwide attention to a disease which we all hope will soon be cured. Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend who we will miss. We extend our deep sympathy to her family.\n\nA funeral service was held on May 18, 1987, at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Pallbearers included actors Ricardo Montalbán, Glenn Ford, Don Ameche, agent Budd Burton Moss, and the choreographer Hermes Pan. She was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. Her headstone includes Yasmin's sentiment: \"To yesterday's companionship and tomorrow's reunion.\"\n\nHayworth received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama for her performance in \"Circus World\" (1964).\n\nIn 1978 at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, DC, Hayworth was presented with the inaugural National Screen Heritage Award of the National Film Society, a group that published \"American Classic Screen\" magazine (1976–84).\n\nIn 1999, Hayworth was acknowledged as one of the top-25 greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood cinema in the American Film Institute's survey, AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars.\n\nThe public disclosure and discussion of Hayworth's illness drew international attention to Alzheimer's disease, which was little known at the time, and it helped to greatly increase federal funding for Alzheimer's research.\n\nThe Rita Hayworth Gala, a benefit for the Alzheimer's Association, is held annually in Chicago and New York City. The program was founded in 1985 by Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, in honor of her mother. She is the hostess for the events and a major sponsor of Alzheimer's disease charities and awareness programs. , a total of more than $72 million had been raised through events in Chicago, New York and Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nOn October 17, 2016, a press release from the Springer Associates Public Relations Agency announced that Rita Hayworth's former manager and friend, Budd Burton Moss, initiated a campaign to solicit the United States Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp featuring Hayworth. Springer Associates also announced that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would be lobbied in hopes of having an honorary Academy Award issued in memory of Hayworth. The press release added that Hayworth's daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, the Alzheimer's Association of Greater Los Angeles, and numerous prominent personalities of stage and screen were supporting the Moss campaign. The press release stated the target date for fulfillment of the stamp and Academy Award to be on October 17, 2018, on what will be the centennial of Hayworth's birth.\n\nThe film \"I Remember Better When I Paint\" (2009) describes how Hayworth took up painting while struggling with Alzheimer's and produced art.\n\n\n",
                "Orson Welles\n\nGeorge Orson Welles (; May 6, 1915 – October 10, 1985) was an American actor, director, writer, and producer who worked in theatre, radio, and film. He is remembered for his innovative work in all three: in theatre, most notably \"Caesar\" (1937), a Broadway adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\"; in radio, the legendary 1938 broadcast \"The War of the Worlds\"; and in film, \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), consistently ranked as one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nIn his 20s, Welles directed a number of high-profile stage productions for the Federal Theatre Project, including an adaptation of \"Macbeth\" with an entirely African American cast, and the political musical \"The Cradle Will Rock\". In 1937 he and John Houseman founded the Mercury Theatre, an independent repertory theatre company that presented a series of productions on Broadway through 1941. Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel \"The War of the Worlds\" performed for his radio anthology series \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\". It reportedly caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was actually occurring. Although some contemporary sources claim these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to notoriety.\n\nHis first film was \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), which he co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred in as Charles Foster Kane. Welles was an outsider to the studio system and directed only 13 full-length films in his career. He struggled for creative control on his projects early on with the major film studios and later in life with a variety of independent financiers, and his films were either heavily edited or remained unreleased. His distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear narrative forms, uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes. He has been praised as \"the ultimate auteur\".\n\nWelles followed up \"Citizen Kane\" with 12 other feature films, the most acclaimed of which include \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942), \"Touch of Evil\" (1958), and \"Chimes at Midnight\" (1966). Other works of his, such as \"The Lady from Shanghai\" (1947) and \"F for Fake\" (1973), are also well-regarded.\n\nIn 2002, Welles was voted the greatest film director of all time in two British Film Institute polls among directors and critics. Known for his baritone voice, Welles was an actor in radio and film, a Shakespearean stage actor, and a magician noted for presenting troop variety shows in the war years.\n\nGeorge Orson Welles was born May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, son of Richard Head Welles (b. Richard Hodgdon Wells, November 12, 1872, near St. Joseph, Missouri; d. December 28, 1930, Chicago, Illinois) and Beatrice Ives Welles (b. Beatrice Lucy Ives, September 1, 1883, Springfield, Illinois; d. May 10, 1924, Chicago). He was named after his paternal great-grandfather, influential Kenosha attorney Orson S. Head, and his brother George Head. An alternative story of the source of his first and middle names is one told by George Ade, who met Welles's parents on a West Indies cruise toward the end of 1914. Ade was traveling with a friend, Orson Wells (no relation), and the two of them sat at the same table as Mr. and Mrs. Richard Welles. Mrs Welles was pregnant at the time, and when they said good-by, she told them that she had enjoyed their company so much that if the child were a boy, she intended to name it for them - George Orson. Welles's birth announcement and a picture of him as a young boy are among George Ade's papers at Purdue University.\n\nDespite his family's affluence, Welles encountered hardship in childhood. His parents separated and moved to Chicago in 1919. His father, who made a fortune as the inventor of a popular bicycle lamp, became an alcoholic and stopped working. Welles's mother, a pianist, played during lectures by Dudley Crafts Watson at the Art Institute of Chicago to support her son and herself; the oldest Welles boy, \"Dickie\", was institutionalized at an early age because he had learning difficulties. Beatrice died of hepatitis in a Chicago hospital May 10, 1924, just after Welles's ninth birthday. The Gordon String Quartet, which had made its first appearance at her home in 1921, played at Beatrice's funeral.\n\nAfter his mother's death, Welles ceased pursuing music. It was decided that he would spend the summer with the Watson family at a private art colony in Wyoming, New York, established by Lydia Avery Coonley Ward. There he played and became friends with the children of the Aga Khan, including the 12-year-old Prince Aly Khan. Then, in what Welles later described as \"a hectic period\" in his life, he lived in a Chicago apartment with both his father and Dr. Maurice Bernstein, a Chicago physician who had been a close friend of both his parents. Welles briefly attended public school before his alcoholic father left business altogether and took him along on his travels to Jamaica and the Far East. When they returned they settled in a hotel in Grand Detour, Illinois, that was owned by his father. When the hotel burned down, Welles and his father took to the road again.\n\n\"During the three years that Orson lived with his father, some observers wondered who took care of whom\", wrote biographer Frank Brady.\n\n\"In some ways, he was never really a young boy, you know,\" said Roger Hill, who became Welles's teacher and lifelong friend.\n\nWelles briefly attended public school in Madison, Wisconsin, enrolled in the fourth grade. On September 15, 1926, he entered the Todd Seminary for Boys, an expensive independent school in Woodstock, Illinois, that his older brother, Richard Ives Welles, had attended ten years before but was expelled for misbehavior. At Todd School, Welles came under the influence of Roger Hill, a teacher who was later Todd's headmaster. Hill provided Welles with an \"ad hoc\" educational environment that proved invaluable to his creative experience, allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that interested him. Welles performed and staged theatrical experiments and productions there.\n\n\"Todd provided Welles with many valuable experiences\", wrote critic Richard France. \"He was able to explore and experiment in an atmosphere of acceptance and encouragement. In addition to a theater the school's own radio station was at his disposal.\" Welles' first radio experience was on the Todd station, he performed an adaptation of \"Sherlock Holmes\" that was written by him.\n\nOn December 28, 1930, when Welles was 15, his father died of heart and kidney failure at the age of 58, alone in a hotel in Chicago. Shortly before this, Welles had announced to his father that he would stop seeing him, believing it would prompt his father to refrain from drinking. As a result, Orson felt guilty because he believed his father had drunk himself to death because of him. His father's will left it to Orson to name his guardian. When Roger Hill declined, Welles chose Maurice Bernstein.\n\nFollowing graduation from Todd in May 1931, Welles was awarded a scholarship to Harvard University, while his mentor Roger Hill advocated he attend Cornell College in Iowa. Rather than enrolling, he chose travel. He studied for a few weeks at the Art Institute of Chicago with Boris Anisfeld, who encouraged him to pursue painting.\n\nWelles would occasionally return to Woodstock, the place he eventually named when he was asked in a 1960 interview, \"Where is home?\" Welles replied, \"I suppose it's Woodstock, Illinois, if it's anywhere. I went to school there for four years. If I try to think of a home, it's that.\"\n\nAfter his father's death, Welles traveled to Europe using a small portion of his inheritance. Welles said that while on a walking and painting trip through Ireland, he strode into the Gate Theatre in Dublin and claimed he was a Broadway star. The manager of Gate, Hilton Edwards, later said he had not believed him but was impressed by his brashness and an impassioned audition he gave. Welles made his stage debut at the Gate Theatre on October 13, 1931, appearing in Ashley Dukes's adaptation of \"Jew Suss\" as Duke Karl Alexander of Württemberg. He performed small supporting roles in subsequent Gate productions, and he produced and designed productions of his own in Dublin. In March 1932 Welles performed in W. Somerset Maugham's \"The Circle\" at Dublin's Abbey Theatre and travelled to London to find additional work in the theatre. Unable to obtain a work permit, he returned to the U.S.\n\nWelles found his fame ephemeral and turned to a writing project at Todd School that would become the immensely successful, first entitled \"Everybody's Shakespeare\" and subsequently, \"The Mercury Shakespeare\". Welles traveled to North Africa while working on thousands of illustrations for the \"Everybody's Shakespeare\" series of educational books, a series that remained in print for decades.\n\nIn 1933, Roger and Hortense Hill invited Welles to a party in Chicago, where Welles met Thornton Wilder. Wilder arranged for Welles to meet Alexander Woollcott in New York, in order that he be introduced to Katharine Cornell, who was assembling a repertory theatre company. Cornell's husband, director Guthrie McClintic, immediately put Welles under contract and cast him in three plays. \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" and \"Candida\" toured in repertory for 36 weeks beginning in November 1933, with the first of more than 200 performances taking place in Buffalo, New York.\n\nIn 1934, Welles got his first job on radio—on \"The American School of the Air\"—through actor-director Paul Stewart, who introduced him to director Knowles Entrikin. That summer Welles staged a drama festival with the Todd School in Woodstock, Illinois, inviting Micheál Mac Liammóir and Hilton Edwards from Dublin's Gate Theatre to appear along with New York stage luminaries in productions including \"Trilby\", \"Hamlet\", \"The Drunkard\" and \"Tsar Paul\". At the old firehouse in Woodstock he also shot his first film, an eight-minute short titled \"The Hearts of Age\".\n\nOn November 14, 1934, Welles married Chicago socialite and actress Virginia Nicolson (often misspelled \"Nicholson\") in a civil ceremony in New York. To appease the Nicolsons, who were furious at the couple's elopement, a formal ceremony took place December 23, 1934, at the New Jersey mansion of the bride's godmother. Welles wore a cutaway borrowed from his friend George Macready.\n\nA revised production of Katharine Cornell's \"Romeo and Juliet\" opened December 20, 1934, at the Martin Beck Theatre in New York. The Broadway production brought the 19-year-old Welles (now playing Tybalt) to the notice of John Houseman, a theatrical producer who was casting the lead role in the debut production of Archibald MacLeish's verse play, \"Panic\". On March 22, 1935, Welles made his debut on the CBS Radio series \"The March of Time\", performing a scene from \"Panic\" for a news report on the stage production\n\nBy 1935 Welles was supplementing his earnings in the theater as a radio actor in Manhattan, working with many actors who would later form the core of his Mercury Theatre on programs including \"America's Hour\", \"Cavalcade of America\", \"Columbia Workshop\" and \"The March of Time\". \"Within a year of his debut Welles could claim membership in that elite band of radio actors who commanded salaries second only to the highest paid movie stars,\" wrote critic Richard France.\n\nPart of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project (1935–39) was a New Deal program to fund theatre and other live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the United States during the Great Depression. It was created as a relief measure to employ artists, writers, directors and theater workers. Under national director Hallie Flanagan it was shaped into a true national theatre that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation and innovation, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time.\nJohn Houseman, director of the Negro Theatre Unit in New York, invited Welles to join the Federal Theatre Project in 1935. Far from unemployed — \"I was so employed I forgot how to sleep\" — Welles put a large share of his $1,500-a-week radio earnings into his stage productions, bypassing administrative red tape and mounting the projects more quickly and professionally. \"Roosevelt once said that I was the only operator in history who ever illegally siphoned money \"into\" a Washington project,\" Welles said.\n\nThe Federal Theatre Project was the ideal environment in which Welles could develop his art. Its purpose was employment, so he was able to hire any number of artists, craftsmen and technicians, and he filled the stage with performers. The company for the first production, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" with an entirely African-American cast, numbered 150. The production became known as the \"Voodoo Macbeth\" because Welles changed the setting to a mythical island suggesting the Haitian court of King Henri Christophe, with Haitian \"vodou\" fulfilling the rôle of Scottish witchcraft. The play opened April 14, 1936, at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem and was received rapturously. At 20, Welles was hailed as a prodigy. The production then made a 4,000-mile national tour that included two weeks at the Texas Centennial Exposition in Dallas.\n\nNext mounted was the farce \"Horse Eats Hat\", an adaptation by Welles and Edwin Denby of \"The Italian Straw Hat\", an 1851 five-act farce by Eugène Marin Labiche and Marc-Michel. The play was presented September 26 – December 5, 1936, at Maxine Elliott's Theatre, New York, and featured Joseph Cotten in his first starring role. It was followed by an adaptation of \"Dr. Faustus\" that used light as a prime unifying scenic element in a nearly black stage, presented January 8 – May 9, 1937, at Maxine Elliott's Theatre.\n\nOutside the scope of the Federal Theatre Project, American composer Aaron Copland chose Welles to direct \"The Second Hurricane\" (1937), an operetta with a libretto by Edwin Denby. Presented at the Henry Street Settlement Music School in New York for the benefit of high school students, the production opened April 21, 1937, and ran its scheduled three performances.\n\nIn 1937, Welles rehearsed Marc Blitzstein's political operetta, \"The Cradle Will Rock\". It was originally scheduled to open June 16, 1937, in its first public preview. Because of severe federal cutbacks in the Works Progress projects, the show's premiere at the Maxine Elliott Theatre was canceled. The theater was locked and guarded to prevent any government-purchased materials from being used for a commercial production of the work. In a last-minute move, Welles announced to waiting ticket-holders that the show was being transferred to the Venice, 20 blocks away. Some cast, and some crew and audience, walked the distance on foot. The union musicians refused to perform in a commercial theater for lower non-union government wages. The actors' union stated that the production belonged to the Federal Theater Project and could not be performed outside that context without permission. Lacking the participation of the union members, \"The Cradle Will Rock\" began with Blitzstein introducing the show and playing the piano accompaniment on stage with some cast members performing from the audience. This impromptu performance was well received by its audience.\n\nBreaking with the Federal Theatre Project in 1937, Welles and Houseman founded their own repertory company, which they called the Mercury Theatre. The name was inspired by the title of the iconoclastic magazine, \"The American Mercury\". Welles was executive producer, and the original company included such actors as Joseph Cotten, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Arlene Francis, Martin Gabel, John Hoyt, Norman Lloyd, Vincent Price, Stefan Schnabel and Hiram Sherman.\n\n\"I think he was the greatest directorial talent we've ever had in the [American] theater,\" Lloyd said of Welles in a 2014 interview. \"When you saw a Welles production, you saw the text had been affected, the staging was remarkable, the sets were unusual, music, sound, lighting, a totality of everything. We had not had such a man in our theater. He was the first and remains the greatest.\"\n\nThe Mercury Theatre opened November 11, 1937, with \"Caesar\", Welles's modern-dress adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy \"Julius Caesar\" — streamlined into an anti-fascist tour de force that Joseph Cotten later described as \"so vigorous, so contemporary that it set Broadway on its ear.\" The set was completely open with no curtain, and the brick stage wall was painted dark red. Scene changes were achieved by lighting alone. On the stage was a series of risers; squares were cut into one at intervals and lights were set beneath it, pointing straight up to evoke the \"cathedral of light\" at the Nuremberg Rallies. \"He staged it like a political melodrama that happened the night before,\" said Lloyd.\n\nBeginning January 1, 1938, \"Caesar\" was performed in repertory with \"The Shoemaker's Holiday\"; both productions moved to the larger National Theatre. They were followed by \"Heartbreak House\" (April 29, 1938) and \"Danton's Death\" (November 5, 1938). As well as being presented in a pared-down oratorio version at the Mercury Theatre on Sunday nights in December 1937, \"The Cradle Will Rock\" was at the Windsor Theatre for 13 weeks (January 4–April 2, 1938). Such was the success of the Mercury Theatre that Welles appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, in full makeup as Captain Shotover in \"Heartbreak House\", in the issue dated May 9, 1938—three days after his 23rd birthday.\n\nSimultaneously with his work in the theatre, Welles worked extensively in radio as an actor, writer, director and producer, often without credit. Between 1935 and 1937 he was earning as much as $2,000 a week, shuttling between radio studios at such a pace that he would arrive barely in time for a quick scan of his lines before he was on the air. While he was directing the \"Voodoo Macbeth\" Welles was dashing between Harlem and midtown Manhattan three times a day to meet his radio commitments.\n\nIn addition to continuing as a repertory player on \"The March of Time\", in the fall of 1936 Welles adapted and performed \"Hamlet\" in an early two-part episode of CBS Radio's \"Columbia Workshop\". His performance as the announcer in the series' April 1937 presentation of Archibald MacLeish's verse drama \"The Fall of the City\" was an important development in his radio career and made the 21-year-old Welles an overnight star.\n\nIn July 1937, the Mutual Network gave Welles a seven-week series to adapt \"Les Misérables\". It was his first job as a writer-director for radio, the radio debut of the Mercury Theatre, and one of Welles's earliest and finest achievements. He invented the use of narration in radio.\n\n\"By making himself the center of the storytelling process, Welles fostered the impression of self-adulation that was to haunt his career to his dying day,\" wrote critic Andrew Sarris. \"For the most part, however, Welles was singularly generous to the other members of his cast and inspired loyalty from them above and beyond the call of professionalism.\"\n\nThat September, Mutual chose Welles to play Lamont Cranston, also known as \"The Shadow\". He performed the role anonymously through mid-September 1938.\n\nAfter the theatrical successes of the Mercury Theatre, CBS Radio invited Orson Welles to create a summer show for 13 weeks. The series began July 11, 1938, initially titled \"First Person Singular\", with the formula that Welles would play the lead in each show. Some months later the show was called \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\". The weekly hour-long show presented radio plays based on classic literary works, with original music composed and conducted by Bernard Herrmann.\n\nThe Mercury Theatre's radio adaptation of \"The War of the Worlds\" by H. G. Wells October 30, 1938, brought Welles instant fame. The combination of the news bulletin form of the performance with the between-breaks dial spinning habits of listeners was later reported to have created widespread confusion among listeners who failed to hear the introduction, although the extent of this confusion has come into question. Panic was reportedly spread among listeners who believed the fictional news reports of a Martian invasion. The myth of the result created by the combination was reported as fact around the world and disparagingly mentioned by Adolf Hitler in a public speech.\n\nWelles's growing fame drew Hollywood offers, lures that the independent-minded Welles resisted at first. \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air,\" which had been a sustaining show (without sponsorship) was picked up by Campbell Soup and renamed \"The Campbell Playhouse.\" \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" made its last broadcast on December 4, 1938, and \"The Campbell Playhouse\" began five days later.\n\nWelles began commuting from California to New York for the two Sunday broadcasts of \"The Campbell Playhouse\" after signing a film contract with RKO Pictures in August 1939. In November 1939, production of the show moved from New York to Los Angeles.\n\nAfter 20 shows, Campbell began to exercise more creative control and had complete control over story selection. As his contract with Campbell came to an end, Welles chose not to sign on for another season. After the broadcast of March 31, 1940, Welles and Campbell parted amicably.\n\nRKO Radio Pictures president George Schaefer eventually offered Welles what generally is considered the greatest contract offered to a filmmaker, much less to one who was untried. Engaging him to write, produce, direct and perform in two motion pictures, the contract subordinated the studio's financial interests to Welles's creative control, and broke all precedent by granting Welles the right of final cut. After signing a summary agreement with RKO on July 22, Welles signed a full-length 63-page contract August 21, 1939. The agreement was bitterly resented by the Hollywood studios and persistently mocked in the trade press.\n\nRKO rejected Welles's first two movie proposals, but agreed on the third offer—\"Citizen Kane\". Welles co-wrote, produced and directed the film, and performed the lead role. Welles conceived the project with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who was writing radio plays for \"The Campbell Playhouse\". Mankiewicz based the original outline on the life of William Randolph Hearst, whom he knew socially and came to hate after being exiled from Hearst's circle.\n\nAfter agreeing on the storyline and character, Welles supplied Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes and put him under contract to write the first draft screenplay under the supervision of John Houseman. Welles wrote his own draft, then drastically condensed and rearranged both versions and added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, \"At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own.\"\n\nWelles's project attracted some of Hollywood's best technicians, including cinematographer Gregg Toland. For the cast, Welles primarily used actors from his Mercury Theatre. Filming \"Citizen Kane\" took ten weeks.\n\nHearst's newspapers barred all reference to \"Citizen Kane\" and exerted enormous pressure on the Hollywood film community to force RKO to shelve the film. RKO chief George Schaefer received a cash offer from MGM's Louis B. Mayer and other major studio executives if he would destroy the negative and existing prints of the film.\n\nWhile waiting for \"Citizen Kane\" to be released, Welles produced and directed the original Broadway production of \"Native Son\", a drama written by Paul Green and Richard Wright based on Wright's novel. Starring Canada Lee, the show ran March 24 – June 28, 1941, at the St. James Theatre. The Mercury Production was the last time Welles and Houseman worked together.\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" was given a limited release and the film received overwhelming critical praise. It was voted the best picture of 1941 by the National Board of Review and the New York Film Critics Circle. The film garnered nine Academy Award nominations but won only for Best Original Screenplay, shared by Mankiewicz and Welles. \"Variety\" reported that block voting by screen extras deprived \"Citizen Kane\" of Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (Welles), and similar prejudices were likely to have been responsible for the film receiving no technical awards.\n\nThe delay in the film's release and uneven distribution contributed to mediocre results at the box office. After it ran its course theatrically, \"Citizen Kane\" was retired to the vault in 1942. In postwar France, however, the film's reputation grew after it was seen for the first time in 1946. In the United States, it began to be re-evaluated after it began to appear on television in 1956. That year it was also re-released theatrically, and film critic Andrew Sarris described it as \"the great American film\" and \"the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since \"Birth of a Nation\".\" \"Citizen Kane\" is now hailed as one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nWelles's second film for RKO was \"The Magnificent Ambersons\", adapted by Welles from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Booth Tarkington. Toland was not available, so Stanley Cortez was named cinematographer. The meticulous Cortez worked slowly and the film lagged behind schedule and over budget. Prior to production, Welles's contract was renegotiated, revoking his right to control the final cut. \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" was in production October 28, 1941 – January 22, 1942.\n\nThroughout the shooting of the film Welles was also producing a weekly half-hour radio series, \"The Orson Welles Show\". Many of the \"Ambersons\" cast participated in the CBS Radio series, which ran September 15, 1941 – February 2, 1942.\n\nAt RKO's request, Welles worked on an adaptation of Eric Ambler's spy thriller, \"Journey into Fear\", co-written with Joseph Cotten. In addition to acting in the film, Welles was the producer. Direction was credited to Norman Foster. Welles later said that they were in such a rush that the director of each scene was determined by whoever was closest to the camera.\n\n\"Journey into Fear\" was in production January 6–March 12, 1942.\n\nIn late November 1941, Welles was appointed as a goodwill ambassador to Latin America by Nelson Rockefeller, U.S. Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and a principal stockholder in RKO Radio Pictures. The mission of the OCIAA was cultural diplomacy, promoting hemispheric solidarity and countering the growing influence of the Axis powers in Latin America. John Hay Whitney, head of the agency's Motion Picture Division, was asked by the Brazilian government to produce a documentary of the annual Rio Carnival celebration taking place in early February 1942. In a telegram December 20, 1941, Whitney wrote Welles, \"Personally believe you would make great contribution to hemisphere solidarity with this project.\"\n\nThe OCIAA sponsored cultural tours to Latin America and appointed goodwill ambassadors including George Balanchine and the American Ballet, Bing Crosby, Aaron Copland, Walt Disney, John Ford and Rita Hayworth. Welles was thoroughly briefed in Washington, D.C., immediately before his departure for Brazil, and film scholar Catherine L. Benamou, a specialist in Latin American affairs, finds it \"not unlikely\" that he was among the goodwill ambassadors who were asked to gather intelligence for the U.S. government in addition to their cultural duties. She concludes that Welles's acceptance of Whitney's request was \"a logical and patently patriotic choice\".\n\nIn addition to working on his ill-fated film project, \"It's All True\", Welles was responsible for radio programs, lectures, interviews and informal talks as part of his OCIAA-sponsored cultural mission, which was regarded as a success. He spoke on topics ranging from Shakespeare to visual art at gatherings of Brazil's elite, and his two intercontinental radio broadcasts in April 1942 were particularly intended to tell U.S. audiences that President Vargas was a partner with the Allies. Welles's ambassadorial mission was extended to permit his travel to other nations including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. Welles worked for more than half a year with no compensation.\n\nWelles's own expectations for the film were modest. \"\"It's All True\" was not going to make any cinematic history, nor was it intended to,\" he later said. \"It was intended to be a perfectly honorable execution of my job as a goodwill ambassador, bringing entertainment to the Northern Hemisphere that showed them something about the Southern one.\"\n\nIn July 1941, Welles conceived \"It's All True\" as an omnibus film mixing documentary and docufiction in a project that emphasized the dignity of labor and celebrated the cultural and ethnic diversity of North America. It was to have been his third film for RKO, following \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) and \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942). Duke Ellington was put under contract to score a segment with the working title, \"The Story of Jazz\", drawn from Louis Armstrong's 1936 autobiography, \"Swing That Music\". Armstrong was cast to play himself in the brief dramatization of the history of jazz performance, from its roots to its place in American culture in the 1940s. \"The Story of Jazz\" was to go into production in December 1941.\n\nMercury Productions purchased the stories for two other segments—\"My Friend Bonito\" and \"The Captain's Chair\"—from documentary filmmaker Robert J. Flaherty. Adapted by Norman Foster and John Fante, \"My Friend Bonito\" was the only segment of the original \"It's All True\" to go into production. Filming took place in Mexico September–December 1941, with Norman Foster directing under Welles's supervision.\n\nIn December 1941, the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs asked Welles to make a film in Brazil that would showcase the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. With filming of \"My Friend Bonito\" about two-thirds complete, Welles decided he could shift the geography of \"It's All True\" and incorporate Flaherty's story into an omnibus film about Latin America—supporting the Roosevelt administration's Good Neighbor policy, which Welles strongly advocated. In this revised concept, \"The Story of Jazz\" was replaced by the story of samba, a musical form with a comparable history and one that came to fascinate Welles. He also decided to do a ripped-from-the-headlines episode about the epic voyage of four poor Brazilian fishermen, the jangadeiros, who had become national heroes. Welles later said this was the most valuable story.\n\nRequired to film the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro in early February 1942, Welles rushed to edit \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" and finish his acting scenes in \"Journey into Fear\". He ended his lucrative CBS radio show February 2, flew to Washington, D.C., for a briefing, and then lashed together a rough cut of \"Ambersons\" in Miami with editor Robert Wise. Welles recorded the film's narration the night before he left for South America: \"I went to the projection room at about four in the morning, did the whole thing, and then got on the plane and off to Rio—and the end of civilization as we know it.\"\n\nWelles left for Brazil on February 4 and began filming in Rio February 8, 1942. At the time it did not seem that Welles's other film projects would be disrupted, but as film historian Catherine L. Benamou wrote, \"the ambassadorial appointment would be the first in a series of turning points leading—in 'zigs' and 'zags,' rather than in a straight line—to Welles's loss of complete directorial control over both \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" and \"It's All True\", the cancellation of his contract at RKO Radio Studio, the expulsion of his company Mercury Productions from the RKO lot, and, ultimately, the total suspension of \"It's All True\".\n\nIn 1942 RKO Pictures underwent major changes under new management. Nelson Rockefeller, the primary backer of the Brazil project, left its board of directors, and Welles's principal sponsor at RKO, studio president George Schaefer, resigned. RKO took control of \"Ambersons\" and edited the film into what the studio considered a commercial format. Welles's attempts to protect his version ultimately failed. In South America, Welles requested resources to finish \"It's All True\". Given a limited amount of black-and-white film stock and a silent camera, he was able to finish shooting the episode about the jangadeiros, but RKO refused to support further production on the film.\n\n\"So I was fired from RKO,\" Welles later recalled. \"And they made a great publicity point of the fact that I had gone to South America without a script and thrown all this money away. I never recovered from that attack.\" Later in 1942, when RKO Pictures began promoting its new corporate motto, \"Showmanship In Place of Genius: A New Deal at RKO\", Welles understood it as a reference to him.\n\nWelles returned to the United States August 22, 1942, after more than six months in South America. A week after his return he produced and emceed the first two hours of a seven-hour coast-to-coast War Bond drive broadcast titled \"I Pledge America\". Airing August 29, 1942, on the Blue Network, the program was presented in cooperation with the United States Department of the Treasury, Western Union (which wired bond subscriptions free of charge) and the American Women's Voluntary Services. Featuring 21 dance bands and a score of stage and screen and radio stars, the broadcast raised more than $10 million—more than $146 million today—for the war effort.\n\nOn October 12, 1942, \"Cavalcade of America\" presented Welles's radio play, \"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\", an entertaining and factual look at the legend of Christopher Columbus.\n\n\"It belongs to a period when hemispheric unity was a crucial matter and many programs were being devoted to the common heritage of the Americas,\" wrote broadcasting historian Erik Barnouw. \"Many such programs were being translated into Spanish and Portuguese and broadcast to Latin America, to counteract many years of successful Axis propaganda to that area. The Axis, trying to stir Latin America against Anglo-America, had constantly emphasized the differences between the two. It became the job of American radio to emphasize their common experience and essential unity.\"\n\n\"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\", also known as \"Columbus Day\", begins with the words, \"Hello Americans\"—the title Welles would choose for his own series five weeks later.\n\n\"Hello Americans\", a CBS Radio series broadcast November 15, 1942 – January 31, 1943, was produced, directed and hosted by Welles under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator for Inter-American Affairs. The 30-minute weekly program promoted inter-American understanding and friendship, drawing upon the research amassed for the ill-fated film, \"It's All True\". The series was produced concurrently with Welles's other CBS series, \"Ceiling Unlimited\" (November 9, 1942 – February 1, 1943), sponsored by the Lockheed-Vega Corporation. The program was conceived to glorify the aviation industry and dramatize its role in World War II. Welles's shows were regarded as significant contributions to the war effort.\n\nThroughout the war Welles worked on patriotic radio programs including \"Command Performance\", \"G.I. Journal\", \"Mail Call\", \"Nazi Eyes on Canada\", \"Stage Door Canteen\" and \"Treasury Star Parade\".\n\nIn early 1943, the two concurrent radio series (\"Ceiling Unlimited\", \"Hello Americans\") that Orson Welles created for CBS to support the war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on the 1943 film adaptation of \"Jane Eyre\" and that fee, in addition to the income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part circus and part magic show. He offered his services as magician and director, and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he co-produced with his friend Joseph Cotten: \"The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men\". Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay. The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel.\n\nThe development of the show coincided with the resolution of Welles's oft-changing draft status in May 1943, when he was finally declared 4-F—unfit for military service—for a variety of medical reasons. \"I felt guilty about the war,\" Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. \"I was guilt-ridden about my civilian status.\" He had been publicly hounded about his patriotism since \"Citizen Kane\", when the Hearst press began persistent inquiries about why Welles had not been drafted.\n\n\"The Mercury Wonder Show\" ran August 3 – September 9, 1943, in an 80-by-120-foot tent located at 9000 Cahuenga Boulevard, in the heart of Hollywood.\n\nAt intermission September 7, 1943, KMPC radio interviewed audience and cast members of \"The Mercury Wonder Show\"—including Welles and Rita Hayworth, who were married earlier that day. Welles remarked that \"The Mercury Wonder Show\" had been performed for approximately 48,000 members of the U.S. armed forces.\n\nThe idea of doing a radio variety show occurred to Welles after his success as substitute host of four consecutive episodes (March 14 – April 4, 1943) of \"The Jack Benny Program\", radio's most popular show, when Benny contracted pneumonia on a performance tour of military bases. A half-hour variety show broadcast January 26 – July 19, 1944, on the Columbia Pacific Network, \"The Orson Welles Almanac\" presented sketch comedy, magic, mindreading, music and readings from classic works. Many of the shows originated on U.S. military camps, where Welles and his repertory company and guests entertained the troops with a reduced version of \"The Mercury Wonder Show\". The performances of the all-star jazz group Welles brought together for the show were so popular that the band became a regular feature and was an important force in reviving interest in traditional New Orleans jazz.\n\nWelles was placed on the U.S. Treasury payroll on May 15, 1944, as an expert consultant for the duration of the war, with a retainer of $1 a year. On the recommendation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau asked Welles to lead the Fifth War Loan Drive, which opened June 12 with a one-hour radio show on all four networks, broadcast from Texarkana, Texas. Including a statement by the President, the program defined the causes of the war and encouraged Americans to buy $16 billion in bonds to finance the Normandy landings and the most violent phase of World War II. Welles produced additional war loan drive broadcasts on June 14 from the Hollywood Bowl, and June 16 from Soldier Field, Chicago. Americans purchased $20.6 billion in War Bonds during the Fifth War Loan Drive, which ended on July 8, 1944.\n\nWelles campaigned ardently for Roosevelt in 1944. A longtime supporter and campaign speaker for FDR, he occasionally sent the president ideas and phrases that were sometimes incorporated into what Welles characterized as \"less important speeches\". One of these ideas was the joke in what came to be called the Fala speech, Roosevelt's nationally broadcast September 23 address to the International Teamsters Union which opened the 1944 presidential campaign.\n\nWelles campaigned for the Roosevelt–Truman ticket almost full-time in the fall of 1944, traveling to nearly every state to the detriment of his own health and at his own expense. In addition to his radio addresses he filled in for Roosevelt, opposite Republican presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey, at \"The New York Herald Tribune Forum\" broadcast October 18 on the Blue Network. Welles accompanied FDR to his last campaign rally, speaking at an event November 4 at Boston's Fenway Park before 40,000 people, and took part in a historic election-eve campaign broadcast November 6 on all four radio networks.\n\nOn November 21, 1944, Welles began his association with \"This Is My Best\", a CBS radio series he would briefly produce, direct, write and host (March 13 – April 24, 1945). He wrote a political column called \"Orson Welles' Almanac\" (later titled \"Orson Welles Today\") for \"The New York Post\" January–November 1945, and advocated the continuation of FDR's New Deal policies and his international vision, particularly the establishment of the United Nations and the cause of world peace.\n\nOn April 12, 1945, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt died, the Blue-ABC network marshalled its entire executive staff and national leaders to pay homage to the late president. \"Among the outstanding programs which attracted wide attention was a special tribute delivered by Orson Welles\", reported \"Broadcasting\" magazine. Welles spoke at 10:10 p.m Eastern War Time, from Hollywood, and stressed the importance of continuing FDR's work: \"He has no need for homage and we who loved him have no time for tears … Our fighting sons and brothers cannot pause tonight to mark the death of him whose name will be given to the age we live in.\"\n\nWelles presented another special broadcast on the death of Roosevelt the following evening: \"We must move on beyond mere death to that free world which was the hope and labor of his life.\"\n\nHe dedicated the April 17 episode of \"This Is My Best\" to Roosevelt and the future of America on the eve of the United Nations Conference on International Organization. Welles was an advisor and correspondent for the Blue-ABC radio network's coverage of the San Francisco conference that formed the UN, taking place April 24 – June 23, 1945. He presented a half-hour dramatic program written by Ben Hecht on the opening day of the conference, and on Sunday afternoons (April 29 – June 10) he led a weekly discussion from the San Francisco Civic Auditorium.\n\nIn the fall of 1945 Welles began work on \"The Stranger\" (1946), a film noir drama about a war crimes investigator who tracks a high-ranking Nazi fugitive to an idyllic New England town. Edward G. Robinson, Loretta Young and Welles star.\n\nProducer Sam Spiegel initially planned to hire director John Huston, who had rewritten the screenplay by Anthony Veiller. When Huston entered the military, Welles was given the chance to direct and prove himself able to make a film on schedule and under budget—something he was so eager to do that he accepted a disadvantageous contract. One of its concessions was that he would defer to the studio in any creative dispute.\n\n\"The Stranger\" was Welles's first job as a film director in four years. He was told that if the film was successful he could sign a four-picture deal with International Pictures, making films of his own choosing. Welles was given some degree of creative control, and he endeavored to personalize the film and develop a nightmarish tone. He worked on the general rewrite of the script and wrote scenes at the beginning of the picture that were shot but subsequently cut by the producers. He filmed in long takes that largely thwarted the control given to editor Ernest J. Nims under the terms of the contract.\n\n\"The Stranger\" was the first commercial film to use documentary footage from the Nazi concentration camps. Welles had seen the footage in early May 1945 in San Francisco, as a correspondent and discussion moderator at the UN Conference on International Organization. He wrote of the Holocaust footage in his syndicated \"New York Post\" column May 7, 1945.\n\nCompleted a day ahead of schedule and under budget, \"The Stranger\" was the only film made by Welles to have been a \"bona fide\" box office success upon its release. Its cost was $1.034 million; 15 months after its release it had grossed $3.216 million. Within weeks of the completion of the film, International Pictures backed out of its promised four-picture deal with Welles. No reason was given, but the impression was left that \"The Stranger\" would not make money.\n\nIn the summer of 1946, Welles moved to New York to direct the Broadway musical \"Around the World\", a stage adaptation of the Jules Verne novel \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" with a book by Welles and music by Cole Porter. Producer Mike Todd, who would later produce the successful 1956 film adaptation, pulled out from the lavish and expensive production, leaving Welles to support the finances. When Welles ran out of money he convinced Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn to send enough money to continue the show, and in exchange Welles promised to write, produce, direct and star in a film for Cohn for no further fee. The stage show soon failed due to poor box-office, with Welles unable to claim the losses on his taxes.\n\nIn 1946, Welles began two new radio series—\"The Mercury Summer Theatre on the Air\" for CBS, and \"Orson Welles Commentaries\" for ABC. While \"Mercury Summer Theatre\" featured half-hour adaptations of some classic Mercury radio shows from the 1930s, the first episode was a condensation of his \"Around the World\" stage play, and is the only record of Cole Porter's music for the project. Several original Mercury actors returned for the series, as well as Bernard Herrmann. Welles invested his earnings into his failing stage play. \"Commentaries\" was a political vehicle for him, continuing the themes from his \"New York Post\" column. Again, Welles lacked a clear focus, until the NAACP brought to his attention the case of Isaac Woodard. Welles brought significant attention to Woodard's cause.\n\nThe last broadcast of \"Orson Welles Commentaries\" on October 6, 1946, marked the end of Welles's own radio shows.\n\nThe film that Welles was obliged to make in exchange for Harry Cohn's help in financing the stage production \"Around the World\" was \"The Lady from Shanghai\", filmed in 1947 for Columbia Pictures. Intended as a modest thriller, the budget skyrocketed after Cohn suggested that Welles's then-estranged second wife Rita Hayworth co-star.\n\nCohn disliked Welles's rough cut, particularly the confusing plot and lack of close-ups, and was not in sympathy with Welles's Brechtian use of irony and black comedy, especially in a farcical courtroom scene. Cohn ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the studio, approximately one hour of Welles's first cut was removed, including much of a climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse. While expressing displeasure at the cuts, Welles was appalled particularly with the musical score. The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors has since become a touchstone of film noir. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce.\n\nAlthough \"The Lady From Shanghai\" was acclaimed in Europe, it was not embraced in the U.S. until decades later. A similar difference in reception on opposite sides of the Atlantic followed by greater American acceptance befell the Welles-inspired Chaplin film \"Monsieur Verdoux\", originally to be directed by Welles starring Chaplin, then directed by Chaplin with the idea credited to Welles.\n\nPrior to 1948, Welles convinced Republic Pictures to let him direct a low-budget version of \"Macbeth\", which featured highly stylized sets and costumes, and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a pre-recorded soundtrack, one of many innovative cost-cutting techniques Welles deployed in an attempt to make an epic film from B-movie resources. The script, adapted by Welles, is a violent reworking of Shakespeare's original, freely cutting and pasting lines into new contexts via a collage technique and recasting \"Macbeth\" as a clash of pagan and proto-Christian ideologies. Some voodoo trappings of the famous Welles/Houseman Negro Theatre stage adaptation are visible, especially in the film's characterization of the Weird Sisters, who create an effigy of Macbeth as a charm to enchant him. Of all Welles's post-\"Kane\" Hollywood productions, \"Macbeth\" is stylistically closest to \"Citizen Kane\" in its long takes and deep focus photography.\n\nRepublic initially trumpeted the film as an important work but decided it did not care for the Scottish accents and held up general release for almost a year after early negative press reaction, including \"Life\"s comment that Welles's film \"doth foully slaughter Shakespeare.\" Welles left for Europe, while co-producer and lifelong supporter Richard Wilson reworked the soundtrack. Welles returned and cut 20 minutes from the film at Republic's request and recorded narration to cover some gaps. The film was decried as a disaster. \"Macbeth\" had influential fans in Europe, especially the French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, who hailed the film's \"crude, irreverent power\" and careful shot design, and described the characters as haunting \"the corridors of some dreamlike subway, an abandoned coal mine, and ruined cellars oozing with water.\"\n\nIn Italy he starred as Cagliostro in the 1948 film \"Black Magic\". His co-star, Akim Tamiroff, impressed Welles so much that Tamiroff would appear in four of Welles's productions during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe following year, Welles starred as Harry Lime in Carol Reed's \"The Third Man\", alongside Joseph Cotten, his friend and co-star from \"Citizen Kane\", with a script by Graham Greene and a memorable score by Anton Karas.\n\nA few years later, British radio producer Harry Alan Towers would resurrect the Lime character in the radio series \"The Adventures of Harry Lime\".\n\nWelles appeared as Cesare Borgia in the 1949 Italian film \"Prince of Foxes\", with Tyrone Power and Mercury Theatre alumnus Everett Sloane, and as the Mongol warrior Bayan in the 1950 film version of the novel \"The Black Rose\" (again with Tyrone Power).\n\nDuring this time, Welles was channeling his money from acting jobs into a self-financed film version of Shakespeare's play \"Othello\". From 1949 to 1951, Welles worked on \"Othello\", filming on location in Europe and Morocco. The film featured Welles's friends, Micheál Mac Liammóir as Iago and Hilton Edwards as Desdemona's father Brabantio. Suzanne Cloutier starred as Desdemona and Campbell Playhouse alumnus Robert Coote appeared as Iago's associate Roderigo.\n\nFilming was suspended several times as Welles ran out of funds and left for acting jobs, accounted in detail in MacLiammóir's published memoir \"Put Money in Thy Purse\". The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a drop-out of sound at every quiet moment. Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith, restored \"Othello\" in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing Angelo Francesco Lavagnino's original musical score, which was originally inaudible, and adding ambient stereo sound effects, which were not in the original film. The restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America.\n\nIn 1952, Welles continued finding work in England after the success of the \"Harry Lime\" radio show. Harry Alan Towers offered Welles another series, \"The Black Museum\", which ran for 52 weeks with Welles as host and narrator. Director Herbert Wilcox offered Welles the part of the murdered victim in \"Trent's Last Case\", based on the novel by E. C. Bentley. In 1953, the BBC hired Welles to read an hour of selections from Walt Whitman's epic poem \"Song of Myself\". Towers hired Welles again, to play Professor Moriarty in the radio series, \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\", starring John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson.\n\nWelles briefly returned to America to make his first appearance on television, starring in the \"Omnibus\" presentation of \"King Lear\", broadcast live on CBS October 18, 1953. Directed by Peter Brook, the production costarred Natasha Parry, Beatrice Straight and Arnold Moss.\n\nIn 1954, director George More O'Ferrall offered Welles the title role in the 'Lord Mountdrago' segment of \"Three Cases of Murder\", co-starring Alan Badel. Herbert Wilcox cast Welles as the antagonist in \"Trouble in the Glen\" opposite Margaret Lockwood, Forrest Tucker and Victor McLaglen. Old friend John Huston cast him as Father Mapple in his 1956 film adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\", starring Gregory Peck.\n\nWelles's next turn as director was the film \"Mr. Arkadin\" (1955), which was produced by his political mentor from the 1940s, Louis Dolivet. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars Robert Arden, who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles's third wife, Paola Mori, whose voice was dubbed by actress Billie Whitelaw; and guest stars Akim Tamiroff, Michael Redgrave, Katina Paxinou and Mischa Auer. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually five different versions of the film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled \"Confidential Report\". In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the Munich Film Museum oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements.\n\nIn 1955, Welles also directed two television series for the BBC. The first was \"Orson Welles' Sketch Book\", a series of six 15-minute shows featuring Welles drawing in a sketchbook to illustrate his reminiscences for the camera (including such topics as the filming of \"It's All True\" and the Isaac Woodard case), and the second was \"Around the World with Orson Welles\", a series of six travelogues set in different locations around Europe (such as Venice, the Basque Country between France and Spain, and England). Welles served as host and interviewer, his commentary including documentary facts and his own personal observations (a technique he would continue to explore in later works).\n\nIn 1956, Welles completed \"Portrait of Gina\". The film cans would remain in a lost-and-found locker at the hotel for several decades, where they were discovered after Welles's death.\n\nIn 1956, Welles returned to Hollywood.\n\nHe began filming a projected pilot for Desilu, owned by Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz, who had recently purchased the former RKO studios. The film was \"The Fountain of Youth\", based on a story by John Collier. Originally deemed not viable as a pilot, the film was not aired until 1958—and won the Peabody Award for excellence.\n\nWelles guest starred on television shows including \"I Love Lucy\". On radio, he was narrator of \"Tomorrow\" (October 17, 1956), a nuclear holocaust drama produced and syndicated by ABC and the Federal Civil Defense Administration.\n\nWelles's next feature film role was in \"Man in the Shadow\" for Universal Pictures in 1957, starring Jeff Chandler.\n\nWelles stayed on at Universal to direct (and co-star with) Charlton Heston in the 1958 film \"Touch of Evil\", based on Whit Masterson's novel \"Badge of Evil\". Originally only hired as an actor, Welles was promoted to director by Universal Studios at the insistence of Charlton Heston. The film reunited many actors and technicians with whom Welles had worked in Hollywood in the 1940s, including cameraman Russell Metty (\"The Stranger\"), makeup artist Maurice Seiderman (\"Citizen Kane\"), and actors Joseph Cotten, Marlene Dietrich and Akim Tamiroff. Filming proceeded smoothly, with Welles finishing on schedule and on budget, and the studio bosses praising the daily rushes. Nevertheless, after the end of production, the studio re-edited the film, re-shot scenes, and shot new exposition scenes to clarify the plot. Welles wrote a 58-page memo outlining suggestions and objections, stating that the film was no longer his version—it was the studio's, but as such, he was still prepared to help with it.\n\nIn 1978, a longer preview version of the film was discovered and released.\n\nAs Universal reworked \"Touch of Evil\", Welles began filming his adaptation of Miguel de Cervantes' novel \"Don Quixote\" in Mexico, starring Mischa Auer as Quixote and Akim Tamiroff as Sancho Panza.\n\nHe continued shooting \"Don Quixote\" in Spain and Italy, but replaced Mischa Auer with Francisco Reiguera, and resumed acting jobs.\nIn Italy in 1959, Welles directed his own scenes as King Saul in Richard Pottier's film \"David and Goliath\". In Hong Kong he co-starred with Curt Jürgens in Lewis Gilbert's film \"Ferry to Hong Kong\". In 1960, in Paris he co-starred in Richard Fleischer's film \"Crack in the Mirror\". In Yugoslavia he starred in Richard Thorpe's film \"The Tartars\" and Veljko Bulajić's \"Battle of Neretva\".\n\nThroughout the 1960s, filming continued on \"Quixote\" on-and-off until the end of the decade, as Welles evolved the concept, tone and ending several times. Although he had a complete version of the film shot and edited at least once, he would continue toying with the editing well into the 1980s, he never completed a version film he was fully satisfied with, and would junk existing footage and shoot new footage. (In one case, he had a complete cut ready in which Quixote and Sancho Panza end up going to the moon, but he felt the ending was rendered obsolete by the 1969 moon landings, and burned 10 reels of this version.) As the process went on, Welles gradually voiced all of the characters himself and provided narration. In 1992, the director Jesús Franco constructed a film out of the portions of \"Quixote\" left behind by Welles. Some of the film stock had decayed badly. While the Welles footage was greeted with interest, the post-production by Franco was met with harsh criticism.\nIn 1961, Welles directed \"In the Land of Don Quixote\", a series of eight half-hour episodes for the Italian television network RAI. Similar to the \"Around the World with Orson Welles\" series, they presented travelogues of Spain and included Welles's wife, Paola, and their daughter, Beatrice. Though Welles was fluent in Italian, the network was not interested in him providing Italian narration because of his accent, and the series sat unreleased until 1964, by which time the network had added Italian narration of its own. Ultimately, versions of the episodes were released with the original musical score Welles had approved, but without the narration.\n\nIn 1962, Welles directed his adaptation of \"The Trial\", based on the novel by Franz Kafka and produced by Michael and Alexander Salkind. The cast included Anthony Perkins as Josef K, Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Paola Mori and Akim Tamiroff. While filming exteriors in Zagreb, Welles was informed that the Salkinds had run out of money, meaning that there could be no set construction. No stranger to shooting on found locations, Welles soon filmed the interiors in the Gare d'Orsay, at that time an abandoned railway station in Paris. Welles thought the location possessed a \"Jules Verne modernism\" and a melancholy sense of \"waiting\", both suitable for Kafka. To remain in the spirit of Kafka Welles set up the cutting room together with the Film Editor, Frederick Muller (as Fritz Muller), in the old un-used, cold, depressing, station master office. The film failed at the box-office. Peter Bogdanovich would later observe that Welles found the film riotously funny. Welles also told a BBC interviewer that it was his best film. While filming \"The Trial\" Welles met Oja Kodar, who later became his mistress and collaborator for the last 20 years of his life.\n\nWelles played a film director in \"La Ricotta\" (1963), Pier Paolo Pasolini's segment of the \"Ro.Go.Pa.G.\" movie, although his renowned voice was dubbed by Italian writer Giorgio Bassani. He continued taking what work he could find acting, narrating or hosting other people's work, and began filming \"Chimes at Midnight\", which was completed in 1966.\n\nFilmed in Spain, \"Chimes at Midnight\" was based on Welles's play, \"Five Kings\", in which he drew material from six Shakespeare plays to tell the story of Sir John Falstaff (Welles) and his relationship with Prince Hal (Keith Baxter). The cast includes John Gielgud, Jeanne Moreau, Fernando Rey and Margaret Rutherford; the film's narration, spoken by Ralph Richardson, is taken from the chronicler Raphael Holinshed. Welles held the film in high regard: \"It's my favorite picture, yes. If I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up.\"\n\nIn 1966, Welles directed a film for French television, an adaptation of \"The Immortal Story\", by Karen Blixen. Released in 1968, it stars Jeanne Moreau, Roger Coggio and Norman Eshley. The film had a successful run in French theaters. At this time Welles met Oja Kodar again, and gave her a letter he had written to her and had been keeping for four years; they would not be parted again. They immediately began a collaboration both personal and professional. The first of these was an adaptation of Blixen's \"The Heroine\", meant to be a companion piece to \"The Immortal Story\" and starring Kodar. Unfortunately, funding disappeared after one day's shooting. After completing this film, he appeared in a brief cameo as Cardinal Wolsey in Fred Zinnemann's adaptation of \"A Man for All Seasons\"—a role for which he won considerable acclaim.\nIn 1967, Welles began directing \"The Deep\", based on the novel \"Dead Calm\" by Charles Williams and filmed off the shore of Yugoslavia. The cast included Jeanne Moreau, Laurence Harvey and Kodar. Personally financed by Welles and Kodar, they could not obtain the funds to complete the project, and it was abandoned a few years later after the death of Harvey. The surviving footage was eventually edited and released by the Filmmuseum München. In 1968 Welles began filming a TV special for CBS under the title \"Orson's Bag\", combining travelogue, comedy skits and a condensation of Shakespeare's play \"The Merchant of Venice\" with Welles as Shylock. In 1969 Welles called again the Film Editor Frederick Muller to work with him re-editing the material and they set up cutting rooms at the Safa Palatino Studios in Rome. Funding for the show sent by CBS to Welles in Switzerland was seized by the IRS. Without funding, the show was not completed. The surviving film clips portions were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.\n\nIn 1969, Welles authorized the use of his name for a cinema in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Orson Welles Cinema remained in operation until 1986, with Welles making a personal appearance there in 1977. Also in 1969 he played a supporting role in John Huston's \"The Kremlin Letter\". Drawn by the numerous offers he received to work in television and films, and upset by a tabloid scandal reporting his affair with Kodar, Welles abandoned the editing of \"Don Quixote\" and moved back to America in 1970.\n\nWelles returned to Hollywood, where he continued to self-finance his film and television projects. While offers to act, narrate and host continued, Welles also found himself in great demand on television talk shows. He made frequent appearances for Dick Cavett, Johnny Carson, Dean Martin and Merv Griffin.\n\nWelles's primary focus during his final years was \"The Other Side of the Wind\", an unfinished project that was filmed intermittently between 1970 and 1976. Written by Welles, it is the story of an aging film director (John Huston) looking for funds to complete his final film. The cast includes Peter Bogdanovich, Susan Strasberg, Norman Foster, Edmond O'Brien, Cameron Mitchell and Dennis Hopper. Financed by Iranian backers, ownership of the film fell into a legal quagmire after the Shah of Iran was deposed. While there have been several reports of all the legal disputes concerning ownership of the film being settled, enough disputes still exist to prevent its release.\nWelles portrayed Louis XVIII of France in the 1970 film \"Waterloo\", and narrated the beginning and ending scenes of the historical comedy \"Start the Revolution Without Me\" (1970).\n\nIn 1971, Welles directed a short adaptation of \"Moby-Dick\", a one-man performance on a bare stage, reminiscent of his 1955 stage production \"Moby Dick—Rehearsed\". Never completed, it was eventually released by the Filmmuseum München. He also appeared in \"Ten Days' Wonder\", co-starring with Anthony Perkins and directed by Claude Chabrol, based on a detective novel by Ellery Queen. That same year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave him an honorary award \"For superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures\". Welles pretended to be out of town and sent John Huston to claim the award, thanking the Academy on film. Huston criticized the Academy for awarding Welles, even while they refused to give Welles any work.\n\nIn 1972, Welles acted as on-screen narrator for the film documentary version of Alvin Toffler's 1970 book \"Future Shock\". Working again for a British producer, Welles played Long John Silver in director John Hough's \"Treasure Island\" (1972), an adaptation of the Robert Louis Stevenson novel, which had been the second story broadcast by \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" in 1938. This was the last time he played the lead role in a major film. Welles also contributed to the script, his writing credit was attributed to the pseudonym 'O. W. Jeeves'. In some versions of the film Welles's original recorded dialog was redubbed by Robert Rietty.\n\nIn 1973, Welles completed \"F for Fake\", a personal essay film about art forger Elmyr de Hory and the biographer Clifford Irving. Based on an existing documentary by François Reichenbach, it included new material with Oja Kodar, Joseph Cotten, Paul Stewart and William Alland. An excerpt of Welles's 1930s \"War of the Worlds\" broadcast was recreated for this film; however, none of the dialogue heard in the film actually matches what was originally broadcast. Welles filmed a five-minute trailer, rejected in the U.S., that featured several shots of a topless Kodar.\n\nWelles hosted a British syndicated anthology series, \"Orson Welles's Great Mysteries\", during the 1973–74 television season. His brief introductions to the 26 half-hour episodes were shot in July 1973 by Gary Graver. The year 1974 also saw Welles lending his voice for that year's remake of Agatha Christie's classic thriller \"Ten Little Indians\" produced by his former associate, Harry Alan Towers and starring an international cast that included Oliver Reed, Elke Sommer and Herbert Lom.\n\nIn 1975, Welles narrated the documentary \"\", focusing on Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1940s. Also in 1975, the American Film Institute presented Welles with its third Lifetime Achievement Award (the first two going to director John Ford and actor James Cagney). At the ceremony, Welles screened two scenes from the nearly finished \"The Other Side of the Wind\".\n\nIn 1976, Paramount Television purchased the rights for the entire set of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe stories for Orson Welles. Welles had once wanted to make a series of Nero Wolfe movies, but Rex Stout—who was leery of Hollywood adaptations during his lifetime after two disappointing 1930s films—turned him down. Paramount planned to begin with an ABC-TV movie and hoped to persuade Welles to continue the role in a mini-series. Frank D. Gilroy was signed to write the television script and direct the TV movie on the assurance that Welles would star, but by April 1977 Welles had bowed out. In 1980 the Associated Press reported \"the distinct possibility\" that Welles would star in a Nero Wolfe TV series for NBC television. Again, Welles bowed out of the project due to creative differences and William Conrad was cast in the role.\n\nIn 1979, Welles completed his documentary \"Filming Othello\", which featured Michael MacLiammoir and Hilton Edwards. Made for West German television, it was also released in theaters. That same year, Welles completed his self-produced pilot for \"The Orson Welles Show\" television series, featuring interviews with Burt Reynolds, Jim Henson and Frank Oz and guest-starring the Muppets and Angie Dickinson. Unable to find network interest, the pilot was never broadcast. Also in 1979, Welles appeared in the biopic \"The Secret of Nikola Tesla\", and a cameo in \"The Muppet Movie\" as Lew Lord.\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s, Welles participated in a series of famous television commercial advertisements. For two years he was on-camera spokesman for the Paul Masson Vineyards, and sales grew by one third during the time Welles intoned what became a popular catchphrase: \"We will sell no wine before its time.\" He was also the voice behind the long-running Carlsberg \"Probably the best lager in the world\" campaign, promoted Domecq sherry on British television and provided narration on adverts for Findus, though the actual adverts have been overshadowed by a famous blooper reel of voice recordings, known as the Frozen Peas reel. He also did commercials for the Preview Subscription Television Service seen on stations around the country including WCLQ/Cleveland, KNDL/St. Louis and WSMW/Boston. As money ran short, he began directing commercials to make ends meet, including the famous British \"Follow the Bear\" commercials for Hofmeister lager.\n\nIn 1981, Welles hosted the documentary \"The Man Who Saw Tomorrow\", about Renaissance-era prophet Nostradamus. In 1982, the BBC broadcast \"The Orson Welles Story\" in the \"Arena\" series. Interviewed by Leslie Megahey, Welles examined his past in great detail, and several people from his professional past were interviewed as well. It was reissued in 1990 as \"With Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film\". Welles provided narration for the tracks \"Defender\" from Manowar's 1987 album \"Fighting the World\" and \"Dark Avenger\" on their 1982 album, \"Battle Hymns\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, Welles worked on such film projects as \"The Dreamers\", based on two stories by Isak Dinesen and starring Oja Kodar, and \"Orson Welles' Magic Show\", which reused material from his failed TV pilot. Another project he worked on was \"Filming The Trial\", the second in a proposed series of documentaries examining his feature films. While much was shot for these projects, none of them was completed. All of them were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.\n\nIn 1984, Welles narrated the short-lived television series \"Scene of the Crime\". During the early years of \"Magnum, P.I.\", Welles was the voice of the unseen character Robin Masters, a famous writer and playboy. Welles's death forced this minor character to largely be written out of the series. In an oblique homage to Welles, the \"Magnum, P.I.\" producers ambiguously concluded that story arc by having one character accuse another of having hired an actor to portray Robin Masters. He also, in this penultimate year released a music single, titled \"I Know What It Is To Be Young (But You Don't Know What It Is To Be Old)\", which he recorded under Italian label Compagnia Generale del Disco. The song was performed with the Nick Perito Orchestra and the Ray Charles Singers and produced by Jerry Abbott (father of guitarist \"Dimebag Darrell\" Abbott).\n\nThe last film roles before Welles's death included voice work in the animated films \"Enchanted Journey\" (1984) and \"\" (1986), in which he played the planet-eating robot Unicron. His last film appearance was in Henry Jaglom's 1987 independent film \"Someone to Love\", released after his death but produced before his voice-over in \"Transformers: The Movie\". His last television appearance was on the television show \"Moonlighting\". He recorded an introduction to an episode entitled \"The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice\", which was partially filmed in black and white. The episode aired five days after his death and was dedicated to his memory.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Henry Jaglom taped lunch conversations with Welles at Los Angeles's Ma Maison as well as in New York. Edited transcripts of these sessions appear in Peter Biskind's 2013 book \"My Lunches With Orson: Conversations Between Henry Jaglom and Orson Welles\".\n\nOrson Welles and Chicago-born actress and socialite Virginia Nicolson (1916–1996) were married on November 14, 1934. The couple separated in December 1939, and were divorced on February 1, 1940. After bearing with Welles's romances in New York, Virginia had learned that Welles had fallen in love with Mexican actress Dolores del Río.\n\nInfatuated with her since adolescence, Welles met del Río at Darryl Zanuck's ranch soon after he moved to Hollywood in 1939. Their relationship was kept secret until 1941, when del Río filed for divorce from her second husband. They openly appeared together in New York while Welles was directing the Mercury stage production, \"Native Son\". They acted together in the movie \"Journey into Fear\" (1943). Their relationship came to an end, among other things, due to the infidelities of Welles. Del Río returned to México in 1943, shortly before Welles married Rita Hayworth.\n\nWelles married Rita Hayworth on September 7, 1943. They were divorced on November 10, 1947. During his last interview, recorded for \"The Merv Griffin Show\" on the evening before his death, Welles called Hayworth \"one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived … and we were a long time together—I was lucky enough to have been with her longer than any of the other men in her life.\"\n\nIn 1955, Welles married actress Paola Mori (née Countess Paola di Girifalco), an Italian aristocrat who starred as Raina Arkadin in his 1955 film, \"Mr. Arkadin\". The couple began a passionate affair, and they were married at her parents' insistence. They were wed in London May 8, 1955, and never divorced.\n\nCroatian-born artist and actress Oja Kodar became Welles's longtime companion both personally and professionally from 1966 onward, and they lived together for some of the last 20 years of his life.\n\nWelles had three daughters from his marriages: Christopher Welles Feder (born March 27, 1938, with Virginia Nicolson); Rebecca Welles Manning (December 17, 1944 – October 17, 2004, with Rita Hayworth); and Beatrice Welles (born November 13, 1955, with Paola Mori).\n\nWelles is thought to have had a son, British director Michael Lindsay-Hogg (born May 5, 1940), with Irish actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, then the wife of Sir Edward Lindsay-Hogg, 4th baronet. When Lindsay-Hogg was 16 his mother reluctantly divulged that there were pervasive rumors that his father was Welles, and she denied them—but in such detail that he doubted her veracity. Fitzgerald evaded the subject for the rest of her life. Lindsay-Hogg knew Welles, worked with him in the theatre and met him at intervals throughout Welles's life. After he learned that Welles's oldest daughter Chris, his childhood playmate, had long suspected that he was her brother, Lindsay-Hogg initiated a DNA test that proved inconclusive. In his 2011 autobiography Lindsay-Hogg reported that his questions were resolved by his mother's close friend Gloria Vanderbilt, who wrote that Fitzgerald had told her that Welles was his father. A 2015 Welles biography by Patrick McGilligan, however, reports the impossibility of Welles's paternity: Fitzgerald left the U.S. for Ireland in May 1939 and her son was conceived before her return in late October, while Welles did not travel overseas during that period.\n\nAfter the death of Rebecca Welles Manning, a man named Marc McKerrow was revealed to be her son, and therefore the direct descendant of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth. McKerrow's reactions to the revelation and his meeting with Oja Kodar are documented in the 2008 film \"Prodigal Sons\". McKerrow died on June 18, 2010.\n\nDespite an urban legend promoted by Welles, he was not related to Abraham Lincoln's wartime Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles. The myth dates back to the first newspaper feature ever written about Welles—\"Cartoonist, Actor, Poet and only 10\"—in the February 19, 1926, issue of \"The Capital Times\". The article falsely states that he was descended from \"Gideon Welles, who was a member of President Lincoln's cabinet\". As presented by Charles Higham in a genealogical chart that introduces his 1985 biography of Welles, Orson Welles's father was Richard Head Welles (born Wells), son of Richard Jones Wells, son of Henry Hill Wells (who had an uncle named Gideon \"Wells\"), son of William Hill Wells, son of Richard Wells (1734–1801).\n\nPeter Noble's 1956 biography describes Welles as \"a magnificent figure of a man, over six feet tall, handsome, with flashing eyes and a gloriously resonant speaking-voice\". Welles said that a voice specialist once told him he was born to be a heldentenor, a heroic tenor, but that when he was young and working at the Gate Theatre in Dublin he forced his voice down into a bass-baritone.\n\nEven as a baby Welles was prone to illness, including diphtheria, measles, whooping cough and malaria. From infancy he suffered from asthma, sinus headaches, and backache that was later found to be caused by congenital anomalies of the spine. Foot and ankle trouble throughout his life was the result of flat feet. \"As he grew older,\" Brady wrote, \"his ill health was exacerbated by the late hours he was allowed to keep [and] an early penchant for alcohol and tobacco\".\n\nIn 1928, at age 13, Welles was already more than six feet tall and weighed over 180 pounds. His passport recorded his height as six feet three inches, with brown hair and green eyes.\n\n\"Crash diets, drugs, and corsets had slimmed him for his early film roles,\" wrote biographer Barton Whaley. \"Then always back to\ngargantuan consumption of high-caloric food and booze. By summer 1949, when he was 34, his weight had crept up to a stout 230 pounds. In 1953 he ballooned from 250 to 275 pounds. After 1960 he remained permanently obese.\"\n\nWhen Peter Bogdanovich once asked him about his religion, Orson Welles gruffly replied that it was none of his business, then misinformed him that he was raised Catholic.\n\nAlthough the Welles family was no longer devout, it was fourth-generation Protestant Episcopalian and, before that, Quaker and Puritan. Welles's earliest paternal forebear in America, Richard Wells, was a leader of the Quaker community in Pennsylvania. His earliest maternal ancestor in America was John Alden, a crew member on the Pilgrim ship \"Mayflower\".\n\nThe funeral of Welles's father Richard H. Welles was Episcopalian.\n\nIn April 1982, when interviewer Merv Griffin asked him about his religious beliefs, Welles replied, \"I try to be a Christian. I don't pray really, because I don't want to bore God.\" Near the end of his life Welles was dining at Ma Maison, his favorite restaurant in Los Angeles, when proprietor Patrick Terrail conveyed an invitation from the head of the Greek Orthodox Church, who asked Welles to be his guest of honor at divine liturgy at Saint Sophia Cathedral. Welles replied, \"Please tell him I really appreciate that offer, but I am an atheist.\"\n\n\"Orson never joked or teased about the religious beliefs of others,\" wrote biographer Barton Whaley. \"He accepted it as a cultural artifact, suitable for the births, deaths, and marriages of strangers and even some friends—but without emotional or intellectual meaning for himself.\"\n\nWelles was politically active from the beginning of his career. He remained aligned with the left throughout his life, and always defined his political orientation as \"progressive\". He was a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, and often spoke out on radio in support of progressive politics. He campaigned heavily for Roosevelt in the 1944 election.\n\n\"During a White House dinner,\" Welles recalled in a 1983 conversation with his friend Roger Hill, \"when I was campaigning for Roosevelt, in a toast, with considerable tongue in cheek, he said, 'Orson, you and I are the two greatest actors alive today.' In private that evening, and on several other occasions, he urged me to run for a Senate seat either in California or Wisconsin. He wasn't alone.\"\n\nFor several years, he wrote a newspaper column on political issues and considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1946, representing his home state of Wisconsin—a seat that was ultimately won by Joseph McCarthy.\n\nWelles's name and political activities are reported on pages 155–157 of Red Channels, the anti-Communist publication that, in part, fueled the already flourishing Hollywood Blacklist. He was in Europe during the height of the Red Scare, thereby adding one more reason for the Hollywood establishment to ostracize him.\n\nIn 1970, Welles narrated (but did not write) a satirical political record on the administration of President Richard Nixon titled \"The Begatting of the President\".\n\nHe was also an outspoken critic of racism in the United States and the practice of segregation.\n\nOn the evening of October 9, 1985, Welles recorded his final interview on the syndicated TV program, \"The Merv Griffin Show\", appearing with biographer Barbara Leaming. \"Both Welles and Leaming talked of Welles's life and the segment was a nostalgic interlude,\" wrote biographer Frank Brady. Welles returned to his house in Hollywood and worked into the early hours typing stage directions for the project he and Gary Graver were planning to shoot at UCLA the following day. Welles died sometime on the morning of October 10, following a heart attack. He was found by his chauffeur at around 10 a.m.; the first of Welles's friends to arrive was Paul Stewart.\n\nWelles was cremated by prior agreement with the executor of his estate, Greg Garrison, whose advice about making lucrative TV appearances in the 1970s made it possible for Welles to pay off a portion of the taxes he owed the IRS. A brief private funeral was attended by Paola Mori and Welles's three daughters—the first time they had ever been together. Only a few close friends were invited: Garrison, Graver, Roger Hill and Prince Alessandro Tasca di Cuto. Chris Welles Feder later described the funeral as an awful experience.\n\nA public memorial tribute took place November 2, 1985, at the Directors Guild of America Theater in Los Angeles. Host Peter Bogdanovich introduced speakers including Charles Champlin, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Greg Garrison, Charlton Heston, Roger Hill, Henry Jaglom, Arthur Knight, Oja Kodar, Barbara Leaming, Janet Leigh, Norman Lloyd, Dan O'Herlihy, Patrick Terrail and Robert Wise.\n\n\"I know what his feelings were regarding his death,\" Joseph Cotten later wrote. \"He did not want a funeral; he wanted to be buried quietly in a little place in Spain. He wanted no memorial services ...\" Cotten declined to attend the memorial program; instead he sent a short message, ending with the last two lines of a Shakespeare sonnet that Welles had sent him on his most recent birthday:\n\nBut if the while I think on thee, dear friend,All losses are restored and sorrows end.\n\nIn 1987 the ashes of Welles and Mori (killed in a 1986 car crash) were taken to Ronda, Spain, and buried in an old well covered by flowers on the rural estate of a longtime friend, bullfighter Antonio Ordóñez.\n\nWelles's reliance on self-production meant that many of his later projects were filmed piecemeal or were not completed. Welles financed his later projects through his own fundraising activities. He often also took on other work to obtain money to fund his own films.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Welles began work on \"Don Quixote\", initially a commission from CBS television. Welles expanded the film to feature length, developing the screenplay to take Quixote and Sancho Panza into the modern age. Filming stopped with the death of Francisco Reiguera, the actor playing Quixote, in 1969. Orson Welles continued editing the film into the early 1970s. At the time of his death, the film remained largely a collection of footage in various states of editing. The project and more importantly Welles's conception of the project changed radically over time. A version of the film was created from available fragments in 1992 and released to a very negative reception.\n\nA version Oja Kodar supervised, with help from Jess Franco, assistant director during production, was released in 2008 to mixed reactions.\n\nFrederick Muller — the film editor for The \"Trial\", \"Chimes at Midnight\" and the CBS Special \"Orson Bag\" was fortunate to work on editing three reels of the original, unadulterated version — was asked for his opinion in 2013 from a journalist of Time Out, his reply was he felt that if released without image re-editing, but with the addition of \"ad hoc\" sound and music, it probably would have been rather successful.\n\nIn 1969, Welles was given another TV commission to film a condensed adaptation of \"The Merchant of Venice\". Although Welles had actually completed the film by 1970, the finished negative was later mysteriously stolen from his Rome production office. A restored and reconstructed version of the film, made by using the original script and composer's notes, premiered at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival alongside \"Othello\" as part of the pre-opening ceremonies in 2015.\n\nIn 1970, Welles began shooting \"The Other Side of the Wind\". The film relates the efforts of a film director (played by John Huston) to complete his last Hollywood picture and is largely set at a lavish party. By 1972 the filming was reported by Welles as being \"96% complete\", though it is likely that Welles had only edited about 40 minutes of the film by 1979. In that year, legal complications over the ownership of the film forced the negative into a Paris vault. In 2004 director Peter Bogdanovich, who acted in the film, announced his intention to complete the production. As of 2009, legal complications over the Welles estate had kept the film from being finished or released.\n\nOn October 28, 2014, the Los Angeles-based production company Royal Road Entertainment announced that it had negotiated an agreement, with the assistance of producer Frank Marshall, and would purchase the rights to complete and release \"The Other Side of the Wind\". Bogdanovich and Marshall will complete Welles's nearly finished film in Los Angeles, aiming to have it ready for screening May 6, 2015, the 100th anniversary of Welles's birth. Royal Road Entertainment and German producer Jens Koethner Kaul acquired the rights held by Les Films de l'Astrophore and the late Mehdi Boushehri. They reached an agreement with Oja Kodar, who inherited Welles's ownership of the film, and Beatrice Welles, manager of the Welles estate; but at the end of 2015, efforts to complete the film were at an impasse.\n\nIn March 2017, Netflix acquired distribution rights to the film. That same month, the original negative, dallies and other footage arrived in Los Angeles, thus resuming the post-production process.\n\nSome footage is included in the documentaries \"Working with Orson Welles\" (1993) and \"Orson Welles: One Man Band\" (1995).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Black dress of Rita Hayworth\n\nIn the 1946 film \"Gilda\", Rita Hayworth wore a black dress made by American costume designer Jean Louis. It was used in one of the most famous scenes of the film: one in which the character of Gilda sings the song \"Put the Blame on Mame\", improvising a quick striptease, choreographed by Jack Cole. The dress has helped consolidate the image of the \"femme fatale\", as well as being universally recognized as an icon of fashion and cinema. \"The Independent\" named it as one of the Ten Best Fashion Moments in Film.\n\nJean Louis, Columbia Pictures costume designer, collaborated with the actress Rita Hayworth in nine films from the 1945 until 1959. Louis is considered \"an essential ingredient in the formula that created the image of Rita Hayworth\".\n\nTo create clothes for Gilda, Jean Louis was inspired by \"Portrait of Madame X\", the famous socialite in Paris. According to \"Life\" magazine, the wardrobe designed by Jean Louis for Rita Hayworth had a value of about $60,000, a large figure for the time. The dress was said to illustrate that \"extreme sexuality\" in women, hot or cold, is a recipe for catastrophe.\n\nIn 1946, the image of Rita Hayworth in the Gilda black dress was imprinted on the first nuclear bomb to be tested after the Second World War, as part of Operation Crossroads. \nThe bomb, nicknamed \"Gilda\", was decorated with a photograph of Hayworth cut from the June 1946 issue of \"Esquire\" magazine. Above it was stenciled \"Gilda\" in two-inch black letters.\n\nIn April 2009, the dress was to be sold at the auction of the Forrest J. Ackerman estate. In the description of the lot it was specified that the dress still had the label \"property of Columbia Pictures\" and \"Rita Hayworth\" sewn inside. The initial price was estimated between $30,000 and $50,000, but the lot was withdrawn before it reached the auction. Later, in September 2009, the dress appeared mysteriously in an auction on eBay with a starting price of $30,000.\n\nThe famous scene with the black dress has been referenced in numerous films. One of the most remembered is a parody sung by Jessica Rabbit in the Disney film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", in which the character performs \"Why Don't You Do Right?\" in the style of Rita Hayworth in Gilda. For the 23rd \"James Bond\" film \"Skyfall\" (2012), costume designer Jany Temime referenced the black dress while creating an outfit for Bond girl Sévérine.\n\nThe strapless dress is a sheath in black satin with a straight neckline, leaving the shoulders bare. The dress is long and side-slit down to the ground. In the scene in the film \"Gilda\" in which it appears, the dress is paired with a pair of satin long gloves worn up to Hayworth's shoulders. The glove fabric is identical to the dress fabric; not made from cheaper stretch satin. \n\nTo be able to wear the dress, Hayworth had to wear a corset, because just a few months before she had given birth to her daughter, Rebecca, and had not yet regained her pre-pregnancy figure. In addition to the dress, Jean Louis made a harness, worn under the dress. The harness consisted of rigging—one under the breast, one in the middle and one on the side. In addition, the soft plastic had been molded around the top of the skirt.\n"

                "Border Collie\n\nThe Border Collie is a working and herding dog breed developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region for herding livestock, especially sheep. It was specifically bred for intelligence and obedience.\n\nConsidered highly intelligent, extremely energetic, acrobatic and athletic, they frequently compete with great success in sheepdog trials and dog sports. They are often cited as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs. Border Collies continue to be employed in their traditional work of herding livestock throughout the world.\n\nIn general, Border Collies are medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is most often thick and sheds often. They have a double coat that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. While black and white is the most commonly seen colour pattern of the Border Collie, the breed appears in just about any colour and pattern known to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolour (black/tan/white), liver and white, and red tricolour (red/tan/white) which have also been seen regularly, and other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. Some Border Collies may also have single-colour coats.\n\nEye colour varies from brown to blue, and occasionally eyes of differing colour occur; this is usually seen with merles. The ears of the Border Collie are also variable — some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect ears (similar to those of the rough Collie). Although working Border Collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general a dog's appearance is considered by the American Border Collie Association to be irrelevant. It is considered much more useful to identify a working Border Collie by its attitude and ability than by its looks.\n\nDogs bred for show are more homogeneous in appearance than working Border Collies, since to win in conformation showing they must conform closely to breed club standards that are specific on many points of the structure, coat, and colour. Kennel clubs specify, for example, that the Border Collie must have a \"keen and intelligent\" expression, and that the preferred eye colour is dark brown. In deference to the dog's working origin, scars and broken teeth received in the line of duty are not to be counted against a Border Collie in the show ring. The males' height from withers comes from , females from .\n\nBorder Collies require considerably more daily physical exercise and mental stimulation than many other breeds. The Border Collie is an intelligent dog breed; in fact, it is widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed. Although the primary role of the Border Collie is to herd livestock, this breed is becoming increasingly popular as a companion animal.\n\nIn this role, due to their working heritage, Border Collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic. They thrive best in households that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many Border Collies develop problematic behaviours in households that are not able to provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls, furniture such as chairs and table legs, destructive scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border Collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs. The breed's herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, as it was in the dogs from which the Border Collie was developed, by selective breeding for many generations. However, being eminently trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialisation training.\n\nBefore taking on the breed as a household pet, potential owners should be sure they can provide regular exercise commensurate with the collie's high energy and prodigious stamina. A working collie may run many miles a day, using its experience, personality and intelligence to control challenging livestock, and these dogs will be distressed and frustrated if left in isolation, ignored or inactive. \nLike many working breeds, Border Collies can be motion-sensitive and may chase moving vehicles and bicycles, but this behaviour can be modified by training. Some of the more difficult behaviours require patience, as they are developmental and may disappear as the dog matures.\n\nThe natural life span of the Border Collie is between 10 and 14 years, with an average lifespan of 12 years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are usually 12 to 13 years.\n\nLeading causes of death are cancer (23.6%), old age (17.9%) and cerebral vascular afflictions (9.4%).\n\nHip dysplasia, Collie eye anomaly (CEA), and epilepsy are considered the primary genetic diseases of concern in the breed at this time. CEA is a congenital, inherited eye disease involving the retina, choroid, and sclera that sometimes affects Border Collies. In Border Collies, it is generally a mild disease and rarely significantly impairs vision. However, other eye conditions such as PRA slowly disintegrates the retina and can cause Border Collies to lose almost all of their vision at night which can progress into complete daytime blindness. There is now a DNA test available for CEA and, through its use, breeders can ensure that they will not produce affected pups. There are different types of hip testing available including OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) and PennHip. Radiographs are taken and sent to these organizations to determine a dog's hip and elbow quality.\n\nTwo types of hearing loss occur in the breed. The first type is pigment associated and is found in Border Collie puppies, although the puppies can have congenital sensorineural deafness from birth as well. The second type is known as adult onset hearing loss. These dogs have a normal auditory brainstem response test as pups but gradually lose their hearing some time between one and eight years of age. A study is currently underway at The Translational Genomics Research Institute to identify the genetic cause of adult onset hearing loss in the breed.\n\nNeuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a rare but serious disease that is limited to show Border Collies. NCL results in severe neurological impairment and early death; afflicted dogs rarely survive beyond two years of age. The mutation causing the form of the disease found in Border Collies was identified by Scott Melville in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no treatment or cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.\n\nTrapped Neutrophil Syndrome (TNS) is a hereditary disease in which the bone marrow produces neutrophils (white cells) but is unable to effectively release them into the bloodstream. Affected puppies have an impaired immune system and will eventually die from infections they cannot fight. The mutation responsible for TNS has been found in Border Collies in English working dogs, in show dogs that had originated in Australia and New Zealand, and in unrelated Australian working dogs. This indicates that the gene is widespread and probably as old as the breed itself. TNS was identified by Jeremy Shearman in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.\n\nOther diseases found less commonly include glaucoma, juvenile cataracts, osteochondritis, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus and canine cyclic neutropaenia, carpal soft-tissue injury. A syndrome of exercise induced collapse similar to that seen in Labrador Retrievers (otherwise termed Border Collie Collapse) and triggered by episodes of collapse associated with periods of intense exercise has been described in Border Collies in North America, Europe and Australia; and is currently the subject of further investigation.\n\nElbow dysplasia may also occur in the breed. Dogs homozygous for the merle gene, sometimes referred to as \"double merles\", are likely to have ocular and/or auditory defects.\n\nThe Border Collie is descended from landrace collies, a type found widely in the British Isles. The name for the breed came from its probable place of origin along the Anglo-Scottish border. Mention of the \"Collie\" or \"Colley\" type first appeared toward the end of the 19th century, although the word \"collie\" is older than this and has its origin in the Scots language. It is also thought that the word 'collie' comes from the old Celtic word for useful. Many of the best Border Collies today can be traced back to a dog known as Old Hemp.\n\nIn 1915, James Reid, Secretary of the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) in the United Kingdom first used the term \"Border Collie\" to distinguish those dogs registered by the ISDS from the Kennel Club's Collie (or Scotch Collie, including the Rough Collie and Smooth Collie) which originally came from the same working stock but had developed a different, standardised appearance following introduction to the show ring in 1860 and mixture with different types breeds.\n\nOld Hemp, a tricolour dog, was born in Northumberland in September 1893 and died in May 1901. He was bred by Adam Telfer from Roy, a black and tan dog, and Meg, a black-coated, strong-eyed dog. Hemp was a quiet, powerful dog to which sheep responded easily. Many shepherds used him for stud and Hemp's working style became the Border Collie style. All pure Border Collies alive today can trace an ancestral line back to Old Hemp.\n\nWiston Cap (b. 28 September 1963)<ref name=\"http://db.kennel.dk/\"></ref> is the dog that the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) badge portrays in the characteristic Border Collie herding pose. He was a popular stud dog in the history of the breed, and his bloodline can be seen in most bloodlines of the modern day Collie. Bred by W. S. Hetherington and trained and handled by John Richardson, Cap was a biddable and good-natured dog. His bloodlines all trace back to the early registered dogs of the stud book, and to J. M. Wilson's Cap, whose name occurs 16 times within seven generations in his pedigree. Wiston Cap sired three Supreme Champions and is grand-sire of three others, one of whom was E. W. Edwards' Bill, who won the championship twice.\n\nCollies were listed as imports to New Zealand as early as 1858, but the type was not specified. In the late 1890s James Lilico (1861?–1945) of Christchurch, New Zealand, imported a number of working dogs from the United Kingdom. These included Hindhope Jed, a black, tan and white born in Hindhope, Scotland in 1895, as well as Maudie, Moss of Ancrum, Ness and Old Bob.\n\nIt is unclear whether Hindhope Jed was a descendant of Old Hemp. Born two years after him, she is mentioned in a \"British Hunts and Huntsmen\" article concerning a Mr John Elliot of Jedburgh:\n\nMr Elliot himself is well known for his breed of Collies. His father supplied Noble to the late Queen Victoria and it was from our subject that the McLeod got Hindhope Jed, now the champion of New Zealand and Australia.\n\nAt the time of her departure to New Zealand, Hindhope Jed was already in pup to \"Captain\", another of the then new \"Border\" strain. Hindhope Jed had won three trials in her native Scotland, and was considered to be the \"best to cross the equator\".\n\nIn 1901 the King and Mcleod stud, created by Charles Beechworth King (b. 1855, Murrumbidgee, NSW), his brother and Alec McLeod at Canonbar, near Nyngan (north-west of Sydney), brought Hindhope Jed to Australia, where she enjoyed considerable success at sheep dog trials.\n\nThere are two types of tests, or standards, to determine the breeding quality of a Border Collie: the original ISDS sheepdog trial and appearance.\n\nThe original test is the ISDS sheepdog trial. It is still used today, where a dog and handler collect groups of livestock and move them quietly around a course. There are certain standard elements to this test depending on the level: national or international. For both levels, sheep must be gathered as calmly as possible without being distressed. For a national competition, normally held between England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, trials run over a 400-yard course. International courses use a 400-yard course for the qualifying trials, but on the third and final day, trials are held in a course of 800 yards. The international test involves a \"double fetch\", where the sheepdog must gather 10 sheep from 800 yards away, bring them on an angle to the center of the field, and then be sent back in another direction to gather another 10 sheep, also placed 800 yards from the handler. Five of those 20 sheep will have collars on, and at the end of a triangular drive, the sheep are gathered into a circular \"shedding ring\" and the 15 sheep without collars driven away as the five collared sheep are kept inside the ring and then penned. Sheepdogs must be directed through obstacles at varying distance from the handler, and then the dog must demonstrate the ability to do work close at hand by penning the sheep and sorting them out.\n\nIn nearly every region of the world, the Border Collie is now also a breed which is shown in ring or bench shows. For the people who participate in these events, the Border Collie is defined by the breed standard, which is a description of how the dog should look. In New Zealand and Australia, where the breed has been shown throughout most of the twentieth century, the Border Collie standards have produced a dog with the longer double coat (smooth coats are allowed), a soft dark eye, a body slightly longer than tall, a well-defined stop, semi-pricked ears, as well as a gentle and friendly temperament. This style of Border Collie has become popular in winning show kennels around the world, as well as among prestigious judges. Breed standards state that its tail must be slightly curved and must stop at the hock. The fur must be lush. It should show good expression in its eyes, and must be intelligent. It is energetic with most commonly a black and white coat (sometimes brown). It should have a very strong herding instinct. \nAway from breed standards, short haired Border collie variants are also found, offering householders a less demanding task clearing year-round shed hair. Crossing collies with German Shepherd dogs produces a strong intelligent hybrid of intermediate size, popularly named a \"shollie\", used as a working dog with livestock and as an animal companion.\n\nOther enthusiasts oppose the use of Border Collies as show dogs, for fear that breeding for appearance will lead to a decline in the breed's working dog traits. Few handlers of working Border Collies participate in conformation shows, as working dogs are bred to a performance standard rather than appearance standard. Likewise, conformation-bred dogs are seldom seen on the sheepdog trial field, except in Kennel Club-sponsored events. Dogs registered with either working or conformation based registries are seen in other performance events such as agility, obedience, tracking or flyball; however, these dogs do not necessarily conform to the breed standard of appearance as closely as the dogs shown in the breed rings as this is not a requirement in performance events, nor do they necessarily participate in herding activities.\n\nIn the UK, there are two separate registries for Border Collies. The International Sheep Dog Society encourages breeding for herding ability, whereas the Kennel Club (UK) encourages breeding for a standardised appearance. The ISDS registry is by far the older of the two, and ISDS dogs are eligible for registration as pedigree Border Collies with the Kennel Club (KC) — but not vice versa. The only way for a Border Collie without an ISDS pedigree to be added to the ISDS registry is by proving its worth as a herding dog so that it can be Registered on Merit (ROM).\n\nOne of the principal registries for Border Collies in the United States is the American Border Collie Association (ABCA), which is dedicated to the preservation of the traditional working dog. The breed was also recognised in 1995 by the American Kennel Club (AKC) after occupying the AKC's Miscellaneous Class for over 50 years. The recognition was under protest from the majority of Border Collie affiliated groups, such as the United States Border Collie Club, which felt that emphasis on the breed's working skills would be lost under AKC recognition. AKC registrations have gradually increased since recognition and by the year 2004 there were 1,984 new AKC registrations of Border Collies, with a further 2,378 for the year 2005. By contrast, the American Border Collie Association registers approximately 20,000 Border Collies annually. Because of the inherent tension between the goals of breeding to a working standard and to an appearance standard, the American Border Collie Association voted in 2003 that dogs who attained a conformation championship would be delisted from the ABCA registry, regardless of ability. Cross-registration is allowed between the working registries, and AKC accepts dogs registered with ABCA and NASDS, but none of the working registries in the U.S. honors AKC pedigrees.\n\nIn Australia, Border Collies are registered with an Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) affiliated state control body or with a working dog registry. Between 2,011 and 2,701 ANKC pedigreed Border Collies have been registered with the ANKC each year since 1986. Inclusion on the ANKC affiliate's main register allows Border Collies to compete in conformation, obedience, agility, tracking, herding and other ANKC-sanctioned events held by an ANKC affiliated club, while inclusion on the limited register prohibits entry in conformation events. The ANKC provides a breed standard; however, this applies to conformation events only and has no influence on dogs entering in performance events. Non-ANKC pedigreed dogs may also be eligible for inclusion on an ANKC associate or sporting register and be able to compete in ANKC performance or herding events. Agility organisations such as the Agility Dog Association of Australia (ADAA) have their own registry which allows the inclusion of any dog wishing to compete in their events.\n\nIn Canada, Agriculture Canada has recognised the Canadian Border Collie Association as the registry under the Animal Pedigree Act for any Border Collie that is designated as \"Pure Breed\" in Canada.\n\nThe criteria used are based on herding lineage rather than appearance. It is a two-tiered registry in that dogs imported that are registered with a foreign Kennel Club that does hold conformation shows are given a \"B\" registration, whereas those that come directly from other working registries are placed on the \"A\" registry.\n\nRecently, the Canadian Kennel Club has polled its members to decide if Border Collies should be included on the CKC \"Miscellaneous List\". This designation would allow Border Collie owners the ability to compete in all CKC events, but the CKC would not be the registering body. People who compete in performance events support the move. The CBCA is against this designation.\n\nThe registration of working sheepdogs in South Africa is the responsibility of the South African Sheepdog Association. ISDS registered dogs imported into the country can be transferred onto the SASDA register. Dogs not registered can become eligible for registration by being awarded a certificate of working ability by a registered judge. Occasionally they will facilitate the testing of dogs used for breeding, for Hip dysplasia and Collie eye anomaly, to encourage the breeding of dogs without these genetic flaws.\n\nThe registration of working Border Collies in Turkey is the province of the Border Collie Dernegi (Turkish Border Collie Association) established in 2007.\n\nThe Border Collie breed is also recognised as the prime sheep dog by the International Stock Dog Federation (ISDF), based in Piccadilly, London, UK.\n\nBorder Collies are one of the most popular breeds for dog agility competitions. They also excel at competitive obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and USBCHA Sheepdog trials and herding events.\n\nWorking Border Collies can take direction by voice and by whistle at long distances when herding. Their great energy and herding instinct are still used to herd all kinds of animals, from the traditional sheep and cattle, to free range poultry, pigs, and ostriches. They are also used to remove unwanted wild birds from airport runways, golf courses, and other public and private areas.\n\nThe use of dogs for herding sheep makes good economic sense for many farmers. In a typical pasture environment each trained sheepdog will do the work of three humans. In vast arid areas like the Australian Outback or the Karoo Escarpment, the number increases to five or more. Attempts to replace them with mechanical approaches to herding have only achieved a limited amount of success. Thus, stock handlers find trained dogs more reliable and economical.\n\nShepherds in the UK have taken the most critical elements of herding and incorporated them into a sheepdog trial. The first recorded sheepdog trials were held in Bala, North Wales, in 1873. These competitions enable farmers and shepherds to evaluate possible mates for their working dogs, but they have developed a sport aspect as well, with competitors from outside the farming community also taking part.\n\nIn the USA, the national sanctioning body for these competitions is the USBCHA. In the UK it is the International Sheep Dog Society, in Canada the Canadian Border Collie Association (CBCA) and in South Africa it is the South African Sheepdog Association.\n\nBorder Collies excel at several dog sports in addition to their success in sheepdog trials. Because of the high instinct of herding, they are excellent at this sport. Herding instincts and trainability can be tested for when introduced to sheep or at noncompetitive instinct tests. Border Collies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in sheepdog trials and other herding events. They perform well at some higher jump heights at dog agility competitions, so much so that in England, competitions often include classes for ABC dogs, \"Anything But Collies\".\n\nThe Border Collie's speed, agility, and stamina have allowed them to dominate in dog activities like flyball and disc dog competitions. Their trainability has also given them a berth in dog dancing competitions.\n\nBorder Collies have a highly developed sense of smell and with their high drive make excellent and easily motivated tracking dogs for Tracking trials. These trials simulate the finding of a lost person in a controlled situation where the performance of the dog can be evaluated, with titles awarded for successful dogs.\n\n\n",
                "Herding dog\n\nA herding dog, also known as a stock dog or working dog, is a type of pastoral dog that either has been trained in herding or belongs to breeds developed for herding. Their ability to be trained to act on the sound of a whistle or word of command is renowned throughout the world. Collies are recommended as herding dogs.\n\nAll herding behavior is modified predatory behavior. Through selective breeding, humans have been able to minimize the dog's natural inclination to treat cattle and sheep as prey while simultaneously maintaining the dog's hunting skills, thereby creating an effective herding dog.\n\nDogs can work other animals in a variety of ways. Some breeds, such as the Australian Cattle Dog, typically nip at the heels of animals (for this reason they are called \"heelers\") and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi and the Pembroke Welsh Corgi were historically used in a similar fashion in the cattle droves that moved cattle from Wales to the Smithfield Meat Market in London but are rarely used for herding today.\n\nOther breeds, notably the Border Collie, get in front of the animals and use what is called \"strong eye\" to stare down the animals; they are known as \"headers\". The \"headers\" or fetching dogs keep livestock in a group. They consistently go to the front or head of the animals to turn or stop the animal's movement. The \"heelers\" or driving dogs keep pushing the animals forward. Typically, they stay behind the herd. The Australian Kelpie and Australian Koolie use both these methods and also run along the backs of sheep so are said to head, heel, and back. Other types such as the Australian Shepherd, English Shepherd and Welsh Sheepdog are \"moderate\" to \"loose eyed\", working more independently. The New Zealand Huntaway uses its loud, deep bark to muster mobs of sheep. Belgian Shepherds, German Shepherd Dogs and Briards are historically \"tending\" dogs, who act as a \"living fence,\" guiding large flocks of sheep to graze while preventing them from eating valuable crops and wandering onto roads.\n\nHerding instincts and trainability can be measured when introducing a dog to livestock or at noncompetitive herding tests. Individuals exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\nIn Australia, New Zealand and the United States herding dogs are known as \"working dogs\" irrespective of their breeding. Some herding breeds work well with any kind of animals; others have been bred for generations to work with specific kinds of animals and have developed physical characteristics or styles of working that enhance their ability to handle these animals. Commonly mustered animals include cattle, sheep, goats and reindeer, although it is not unusual for poultry to be handled by dogs.\n\nThe term \"herding dog\" is sometimes erroneously used to describe livestock guardian dogs, whose primary function is to guard flocks and herds from predation and theft, and they lack the herding instinct. Although herding dogs may guard flocks their primary purpose is to move them; both herding dogs and livestock guardian dogs may be called \"sheep dogs\".\n\nIn general terms when categorizing dog breeds, herding dogs are considered a subcategory of working dogs, but for conformation shows they usually form a separate group.\n\nAustralia has the world's largest cattle stations and sheep stations and some of the best-known herding dogs, such as the Koolie, Kelpie, Red and Blue Heelers are bred and found there.\n\nThe competitive dog sport in which herding dogs move animals around a field, fences, gates, or enclosures as directed by their handlers is called a \"sheepdog trial\", \"herding test\" or \"stockdog trial\" depending on the area. Such events are particularly associated with hill farming areas, where sheep range widely on largely unfenced land. These trials are popular in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Chile, Canada, the USA, Australia, New Zealand and other farming nations, and have occasionally even become primetime television fare.\n\nIn the US, regular events are run by the United States Border Collie Handler's Association, Australian Shepherd Club of America, American Kennel Club and many others.\n\nThe world record price for a working sheep dog was broken February 2011 at the auction at Skipton Market, England, with £6,300 ($10,270) for Dewi Fan. The previous record was £5,145 ($8,390)\n\n\nThese commands may be indicated by a hand movement, whistle or voice. There are many other commands that are also used when working stock and in general use away from stock. Herding dog commands are generally taught using livestock as the modus operandi. Urban owners without access to livestock are able to teach basic commands through herding games.\n\nThese are not the only commands used: there are many variations. When whistles are used, each individual dog usually has a different set of commands to avoid confusion when several dogs are being worked at one time.\n\nHerding dogs are often chosen as family pets. The collie breeds including the Bearded Collie and Border Collie are well known, as are the Welsh Corgis. Although they make good family dogs and show dogs they are at their best when they have a job to do. These dogs have been bred as working dogs and need to be active. They retain their herding instincts and may sometimes nip at people's heels or bump them in an effort to 'herd' their family, and may need to be trained not to do so. Their activity level and intelligence makes them excellent canine athletes. The Australian Shepherd, Shetland Sheepdog, Rough Collie, Smooth Collie and Old English Sheepdog are more popular as family companion dogs.\n\nHerding breeds include the following:\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Pyrenean Shepherd\n\nThe Pyrenean Shepherd (known in France originally, and also in non-AKC registries such as the UKC, as the Berger des Pyrénées, and in Spain as the Pastor de los Pirineos) is a medium-small breed of dog native to the Pyrenees mountains in southern France and northern Spain, bred since at least medieval times for herding livestock, especially sheep. It worked as an active herder together with the Great Pyrenees, another mountain dog, which acted as the flock's guardian.\n\nThe Pyrenean Shepherd is the smallest of the French and Spanish herding dogs. The breed comes in two varieties: Rough-faced and smooth-Faced. Rough-faced males are at the withers, and rough-faced females are . Smooth-faced males are at the withers, and smooth-faced females are inches at the withers. The weight is between , aiming for lithe and muscular, never fat.\n\nThe head is of small proportions in comparison to the dog, with a rather flat skull, and a somewhat short, triangular muzzle. The face is expressive and intelligent, with dark eyes, except in the case of merles or slate grey coat colour. Traditionally the dog's ears are cropped. If natural, the Pyrenean Shepherd should have semi-prick or rose ears. Naturally prick ears are not correct for the breed, and may indicate an outcross.\n\nThe body is long and lean, and should reflect the natural energetic athleticism of the dog. The legs are well proportioned, with lean, well-angulated, well-let-down hocks typical of a sure-footed mountain breed. The tail can be docked short, a natural bob-tail, or naturally long with a crook in the end, so long as its carried below the topline at rest and in motion.\n\nThe coat has two basic varieties, smooth-faced and rough-faced (demi-long or long-haired). The smooth-faced variety has short, fine hairs on the muzzle, with a modest ruff around the face and neck, and some feathering along the legs, tail, and belly. In contrast, the rough-faced has longer hair on the muzzle and face, though never enough to cover or obscure the eyes or create a bearded effect, and demi-long or long, coarse hair over the rest of the body. The rough-faced dog can also form cords over his hindquarters and front legs.\n\nShades of fawn are most typical for the breed, either with or without black mask and overlay. Also very common are brindles and various shades of grey. Less common are merles of various kinds (blue merle, brindle merle, fawn merle), and black. All colors allow for some white at the head, chest, and feet, but solid colors are preferred.\n\nThe Pyrenean Shepherd was designed to be a sheepdog, and as such is full of the same sort of energy that other herding dogs have, but in a surprisingly small package. This adaptive dog wants to, and can, do all the jobs on the field, and is a natural herder. A dog that needs a job, its cleverness makes it ideal for other work and dog sports such as flyball, competitive obedience, and agility. This dog is good with, and protective of, children with whom they were brought up.\n\nPyr Sheps are \"one-man\" dogs, attached and dedicated to their owners, with a desire to follow them around the house to help with daily chores. They sense every mood and often seem to be able to read their masters' minds, as they are constantly watchful. Because of this, they are extremely trainable.\n\nTheir natural wariness, while valuable in a herding dog which might need to alert their shepherd of strange animals or people, combined with their herding bossiness, can lead to shyness or aggression in even the most friendly puppy if not properly managed. Frequent socialization from a very young age can help counter this trait.\n\nPyrenean Shepherds can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, and tracking events.\n\nOn 1 January 2009, the Pyrenean Shepherd finally became eligible to compete in herding events in the United States sponsored by the AKC. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Pyr Sheps exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\nPyrenean Shepherds need only a weekly brush, as well as regular checks for burrs or mats, to keep their coat in good condition. They also need a lot of space indoors, and space to exercise outdoors.\n\nSome specialists argue that the Pyrenean Shepherd was there long before the arrival of the Roman armies which dominated Gaul and Hispania and this was mixed with large molossers that the Romans had in their army. Other theories suggest that its origin is linked to the passage of the Vandals and Suebi through the Pyrenees to the south.\n\nAfter the first World War, the Pyrenean Shepherd, or \"Pyr Shep\", gained national recognition in France for their valiant work as couriers, search and rescue dogs, watch dogs, and company mascots.\n\nThe smooth-faced Pyrenean Shepherd in its harlequin or blue merle coloration may have been one of the foundation breeds for the Australian Shepherd when sheep herders brought their sheepdogs to the American West when they flew to the United States as contract herders for the Western Range Association in the 1940s until the early 1970s.\n\nThe Pyr Shep is not yet a well-known breed outside of its native France and Spain, but its size, intelligence, and attractive coat make it appealing. After one of its breed won the World Agility Championship for midsized dogs in 2003, it gained more attention as an intelligent performance dog for dog sports.\n\nOn 24 January 2015, a male Pyrenean Shepherd, GCh (Grand Champion) La Brise Sun Bear, a dog (i.e., male), was awarded an AKC all-breed Best In Show (BIS). This was the first (and so far only) BIS since having been formally recognized by the AKC for competition (within the Herding Group) effective as of 1 January 2009 (6 years previously).\n\nThe first Pyrenean Sheepdogs were registered with the Kennel Club (UK) in 1988 and the Pyrenean Sheepdog Club of Great Britain was formed in 1992 by a small number of enthusiasts.\n"
