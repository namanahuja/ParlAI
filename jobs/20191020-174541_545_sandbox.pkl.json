                "The Shining (film)\n\nThe Shining is a 1980 horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick and co-written with novelist Diane Johnson. The film is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel \"The Shining\".\n\n\"The Shining\" is about Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic, who accepts a position as the off-season caretaker of the isolated historic Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies. Wintering over with Jack is his wife Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd), who possesses \"the shining\", an array of psychic abilities that allow Danny to see the hotel's horrific past. The hotel's current cook, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers), also has this ability and is able to telepathically communicate with Danny. The hotel had a previous winter caretaker who went crazy and killed his wife, two daughters and then himself. After a winter storm leaves the Torrances snowbound, Jack's sanity deteriorates due to the influence of the supernatural forces that inhabit the hotel, placing his wife and son in danger. Supporting roles are provided by Barry Nelson, Philip Stone, Joe Turkel, Anne Jackson, and Tony Burton.\n\nProduction took place almost exclusively at EMI Elstree Studios with sets strongly based on real locations. Kubrick often worked with a small crew which allowed him to do many takes, sometimes to the exhaustion of the actors and staff. The new Steadicam was used in several scenes giving it an innovative and immersive look and feel. Because of inconsistencies, ambiguities, symbolism, and differences from the book, there has been much speculation into the meanings and actions in the movie.\n\nUnlike Kubrick's previous works, which developed audiences gradually through word-of-mouth, \"The Shining\" was released as a mass-market film, initially opening in two U.S. cities on Memorial Day, then nationwide within a month. The European release of \"The Shining\" a few months later was 25 minutes shorter due to Kubrick's removal of most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel.\n\nAlthough contemporary responses from critics were mixed, assessment became more favorable in following decades, and it is now widely regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made. American director Martin Scorsese ranked it one of the 11 scariest horror movies of all time. Critics, scholars, and crew members (such as Kubrick's producer Jan Harlan) have discussed the film's enormous influence on popular culture.\n\nJack Torrance arrives at the mountain-isolated Overlook Hotel, which is twenty-five miles from the closest town, to be interviewed for the position of winter caretaker. Once hired, Jack plans to use the hotel's solitude to write. The hotel, built on the site of a Native American burial ground, becomes snowed-in during the winter; it is closed from October to May. Manager Stuart Ullman warns Jack that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, developed cabin fever and killed his family and himself. In Boulder, Jack's son, Danny Torrance, has a terrifying premonition about the hotel, viewing a cascade of blood emerging from an elevator door, and then falls into a trance. Jack's wife, Wendy, tells a doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony, and that Jack has given up drinking because he dislocated Danny's shoulder following a binge.\n\nThe family arrives at the hotel on closing day and is given a tour. The chef, Dick Hallorann, surprises Danny by telepathically offering him ice cream. Dick explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls \"shining\". Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly room 237. Hallorann denies it, but tells Danny that the hotel has a \"shine\" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good. He also tells Danny to stay away from room 237.\n\nA month passes; while Jack's writing goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel's hedge maze, and Hallorann goes to Florida. Wendy learns that the phone lines are out due to the heavy snowfall, and Danny has frightening visions. Jack, increasingly frustrated, starts behaving strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts. Danny's curiosity about room 237 overcomes him when he sees the room's door open. Later, Wendy finds Jack screaming during a nightmare while asleep at his typewriter. After she awakens him, Jack says he dreamed that he killed her and Danny. Danny arrives and is visibly traumatized with a bruise on his neck, causing Wendy to accuse Jack of abusing him. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room and meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Lloyd serves him bourbon whiskey while Jack complains about his marriage. Wendy later tells Jack that Danny told her a \"crazy woman in one of the rooms\" attempted to strangle him. Jack investigates room 237, encountering the ghost of a dead woman, but tells Wendy that he saw nothing. Wendy and Jack argue over whether Danny should be removed from the hotel and a furious Jack returns to the Gold Room, now filled with ghosts attending a ball. He meets the ghost of Grady who tells Jack that he must \"correct\" his wife and child and that Danny has reached out to Hallorann using his \"talent\". Meanwhile, Hallorann grows concerned about what's going on at the hotel and flies back to Colorado. Danny starts calling out \"redrum\" and goes into a trance, referring to himself as \"Tony\".\n\nWhile searching for Jack, Wendy discovers he has been typing pages of a repetitive manuscript: \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\". She begs Jack to leave the hotel with Danny, but he threatens her before she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat. She drags him into the kitchen and locks him in the pantry, but she and Danny are both trapped at the hotel: Jack has disabled the hotel's two-way radio and snowcat. Later, Jack converses through the pantry door with Grady, who unlocks the door.\n\nDanny writes \"REDRUM\" on the outside of the bathroom door in the family's living quarters. When Wendy sees the word reversed in the bedroom mirror, the word is revealed to be \"MURDER\". Jack begins hacking through the quarters' main door with a firefighter's axe. Wendy sends Danny through the bathroom window, but it will not open sufficiently for her to pass. Jack breaks through the bathroom door, shouting \"Here's Johnny!\", but retreats after Wendy slashes his hand with a butcher's knife. Hearing Hallorann arriving in a snowcat he borrowed, Jack leaves the room. He murders Hallorann with the axe in the lobby and pursues Danny into the hedge maze. Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering ghosts and the cascade of blood Danny envisioned in Boulder. She also finds Hallorann's corpse in the lobby. Danny lays a false trail to mislead Jack, who is following his footprints, before hiding behind a drift. Danny escapes from the maze and reunites with Wendy; they escape in Hallorann's snowcat, while Jack freezes to death in the snow. In an old photograph in the hotel hallway dated July 4, 1921, Jack Torrance smiles front and center amid a crowd of party revelers at the Overlook.\n\nIn the shorter European cut, all of the scenes involving Jackson and Burton are cut (although their names still appear in the credits). Dennen is on-screen in both versions of the film, albeit to a limited degree (and with no dialogue) in the shorter cut.\n\nThe actresses who played the ghosts of the murdered Grady daughters, Lisa and Louise Burns, are identical twins; however, the characters in the book and film script are merely sisters, not twins. In the film's dialogue, Mr. Ullman says he thinks they were \"about eight and ten\". Nonetheless, they are frequently referred to in discussions about the film as \"the Grady twins\".\n\nThe resemblance in the staging of the Grady girls and the \"Twins\" photograph by Diane Arbus has been noted both by Arbus' biographer, Patricia Bosworth, the Kubrick assistant who cast and coached them, Leon Vitali, and by numerous Kubrick critics. Although Kubrick both met Arbus personally and studied photography under her during his youthful days as photographer for \"Look\" magazine, Kubrick's widow says he did not deliberately model the Grady girls on Arbus' photograph, in spite of widespread attention to the resemblance.\n\nBefore making \"The Shining\", Stanley Kubrick had directed the 1975 movie \"Barry Lyndon\", a highly visual period film about an Irish man who attempts to make his way into the British aristocracy. Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with \"Barry Lyndon\"&apos;s lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: \"Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust. She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading \"The Shining.\"\"\n\nSpeaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that \"there's something inherently wrong with the human personality. There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\".\n\nNicholson was Kubrick's first choice for the role of Jack Torrance; other actors considered included Robert De Niro (who claims the film gave him nightmares for a month), Robin Williams, and Harrison Ford, all of whom met with Stephen King's disapproval. In his search to find the right actor to play Danny, Kubrick sent a husband and wife team, Leon and Kersti Vitali, to Chicago, Denver, and Cincinnati to create an interview pool of 5,000 boys over a six-month period. These cities were chosen since Kubrick was looking for a boy with an accent which fell in between Jack Nicholson's and Shelley Duvall's speech patterns.\n\nHaving chosen King's novel as a basis for his next project, and after a pre-production phase, Kubrick had sets constructed on soundstages at EMI Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, Britain. Some of the interior designs of the Overlook Hotel set were based on those of the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. To enable him to shoot the scenes in chronological order, he used several stages at EMI Elstree Studios in order to make all sets available during the complete duration of production. The set for the Overlook Hotel was at the time the largest ever built at Elstree, including a life-size re-creation of the exterior of the hotel. In February 1979, the set at Elstree was badly damaged in a fire, causing a delay in the production.\n\nWhile most of the interior shots, and even some of the Overlook exterior shots, were shot on studio sets, a few exterior shots were shot on location by a second-unit crew headed by Jan Harlan. Saint Mary Lake and Wild Goose Island in Glacier National Park, Montana was the filming location for the aerial shots of the opening scenes, with the Volkswagen Beetle driving along Going-to-the-Sun Road. The Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon was filmed for a few of the exterior shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel; notably absent in these shots is the hedge maze, something the Timberline Lodge does not have.\n\nOuttakes of the opening panorama shots were later used by Ridley Scott for the closing moments of the original cut of the film \"Blade Runner\" (1982).\n\n\"The Shining\" had a prolonged and arduous production period, often with very long workdays. Principal photography took over a year to complete, due to Kubrick's highly methodical nature. Actress Shelley Duvall did not get along with Kubrick, frequently arguing with him on set about lines in the script, her acting techniques and numerous other things. Duvall eventually became so overwhelmed by the stress of her role that she became physically ill for months. At one point, she was under so much stress that her hair began to fall out. The shooting script was being changed constantly, sometimes several times a day, adding more stress. Jack Nicholson eventually became so frustrated with the ever-changing script that he would throw away the copies that the production team would give to him to memorize, knowing that it was just going to change anyway. He learned most of his lines just minutes before filming them. Nicholson was living in London with his then-girlfriend Anjelica Huston and her younger sister, Allegra, who testified to his long shooting days. Joe Turkel stated in a 2014 interview that they rehearsed the \"bar scene\" for six weeks, and that the shoot day lasted from 9a.m. to 10:30p.m., with Turkel recollecting that his clothes were soaked in his own sweat by the end of the day's shoot. He also added that it was his favorite scene in the film.\n\nFor the final Gold Room sequence, Kubrick instructed the extras (via megaphone) not to talk, \"but to mime conversation to each other. Kubrick knew from years of scrutinizing thousands of films that extras could often mime their business by nodding and using large gestures that look fake. He told them to act naturally to give the scene a chilling sense of time-tripping realism as Jack walks from the seventies into the roaring twenties\".\n\nFor the international versions of the film, Kubrick shot different takes of Wendy reading the typewriter pages in different languages. For each language, a suitable idiom was used: German (\"Was du heute kannst besorgen, das verschiebe nicht auf morgen\" — \"Never put off till tomorrow what may be done today\"), Italian (\"Il mattino ha l’oro in bocca\" — \"The morning has gold in its mouth\"), French (\"Un «Tiens» vaut mieux que deux «Tu l'auras»\" — \"One 'here you go' is worth more than two 'you'll have it, the equivalent of \"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\"), Spanish (\"No por mucho madrugar amanece más temprano\" — \"No matter how early you get up, you can't make the sun rise any sooner.\") These alternate shots were not included with the DVD release, where only the English phrase \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" was used.\n\nThe door that Jack chops through with the axe near the end of the film was a real door. Kubrick had originally shot this scene with a fake door, but Nicholson, who had worked as a volunteer fire marshal, tore it down too quickly. Jack's line, \"Heeeere's Johnny!\", is taken from Ed McMahon's famous introduction to \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", and was improvised by Nicholson. Kubrick, who had lived in England for some time, was unaware of the significance of the line, and nearly used a different take. Carson later used the Nicholson clip to open his 1980 anniversary show on NBC.\n\nDuring production, Kubrick screened David Lynch's \"Eraserhead\" (1977) to the cast and crew, to convey the mood he wanted to achieve for the film.\n\n\"The Shining\" was among the first half-dozen films (after the 1976 films \"Bound for Glory\", \"Marathon Man\", and \"Rocky\"), to use the newly developed Steadicam, a stabilizing mount for a motion picture camera, which mechanically separates the operator's movement from the camera's, allowing smooth tracking shots while the operator is moving over an uneven surface. It essentially combines the stabilized steady footage of a regular mount with the fluidity and flexibility of a handheld camera. The inventor of the Steadicam, Garrett Brown, was heavily involved with the production of \"The Shining\". Brown has described his excitement taking his first tour of the sets which offered \"further possibilities for the Steadicam\". This tour convinced Brown to become personally involved with the production. Kubrick was not \"just talking of stunt shots and staircases\". Rather he would use the Steadicam \"as it was intended to be used — as a tool which can help get the lens where it's wanted in space and time without the classic limitations of the dolly and crane\". Brown used an 18 mm Cooke lens that allowed the Steadicam to pass within an inch of walls and door frames. Brown published an article in \"American Cinematographer\" about his experience, and contributed to the audio commentary on the 2007 DVD release.\nKubrick personally aided in modifying the Steadicam's video transmission technology. Brown states his own abilities to operate the Steadicam were refined by working on Kubrick's film. For this film, Brown developed a two-handed technique, which enabled him to maintain the camera at one height while panning and tilting the camera. In addition to tracking shots from behind, the Steadicam enabled shooting in constricted rooms without flying out walls, or backing the camera into doors. Brown notes that:\nThis required the Steadicam to be on a special mount modeled on a wheelchair in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the sound man. The weight of the rig and its occupants proved to be too much for the original tires however, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused a serious crash. Solid tires were then mounted on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform take after identical take. Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a Steadicam.\n\nThe stylistically modernist art-music chosen by Kubrick is similar to the repertoire he first explored in \"\". Although the repertoire was selected by Kubrick, the process of matching passages of music to motion picture was left almost entirely at the discretion of music editor Gordon Stainforth, whose work on this film is known for the attention to fine details and remarkably precise synchronization without excessive splicing.\n\nThe soundtrack album on LP was withdrawn due to problems with licensing of the music. It remains only available on vinyl (there has never been a CD release) and is difficult to find. The LP soundtrack omits some pieces heard in the film, and also includes complete versions of pieces of which only fragments are heard in the film.\n\nThe non-original music on the soundtrack is as follows:\n\nUpon their arrival at Elstree Studios, Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind were shown the first version of the film by Kubrick: \"The film was a little on the long side. There were great gobs of scenes that never made it to the film. There was a whole strange and mystical scene in which Jack Nicholson discovers objects that have been arranged in his working space in the ballroom with arrows and things. He walks down and thinks he hears a voice and a ghost throws a ball back to him. None of that made it to the final film. We scored a lot of those. We didn't know what was going to be used for sure\". Carlos has said that she was so disillusioned by Kubrick's actions that she vowed never to work with him again. Her own music was released in its near entirety in 2005 as part of her \"Rediscovering Lost Scores\" compilation.\n\nAfter its premiere and a week into the general run (with a running time of 146 minutes), Kubrick cut a scene at the end that took place in a hospital. The scene shows Wendy in a bed talking with Mr. Ullman who explains that Jack's body could not be found; he then gives Danny a yellow tennis ball, presumably the same one that Jack was throwing around the hotel. This scene was subsequently physically cut out of prints by projectionists and sent back to the studio by order of Warner Bros., the film's distributor. This cut the film's running time to 144 minutes. As noted by Roger Ebert:\nFor its release in Europe, Kubrick cut about 25 minutes from the film. The excised scenes included a longer meeting between Jack and Watson at the hotel, Danny being attended by a doctor (Anne Jackson) including references to Tony and how Danny was once injured by Jack in a drunken rage, more footage of Hallorann's attempts to get to the hotel during the snowstorm including a sequence with a garage attendant (Tony Burton), extended dialogue scenes at the hotel, and a scene where Wendy discovers a group of skeletons in the hotel lobby during the climax. Jackson and Burton are credited in the European print, despite their scenes being excised from the movie. According to Harlan, Kubrick decided to cut some sequences because the film was \"not very well received\", and after Warner Bros. complained about its ambiguity and length.\n\nThe scene where Jack writes obsessively on the typewriter \"\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\"\" was shot changing the language of the typescript in Italian, French, Spanish, and German, because the film would be dubbed in these languages in their respective countries. In the Italian version, Nicholson was dubbed by Giancarlo Giannini; Kubrick sent him a congratulations letter for his excellent work as voice actor.\n\nTwo alternative takes were used in a British television commercial.\n\nThe U.S. premiere by ABC on May 6, 1983 started with a placard saying, \"TONIGHT’S FILM DEALS WITH THE SUPERNATURAL, AS A POSSESSED MAN ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY HIS FAMILY.\" With the movie's ambiguities, it is not known how Kubrick felt about or if he agreed with this proclamation. The placard also said that the film was edited for television and warned about the content.\n\nThe U.S. region 1 DVD of the film is the longer (144 minute) edit of the film. The European (including UK) region 2 DVD is the shorter (119 minute) version. On British television, the short version played on Channel 4 once and on Sky Movies numerous times in the mid-nineties. All other screenings, before and since these, have been on either ITV or ITV4 and have been the longer U.S. edit. The German DVD shows the short version, as seen in German television screenings.\n\nIn accordance with stipulations contained in Kubrick's will, DVD releases show the film in open matte (i.e., with more picture content visible than in movie theaters). The scene in which Wendy discovers her husband's work (consisting only of a simple proverb: \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" repeatedly typed on numerous pages) was shot with different proverbs in at least five languages (English, French, Spanish, Italian and German). Nevertheless, most DVD releases show the English version, disregarding the dub language.\n\nDVDs in both regions contain a candid fly-on-the-wall 33-minute documentary made by Kubrick's daughter Vivian (who was 17 when she filmed it) entitled \"Making The Shining\", originally shown on British television in 1980. She also provided an audio commentary track about her documentary for its DVD release. It appears even on pre-2007 editions of \"The Shining\" on DVD, although most DVDs of Kubrick films before then were devoid of documentaries or audio commentaries. It has some candid interviews and very private moments caught on set, such as arguments with cast and director, moments of a no-nonsense Kubrick directing his actors, Scatman Crothers being overwhelmed with emotion during his interview, Shelley Duvall collapsing from exhaustion on the set, and Jack Nicholson enjoying playing up to the behind-the-scenes camera.\n\n\"The Shining\" had a slow start at the box office, but gained momentum, eventually doing well commercially during the summer of 1980 and making Warner Bros. a profit. It opened at first to mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" lauded Nicholson's performance and praised the Overlook Hotel as an effective setting for horror, but wrote that \"the supernatural story knows frustratingly little rhyme or reason […] Even the film's most startling horrific images seem overbearing and perhaps even irrelevant.\" \"Variety\" was critical, saying, \"With everything to work with, ... Kubrick has teamed with jumpy Jack Nicholson to destroy all that was so terrifying about Stephen King's bestseller.\" A common initial criticism was the slow pacing, which was highly atypical of horror films of the time. Roger Ebert did not review the film on his television show when first released, and in print complained that it was hard to connect with any of the characters. It was the only one of Kubrick's last nine films to receive no nominations at all from either the Oscars or Golden Globes, but was nominated for a pair of Razzie Awards, including Worst Director and Worst Actress (Duvall), in the first year that award was given.\n\nTim Cahill of \"Rolling Stone\" noted in an interview with Kubrick that by 1987 there was already a \"critical reevaluation of [\"The Shining\"] in process\". As with most Kubrick films, more recent analyses have treated the film more favorably. Viewers subsequently decided the slow pacing actually contributes to the film's hypnotic quality. Film website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gave the film a 'Certified Fresh' score of 87% based on 69 reviews with an average rating of 8.4/10.\n\nIn 2006, Roger Ebert, who was initially critical of the work, inducted \"The Shining\" into his Great Movies series, saying, \"Stanley Kubrick's cold and frightening \"The Shining\" challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust? […] It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick's film so strangely disturbing.\"\n\nHorror film critic Peter Bracke reviewing the Blu-ray release in \"Hi-Def Digest\" writes:\n\nJust as the ghostly apparitions of the film's fictional Overlook Hotel would play tricks on the mind of poor Jack Torrance, so too has the passage of time changed the perception of \"The Shining\" itself. Many of the same reviewers who lambasted the film for \"not being scary\" enough back in 1980 now rank it among the most effective horror films ever made, while audiences who hated the film back then now vividly recall being \"terrified\" by the experience. \"The Shining\" has somehow risen from the ashes of its own bad press to redefine itself not only as a seminal work of the genre, but perhaps the most stately, artful horror ever made.\n\n\"The Shining\" is widely acclaimed by today's critics, and has become a staple of pop culture. In 2001, the film was ranked 29th on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills list and Jack Torrance was named the 25th greatest villain on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains list in 2003. In 2005, the quote \"Here's Johnny!\" was ranked 68 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list. It was named the all-time scariest film by Channel 4, Total Film labeled it the 5th greatest horror film, and Bravo TV named one of the film's scenes 6th on their list of the 100 Scariest Movie Moments. In addition, film critics Kim Newman and Jonathan Romney both placed it in their top ten lists for the 2002 \"Sight & Sound\" poll. Director Martin Scorsese placed \"The Shining\" on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time.\nMathematicians at London's King's College used statistical modeling in a study commissioned by \"Sky Movies\" to conclude that \"The Shining\" was the \"perfect scary movie\" due to a proper balance of various ingredients including shock value, suspense, gore and size of the cast. It was voted the 62nd greatest American film ever made in a 2015 poll conducted by BBC.\n\nIn 1999, Jonathan Romney discussed Kubrick's perfectionism and dispelled others' initial arguments that the film lacked complexity: \"The final scene alone demonstrates what a rich source of perplexity \"The Shining\" offers [...] look beyond the simplicity and the Overlook reveals itself as a palace of paradox\". Romney further explains:The dominating presence of the Overlook Hotel – designed by Roy Walker as a composite of American hotels visited in the course of research – is an extraordinary vindication of the value of mise en scène. It's a real, complex space that we don't just see but come to virtually inhabit. The confinement is palpable: horror cinema is an art of claustrophobia, making us loath to stay in the cinema but unable to leave. Yet it's combined with a sort of agoraphobia – we are as frightened of the hotel's cavernous vastness as of its corridors' enclosure. ... The film sets up a complex dynamic between simple domesticity and magnificent grandeur, between the supernatural and the mundane in which the viewer is disoriented by the combination of spaciousness and confinement, and an uncertainty as to just what is real or not.\n\nSpeaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that \"there's something inherently wrong with the human personality. There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\". Stephen King has been quoted as saying that although Kubrick made a film with memorable imagery, it was poor as an adaptation and that it is the only adaptation of his novels that he could \"remember hating\". However, in King's 1981 nonfiction book \"Danse Macabre\", he listed Kubrick's film among those he considered to have \"contributed something of value to the [horror] genre\" and mentioned it as one of his \"personal favorites\". Before the 1980 movie King often said he gave little attention to the film adaptations of his work.\n\nKing himself was suffering from alcoholism at the time he wrote the novel, therefore giving a strong autobiographical element to the story. He has expressed disappointment that his novel's important themes, such as the disintegration of family and the dangers of alcoholism, are less prevalent in the film. King also viewed the casting of Nicholson as a mistake, arguing it would result in a rapid realization among audiences that Jack would ultimately go mad, due to Nicholson's famous identification with the character of McMurphy in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975). King had suggested that a more “everyman”-like actor such as Jon Voight, Christopher Reeve, or Michael Moriarty play the role, so that Jack's subsequent descent into madness would be more unnerving.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, King also criticized Shelley Duvall's performance in the film, stating \"(S)he's basically just there to scream and be stupid, and that's not the woman that I wrote about.\"\n\nOver the years, contradictions have arisen in the discussion of King's criticisms. The author once suggested that he disliked the film's downplaying of the supernatural; King had envisioned Jack as a victim of the genuinely external forces haunting the hotel, whereas King felt Kubrick had viewed the haunting and its resulting malignancy as coming from within Jack himself. In October 2013, however, journalist Laura Miller wrote that the discrepancy between the two was almost the complete opposite: the Jack Torrance of the novel was corrupted by his own choices – particularly alcoholism – whereas in Kubrick's adaptation the causes are actually more surreal and ambiguous:King is, essentially, a novelist of morality. The decisions his characters make — whether it’s to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety — are what matter to him. But in Kubrick’s \"The Shining\", the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It’s a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King’s novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like “insects” because the director doesn’t really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick’s highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King’s “The Shining”, the monster is Jack. In Kubrick’s, the monster is Kubrick.\n\nKing's oft-cited remark about Kubrick being a man who “thinks too much and feels too little” is often misconstrued as a remark on Kubrick's obsessive and detached approach to directing actors, but it is actually a less disparaging reference to Kubrick's skepticism regarding the verisimilitude of the supernatural, which emerged in pre-production conversations between King and Kubrick. The full context of King's well-known quote is:\n\nMark Browning, a critic of King's work, observed that King's novels frequently contain a narrative closure that completes the story, which Kubrick's film lacks. Browning has in fact argued that King has exactly the opposite problem of which he accused Kubrick. King, he believes, \"feels too much and thinks too little\".\n\nKing was also disappointed by Kubrick's decision not to film at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, which inspired the story (a decision Kubrick made since the hotel lacked sufficient snow and electricity). However, King finally supervised the 1997 television adaptation also titled \"The Shining\", filmed at The Stanley Hotel.\n\nThe animosity of King toward Kubrick's adaptation has dulled over time. During an interview segment on the Bravo channel, King stated that the first time he watched Kubrick's adaptation, he found it to be \"dreadfully unsettling\".\n\nNonetheless, writing in the afterword of \"Doctor Sleep\", King professed continued dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film. He said of it \"...of course there was Stanley Kubrick's movie which many seem to remember — for reasons I have never quite understood — as one of the scariest films they have ever seen. If you have seen the movie but not read the novel, you should note that \"Doctor Sleep\" follows the latter which is, in my opinion, the True History of the Torrance Family.\"\n\nFilm critic Jonathan Romney writes that the film has been interpreted in many different ways; as being about the crisis in masculinity, sexism, corporate America, and racism: \"It's tempting to read \"The Shining\" as an Oedipal struggle not just between generations but between Jack's culture of the written word and Danny's culture of images...\" Romney writes, \"Jack also uses the written word to more mundane purpose – to sign his 'contract' with the Overlook. 'I gave my word,' [..] which we take to mean 'gave his soul' in the [..] Faustian sense. But maybe he means it more literally – by the end [..] he has renounced language entirely, pursuing Danny through the maze with an inarticulate animal roar. What he has entered into is a conventional business deal that places commercial obligation [..] over the unspoken contract of compassion and empathy that he seems to have neglected to sign with his family.\" These varied interpretations spawned the 2012 documentary \"Room 237\", directed by Rodney Ascher, which provides an in-depth exploration of various interpretations of, and myths surrounding, the film.\n\nAmong interpreters who see the film reflecting more subtly the social concerns that animate other Kubrick films, one of the earliest and most well-known viewpoints was discussed in an essay by ABC reporter Bill Blakemore entitled \"Kubrick's 'Shining' Secret: Film's Hidden Horror Is The Murder Of The Indian\", first published in \"The Washington Post\" on July 12, 1987. He believes that indirect references to American killings of Native Americans pervade the film, as exemplified by the Amerindian logos on the baking powder in the kitchen, and the Amerindian artwork that appears throughout the hotel, though no Native Americans are ever seen. Stuart Ullman tells Wendy that when building the hotel, a few Indian attacks had to be fended off since it was constructed on an Indian burial ground.\n\nBlakemore's general argument is that the film as a whole is a metaphor for the genocide of Native Americans. He notes that when Jack kills Hallorann, the dead body is seen lying on a rug with an Indian motif. The blood in the elevator shafts is, for Blakemore, the blood of the Indians in the burial ground on which the hotel was built. As such, the fact that the date of the final photograph is July 4 is meant to be deeply ironic. Blakemore writes:\n\nAs with some of his other movies, Kubrick ends \"The Shining\" with a powerful visual puzzle that forces the audience to leave the theater asking, \"What was that all about?\" \"The Shining\" ends with an extremely long camera shot moving down a hallway in the Overlook, reaching eventually the central photo among 21 photos on the wall. The caption reads: \"Overlook Hotel-July 4th Ball-1921.\" The answer to this puzzle, is that most Americans overlook the fact that July Fourth was no ball, nor any kind of Independence day, for native Americans; that the weak American villain of the film is the re-embodiment of the American men who massacred the Indians in earlier years; that Kubrick is examining and reflecting on a problem that cuts through the decades and centuries.\nAlso likely significant is that before Jack's behavior starts becoming aberrant, he is seen throwing a tennis ball hard against Amerindian artwork on the walls and floor, and just a few feet over a mounted buffalo head (which was an animal key to the Plains Indians' economy and culture before it was hunted and slaughtered nearly to extinction in the 19th century, mostly by Euro-Americans). Later, Jack murders Halloran, and tries to murder his family, using an axe, which resembles the tomahawk, a frequently depicted weapon of the Amerindians.\n\nFilm writer John Capo sees the film as an allegory of American imperialism. This is exemplified by many clues, such as the closing photo of Jack in the past at a 4th of July party, or Jack's earlier citation of the Rudyard Kipling poem \"The White Man's Burden\". The poem has been interpreted as rationalizing the European colonization of non-white people, while Jack's line has been interpreted as referring to alcoholism, from which he suffers.\n\nFilm historian Geoffrey Cocks has extended Blakemore's idea that the film has a subtext about Native Americans to arguing that the film indirectly reflects Stanley Kubrick's concerns about the Holocaust (Both Cocks' book and Michael Herr's memoir of Kubrick discuss how he wanted his entire life to make a film dealing directly with the Holocaust, but could never quite get the handle on it that satisfied him). Cocks is a cultural historian best known for describing the impact of the Holocaust on subsequent Western culture. Cocks, writing in his book \"The Wolf at the Door: Stanley Kubrick, History and the Holocaust\", proposed a controversial theory that all of Kubrick's work is informed by the Holocaust; there is, he says, a strong (though hidden) holocaust subtext in \"The Shining\". This, Cocks believes, is why Kubrick's screenplay goes to emotional extremes, omitting much of the novel's supernaturalism and making the character of Wendy much more hysteria-prone. Cocks places Kubrick's vision of a haunted hotel in line with a long literary tradition of hotels in which sinister events occur, from Stephen Crane's short story \"The Blue Hotel\" (which Kubrick admired) to the Swiss Berghof in Thomas Mann's novel \"The Magic Mountain\", about a snowbound sanatorium high in the Swiss Alps in which the protagonist witnesses a series of events which are a microcosm of the decline of Western culture. In keeping with this tradition, Kubrick's film focuses on domesticity and the Torrances' attempt to use this imposing building as a home which Jack Torrance describes as \"homey\".\n\nCocks claims that Kubrick has elaborately coded many of his historical concerns into the film with manipulations of numbers and colors and his choice of musical numbers, many of which are post-war compositions influenced by the horrors of World War II. Of particular note is Kubrick's use of Penderecki's \"The Awakening of Jacob\" to accompany Jack Torrance's dream of killing his family and Danny's vision of past carnage in the hotel, a piece of music originally associated with the horrors of the Holocaust. As such, Kubrick's pessimistic ending in contrast to Stephen King's optimistic one is in keeping with the motifs that Kubrick wove into the story.\n\nCocks' work has been anthologized and discussed in other works on Stanley Kubrick films, but sometimes with skepticism. In particular, Julian Rice writing in the opening chapter of his book \"Kubrick's Hope\" believes Cocks' views are excessively speculative and contain too many strained \"critical leaps\" of faith. Rice holds that what went on in Kubrick's mind cannot be replicated or corroborated beyond a broad vision of the nature of good and evil (which included concern about the Holocaust), but Kubrick's art is not governed by this one single obsession. Diane Johnson, co-screenwriter for \"The Shining\", commented on Cocks' observations and holds that preoccupation with the Jewish Holocaust on Kubrick's part could very likely have motivated his decision to place the hotel on a Native American burial ground, although Kubrick never directly mentioned it to her.\n\nGeoffrey Cocks notes that the film contains many allusions to fairy tales, both \"Hansel and Gretel\" and the \"Three Little Pigs\", with Jack Torrance identified as the Big Bad Wolf, which Bruno Bettelheim interprets as standing for \"all the asocial unconscious devouring powers\" that must be overcome by a child's ego.\n\nThe saying \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" appeared first in James Howell's \"Proverbs in English, Italian, French and Spanish\" (1659).\n\nRoger Ebert notes that the film does not really have a \"reliable observer\", with the possible exception of Dick Hallorann. Ebert believes various events call into question the reliability of Jack, Wendy, and Danny at various points. This leads Ebert to conclude that:\nEbert ultimately concludes that \"The movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies\". Likewise, film critic James Berardinelli (who is generally much less impressed with the film than Ebert), notes that \"King would have us believe that the hotel is haunted. Kubrick is less definitive in the interpretations he offers.\" He dubs the film a failure as a ghost story, but brilliant as a study of \"madness and the unreliable narrator.\"\n\nIn some sequences, there is a question of whether or not there are ghosts present. In the scenes where Jack sees ghosts he is always facing a mirror, or in the case of his storeroom conversation with Grady, a reflective, highly polished door. Film reviewer James Berardinelli notes \"It has been pointed out that there's a mirror in every scene in which Jack sees a ghost, causing us to wonder whether the spirits are reflections of a tortured psyche.\"\nIn \"Hollywood's Stephen King\", Tony Magistrale writes:\n\nKubrick's reliance on mirrors as visual aids for underscoring the thematic meaning of this film portrays visually the internal transformations and oppositions that are occurring to Jack Torrance psychologically. Through...these devices, Kubrick dramatizes the hotel's methodical assault on Torrance's identity, its ability to stimulate the myriad of self-doubts and anxieties by creating opportunities to warp Torrance's perspective on himself and [his family]. Furthermore the fact that Jack looks into a mirror whenever he \"speaks\" to the hotel means, to some extent, that Kubrick implicates him directly into the hotel's \"consciousness\", because Jack is, in effect, talking to himself.\nGhosts are the implied explanation for Jack's escape from the locked storeroom. In an interview by scholar Michel Ciment, Kubrick stated:\n\nIt seemed to strike an extraordinary balance between the psychological and the supernatural in such a way as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.' This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing...It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.\nEarly in the film, Stuart Ullman tells Jack of a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, who, in 1970, succumbed to cabin fever, murdered his family and then killed himself. Later, Jack meets a ghostly butler named Grady. Jack says he knows about the murders, claiming to recognize Grady from pictures; however, the butler introduces himself as \"Delbert\" Grady.\n\nGordon Dahlquist of \"The Kubrick FAQ\" argues that the name change \"deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the July Fourth photo. It is to say he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous situation and the man who has 'always' been at the Overlook. It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does, and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that \"The Shining\" brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance – once more, perhaps – to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may have had a chance to escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to.\" Dahlquist's argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two different people or the same are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance, but nor is he someone entirely different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook, Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel. The film's assistant editor Gordon Stainforth has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity-error explanation on one side and the hidden-meaning explanation on the other; \"I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this. Was his full name Charles Delbert Grady? Perhaps Charles was a sort of nickname? Perhaps Ullman got the name wrong? But I also think that Stanley did NOT want the whole story to fit together too neatly, so [it is] absolutely correct, I think, to say that 'the sum of what we learn refuses to add up neatly'.\"\n\nAmong Kubrick's other doubling / mirroring effects in the film:\n\n\nAt the end of the film, the camera moves slowly towards a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, revealed to include Jack Torrance seen at the middle of a 1921 party. In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick overtly declared that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel. Still, this has not stopped interpreters from developing alternative readings, such as that Jack has been \"absorbed\" into the Overlook Hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wroteAs the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it? After all, it's right at the center of the central picture on the wall, and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn-out winter of mind-numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place. Is it just that, like Poe's purloined letter, the thing in plain sight is the last thing you see? When you do see it, the effect is so unsettling because you realise the unthinkable was there under your nose – overlooked – the whole time.\n\nScreenwriter Todd Alcott has noted:\n\nArtist Juli Kearns first identified and created maps of spatial discrepancies in the overall layout of the Overlook Hotel location, the interiors of which were constructed in studios in England. These spatial discrepancies included windows appearing in impossible places, such as in Stuart Ullman's office which is surrounded by interior hallways, and apartment doorways positioned in places where they cannot possibly lead to apartments. Rob Ager is another proponent of this theory. Jan Harlan, an Executive Producer on \"The Shining\", was asked about the discontinuity of sets by Xan Brooks of \"The Guardian\" and confirmed the discontinuity was intentional, \"The set was very deliberately built to be offbeat and off the track, so that the huge ballroom would never actually fit inside. The audience is deliberately made not to know where they're going. People say The Shining doesn't make sense. Well spotted! It's a ghost movie. It's not supposed to make sense.\" Harlan further elaborated to Kate Abbot for the same newspaper, \"Stephen King gave him the go-ahead to change his book, so Stanley agreed – and wrote a much more ambiguous script. It's clear instantly there's something foul going on. At the little hotel, everything is like Disney, all kitsch wood on the outside – but the interiors don't make sense. Those huge corridors and ballrooms couldn't fit inside. In fact, nothing makes sense.\"\n\nThe film differs from the novel significantly with regard to characterization and motivation of action. The most obvious differences are those regarding the personality of Jack Torrance (the source of much of author Stephen King’s dissatisfaction with the film).\n\nIn the film, the motive of the ghosts is apparently to \"reclaim\" Jack (even though Grady expresses an interest in Danny's \"shining\" ability), who seems to be a reincarnation of a previous caretaker of the hotel, as suggested by the 1920s photograph of Jack at the end of the film and Jack's repeated claims to have \"not just a deja vu\". The film is even more focused on Jack (as opposed to Danny) than the novel.\n\nThe room number 217 has been changed to 237. Timberline Lodge, located on Mt. Hood in Oregon, was used for the exterior shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel. The Lodge requested that Kubrick not depict Room 217 (featured in the book) in \"The Shining\", because future guests at the Lodge might be afraid to stay there, and a nonexistent room, 237, was substituted in the film. Contrary to the hotel's expectations, Room 217 is requested more often than any other room at Timberline.\n\nThere are fringe analyses relating this number change to rumors that Kubrick faked the first moon landing, as there are approximately 237,000 miles between Earth and Moon (average is 238,855 miles) and the movie is a subtle confession of his involvement. Another theory is an obsession with the number 42 and its forms in the movie and the product of the digits in 237 is 42.\n\nThe novel presents Jack as initially likable and well-intentioned but haunted by the demons of alcohol and authority issues. Nonetheless, he becomes gradually overwhelmed by the evil forces in the hotel. At the novel's conclusion, the hotel forces have possessed Jack's body and proceed to destroy all that is left of his mind during a final showdown with Danny, leaving a monstrous entity that Danny is able to divert while he, Wendy and Dick Halloran escape. The film's Jack is established as somewhat sinister much earlier in the story and dies in a different manner. Jack actually kills Dick Hallorann in the film, but only wounds him in the novel. King attempted to talk Stanley Kubrick out of casting Jack Nicholson even before filming began, on the grounds that he seemed vaguely sinister from the very beginning of the film, and had suggested Jon Voight among others for the role.\n\nOnly in the novel does Jack hear the haunting, heavy-handed voice of his father with whom he had a troubled relationship. In both the novel and film, Jack's encounter with the ghostly bartender is pivotal to Jack's deterioration. However, the novel gives much more detail about Jack's problems with drinking and alcohol.\n\nThe film prolongs Jack's struggle with writer's block. Kubrick's co-screenwriter Diane Johnson believes that in King's novel, Jack's discovery of the scrapbook of clippings in the boiler room of the hotel which gives him new ideas for a novel catalyzes his possession by the ghosts of the hotel, while at the same time unblocking his writing. Jack is no longer a blocked writer, but now filled with energy. In her contribution to the screenplay, Johnson wrote an adaptation of this scene, which to her regret Kubrick later excised, as she felt this left the father's change less motivated. Kubrick showed Jack's continued blockage quite late in the film with the \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" scene, which does not appear in the novel.\n\nStephen King has openly stated on the DVD commentary of the 1997 mini-series of \"The Shining\" that the character of Jack Torrance was partially autobiographical, as he was struggling with both alcoholism and unprovoked rage toward his family at the time of writing. Tony Magistrale wrote about Kubrick's version of Jack Torrance in \"Hollywood's Stephen King\":\nFrom Thomas Allen Nelson's \"Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze\": \"When Jack moves through the reception area on his way to a 'shining' over the model maze, he throws a yellow tennis ball past a stuffed bear and Danny's Big Wheel, which rests on the very spot (a Navajo circle design) where Hallorann will be murdered.\"\nJack's tennis ball mysteriously rolls into Danny's circle of toy cars just before the boy walks through the open door of Room 237.\n\n\"In the film's opening, the camera from above moves over water and through mountains with the ease of a bird in flight. Below, on a winding mountain road, Jack's diminutive yellow Volkswagen journeys through a tree-lined maze, resembling one of Danny's toy cars or the yellow tennis ball seen later outside of Room 237.\"\n\nDanny Torrance is considerably more open about his supernatural abilities in the novel, discussing them with strangers such as his doctor. In the film, he is quite secretive about them even with his prime mentor Dick Halloran, who also has these abilities. (The same is true of Dick Halloran, who in his journey back to the Overlook in the book, talks with others with the \"shining\" ability, while in the film he lies about his reason for returning to the Overlook.) Danny in the novel is generally portrayed as unusually intelligent across the board. In the film, he is more ordinary, though with a preternatural gift. In the novel, Danny is much more bonded to his father than in the film.\n\nAlthough Danny has supernatural powers in both versions, the novel makes it clear that his apparent imaginary friend \"Tony\" really is a projection of hidden parts of his own psyche, though heavily amplified by Danny's psychic \"shining\" abilities. At the end it is revealed that Danny Torrance's middle name is \"Anthony\".\n\nWendy Torrance in the film is relatively meek, submissive, passive, gentle, and mousy; this is shown by the way she defends Jack even in his absence to the doctor examining Danny. It is implied she has perhaps been abused by him as well. In the novel, she is a far more self-reliant and independent personality who is tied to Jack in part by her poor relationship with her parents. In the novel, she never displays hysteria or collapses the way she does in the film, but remains cool and self-reliant. Writing in \"Hollywood's Stephen King\", author Tony Magistrale writes about the mini-series remake:\nDe Mornay restores much of the steely resilience found in the protagonist of King's novel and this is particularly noteworthy when compared to Shelley Duvall's exaggerated portrayal of Wendy as Olive Oyl revisited: A simpering fatality of forces beyond her capacity to understand, much less surmount.\nCo-screenwriter Diane Johnson stated that in her contributions to the script, Wendy had more dialogue, and that Kubrick cut many of her lines, possibly due to his dissatisfaction with actress Shelley Duvall's delivery. Johnson believes the earlier draft of the script portrayed Wendy as a more-rounded character.\n\nIn the novel, Jack's authority issues are triggered by the fact that his interviewer, Ullman, is highly authoritarian, a kind of snobbish martinet. The film's Ullman is far more humane and concerned about Jack's well-being, as well as smooth and self-assured. Only in the novel does Ullman state that he disapproves of hiring Jack but higher authorities have asked that Jack be hired. Ullman's bossy nature in the novel is one of the first steps in Jack's deterioration, whereas in the film, Ullman serves largely as an expositor.\n\nIn \"Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation\", author Greg Jenkins writes \"A toadish figure in the book, Ullman has been utterly reinvented for the film; he now radiates charm, grace and gentility.\"\n\nFrom \"Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze\": Ullman tells Jack that the hotel's season runs from May 15 to October 30, meaning the Torrances moved in on Halloween. On Ullmann's desk next to a small American flag sits a metal cup containing pencils and a pen—and a miniature replica of an ax.\n\n\"When Ullman, himself all smiles, relates as a footnote the story about the former caretaker who 'seemed perfectly normal' but nevertheless cut up his family with an ax, Jack's obvious interest (as if he's recalling one of his own nightmares) and his insincere congeniality (early signs of a personality malfunction) lead the viewer to believe that the film's definition of his madness will be far more complex.\"\n\nStephen King provides the reader with a great deal of information about the stress in the Torrance family early in the story, including revelations of Jack's physical abuse of Danny and Wendy's fear of Danny's mysterious spells. Kubrick tones down the early family tension and reveals family disharmony much more gradually than does King. In the film, Danny has a stronger emotional bond with Wendy than with Jack, which fuels Jack's rather paranoid notion that the two are conspiring against him.\n\nIn the novel Jack recovers his sanity and goodwill through the intervention of Danny while this does not occur in the film. Writing in \"Cinefantastique\" magazine, Frederick Clarke suggests \"Instead of playing a normal man who becomes insane, Nicholson portrays a crazy man attempting to remain sane.\" In the novel, Jack's final act is to enable Wendy and Danny to escape the hotel before it explodes due to a defective boiler, killing him. The film ends with the hotel still standing. More broadly, the defective boiler is a major element of the novel's plot, entirely missing from the film version.\n\nBecause of the limitations of special effects at the time, the living topiary animals of the novel were omitted and a hedge maze was added, acting as a final trap for Jack Torrance as well as a refuge for Danny.\n\nIn the film, the hotel possibly derives its malevolent energy from being built on an Indian burial ground. In the novel, the reason for the hotel's manifestation of evil is possibly explained by a theme present in King's previous novel \"Salem's Lot\" as well as Shirley Jackson's \"The Haunting of Hill House\": a physical place may absorb the evils that transpire there and manifest them as a vaguely sentient malevolence. The film's Hallorann speaks to Danny about that phenomenon occurring at the Overlook. In the novel, Jack does a great deal of investigation of the hotel's past through a scrapbook, a subplot almost omitted from the film aside from two touches: a brief appearance of the scrapbook beside the typewriter, and Jack's statement to the ghost of Grady that he knows his face from an old newspaper article describing the latter's horrific acts. Kubrick in fact shot a scene where Jack discovers the scrapbook but removed it during post-production, a decision which co-screenwriter Diane Johnson lamented.\n\nSome of the film's most famous iconic scenes, such as the ghost girls in the hallway and the torrent of blood from the elevators, are unique to the film. The most notable of these would be the typewritten pages Wendy discovers on Jack's desk. Similarly, many of the most memorable lines of dialogue (\"Words of wisdom\" and \"Here's Johnny!\") are heard exclusively in the film.\n\nAlthough Stephen King fans were critical of the novel's adaptation on the grounds that Kubrick altered and reduced the novel's themes, a defense of Kubrick's approach was made in Steve Biodrowski's review of the film. He argues that as in earlier films, Kubrick stripped out the back story of the film, reducing it down to a \"basic narrative line\", making the characters more like archetypes.\nHis review of the film is one of the few to go into detailed comparison with the novel. He writes, \"The result ...[is] a brilliant, ambitious attempt to shoot a horror film without the Gothic trappings of shadows and cobwebs so often associated with the genre.\"\n\nBoth parodies and homages to \"The Shining\" are prominent in UK and U.S. popular culture, particularly in films, TV shows, video games and music. Images and scenes frequently referenced are: the Grady girls in the hallway, the word \"Redrum\", the blood spilling out of the elevator doors and Jack sticking his head through the hole in the bathroom door, saying, \"Here's Johnny.\" The tricycle scene in which Danny sees the Grady girls and the \"here's Johnny\" scene are seen on a drive-in theatre screen in the movie \"Twister\" just before a tornado rips the screen down.\n\nDirector Tim Burton (who credits Kubrick as an influence) modeled the characters of Tweedledum and Tweedledee on the Grady girls in his version of \"Alice in Wonderland\" (like so many viewers of the film, Burton identifies the girls as twins in spite of Ullman's dialogue to the contrary).\n\n\"The Simpsons\" episode \"Treehouse of Horror V\" includes a parody titled \"The Shinning\". In addition, Sherri and Terri, the twins in Bart's 4th grade class, are visually similar to the Grady girls.\n\n\"Remington Steele\" episode \"Etched In Steele\" includes a reference to \"The Shining\" when Steele uses one of his customary cinematic references to explain the concept of writer's block to his colleague Laura Holt.\n\nFive episodes of the drama \"Gilmore Girls\" reference the film. One episode contains Lorelai's line \"Well, we like our Internet slow, okay? We can turn it on, walk around, dance, make a sandwich. With DSL, there's no dancing, no walking, and we'd starve. It'd be all work and no play. Have you not seen \"The Shining\", Mom?\"\n\nKate Bush's 1982 album \"The Dreaming\" contains the song \"Get Out of My House\", inspired primarily by the novel.\n\nSound clips of Ullman warning Jack about cabin fever with Jack's reassurances appear in Swedish goth band Katatonia's song \"Endtime\" on the album \"Brave Murder Day\".\n\nThe plot of the film is the basis for the music video for \"The Kill\" by Thirty Seconds to Mars.\n\nAmerican heavy metal band Slipknot pay homage to the film in their first music video for their song \"Spit It Out\", directed by Thomas Mignone. The video consists of conceptual imagery of the bandmembers each portraying characters enacting iconic scenes from the film, with Joey Jordison as Danny Torrance; Shawn Crahan and Chris Fehn as the Grady sisters; Corey Taylor as Jack Torrance; Mick Thomson as Lloyd the Bartender; Craig Jones as Dick Hallorann; James Root as Wendy Torrance; Paul Gray as Harry Derwent; and Sid Wilson as the corpse in the bathtub. The video was banned from MTV for overtly graphic and violent depictions, including Corey Taylor's smashing through a door with an axe and the scene wherein James Root viciously assaults Corey Taylor with a baseball bat. Mignone and the band eventually re-edited a less violent version, which was subsequently aired on MTV.\n\n\"Here's Johnny!\" was parodied by British comedian Lenny Henry in a controversial advertisement for Premier Inn.\n\nJohnny Cage parodies the \"here's Johnny\" scene as part of his fatality in \"Mortal Kombat X\" where he shoves his hands behind the opponent in which he then says the line by peeping his face through the opened torso.\n\nIn the \"Scream Queens\" episode \"Pumpkin Patch\", Chanel demands that her pumpkin patch party have an exact replica of the hedge maze which plays a central part of the episode. Also in the episode, Chanel #5 has two twin boyfriends, Rodger and Dodger.\n\nThe Little Sisters in the fallen underwater utopia Rapture, introduced in the 2007 video game \"BioShock\", were partly inspired by the Grady sisters.\n\"The Angry Birds Movie\" contains a scene with two pigs dressed as the Grady sisters.\n\nThe song \"Enjoy Your Slay\" by American metalcore band Ice Nine Kills is inspired primarily by the novel as well as the film adaption. The song also features Stanley Kubrick's grandson Sam Kubrick as guest vocalist.\n\nThe TV show \"Psych\" has an episode titled \"Heeeeere's Lassie\" in which the plot and characters are based on film.\n\nShowrunner Vince Gilligan, being a fan of Kubrick and his \"non-submersible moments\", has included references to Kubrick movies in many of his works. \"I'm happy to see that his inspiration has shown in noticeable ways in our work in \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Better Call Saul\",\" says Gilligan. \"Breaking Bad's\" episode \"Sunset\" has a cop radioing for assistance and begins, \"KDK-12\" — the radio address at the Overlook, before being axed. The axe-murdered Grady twins in \"The Shining\" are turned into the axe-murdering Salamanca twins in \"Breaking Bad\". The descent of the main character, school teacher Walt, into the dark killer has some similarities to Jack's arc. Reflections are used in both to show the characters change. \"Better Call Saul\" has a \"Here's Johnny\" scare in a flashback. Gilligan has also likened his early writing situation, getting snowed in and not writing, to feeling like Jack while going insane.\n\n\n",
                "List of films considered the worst\n\nThe films listed below have been cited by a variety of notable critics in varying media sources as being among the worst films ever made. Examples of such sources include Metacritic, Roger Ebert's list of most-hated films, \"The Golden Turkey Awards\", \"Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide\", Rotten Tomatoes, the Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", and the Golden Raspberry Awards (\"Razzies\").\n\n\"Reefer Madness\" (originally released as \"Tell Your Children\" and sometimes titled or subtitled as \"The Burning Question\", \"Dope Addict\", \"Doped Youth\", and \"Love Madness\") is a 1936 American exploitation film and propaganda work revolving around the melodramatic events that ensue when high school students are lured by pushers to try marijuana—from a hit and run accident, to manslaughter, suicide, attempted rape, and descent into madness. \"The Los Angeles Times\" has claimed that \"Reefer Madness\" was the first film that a generation embraced as \"the worst\". Leonard Maltin has called it \"the grand-daddy of all 'Worst' movies\". \"Las Vegas CityLife\" named it the \"worst ever\" runner-up to \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\", and AMC described it as \"one of the worst movies ever made\". The movie has inspired a number of parodies, including an off-Broadway musical satire and a 2005 film based on the musical.\n\n\"No Orchids for Miss Blandish\", a British gangster film adapted from the 1939 novel by James Hadley Chase, received a very hostile reception from the press. This was mainly due to the film's high (for the time) level of sexual and violent content, but also because its attempt to portray Americans using a largely British cast (including an early role for Sid James) was seen as unconvincing. The British film journal \"Monthly Film Bulletin\" called it \"the most sickening exhibition of brutality, perversion, sex and sadism ever to be shown on a cinema screen\". \"The Sunday Express\" film reviewer called \"No Orchids for Miss Blandish\" \"the worst film I have ever seen\". The Australian newspaper \"The Age\" also gave a harsh review: \"\"No Orchids for Miss Blandish\" is not only a disgrace to the studio that made it, but it also reflects on the British industry as a whole ... the entire production is unpardonable.\" Cliff Goodwin, discussing \"No Orchids For Miss Blandish's\" initial reception, notes it was \"unanimously dubbed 'the worst film ever made. Later reviews of the film were equally antipathetic. \"No Orchids for Miss Blandish\" was described by British film historian Leslie Halliwell as a \"hilariously awful gangster film ... one of the worst films ever made\". \"Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide\" states \"\"No Orchids for Miss Blandish\" misses by a mile.\"\n\n\"The Babe Ruth Story\" is a 1948 baseball film biography of Babe Ruth, starring William Bendix. \"The New York Times\" describes it as \"the \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" of baseball biopics\". It was rushed into release while Ruth was still alive. The final scene is notable for Ruth delivering on a promise he made to a young cancer patient that he would hit a home run. Not only does Ruth succeed in fulfilling the promise, but also the child is subsequently cured of his cancer. Dan Shaughnessy of the \"Boston Globe\" claimed the film was the worst he had ever seen, while the \"Washington Times\" stated that it \"stands as possibly the worst movie ever made\". The film has been called one of the worst sports films ever by \"Newsday\" and \"The A.V. Club\", and called one of the worst biopics by Moviefone and Spike. Michael Sauter included it in his book \"The Worst Movies of All Time\" and Leonard Maltin called it \"perfectly dreadful\".\n\nA semi-autobiographical quasi-documentary about transvestism, \"Glen or Glenda\" starred and was directed by Ed Wood. After a nightmarish dream sequence, Glen undergoes psychotherapy to help cure his affliction. Bela Lugosi appears in this film, as he did in several other Wood films toward the end of his career. Leonard Maltin insists this was far worse than Wood's later \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" and considers it \"possibly the worst movie ever made\". Richard Barrios describes \"Glen or Glenda\" as \"one of the funniest and worst movies ever made\". In his book \"Cult Movies 3\", Danny Peary suggests this is actually a radical, if ineptly made, film that presents a far more personal story than is contained in films by more well-respected auteurs, and it was taken seriously and seen as a significant work by Steve Jenkins, writing for \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" when the film was finally released in the UK in 1981. The film currently has a 32% rating on the review website Rotten Tomatoes. In 1994, Tim Burton directed \"Ed Wood\", which includes some material about the trials and tribulations of making \"Glen or Glenda\".\n\n\"Robot Monster\", a science-fiction film originally shot and exhibited in 3D, features an actor dressed in a gorilla suit and what looks almost like a diving helmet. The film, produced and directed by Phil Tucker, is listed in Michael Sauter's book \"The Worst Movies of All Time\" among \"The Baddest of the Bs\" and has a 31% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It is also featured in \"The Book of Lists\" 10 worst movies list, and in \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\". \"The Golden Turkey Awards\" confers on its main character the title of \"Most Ridiculous Monster in Screen History\" and, listing director Tucker among the runners-up to \"Worst Director of All Time\" (the winner being Ed Wood), states, \"What made \"Robot Monster\" ineffably worse than any other low-budget sci-fi epic was its bizarre artistic pretension\". It was featured in an episode of the movie-mocking television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", and was fondly remembered by author Stephen King, who quotes, and agrees with, a review in \"Castle of Frankenstein\" magazine (\"certainly among the finest terrible movies ever made\", \"one of the most laughable poverty row quickies\").\n\n\"Bride of the Monster\" is an ultra-low-budget monster/detective film written and directed by Ed Wood. Hungarian-accented German mad scientist Eric Vornoff (Bela Lugosi, in his last speaking role) aims to take over the world by creating a race of supermen in his isolated house located in a California swamp. He kills all those who displease him via crocodiles, octopuses and his large, stealthy henchman Lobo (Tor Johnson). Police lieutenant Dick Craig (Tony McCoy) and journalist Janet Lawton (Loretta King) set out to stop him. The film was featured as #3 on Paste Magazine's \"The 10 Worst Films Ever Featured on MST3K\", and the publication wrote that \"this film was made famous by Tim Burton’s \"Ed Wood\" because of the use of a lifeless giant octopus that actors would have to fruitlessly thrash around with to try and make it look like, you know, it was alive and attacking them. This is emblematic of the movie, and of Wood as a filmmaker in general.\" Leonard Maltin called this film \"another hilariously inept Z-grade piece of trash from the king of bad cinema\", and Dennis Schwartz of Ozus' World of Movie Reviews said \"it's more fun than its ridiculous story and brutal acting and incompetently designed sets would indicate\". The film was also featured in a 2004 DVD \"50 Worst Movies Ever Made\", and in Michael Medved's book \"The Golden Turkey Awards: Nominees and Winners, the Worst Achievements in Hollywood History\".\n\nHoward Hughes funded \"The Conqueror\", an epic film featuring John Wayne as Mongolian chieftain Genghis Khan and the redheaded Susan Hayward as a Tatar princess. The movie was filmed near St. George, Utah, downwind from a nuclear testing range in Nevada, and is often blamed for the cancer deaths of many of the cast and crew, including Hayward, Wayne, Agnes Moorehead, Pedro Armendáriz, and director Dick Powell. In addition to filming near the testing range, truckloads of the red sands were transported back to the studios for interior scenes. The film made the ten-worst list in \"The Book of Lists\", appears in Michael Sauter's book \"The Worst Movies of All Time\", and was among those listed in Michael Medved's book \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\". Originally written for Marlon Brando, \"The Guardian\" called the choice of Wayne for Khan \"one of the worst casting decisions of all time\". \"Complex\" listed \"The Conqueror\" as the worst biopic ever made.\n\nHughes, one of the world's wealthiest people at the time, had previously produced the popular dramatic films \"Hell's Angels\", \"Scarface\", and \"The Outlaw\". After seeing \"The Conqueror\" himself, Hughes bought every existing print for $12 million and refused to let the film be seen on television until 1974, reportedly out of guilt over the decision to shoot at such a hazardous location. By 1980, 91 of the 220 cast and crew members had been diagnosed with cancer. This was the last film Hughes produced.\n\n\"Fire Maidens from Outer Space\", a low-budget British space opera film (known in the US as \"Fire Maidens of Outer Space\"), is about a group of astronauts visiting an all-female society on a moon of Jupiter. This film developed a negative reputation for its poor special effects (including a scene on the alien planet, where an automobile is visible driving past). Leslie Halliwell described \"Fire Maidens from Outer Space\" as \"a strong contender for the title of the worst movie ever made, with diaphanously clad English gals striking embarrassed poses against cardboard sets\". British film historian I.Q. Hunter included it in his list of candidates for \"the worst British film ever made\". The DVD Talk website's review claimed it \"may be among the worst-ever professionally produced science fiction films\". In November 1992, the film was featured in an episode of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\".\n\nEd Wood's \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" was labeled the \"Worst Film Ever\" by \"The Golden Turkey Awards\". This movie marked the final film appearance of Bela Lugosi. Wood shot only a small amount of test footage featuring his idol Lugosi before the actor's death. Afterwards, the character was played by Tom Mason, the chiropractor of Wood's wife (Kathy O'Hara) at the time, who played his scenes holding the character's cape in front of his face. Wood was apparently undeterred by the numerous physical differences that distinguished Mason from Lugosi such as height and build, and the fact that Mason was nearly bald while Lugosi retained a full head of hair until he died. Years later, video distributors such as Avenue One DVD began to make light of this, adding such blurbs as \"Almost Starring Bela Lugosi\" to the cover art. Numerous critics also pointed out the cheap, hardly believable special effects and kitschy dialogue.\n\nShot in 1956, the film was not released until 1959 because of difficulty in finding a distributor. It has played at the New Orleans Worst Film Festival. In 1994, Tim Burton directed \"Ed Wood\", which includes some material about the trials and tribulations of making \"Plan 9\". Phil Hall of \"Film Threat\" calls it \"far too entertaining to be considered as the very worst film ever made\". Likewise, John Wirt of \"The Advocate\" goes as far as to call it \"the ultimate cult flick\", and \"Videohound's Complete Guide to Cult Flicks and Trash Pics\" states, \"In fact, the film has become so famous for its own badness that it's now beyond criticism.\" Ian Berriman of \"SFX\" commented about the unintentional comedy, \"Some things are best watched at 3 am, wrapped in the warm glow of drunkenness ... \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" is one of them.\" \"The Radio Times Guide to Films\" described \"Plan 9\" as \"the worst film ever made\" and \"tediously depressing\". However, \"Plan 9\" has a rating of 67% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n\"The Beast of Yucca Flats\" by Coleman Francis, shot silently with added narration, concerns a scientist (Tor Johnson) who is exposed to radiation from an atomic blast, which turns him into a monster. The film opens with a scene of implied necrophilia that has nothing to do with the remainder of the movie and does not fit anywhere into the film's chronology. \"Leonard Maltin's TV and Movie Guide\" calls it \"one of the worst films ever made\". Bill Warren said, \"It may very well be the worst non-porno science fiction movie ever made.\" It was featured on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", where members of the cast state it is by far one of the worst films they have seen up to that point.\n\nThe low-budget shocker \"Eegah\" features Richard Kiel as a prehistoric caveman emerging in early 1960s California who finds love with another teenager. Arch Hall, Jr. performs musical numbers, with lyrics widely considered terrible. The film's notoriety was enhanced as a result of being featured on episodes of \"Canned Film Festival\" and \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", where the cast of the show stated in \"The Mystery Science Theater 3000 Amazing Colossal Episode Guide\" (), that they consider the shaving scene (where Eegah lolls his tongue around and laps up shaving cream) one of the most disgusting things they have seen. It was also one of the films listed in Michael Medved's book \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\".\n\nThe science-fiction/horror film \"The Creeping Terror\" was directed, produced, and edited by Vic Savage (under the pseudonym A.J. Nelson, but he keeps his name when credited as an actor). The movie is about a large slug-like alien that lands on Earth and terrorizes an American town. The film is memorable for its use of some bargain-basement effects: stock footage of a rocket launch played in reverse to depict the landing of an alien spacecraft, and the \"monster\" appears to be composed of a length of shag carpet draped over several actors. Notably, the creature's victims inexplicably stand perfectly still as the slow-moving monster approaches them. Scott Weinberg of efilmcritic.com simply summarizes the movie with \"You've seen clips of this one in those 'awful, awful movies' documentaries.\" The movie was featured in the sixth season of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\".\n\n\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" featured \"The Horror of Party Beach\" in 1997, and the film was listed in \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\". Del Tenney directed it, and the plot mainly consists of sea monsters attacking young women at slumber parties on a beach, who keep returning even after a few murders. \"The New York Times\" film review stated, \"The most to be said for him is that he has not stinted on the gore.\" Thomas Lisanti in \"Hollywood Surf and Beach Movies: The First Wave, 1959–1969\" called it \"by far the worst of the sixties beach films\", and Stephen King called it \"an abysmal little wet fart of a film\". Joe Meyers in the Hearst newspaper blog for the \"Stamford Advocate\" said on Del Tenney's passing: \"Connecticut had its own Ed Wood, an actor, director and entrepreneur named Del Tenney who made a series of truly awful pictures in the Stamford area during the 1960s, the most notorious of which is \"Horror of Party Beach\", a 1964 drive-in quickie about an atomic mutation that terrorizes Stamford ('Party Beach' was actually Shippan Point).\" It is also listed in Michael Sauter's book \"The Worst Movies of All Time\".\n\n\"The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies?!!\" (sometimes billed as \"The Incredibly Strange Creatures\") is a 1964 American monster movie written and directed by Ray Dennis Steckler. Steckler also starred in the film, billed under the pseudonym \"Cash Flagg\". In the film, three friends visit a carnival and stumble into a group of occultists and disfigured monsters. Produced on a $38,000 budget, much of it takes place at The Pike amusement park in Long Beach, California, which resembles Brooklyn's Coney Island. The film was billed as the first \"monster musical\", beating out \"The Horror of Party Beach\" by a mere month in release date. The 2004 DVD \"The 50 Worst Movies Ever Made\" listed this film as the worst film of all time. The rock critic Lester Bangs wrote an appreciative 1973 essay about \"Incredibly Strange Creatures\" in which he tries to explain and justify the movie's value: \"This flick doesn't just rebel against, or even disregard, standards of taste and art. In the universe inhabited by \"The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies\", such things as standards and responsibility have never been heard of. It is this lunar purity which largely imparts to the film its classic stature. Like \"Beyond the Valley of the Dolls\" and a very few others, it will remain as an artifact in years to come to which scholars and searchers for truth can turn and say, \"'This\" was trash! It currently has a 20% \"Rotten\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nThe sci-fi movie \"Santa Claus Conquers the Martians\" was the creation of Nicholas Webster. Because Martian children only get to see Santa Claus on TV signals beamed from Earth, their parents decide to abduct Santa to make them happy. The film was initially criticized for its oddity and poor special effects. Like many others in this category, it has been featured in \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". The film is cited on a 10-worst list in \"The Book of Lists\" and in \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\". It is also known for starring a very young Pia Zadora. In addition to being featured on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", \"Cinematic Titanic\" (a spin-off of \"MST3K\") revisited the film in 2008.\n\nA remake was rumoured with David Zucker as producer, and Jim Carrey attached to play Dropo. An estimated release date was announced as 2002, though it was then believed to have been in development hell.\n\n\"Monster a Go-Go!\" began as \"Terror at Halfday\" by Bill Rebane. The production ran out of money and the film was abandoned. Herschell Gordon Lewis, who reportedly needed a second feature to compose a double bill, purchased and completed it for a minimal amount of money. Several of the film's actors were unable to return, so Lewis simply replaced their parts with new characters who mysteriously appear and fill the roles of the missing characters. One of the actors Lewis managed to rehire had gained weight, gone bald, and grown a goatee, so Lewis recast him as the brother of the original character. The picture consists mostly of lengthy dialogue sequences concerning the apparent mutation of an astronaut into a monster portrayed by the giant, Henry Hite. Poor audio quality makes much of the dialogue unintelligible, and when the film is overexposed, several characters' faces appear as bright white, glowing circles. At one point, when a phone supposedly rings, the sound effect is obviously a person making a noise with their mouth. During the climax of the movie, as soldiers prepare to confront the mutated astronaut, he abruptly vanishes and the narrator informs the audience, \"there was no monster\", and that the astronaut has, in fact, been in the Atlantic Ocean the entire time. All Movie Guide calls the film a \"surreal anti-masterpiece\". It was also featured on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", where writer Paul Chaplin called the dialogue \"garbled beyond recognition\". The entire cast of the show later stated it was officially the worst movie they have ever seen.\n\nThe low-budget horror film \"\", made by El Paso insurance and fertilizer salesman Hal P. Warren, concerns a vacationing family kidnapped by a polygamous cult of pagans. The film was conceived after Warren bet Academy Award-winning screenwriter Stirling Silliphant that anyone could make a horror movie. Warren was convinced by the film's cinematographer and stunt coordinator that most of its glaring mistakes could be fixed in a Dallas post-production studio, when in reality the two wanted to quickly wrap the production because they were not being paid. Several technical gaffes made it into the film, including scenes filmed out of focus, a marking slate being seen in one shot, the scarf on the female lead's head disappearing and reappearing, and an insect bumping the camera lens. The film was shot with a camera that could not record sound and had a 32-second maximum shot length. All dialogue was later dubbed by Warren and four others, including a grown woman who dubbed the voice for a seven-year-old girl. It opens with a nine-minute driving scene that the filmmakers intended to use for cast and crew credits, but failed to do so. The movie includes dialogue spoken while all characters are facing away from the camera, a character complaining about it getting dark while the sun is brightly shining, and the character Torgo, a satyr with overly large thighs, that three women attempt to massage to death. The film gained notoriety and cult popularity by being featured on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", and was the show's most popular episode. The film has a 0% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and \"Entertainment Weekly\" says the movie is \"widely regarded as, quite simply, the worst movie ever made\". Even Warren himself would later admit his film was one of the worst ever, suggesting it might make a passable comedy if redubbed.\n\n\"A Place for Lovers\" is a French-Italian romantic film directed by Vittorio De Sica, starring Faye Dunaway as a terminally-ill American fashion designer in Venice, Italy, and Marcello Mastroianni as a race car driver who has a whirlwind affair with her. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" called it the \"most godawful piece of pseudo-romantic slop I've ever seen!\" and Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" referred to it as \"the worst movie I have seen all year and possibly since 1926\". Leonard Maltin noted Ebert's comments in his review and offered that the film was \"low points for all concerned\". \"A Place for Lovers\" was included as one of the choices in \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\".\n\nThe comedy \"Myra Breckinridge\", based on the book of the same name by Gore Vidal, directed by Michael Sarne and starring Raquel Welch, Rex Reed, Mae West, John Huston and Farrah Fawcett, provoked controversy due to a scene in which Welch forcibly sodomizes a bound man while clips from various classic films play onscreen. The film was initially rated X before edits and an appeal to the MPAA brought it down to an R. It also used the technique of inserting clips from Golden Age movies in such a way that the dialogue took on sexual undertones. Several stars whose films were featured objected to the gimmick, and some (such as Loretta Young) sued to remove the footage. The film was a critical failure, with \"Time\" magazine saying \"\"Myra Breckinridge\" is about as funny as a child molester\". Leonard Maltin gave it a BOMB (the lowest score possible) and stated that it was \"as bad as any movie ever made\". The \"Miami News\" critic Herb Kelly nominated \"Myra Breckinridge\" as the worst film ever made. The film is also cited in \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\". It also was included in \"The Book of Lists\" worst movies of all time, claiming there was something in the movie to offend absolutely everyone. Gore Vidal disowned it, calling it \"an awful joke\", and blamed the movie for a decade-long drought in the sale of the original book.\n\nDirected by Don Barton, \"Zaat\" was also known under various titles including \"Hydra\", \"Attack of the Swamp Creatures\", \"Legend of the Zaat Monster\", and \"The Blood Waters of Dr. Z\" (the name under which it was lampooned on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\"). The film follows a Nazi mad scientist who injects himself with a formula that turns him into a mutated catfish. \"Florida Times-Union\" critic Matt Soergel quipped \"Zaat\" \"could very well be the best film ever made about a mutated catfish\". Critic Jeffrey Kauffman said, \"this is the sort of film Ed Wood, Jr. might have made—on a bad day\" and added, \"Lovers of fantastically bad films rate \"Zaat\" one of the worst\". Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict stated, \"The acting in \"Zaat\" is below subpar. Actors seem to be whispering their lines and trying hard not to fully comprehend that they're in one of the worst films ever made\", while Michael Rubino of DVD Verdict also claimed, \"\"Zaat\" may be one of the worst films ever created\". NPR called it a \"sci-fi fiasco\" when it became \"the winner — er, loser —\" on IMDb's Bottom 100. \"Zaat\" appeared on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\", which gave it significant exposure, and was also featured on RedLetterMedia show \"Half in the Bag\" where they called it one of their favorite \"so bad it's good\" films. \"Total Film\" included it in their list of the 66 worst films of all time.\n\nThe Israeli \"An American Hippie in Israel\" is about an American hippie traveling to Israel after being involved with the Vietnam War, befriending Israeli flower children, and encountering \"menacing\" mimes along the way. The film was presumed lost, but after resurfacing 38 years after its production, it became a \"midnight sensation\" in Tel Aviv and developed a cult following akin to \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\". It was then released internationally on home video by Grindhouse Releasing. Gil Shefler of \"The Jewish Daily Forward\" described it as \"perfectly awful\", offering that it \"probably is the worst Israeli movie ever made, and a serious candidate for the worst movie of all time\". Ben Hartman of the \"Jerusalem Post\" stated the film was \"surely one of the worst films ever made in Israel, or beyond\". \"Nana 10\" said it claims the title of \"worst Israeli film and most amusing\".\n\nA loose spoof of the 1966 \"Batman\" television series cited as one of the earliest examples of a pornographic parody film, the presumably-1970s pornographic film \"Bat Pussy\" has been \"widely described\" as the worst pornographic film ever made, on account of \"some incredibly unarousing sex and a general attitude of awfulness\". Possessing no credits or copyright information, there is no known record of \"Bat Pussy\"s existence prior to the mid-1990s, when it was discovered in the storeroom of an adult movie theater in Memphis, Tennessee and subsequently released on home video by exploitation film distributor Something Weird Video. Gawker Medias io9 proclaimed the film to be \"the absolute nadir of pornography, period. Not just Batman-themed pornography. ALL pornography\", deriding its \"obese redneck\" cast as rendering the film \"wank-proof\". \"PornParody.com\", a website dedicated to pornographic parody films, acknowledged its status as \"the worst adult movie of all time\", describing \"Bat Pussy\" as \"renowned for its technical ineptness and anti-eroticism\" due to its \"physically unappealing\" actors. \"AV Maniacs\" contested \"Bat Pussy\"s categorization as pornography on the grounds of the lead actor's visible impotence and instead labeled the film \"anti-porn\", asking \"How else do you categorize an adult film that completely and utterly fails to elicit even the minutest amount of arousal in its viewers?\" The book \"The Many More Lives of Batman\" by William Uricchio and Will Brooker also labeled \"Bat Pussy\" \"the worst porn film ever made\", criticizing its poor adaptation of the source material, while Tim Lewis, the general manager of Something Weird Video, selected \"Bat Pussy\" as the one film \"so nuts it has to be seen to be believed\" out of the company's entire catalog, saying it was \"only for the truly jaded adult film viewer\".\n\n\"At Long Last Love\" was renowned director Peter Bogdanovich's musical homage to great 1930s Hollywood musicals. It features songs by Cole Porter and stars Cybill Shepherd and Burt Reynolds. Upon release, it received very negative reviews. CNN noted it was once considered \"the worst musical extravaganza in Hollywood history\". \"Esquire\" film critic John Simon said, \"it may be the worst movie musical of this – or any – decade\". \"Buffalo News\" film critic Jeff Simon wrote, \"About 45 minutes in, it became apparent to one and all that this was one of the worst and most embarrassing major-talent turkeys of all time.\" Film critic Jay Cocks has said the film was \"regarded as the great white elephant catastrophe of its time\". Hollis Alpert stated, \"This failure is so dismal that it goes beyond failure.\" It was included in the book \"The Fifty Worst Films of All Time\" and Michael Sauter's book \"The Worst Films of All Time\". It is also included in the \"Golden Turkey Awards Nominees and Winners, the Worst Achievements in Hollywood History\". Bogdanovich, who was also the screenwriter, sent press releases to newspapers across the country apologizing for this film.\n\nOne defender of the film was Roger Ebert, who stated, \"The movie's no masterpiece, but I can't account for the viciousness of some of the critical attacks against it.\" He continued, \"It's a light, silly, impeccably stylish entertainment ... if [Bogdanovich] doesn't go spectacularly right, at least he provides small pleasures and great music.\" In a recent documentary on his career, Bogdanovich lamented being influenced by studio previews to cut the film before its theatrical release. He subsequently recut it again before it debuted on cable TV the next year. A fan of the film, a studio editor who preferred the director's first cut, secretly saved that original version and quietly put it in place of the others. When news of this version streaming on Netflix reached Bogdanovich, he contacted Fox, made a few finishing touches to said version, and the result was a director's cut, making its debut on home video in 2013.\n\n\"\" is the sequel to William Friedkin's Academy Award-winning 1973 film, directed by John Boorman. While British film critic Mark Kermode called the original film his favourite film of all time, he believes the sequel to be the worst film ever made. The \"Golden Turkey Awards\" named it the second-worst film ever made, after \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\". Critic Bill Chambers stated it was \"Possibly the worst film ever made and surely the worst sequel ever made.\" It also appeared in \"\" book. Friedkin has stated this sequel diminished the value of the original and called it \"one of the worst films I've ever seen\". Eventually, the film garnered so much hate that Boorman disowned it. In an interview with Bob McCabe for the book \"The Exorcist: Out of the Shadows\", he confessed, \"The sin I committed was not giving the audience what it wanted in terms of horror.\"\n\n\"The Swarm\" is a horror film about a killer bee invasion of Texas, directed and produced by Irwin Allen. Despite its all-star cast (including Michael Caine, Henry Fonda, Richard Widmark and Olivia de Havilland), it was a box-office failure and was excoriated by reviewers. On its UK release, the \"Sunday Times\" described \"The Swarm\" as \"simply the worst film ever made\". Leslie Halliwell described it as a \"very obvious disaster movie with risible dialogue\". \"The Guardian\" article on \"The Swarm\" stated, \"You could pass it all off as a sick joke, except it cost twelve million dollars, twenty-two million bees, and several years of someone's life.\" Barry Took, reviewing it for \"Punch\", stated, \"the story is of a banality matched only by the woodenness of the acting\". \"Time Out\" magazine called \"The Swarm\" a \"risibly inadequate disaster movie\". \"The Swarm\" is included in several \"worst movie\" books, including the Medved brothers' \"The Golden Turkey Awards\", and John Wilson's book \"The Official Razzie Movie Guide\", as one of the 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made.\n\n\"I Spit on Your Grave\" became controversial for its graphic violence and lengthy depictions of gang rape. It was initially unable to find a distributor until 1980, when it received a wider release. Luke Y. Thompson of the \"New Times\" stated, \"Defenders of the film have argued that it's actually pro-woman, due to the fact that the female lead wins in the end, which is sort of like saying that cockfights are pro-rooster because there's always one left standing\". Critic David Keyes named it the worst film of the 1980s. Scott Tobias of \"The A.V. Club\" called it \"one of the era's most abhorrent pieces of exploitation trash\" and Patrick Naugle of DVD Verdict stated, \"It's one of the most soulless, vile, and morally reprehensible things I've ever had to sit through.\" Roger Ebert gave the film no stars, referring to it as \"a vile bag of garbage ... without a shred of artistic distinction,\" adding, \"Attending it was one of the most depressing experiences of my life.\" Ebert also included it on his \"most hated\" list and considered it the worst movie ever made. Gene Siskel also considered it one of the worst films ever made. Author James Livingston wrote in \"The World Turned Inside Out\" that \"I Spit on Your Grave\" was the second worst movie ever made, \"Film Racket\" featured it as their first entry in to their \"Worst Movie Ever?\" series, and \"Flavorwire\" named it the eleventh worst movie ever made. Despite the intense negative reception from some critics, the film currently has a 55% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with critics arguing that \"It shows us the raw, shocking reality of rape, in all its bloody viciousness.\"\n\nThe erotic/historical drama \"Caligula\", directed by Tinto Brass, about the infamous Roman Emperor was in part financed by \"Penthouse\" founder Bob Guccione. The film, featuring a prestigious cast (Malcolm McDowell, Helen Mirren, Peter O'Toole, and John Gielgud) is notable for its explicit scenes of sex and violence, including six minutes of hardcore porn footage filmed by Guccione and another editor. \"Caligula\" earned some prerelease controversy after Gore Vidal, who had written the script, distanced himself from the film. When \"Caligula\" was released, it received strongly hostile reviews, reviewers criticizing its extreme scenes of sex and violence and lack of narrative coherence. Rex Reed of \"New York Magazine\" called the film \"a trough of rotten swill\". Roger Ebert gave \"Caligula\" a zero stars rating, dubbing it \"sickening, utterly worthless, shameful trash\", accusing it of being artistically vulgar in its depiction of sex and violence, and of having technically incompetent direction and structure. \"Caligula\" was one of the few films Ebert ever walked out on (two hours into its 170-minute running time), after describing himself as feeling \"disgusted and unspeakably depressed\", and he also placed it on his \"Most Hated\" list. Jay Scott, reviewing \"Caligula\" for \"The Globe and Mail\", stated, \"\"Caligula\" doesn't really work on any level\" and the film and its production \"constitute a boondoggle of landmark proportions\". So negative was its initial reception, Australian newspaper \"The Age\" stated that \"Caligula\" was being \"billed by critics everywhere as one of the worst films ever made\". Leslie Halliwell dubbed it \"a vile curiosity of interest chiefly to sadomasochists\". \"The Hamilton Spectator\" later referred to \"Caligula\" as \"possibly the worst movie ever made\". Joe Holleman, in an article in the \"St. Louis Post-Dispatch\" discussing historical films set in Ancient Rome, argued, \"two of the worst movies made in the 20th century were ancient Rome pieces ... \"Cleopatra\" and \"Caligula\"\". Christopher Armstead, reviewing \"Caligula\" for the website Film Critics United, stated, \"Dollar for dollar, this could very well be the worst movie ever made.\"\n\nThe Western epic \"Heaven's Gate\", loosely based on the Johnson County War in 1890s Wyoming, was plagued by massive cost and time overruns, largely due to director Michael Cimino's extreme attention to detail. He demanded 50 takes of at least one scene, and refused to start shooting for another until a cloud he liked rolled across the sky. It cost over $44 million, but brought in only $3.5 million at the box office. The original version ran at nearly four hours, but was yanked from release after only one week due to scathing reviews. It later resurfaced in a 149-minute version, but by then the damage was done. Vincent Canby famously called it \"an unqualified disaster\", among other things. Roger Ebert called it \"the most scandalous cinematic waste I've ever seen\".\n\nAfter word of his grandiose spending and defiant nature toward studio United Artists got out (detailed in \"Final Cut\" by Steven Bach, a studio executive involved with the film from the beginning) Cimino was awarded the 1980 Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Director, and the film was nominated for four more Razzies, including Worst Picture. In February 2010, the readers of \"Empire\" voted it the sixth-worst film of all time. That same year, Joe Queenan of \"The Guardian\" also called it the worst film ever made, saying that much of it was \"beyond belief\". Cimino was initially considered a director on the rise after directing \"The Deer Hunter\" (which won five Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director), but his reputation never recovered after \"Heaven's Gate\". The production is also notorious for the cruelty to animals that occurred both on screen and on site, including deliberately killing a horse with explosives. The film effectively ended not only the existence of United Artists as an independent Hollywood studio (its parent firm sold the company to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where it still operates), but also, largely, Cimino's career — he would not direct again until 1985's \"Year of the Dragon\".\n\nDespite the vicious reviews, the film's reputation improved over time. In fall 2012, the New York Film Festival, the venue for its infamous opening, premiered the restored director's cut. In stark contrast, the \"Times\" called the restored version \"a modern masterpiece\" and its 1980 cut \"one of the greatest injustices of cinematic history\". The film has also been released on Blu-ray and DVD by the Criterion Collection, a home video label that specializes in critically acclaimed and \"important\" films. Manohla Dargis of \"The New York Times\" said that the movie \"has been called a disaster and a disgrace, yet also anointed a masterpiece\". Kris Kristofferson has consistently defended both the film and Cimino, stating at one point that he hoped Cimino would \"get the chance to sin again\" by being hired to direct an ambitious, big-budget project where his talents would be more successful.\n\nA disco rock opera set in 1994, \"The Apple\" (also known as \"Star Rock\") focuses on a young pair of singers, Alphie (George Gilmour) and Bibi (Catherine Mary Stewart) who become entangled with the corrupt Mr. Boogalow (Vladek Sheybal). \"The Apple\" was directed by Menahem Golan, who hoped the film would imitate the success of other music-oriented films such as \"Saturday Night Fever\" and \"Grease\". Upon release in the US, \"The Apple\" was critically savaged and was a commercial failure. One \"Hollywood legend\" states that the audience at \"The Apple's\" premiere were so angry at the film that they threw their promotional copies of the film's soundtrack at the screen. Sean Burns in the \"Philadelphia Weekly\" gave the film a very negative review: \"\"The Apple\" isn't just the worst disco musical ever made; it could very well be the worst movie ever made, period.\" Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict described \"The Apple\" as \"a gamy glitterdome of outrageous kitsch passing itself off as a futuristic fable\". Gibron criticized the film's musical numbers as being inept and added \"\"The Apple\" should be a celebration of all that is camp. Instead, it's just seriously disturbed.\" Eric Henderson of \"Slant\" magazine gave \"The Apple\" one star out of four and said \"every song in the goddamned movie sucks\". Henderson added that \"The Apple's\" \"relentless bad taste is sure to appeal to the same audience that won't even realize they're being slapped in the face\". Nathan Rabin of \"The A.V. Club\" reviewing \"The Apple\" for his \"My Year Of Flops\" series, said \"The peculiar genius of \"The Apple\" is that every time it appears that the film cannot get any crazier, it ratchets up the weirdness to almost indescribable levels. It belongs to the curious subset of movies so all-consumingly druggy and surreal that they make audiences feel baked out of their minds even when they're stone-cold sober.\" In 2013, \"The Apple\" was released as a video on demand from RiffTrax. This edition features a satirical commentary on \"The Apple\" done by the former stars of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" – Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett.\n\nThe war movie \"Inchon\", directed by Terence Young and starring Laurence Olivier as General Douglas MacArthur, was meant to depict the Battle of Inchon during the Korean War. Producer Mitsuharu Ishii was a senior member of the Japanese branch of the Unification Church, whose leader, Sun Myung Moon, claimed he had the film made to show MacArthur's spirituality and connection to God and the Japanese people. Its eventual production cost of $46 million resulted in a $5 million box office gross, and \"The New York Times\" review written by Vincent Canby calls the movie \"the most expensive B-movie ever\". \"The Washington Post\" described \"Inchon\" as \"one of the biggest commercial disasters in film history\". Every conceivable kind of problem plagued production, including labor issues, the U.S. military withdrawing support due to the film's Unification Church connection, weather and natural disasters, customs difficulties, expensive directorial blunders, and the original director (Andrew McLaglen) quitting before the start of production. Olivier's performance was roundly panned and he was awarded the 1982 Golden Raspberry award for Worst Actor. The film itself took the 1982 Razzies for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay, and Young's direction earned him a tie for Worst Director of 1982. A number of reviewers at various media outlets described \"Inchon\" as the worst film ever made, including \"The Washington Post\", \"Newsweek\", \"TV Guide\", and the Canadian Press. \"Inchon\" was later profiled in multiple books on worst in film, including \"The Hollywood Hall of Shame\" by Harry and Michael Medved, and \"The Worst Movies of All Time\" by Michael Sauter. To date, \"Inchon\" has never been released on home video in the United States.\n\nThe adventure film \"Tarzan, the Ape Man\", loosely based on the novel \"Tarzan of the Apes\" by Edgar Rice Burroughs, stars Miles O'Keefe in the title role and Bo Derek as his partner Jane Parker, and is told from Jane's point of view. Despite being a box office success, it was widely panned by critics upon its release due to its poor screenplay, bad acting, and unintentional humor. Leonard Maltin, writing for his \"Movie Guide\", stated that the film \"lacks action, humor and charm\", and considered it so bad that it \"nearly forced editors of this book to devise a rating lower than BOMB\". Leslie Halliwell was equally harsh; he described \"Tarzan, the Ape Man\" as \"certainly the worst of the Tarzan movies and possibly the most banal film so far made; even the animals give poor performances\". Writer Thomas S. Hischak described it thus: \"Produced and directed without a shred of talent by John Derek, \"Tarzan, the Ape Man\" often ranks high in the lists of the worst movies ever made.\" Film critic John Nesbit considered it \"my pick for worst film ever\", while Matt Brinson of \"Creative Loafing\" wrote, \"this cinematic atrocity truly is one of the all-time worsts\". \"Tarzan, the Ape Man\" was nominated for six awards at the 2nd Golden Raspberry Awards, winning one for Worst Actress (Derek). It currently holds an 11% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 19 reviews.\n\n\"Mommie Dearest\" was based on the memoir of the same name by Christina Crawford about her upbringing by Joan Crawford. It was the first film to sweep the Golden Raspberry Awards nominations, winning a total of five Razzies out of the nine nominations, including \"Worst Picture\" and Worst Actress (Faye Dunaway, shared with Bo Derek). The same organization also named it \"Worst Picture of the Decade\" in 1989/90, and was nominated for \"Worst Drama of Our First 25 Years\" in 2004/05. The film is part of the \"100 most awful\" in the book \"\". Entertainment writer Michael Sauter included the film in his book \"The Worst Movies of All Time\". It earned, as film critic and television host Richard Crouse put it, \"some of the nastiest reviews ever\". Eric Henderson of \"CBS Minneapolis\" named it at the top of his \"Best 'Worst Movies Ever list. Roger Ebert wrote of this film, \"I can't imagine who would want to subject themselves to this movie. \"Mommie Dearest\" is a painful experience that drones on endlessly, as Joan Crawford's relationship with her daughter, Christina, disintegrates from cruelty through jealousy into pathos.\" Of the performance of Faye Dunaway, \"Variety\" said \"Dunaway does not chew scenery. Dunaway starts neatly at each corner of the set in every scene and swallows it whole, co-stars and all.\"\n\nDespite the reviews at the time, the film was a box office success, grossing $39 million worldwide on a $5 million budget. It currently has a 55% rating on \"Rotten Tomatoes\". In its summary \"Rotten Tomatoes\" wrote, \"The 1981 film version of this tome was evidently meant to be taken seriously, but the operatic direction by Frank Perry and the over-the-top portrayal of Joan Crawford by Faye Dunaway (whose makeup is remarkable) has always seemed to inspire loud laughter whenever and wherever the film is shown.\"\n\nThe Turkish science-fiction adventure \"Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam\" (also commonly known as \"Turkish Star Wars\") was directed by Çetin İnanç and starred Cüneyt Arkın. It is notorious for illegally using footage from well known science fiction films and shows, most notably \"Star Wars\", along with stealing the music score from films such as \"Moonraker\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". The film is also criticized for its nonsensical plot, badly written dialogue, and crude special effects. Jos Kirps of ArticlesBase called it \"The Worst Movie Ever\", and stated, \"There are many bad sci-fi movies, and for many years movie addicts even considered Ed Wood's \"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" the worst movie of all times. But \"Plan 9\" is still a pretty good movie when compared to \"Dünyayi Kurtaran Adam\".\" \"Sabah\" called it the \"world's worst film\". \"Hürriyet\" described the film as \"sitting on the throne of the king\" when compared to other \"so bad it's good\" cult films. \"Toronto Standard\" called it a \"dollar-store Star Wars\" and compared it to the works of Ed Wood. After a strong worldwide cult developed around the film, a sequel, \"The Son of the Man Who Saved the World\" (\"Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam'ın Oğlu\"), was shot in 2006 and featured many returning members of the original cast and crew.\n\nThe American Dance film \"Staying Alive\" sequel to the 1977 musical film \"Saturday Night Fever\" starring John Travolta. It was blasted by film critics with comments such as \"It lacked the heart\" and \"It lacked the interesting characters of \"Saturday Night Fever.\"\" It The film hold a score of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews and with the consensus being \"This sequel to \"Saturday Night Fever\" is shockingly embarrassing and unnecessary, trading the original's dramatic depth for a series of uninspired dance sequences.\" The film was nominated for 3 Golden Raspberry Awards for Worst Actor (John Travolta), Worst New Star (Finola Hughes), and Worst Supporting Actress (Finola Hughes)\n\nProduced by George Lucas and based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name, \"Howard the Duck\" received overwhelmingly negative reviews from film critics. \"Orange Coast Magazine\" writer Marc Weinberg and Leonard Maltin criticized the decision to shoot the film in live action. Maltin described it as a \"hopeless mess ... a gargantuan production which produces a gargantuan headache\". The appearance of Howard was criticized as being unconvincing due to his poorly functioning mouth, drunkenness, perverted tendencies, and expressionless face. Reviewers also criticized the acting and humor and found the film boring. Jay Carr of \"The Boston Globe\" claimed that \"They Don't Get Much Worse Than \"Howard\"\", Glenn Heath Jr. of \"Slant Magazine\" wrote that it \"has a rightful place in the canon of worst films ever\", and \"TV Guide\" states it is \"one of the worst big-budget movies ever made\". Film website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 15% based on 32 reviews, making it the lowest-rated Lucasfilm production of those reviewed on the site. The site's consensus states: \"While it has its moments, \"Howard the Duck\" suffers from an uneven tone and mediocre performances.\" It received seven Golden Raspberry Award nominations in 1987 including Worst Supporting Actor (Tim Robbins), Worst Director (Willard Huyck) and Worst Original Song (\"Howard the Duck\"). It won four trophies for Worst Screenplay, Worst New Star (\"the six guys and gals in the duck suit\"), Worst Visual Effects, and Worst Picture, tied with \"Under the Cherry Moon\". The movie won also a Stinkers Bad Movie Awards for Worst Picture. \"Howard the Duck\" was also featured in \"Empire\"s poll of the 50 worst films ever made. The negative reaction to the film took its toll on the cast, who found themselves unable to work on other projects as a result.\n\n\"Ishtar\" was written and directed by Elaine May and starred Academy Award-winning duo Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman as Rogers and Clarke, two untalented lounge singers who travel to Morocco in hopes of finding a gig. Due to unanticipated problems with filming in the desert—which resulted in numerous reshoots—the film ran over budget by $30 million. While its final budget cost was $55 million, \"Ishtar\" earned only $14,375,181 at the North American box office leading \"Ishtar\" to become synonymous with \"box office flop\". It was also subject to harsh reviews from critics. Roger Ebert stated that \"\"Ishtar\" is a truly dreadful film, a lifeless, massive, lumbering exercise in failed comedy\"; Gene Siskel called it \"shockingly dull\" and \"dim-witted\"; and together they selected it as the worst film of 1987 on \"Siskel & Ebert & The Movies\". The film was nominated for Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay in the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards, winning one for Worst Director. \"San Jose Mercury News\" claimed that \"Time has not improved this film's reputation as being one of the worst ever made.\" \"Time Out\" suggested it was \"so bad it could have been deliberate\", and called it \"one of the worst films ever made\", while \"Hot Air\" referred to it as \"The \"Citizen Kane\" of big-budget, A-list vehicular homicides.\" It was included in Michael Sauter's \"The Worst Movies of All Time\" book and Richard Roeper included it on his list of the 40 worst films he had seen. In 1999 \"Time\" placed the film on a list of the 100 worst ideas of the 20th century.\n\n\"Nukie\" is a 1987 South African film directed by Sias Odendaal (credited as Sias Odendal) and Michael Pakleppa, and starring Steve Railsback, Ronald France, and Glynis Johns. The plot concerns an alien, Nukie, who crash lands on earth and seeks help from two children to reunite with his brother, Miko, who has been captured by the U.S. government. The film was heavily inspired by Steven Spielberg's 1982 film \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\". Simon Abrams of Politico wrote that \"Nukie\" was worse than 1988 \"E.T.\" knock-off, \"Mac and Me\", writing that it is \"probably the most incompetent \"E.T.\" ripoff of any time period ... While \"Mac and Me\" was just rotten and ill-conceived, \"Nukie\" is uniquely perplexing\". Critic Brad Jones has said that \"Nukie\" is the worst film he has ever reviewed. \"Total Film\" named \"Nukie\" the worst kids movie ever made. They also named it one of the worst science-fiction films ever made.\n\n\"\" was the last film in the Christopher Reeve series of Superman films, and co-starred Mark Pillow as the villain Nuclear Man. Despised by fans and critics alike, it is the lowest-grossing film in the series, only taking in $15,681,020 at the North American box office. Many critics pointed out the film's poor screenplay, acting, and special effects (such as a scene in which Superman repairs the Great Wall of China with his super-vision), while some have criticized it for its lack of attention to the comic book source material. Such special effects led Rita Kempley of \"The Washington Post\" to call it \"one of the cheesiest movies ever made\". Film critic Jeffrey Lyles voiced similar hatred, claiming that the film \"isn't just one of the worst comic book films, it's one of the worst films ever made\". Currently, \"Superman IV\" holds a 12% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 41 reviews. It appears on \"Empire\"'s list of the 50 worst movies of all time, as well as the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list. The film was nominated for two Razzies at the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Supporting Actress (Mariel Hemingway) and Worst Visual Effects.\n\n\"The Garbage Pail Kids Movie\" is a live-action adaptation of the then-popular trading card series of the same name, itself a gross-out parody of the Cabbage Patch Kids dolls. The title characters are depicted by dwarf actors in low budget costumes, with poorly functioning mouths and expressionless faces. The film is often criticized for its gross-out humor, nonsensical plot, poor explanations, bad acting, and the creepy appearance of the Garbage Pail Kids. It has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Caryn James of \"The New York Times\" said the movie is \"too repulsive for children or adults of any age\" and is \"enough to make you believe in strict and faraway boarding schools\". Carlos Coto of the \"Sun-Sentinel\" called it \"one of the worst ever made\". Much of its content is said to be inappropriate for children, its intended audience. Throughout the movie, the Garbage Pail Kids steal, get in fights, bite toes off people, fart in people's faces, threaten others with switchblades, urinate upon themselves, and run over cars. In addition to scatological behavior, the movie has several scenes that feature sexual images, violence, and drinking. Offended parents launched a nationwide protest of the movie that successfully resulted in the movie being withdrawn from circulation. The shortened release contributed to the movie's poor gross of only $1,576,615. It was nominated for three Razzies at the 8th Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Visual Effects, Worst New Star for the Garbage Pail Kids collectively, and Worst Original Song.\n\n\"Leonard Part 6\", starring (as well as written and produced by) Bill Cosby, was intended as a parody of spy movies. Leonard Parker, a former CIA spy, is brought out of retirement to save the world from an evil vegetarian who brainwashes animals to kill people. It has also been cited as one of the worst movies of all time, earning Golden Raspberrys for Worst Actor (Cosby), Worst Picture, and Worst Screenplay. It was also nominated for two more Razzie Awards, for Worst Supporting Actress and Worst Director. Cosby himself disowned the film, and when it was released to theatres he publicly advised people not to see it. Rita Kempley at \"The Washington Post\" noted the large number of Coca-Cola product placements and said \"The only good thing about Bill Cosby's \"Leonard Part 6\" is that we didn't have to see Parts 1 through 5.\" Scott Weinberg at DVD Talk noted the film as \"truly one of the worst movies you'll ever see ... movies this bad should be handled with Teflon gloves and a pair of tongs\". Kevin Thomas at the \"Los Angeles Times\" said \"There's virtually nothing to laugh at in this film, and too much of everything else.\" \"Total Film\" included \"Leonard Part 6\" on their list of the \"66 Worst Films of all Time\".\n\n\"Hobgoblins\", by Rick Sloane, is widely considered a blatant rip-off that capitalizes on the popularity of the 1984 film \"Gremlins\". It gained popularity in 1998 after being featured on an episode of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". \"MST3K\" writer Paul Chaplin later commented on \"Hobgoblins\", saying, \"Oh, man. You have no idea the torture it was to watch this movie several times in the space of a week. It shoots right to the top of the list of the worst movies we've ever done.\" Specific points of the film that were lampooned was the extreme misogyny and atrocious treatment of women, the film's technical incompetence and repetitive scenes, its moronic, very poorly conceived plot, its dreadful acting, its ugly look and its preference towards rather needless vulgarity, particularly in regards to its characters and subject matter. Greg Muskewitz at Efilmcritic.com called it \"Jim Henson's worst nightmare\", while David Cornelius of DVD Talk stated, \"There's not one aspect of this movie that isn't the Worst Thing Ever.\" After seeing the \"MST3K\" episode himself, Sloane was inspired to direct a sequel, which was released in 2009.\n\n\"Mac and Me\" is about a young boy in a wheelchair who meets and befriends an alien who has crash-landed on Earth. The decision to make it was based on the success of \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (the title itself, \"Mac and Me\", comes from the working title for \"E.T.\"—\"E.T. and Me\"), as well as to serve as a marketing vehicle for Coca-Cola and McDonald's. One scene in the film is a large, impromptu dance-off with the alien (dressed in a teddy bear costume), a football team, Ronald McDonald, and various other people inside and outside of a McDonald's restaurant. The film's cast list states \"and Ronald McDonald as Himself\". \"Mac and Me\" has a rating of 0% on Rotten Tomatoes, and Leonard Maltin referred to it as \"more like a TV commercial than a movie\". Scott Weinberg of eFilmcritic.com called it \"Quite possibly one of the worst movies of the past 435 years\" and Marjorie Baumgarten of the \"Austin Chronicle\" called it a \"shameless \"E.T.\" knockoff\". Filmmaker Morgan Spurlock asserted that \"It's the worst, worst, worst, worst, worst thing you'll ever see in your entire life.\" Spurlock also cited the film as the most egregious example of product placement. It was nominated for four Razzie Awards including Worst Picture and Worst Screenplay and won two trophies, Worst Director for Stewart Raffill (tied with Blake Edwards for \"Sunset\") and Worst New Star for Ronald McDonald in a small cameo.\n\nThis Canadian low budget, independent, horror exploitation film \"Things\" was written and produced by Andrew Jordan & Barry J. Gillis. It cost approximately $35,000 in total to make and marked the mainstream film debut of porn star Amber Lynn. It was ostensibly made as homage to horror icons and films, such as George A. Romero and his \"Night of the Living Dead\". \"They Came From Within: A History of Canadian Horror Cinema\" author Caelum Vatnsdal described \"Things\" as \"the worst Canadian horror film ever made\". \"Critic Online\" called it \"definitely one of the worst atrocities ever committed to film\". \"Severed Cinema\" announced that \"a new generation of horror fans and people who have been desperately seeking this glistening turd for years can now experience this infamous abomination\". \"Cinema Sewer\" magazine has repeatedly proclaimed that \"this is the worst movie ever made\". Robin Bougie, its founder and editor, wrote \"I don't mean [\"bad\"] like the way Troma makes bad movies. I'm talking about bad with the best of intentions, like all of the best \"bad\" movies. You like tormenting yourself with hilariously trashy, moronic, gory, \"idiotic\" bad films? \"Things\" is the fucking \"king\" of bad movies. This is the movie you put on when you have a get together of pals — and just blow them away. Trust me, you have never seen anything like this in your life. It's absolutely astonishing in how it is able to \"mentally wreck\" anyone who watches it.\" Jeff Kirschner of Dread Central has also named it the worst movie ever made. \"Things\" was covered in an episode of RedLetterMedia show \"Half in the Bag\"; during the discussion Jay Bauman stated that \"Things\" was \"probably one of the worst movies ever made\", to which Mike Stoklasa replied \"I would remove 'probably'.\"\n\nDespite its title, \"Troll 2\" is notable in part for not featuring any trolls (the antagonists are actually goblins) and having no relation to the original \"Troll\", which was also poorly reviewed. Released in relative obscurity, was re-taken by the public in later years; NPR claims that it is \"known as the worst movie of all time\" while \"The A.V. Club\" calls it \"a popular candidate for the worst film ever made\". Rumsey Taylor of \"Not Coming to a Theater Near You\" opined that it was \"one of the worst films I’ve ever seen\". Ken Hanke of \"Mountain Xpress\" gave it one-half star out of five, and famously stated in his review, \"There are movies that are bad. There are movies that are so-bad-they're-good. And then there's \"Troll 2\"—a movie that's so bad that it defies comprehension.\" In addition, \"TV Guide\" proclaimed that \"\"Troll 2\" is really as bad as they come.\" , the film had a 6% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Nearly twenty years after its release, the movie's child star, Michael Stephenson, made a documentary about its production and fanbase titled \"Best Worst Movie\", released to critical success in 2009.\n\nThe French-British film \"\" is a sequel to the cult film \"Highlander,\" which transitions the fantasy of the original film into science fiction, and retcons the mystical warriors of the first film into aliens. It was met with harsh criticism by both critics and audiences. Based on 23 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film currently holds a 0% \"Rotten\" rating, all 23 reviews being negative. Common criticisms included the lack of motivation for the characters, the blatant disregard for established characters and background set in the first film (such as the new and seemingly incongruent origin for the Immortals), the massive number of gigantic plot holes, the film's messy, nonsensical story structure, the filmmaker's inability to balance out the rather unrelated plots and subplots involved, the unexplained resurrection of Ramirez, and rampantly apparent contradictions in the film's internal logic. Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave it a score of 0.5 stars (out of four), saying: \"\"Highlander II: The Quickening\" is the most hilariously incomprehensible movie I've seen in many a long day—a movie almost awesome in its badness. Wherever science fiction fans gather, in decades and generations to come, this film will be remembered in hushed tones as one of the immortal low points of the genre.\" He continued, saying \"If there is a planet somewhere whose civilization is based on the worst movies of all time, \"Highlander 2: The Quickening\" deserves a sacred place among their most treasured artifacts\", naming it the worst film of 1991. Giving the film a score of 2 out of 10, IGN's review said: \"How bad is this movie? Well, imagine if Ed Wood were alive today, and someone gave him a multi-million dollar budget. See his imagination running rampant, bringing in aliens from outer space with immensely powerful firearms, immortals who bring each other back to life by calling out their names, epic duels on flying skateboards, and a blatant disregard for anything logical or previously established—now you are starting to get closer to the vision of \"Highlander II\".\" Awarding the film one star out of five, Christopher Null of Filmcritic.com said, \"\"Highlander\" has become a bit of a joke, and here's where the joke started. ... Incomprehensible doesn't even begin to explain it. This movie is the equivalent of the 'Hey, look over there!' gag. You look, and the guy you wanted to beat up has run away and hid.\"\n\nIn 1995, the film's director Russell Mulcahy made a director's cut version known as \"Highlander 2: Renegade Version\" and then later released another version simply known as \"Highlander 2: The Special Edition\" for its 2004 DVD release. The film was reconstructed on both occasions largely from existing material, with certain scenes removed and others added back in, and the entire sequence of events changed. The reconstructed film's reception was far better than the original's; it was elevated to a mixed reception.\n\nThe Italian erotic thriller \"Cattive ragazze (Bad Girls)\" was directed by gossip columnist Marina Ripa Di Meana, and stars Eva Grimaldi as a recently divorced woman falling in love with a male stripper, alongside a cast of big names such as Anita Ekberg and Burt Young. The production received bad publicity, as it was made using money from the country's Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities. Paolo Mereghetti in his film encyclopaedia \"Dizionario dei Film\" described the film as a \"vapid mess that can only serve those incapable of understanding what cinema is\", and considered it able to \"compete for the title of worst film in cinema history and win!\" G. Giraud wrote in \"Il Lavoro\", that \"Cattive ragazze\" \"does not resemble anything in a real movie, or even recall anything previously seen at the cinema, even in its worst\". Film critic Marco Giusti refers to it as \"one of the pillars of Italian trash cinema\". While \"Cattive ragazze\" was Ripa Di Meana's directorial debut, she has not made another film since.\n\nThe Rob Reiner film \"North\" is an adaptation of the novel \"North: The Tale of a 9-Year-Old Boy Who Becomes a Free Agent and Travels the World in Search of the Perfect Parents\" by Alan Zweibel, who also wrote the screenplay and has a minor role in the film. \"North\", which was also Scarlett Johansson's film debut, was a critical and commercial failure, earning only $7,138,449 worldwide. It was widely criticized for its plot, its all-star cast of insensitive characters, lack of humor, references to pedophilia, and portrayal of numerous ethnic stereotypes. It has a 15% approval rating at Rotten Tomatoes. Roger Ebert gave it zero stars and, in his review, infamously wrote \"I hated this movie. Hated, hated, hated, hated, \"hated\" this movie. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it. Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it. Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it.\" He continued saying \"\"North\" is a bad film – one of the worst movies ever made\", and it is also on his list of most hated films. Both Ebert and Gene Siskel named \"North\" as the worst film of 1994. Mick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" said in his review that \"\"North\" is director Rob Reiner's first flat-out failure, a sincerely wrought, energetically made picture that all the same crashes on takeoff. It's strange and oddly distasteful, at its best managing to be bad in some original and unexpected ways.\" Richard Roeper named \"North\" as one of the 40 worst movies he has ever seen, saying that, \"Of all the films on this list, \"North\" may be the most difficult to watch from start to finish.\" The film was nominated for the following awards at the 15th Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Bruce Willis, also for \"Color of Night\"), Worst Supporting Actress (Kathy Bates), Worst Supporting Actor (Dan Aykroyd, also for \"Exit to Eden\"), Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay (Andrew Scheinman and Alan Zweibel).\n\nThe Norwegian romantic film \"Dis – en historie om kjærlighet\" was directed by Aune Sand. The film follows different couples and their love stories around the world, in Cairo, Normandy, Oslo and New York City. \"Dis\" received universaly poor reviews by critics, and has been called the most poorly reviewed Norwegian film in history. Critic Harald Kolstad of \"Dagsavisen\" gave it a score of zero, refused to acknowledge \"Dis\" as a film, and claimed to have never seen anything worse. \"Aftenposten\" referred to the film as \"the largest turkey\" and \"the most reviled film\". Despite being a critical disaster it became a commercial success, gaining cult film status with a following akin to \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\", with fans embracing its \"so bad it's good\" qualities. Director Aune Sand insists that \"Dis\" is a masterpiece.\n\nA large amount of hype of \"Showgirls\" was put behind promoting the sex and nudity in this NC-17 French-American film with a $45 million budget, but the final result was critically derided. Most of the hype revolved around the film's star, Elizabeth Berkley, who only two years before had been one of the stars of the Saturday morning teen sitcom \"Saved by the Bell\". The film won seven Razzie Awards, a record at that time, and received 13 nominations, a record that still stands. It received an additional award at the 20th Golden Raspberry Awards, where it was awarded Worst Picture of the Decade. Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called it, \"a film of thunderous oafishness that gives adult subject matter the kind of bad name it does not need or deserve\", while Rob Gonsalves of eFilmCritic.com stated, \"Even the grossest porn is more cheerfully sexual than this movie.\" Michael Dequina of TheMovieReport.com also criticised the film, claiming that it was \"the best bad filmmaking Hollywood has to offer\". Stephen Lynch of the \"Knight Ridder/Tribune\" named it the worst movie ever made, calling it \"so bad it may be brilliant\". Rotten Tomatoes selected it as one of 25 movies that are so bad they're unmissable while \"Empire\" featured it on its poll of the worst films ever made. \"Showgirls\" was also featured in Michael Sauter's \"The Worst Movies of All Time\" book as well as \"\". The edited R-rated version, which director Paul Verhoeven developed for video outlets that would not carry NC-17 films, deletes about three minutes of the more graphic sex scenes. TBS has broadcast the film on television in its prime time schedule, but this version adds digitally animated solid black underwear to hide breasts and genitalia. This version has also been broadcast by VH1 as part of its \"Movies That Rock\" series. It currently holds a 19% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 47 reviews.\n\nA comedy-drama directed by Andrew Bergman, based on a novel by Carl Hiaasen, \"Striptease\" centers on a woman (Demi Moore) who becomes a stripper in order to fund an appeal for custody of her daughter. The film was criticised as boring and humourless, and was also accused of being a vanity project for Moore. Daniel P. Franklin, discussing \"Striptease\" in his book \"Politics and Film: The Political Culture of Film in the United States\" stated \"This is the worst film ever made.\" Joe Queenan cited \"Striptease\" as an example of what he considered the poor quality of contemporary Hollywood cinema: \"One thing that I admire about films like \"Striptease\" is that they serve as powerful reminders that on any given day, Hollywood has the potential to release the worst film in history.\" Richard Schickel in \"Time\", also criticised the film: \"Bergman ... misses Hiaasen's strength: setting mean-funny characters spinning through lowlife milieus ... the crazy, nothing-to-lose anarchy of people living below the margin and beyond the fringe is not within Bergman's fastidious reach.\" Leonard Maltin stated that \"Striptease\" was \"Not funny enough, or dramatic enough, or sexy enough, or bad enough, to qualify as entertainment in \"any\" category.\" Brian D. Johnson of \"Maclean's\" stated \"While \"Showgirls\" was honestly sleazy, \"Striptease\" is tacky, pretentious – and boring. Trying to be a comedy, a morality tale and a titillating sideshow, \"Striptease\" fails on all counts.\" \"Striptease\" was awarded six Golden Raspberry awards, for Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Actress (Moore), Worst Original Song (\"(Pussy Pussy Pussy) Whose Kitty Cat Are You?\"), and Worst Screen Couple (Moore and Burt Reynolds).\n\nThe French romance film \"Le Jour et la Nuit\" was directed by philosopher Bernard-Henri Lévy. It follows a French author who fled to Mexico for a quiet life and an actress who is willing to seduce him to get a part in a film adapted from one of his books. Before its release, \"Le Jour et la Nuit\" was heavily promoted in many French newspapers and magazines. When the film premiered at the Berlin International Film Festival in 1997, hundreds of journalists walked out of the screening and those that stayed audibly ridiculed it. Following its release, \"Le Jour et la Nuit\" was very harshly criticized by the French media. Gérard Lefort of \"Libération\" described the film as \"BHL pedalling through guacamole\", and it was also panned by \"Le Monde\" and \"Le Nouvel Observateur\". The film also did poorly commercially, with only 73,147 seats for \"Le Jour et la Nuit\" having been sold two months after its release. \"Le Jour et la Nuit\" was considered the worst French film since 1945 by film magazine \"Cahiers du cinéma\", and considered as a possible \"worst film in history\" by the French version of \"Slate\". \"Variety\" said the film was -out-loud awful without touching the cult realm of 'so bad it's good, Françoise Giroud stated that a bad movie, there's no question\", and \"L'Humanité\" called it an \"Absolute debacle\". An original documentary, \"Anatomy of a Massacre\", was released with the \"Le Jour et la Nuit\" DVD, and focused on its intense negative reception and failure.\n\n\"Batman & Robin\" is a superhero film based on the DC character Batman and is the fourth and final installment of the Burton/Schumacher Batman film series. It is directed by Joel Schumacher and stars George Clooney as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Arnold Schwarzenegger as Mr. Freeze, Uma Thurman as Poison Ivy, Chris O'Donnell as Robin/Dick Grayson, Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl/Barbara Wilson and Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth. This film was largely criticized for its toyetic and camp approach, Mr. Freeze's approach and one-line jokes, as well as its possible homosexual innuendo. As of June 2017, review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 10% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 86 reviews, certifying it \"Rotten\" with an average rating of 3.7/10, and the Critics Consensus: \"Joel Schumacher's tongue-in-cheek attitude hits an unbearable limit in \"Batman & Robin\", resulting in a frantic and mindless movie that's too jokey to care much for.\" By comparison Metacritic collected an average score of 28/100, based on 21 reviews. \"International Business Times\" included it on its list of Hollywood's top five worst movies ever made. Michael J. Nelson, of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" fame, wrote of the movie in his book, \"Movie Megacheese\", \"\"Batman & Robin\" is not the worst movie ever. No, indeed. It's the worst thing ever. Yes, it's the single worst thing that we as human beings have ever produced in recorded history.\" \"Batman & Robin\" also came in first in an \"Empire\" poll of the 50 worst films ever. Joel Schumacher apologized to disappointed fans on the 2005 DVD release of \"Batman & Robin\".\n\nAn adaptation of the popular 1960s British series of the same name, \"The Avengers\" starred Ralph Fiennes as John Steed and Uma Thurman as Emma Peel, with Sean Connery as their antagonist, Sir August de Wynter. It was directed by Jeremiah S. Chechik. \"The Avengers\" began to receive negative publicity after Warner Bros., the film's distributor, refused to allow any early press-screenings for movie reviewers. After early test screenings, \"The Avengers\" was heavily edited by the studio. On its release, \"The Avengers\" was savaged by film critics, with \"The Birmingham Post\" stating \"\"The Avengers\" is being slated by critics as the worst film ever made\" and adding that one reviewer had joked the film was such a \"turkey\" that the makers should have handed distribution to the poultry chain Bernard Matthews. Several reviewers disparaged \"The Avengers\" for lacking the wit and excitement of its source material. Janet Maslin strongly criticised \"The Avengers\": \"With pseudo-suave repartee that would make Austin Powers blush and with so many shades of \"Howard the Duck\" that one scene depicts man-size pastel teddy bears sitting around a conference table, it's a film to gall fans of the old television series and perplex anyone else. I can't remember another Friday morning show where I heard actual cries of \"Ugh!\" on the way out the door\" and finished her review with, \"At a pared-down, barely rational 100 minutes, \"The Avengers\" is short but not short enough.\" David Bianculli said \"This \"Avengers\" film is so horrendously, painfully and thoroughly awful, it gives other cinematic clunkers like \"Ishtar\" and \"Howard the Duck\" a good name.\" Alan Jones in \"The Radio Times\" stated \"The cult 1960s TV series gets royally shafted by Hollywood in this stunningly designed blockbuster that's stunningly awful in every other department ... Terrible special effects and zero chemistry between Fiennes and Thurman make this notorious disaster a total waste of everyone's time and energy.\" \"The Avengers\" also shared a Razzie Award for \"Worst Remake or Sequel\" with the 1998 adaptations of \"Psycho\" and \"Godzilla\" at the 19th Golden Raspberry Awards. \"Total Film\" magazine later voted Fiennes and Thurman in \"The Avengers\" as \"The Worst Movie Double Act Of All Time\". The film also appeared on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films.\n\nThe Brazilian film \"Cinderela Baiana\" was directed by Conrado Sanchez and stars former É o Tchan! dancer Carla Perez in the lead role. It is a heavily fictionalized biographical account of Perez's early life and how she came into fame. Despite starring an all-star cast, including Alexandre Pires, then-Perez's boyfriend and a very popular singer in Brazil at the time, the movie was criticized for its campy dialogue, badly written script, numerous plot holes and ludicrous acting, to the point of Perez herself disowning the film years later. It was a box office bomb, and it was some time later banned from circulation by request of Perez herself. It was also the debut of a then-unknown Lázaro Ramos, who used his salary to pay for acting classes. On March 15, 2010, Brazilian magazine \"Veja\" made a Top 10 list of the worst Brazilian movies of all time, and \"Cinderela Baiana\" was featured in first place. The reviewer, Pollyane Lima e Silva, called the film \"a shame\". Author Renzo Mora included it in his \"25 Movies That Can Ruin Your Life\" book, while Luis Nassif claimed that, \"For me this is the worst of all.\"\n\nThe British black comedy \"Parting Shots\" was the last film directed by Michael Winner. It starred rock musician Chris Rea as a man who, told he has only six months to live, begins murdering people who have wronged him. \"Parting Shots\" was accused of being poorly acted, filmed and scripted, as well as treating murder flippantly. Andrew Collins took a very negative view of the film: \"\"Parting Shots\" ... is going to set the course of British film-making back 20 years. It is not only the worst British film produced in this country since \"Carry On Emmannuelle\" (quite a feat in itself), it is a thoroughbred contender for the crown of Worst Film Ever Made.\" Christopher Tookey was even more harsh, stating: \"\"Parting Shots\" is not only the most horrible torture for audiences that Winner has ever devised. It is also profoundly offensive, even by Winner standards\" and later called \"Parting Shots\" \"the most tasteless, abysmal comedy of all time\". Tookey also stated that Winner had \"established himself, over his last dozen films, as beyond doubt the worst director of all time\". In an interview about the film, Charlotte O'Sullivan, the \"Independent\"'s film editor, claimed \"Parting Shots\" was \"the worst film I've ever seen\". O'Sullivan also criticised it for glorifying vigilantism: \"It's Michael Winner and you know, he doesn't have any sense of irony. He seems to be saying it is okay to go and kill people.\" The journalist Miles Kington later claimed \"\"Parting Shots\" ... was directed by Michael Winner and despite the glittering cast, was possibly the worst film ever made.\" I. Q. Hunter listed \"Parting Shots\" as one of the candidates for \"the Worst British film ever made\". \"Parting Shots\" was also featured in a poll of \"Empire\" magazine readers' \"50 Worst Movies Ever\" poll.\n\nThe comedy \"The Underground Comedy Movie\" is based on a cable access show from 1988. Director and lead actor Vince Offer constructed the film out of a series of tasteless, lowbrow skits (including Gena Lee Nolin loudly using the restroom and a superhero named \"Dickman\" who dresses in a giant penis costume and defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen). In 1999, Offer filed a suit against 20th Century Fox and the co-directors of \"There's Something About Mary\", Bobby and Peter Farrelly, claiming that 14 scenes in \"Mary\" were stolen from his film. The Farrellys released this statement: \"We've never heard of him, we've never heard of his movie, and it's all a bunch of baloney.\" In a review in \"The Village Voice\", Rob Davis called the film a \"listless, laughless attempt\", and \"lunkheaded and amateurish\", and stated that it was \"for masochists only\". Likewise, Lawrence Van Gelder of \"The New York Times\" referred to it as a \"wretched film\" and stated that \"'The Underground Comedy Movie' stands as a monument to ineptitude and self-delusion.\" Rod Dreher of the \"New York Post\" said it \"may be the least amusing comedy ever made\". Christopher Null of filmcritic.com called it \"a crass, disgusting, and vile re-creation of a late-1980s cable TV access show, [with] small bits of film that cut in and out haphazardly and without any sense of pacing\", referred to the \"only conceivably funny point in the movie as \"more pathetic than hilarious\", and wrapped up his review by stating, \"If you're looking for the ultimate movie to clear your house of partygoers who don't know when to leave, look no further than this DVD.\" Thom Bennett at \"Film Journal International\", wrote \"Anyone offended by unbearably bad films, jokes that are not funny and wasting 90 minutes of their lives is, as promised, guaranteed to be offended. In fact, to even call this mess a comedy is giving it far too much credit\", and \"\"The Underground Comedy Movie\" may well be the worst film I have ever seen.\" Offer stated in 2004 that \"almost 100,000\" DVDs of the film had been sold.\n\n\"Battlefield Earth\" is based on the first half of L. Ron Hubbard's novel of the same name, and stars John Travolta, Barry Pepper and Forest Whitaker. Although a sequel covering the second half of the book was planned, the poor reviews and box office performance, and financial ruin of Franchise Pictures killed off such plans. It was criticized for a poor script, hammy acting, overuse of Dutch angles, repetitive dialogue, and several inconsistencies. The movie's producer, Franchise Pictures, was later forced out of business after it emerged that it had fraudulently overstated the film's budget by $31 million. It has a 3% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and it was included in their Top 100 worst-reviewed movies of the 2000s. Roger Ebert predicted that the film, \"for decades to come will be the punch line of jokes about bad movies\". Ebert also wrote, \"the director, Roger Christian, has learned from better films that directors sometimes tilt their cameras, but he has not learned why\". It is also on his \"most hated\" list. It won seven Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture and Worst Screen Couple (John Travolta and \"anyone on the screen with him\"). In 2005, an eighth Razzie (for Worst \"Drama\" of Our First 25 Years) was awarded to the film, and in 2010 it won a ninth Razzie at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards for \"Worst Picture of the Decade\", the most of any film in the history of the awards at the time, before \"Jack and Jill\" surpassed its record with ten wins in 2012. The movie appeared on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list.\n\n\"Honest\" is the directorial debut of Eurythmics member David A. Stewart, and starring three members of the British/Canadian girl group All Saints (Melanie Blatt, Nicole and Natalie Appleton). It received a large amount of media criticism following its release. The Scottish newspaper \"Daily Record\" described \"Honest\" thus: \"This turgid tale of Sixties London isn't just bad – it's quite probably the worst film ever.\" Peter Bradshaw noted that \"Honest\" \"subscribes to the usual credulous fictions about the charm, glamour and wit of violent criminals, and leaves out these qualities in spades\" and added \"However silly and implausible, it would be all right if there was the slightest hint of brio or fun in the script, written by comedy giants Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais. But there isn't.\" Alexander Walker called \"Honest\" \"An ugly, ratty-looking load of jazzy cliches buried in flashy has-been styles, including slowmo frolicking in the Trafalgar Square fountains, strobe-lit druggy sessions and accelerated action on the mattress.\" British film historian I.Q. Hunter later listed \"Honest\" as one of the candidates for the title of \"Worst British film ever made\".\n\nThe British film \"Rancid Aluminium\" was directed by Edward Thomas and based on the novel of the same name by James Hawes. Despite a cast that included Rhys Ifans, Joseph Fiennes, Tara FitzGerald, Sadie Frost, Steven Berkoff, Olegar Fedoro, Keith Allen and Dani Behr, the film received highly negative reviews. Peter Bradshaw of \"The Guardian\" said that it \"succeeds in getting its cast – some of the brightest and best of British character actors, young and old – to give the worst performances imaginable ... The plot is all over the place, eventually incomprehensible, and very, very boring\". Cosmo Landesman, writing in \"The Sunday Times\", also gave it a negative review, describing it as \"a stupid, unfunny and self-satisfied film that should be avoided at all costs\". Anne Billson of \"The Sunday Telegraph\" found it confusing and derivative: \"I couldn’t even work out where the film is supposed to be set. Isn't that Portobello Road? Why is Tara Fitzgerald talking about Exeter? And how in hell did we get to this cricket pavilion? Director Ed Thomas appears to have been aiming for the \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" crowd, but misses by several billion miles.\"\n\nDiscussing \"Rancid Aluminium\" in an article on British cinema, Jacques Peretti gave an equally harsh assessment: \"In many ways, \"Rancid Aluminium\" is beyond criticism because it is very hard, even after several viewings, to work out what the hell is going on\" and that it was \"incomprehensible and deeply lacklustre in all departments.\" Noting the film's negative reception, Peretti went on to argue: \"By universal consent, it is the worst film ever made in the UK.\"\n\nThe American version of \"\", an Italian animated feature film about the sinking of the , features completely different plot, songs, and dialogues, with a similar storyline to James Cameron's 1997 \"Titanic\" film, but also with a number of talking animals (most notably, a rapping dog). In 2011, \"Total Film\" named it the 40th worst children's movie ever made, describing the film as being \"widely considered one of the worst animated films ever made\". \"Total Film\" later named \"Titanic: The Legend Goes On\" as the worst film ever made, after it topped a list of the 66 worst films ever in 2012. Screen Rant included it on a list of the twelve worst animated films of all time and it topped a \"cheatsheet.com\" list of the top ten worst animated films ever, with author Will Roberts commenting that \"[any] list of the worst animated films of all time begins with ... \"Titanic: The Legend Goes On\"\". The uncut version received moderate (but generally better) reviews.\n\nThe comedy film \"Freddy Got Fingered\" stars Tom Green, who also wrote and directed it, featuring largely gross-out and shock humor similar to that featured in \"The Tom Green Show\". In the film, Green stars as a 28-year-old slacker and cartoonist who falsely accuses his father of child molestation when he questions his son's life goals. \"Freddy Got Fingered\" received overwhelmingly negative reviews, with CNN critic Paul Clinton declaring it \"quite simply the worst movie ever released by a major studio in Hollywood history\". Warren Epstein of \"The Gazette\" described \"Freddy Got Fingered\" as \"the worst movie ever made\". A review in \"The Washington Post\" said: \"If ever a movie testified to the utter creative bankruptcy of the Hollywood film industry, it is the abomination known as \"Freddy Got Fingered\".\" Robert Koehler of \"Variety\" called it, \"One of the most brutally awful comedies ever to emerge from a major studio.\" Film reviewer Roger Ebert included the film on his \"most hated\" list, gave it zero out of four stars, and wrote: \"This movie doesn't scrape the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't the bottom of the barrel. This movie isn't below the bottom of the barrel. This movie doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same sentence with barrels.\" \"Freddy Got Fingered\" was nominated for eight awards at the 2001 Razzies, and won for Worst Picture, Worst Actor, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, and Worst On-Screen Couple. Razzies founder John J. B. Wilson called it \"offensive, stupid and obnoxious\" and said it had \"no redeeming value\". Green accepted his awards in person, traveling to the ceremony in a white Cadillac, wearing a tuxedo and rolling out his own red carpet to the presentation. The movie has an 11% positive rating on Rotten Tomatoes. In 2010, the film was nominated at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards for \"Worst Picture of the Decade\", though it lost to \"Battlefield Earth\". \"Freddy Got Fingered\" also appeared on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, was featured in \"Empire\"'s list of the \"50 Worst Movies Ever\" poll, and is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list.\n\nMariah Carey starred in the lead role as an aspiring singer; \"Glitter\" was intended to be her breakthrough role but was a critical failure and a box office bomb. \"Hindustan Times\" claimed that \"Glitter\" \"was slammed by almost all critics for being the worst film ever\". \"Fade In\" stated that \"\"Glitter\" isn’t just one of the worst music-themed films ever — it’s one of the worst films ever made, period.\" Author Bob McCann wrote in \"Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television\" that it's \"rightfully in the running as one of the worst films ever made\". News.com.au, \"Hi\", \"Flavorwire\", Metacritic, and \"Empire\" are amongst those who have listed it as one of the worst films ever made.\"Glitter\" received six Razzie nominations and Carey won for Worst Actress. It was also featured in John Wilson's \"The Official Razzie Movie Guide\", and in 2005, it was nominated for \"Worst Musical of Our First 25 Years\", but lost to \"From Justin to Kelly\". In an interview in 2010, Carey stated that she believed that the film's failure at the box office was largely due to the soundtrack's release date being September 11, 2001, the same day as the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon. It has a 7% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 87 reviews.\n\nThe comedy film \"The Master of Disguise\" was produced in part by Adam Sandler and stars Dana Carvey as Pistachio Disguisey, an undercover Italian waiter who must save his father Fabbrizio (James Brolin) from the evil Devlin Bowman (Brent Spiner) by using his inherent skills in disguise. Although the film was a box office success, it received scathing reviews from critics upon its release, many of which pointed out its sophomoric plot, unfunny humor (in particular, its flatulence gags) and disguises that would clearly not be recognized by children (such as Tony Montana from \"Scarface\"). Many critics also pointed out the short running time, consisting of 72 minutes of the film itself and over ten minutes of end credits juxtaposed with outtakes. Roger Ebert gave it one star out of four, claiming, \"The movie is a desperate miscalculation. It gives poor Dana Carvey nothing to do that is really funny, and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time.\" Alan Morrisson, writing for the film magazine \"Empire\", proclaimed that \"The Master of Disguise\" was \"the worst film ever made: a film about idiots, made by idiots, for idiots\", while Matthew Turner of \"ViewLondon\" remarked, \"This is a serious contender for the title of The Worst Film Ever Made.\" In addition, Chris Parry of eFilmCritic.com stated, \"Quite honestly, I've never seen anything less competent. And I mean that.\" The film currently holds a 1% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 103 reviews, and was featured on the site's list of the top 100 worst-reviewed films of the 2000s. It also appears on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list. A cameo appearance by Bo Derek landed her a nomination for Worst Supporting Actress at the 23rd Golden Raspberry Awards, but she lost to Madonna for \"Die Another Day\".\n\nThe action film \"\" stars Antonio Banderas and Lucy Liu as opposing secret agents. Critics panned it, generally regarding it as having no redeeming features, not even the unintentional comedic value normally associated with bad films. They variously described the film as \"A picture for idiots\", \"Boring to an amazing degree\", \"A fine achievement in stupidity and dullness\", \"Dreadful\", \"[Giving] new meaning to the word incoherent\", and \"bad on just about every level\". One critic suggested an alternative title as \"\"Simplistic: Bullets Vs. Humans\"\". Stephen Hunter of \"The Washington Post\" wrote, \"You could run this film backward, soundtrack included, and it would make no less sense.\" Roger Ebert, who included the film in his \"most hated list\", called the movie \"a chaotic mess, overloaded with special effects and explosions, light on continuity, sanity and coherence\", In addition to being lambasted by critics, it was a disaster financially, recouping just over $19.9 million of its $70 million budget. \"International Business Times\" included it on its list of Hollywood's top 5 worst movies ever made. In March 2007, the movie review site Rotten Tomatoes ranked it #1 among \"The Worst of the Worst\" movie list, with 108 \"rotten\" reviews and no \"fresh\" ones.\n\nA low-budget 2002 American romantic drama film about the titular gay couple who come into conflict with Arthur's religious brother, \"Ben and Arthur\" was written, directed, produced, edited, and scored by Sam Mraovich, who also played the character Arthur. \"Ben and Arthur\" received strong criticism (especially from the LGBT community) for its low budget and poor plotting. The gay popular culture site Queerty described \"Ben and Arthur\" as \"unintelligible\" and ended its review by calling it the \"Worst. Movie. Ever.\" The gay movie review site Cinemaqueer likewise stated: \"\"Ben and Arthur\" is so terrible that it has awoken the dormant Bette Davis in me. It is so painfully bad that it wouldn't even make good fodder on \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". This just might possibly be the worst movie I have ever seen ... Unless you get a kick out of mocking bad films, avoid this one at all costs.\" Michael Adams, reviewing the film for his book \"Showgirls, Teen Wolves, and Astro Zombies\", describes it thus: \"\"Ben & Arthur\" is as over-the-top insane as it is ludicrously executed ... the production values, from biscuits on plates comprising the main course of a candlelit dinner to a church literally having a cardboard cross and a cartoon Jesus on the wall, are as bad as anything I've seen.\" A Rotten Tomatoes' article ranked \"Ben and Arthur\" #15 on their list of \"Films So Bad They're Unmissable\", saying \"If Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room\" is the over-wrought, melodramatic and self-pitying heterosexual camp classic of choice, then Sam Mraovich's \"Ben & Arthur\" is its gay equivalent.\" \"Rotten Tomatoes\" also stated \"Every scene, every line, every hissy fit is simultaneously hilariously amateur and hysterically fever-pitched.\" \"Total Film\" ranked \"Ben and Arthur\" at #58 in their list of the 66 worst films of all time.\n\nThe romantic-comedy musical \"From Justin to Kelly\" stars Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini, the winner and runner-up, respectively, of the first season of \"American Idol\". The film was a critical and commercial disaster, earning only $4.9 million at the North American box office and achieving a 10% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 63 reviews. Josh Tyrangiel of \"Time Magazine\" described \"From Justin to Kelly\" as \"a monstrous \"Idol\" movie musical that in the most generous light is the worst film so far this century\", while \"The Free Lance–Star\" referred to it as \"the world's worst movie\". Nathan Rabin of \"The A.V. Club\", reviewing the film for his \"My Year of Flops\" series, stated, \"All films require suspension of disbelief. \"From Justin To Kelly\" requires something more like a temporary lobotomy. Nothing about the main characters or their relationships makes sense.\" It won a special Razzie—\"Governor's Award – Distinguished Under-Achievement in Choreography\"—at the 24th Golden Raspberry Awards. It was nominated for eight additional Razzies (including a second special award, \"Worst Excuse for an Actual Movie\"), and a year later it won for Worst \"Musical\" of Our First 25 Years. \"Total Film\" included \"From Justin to Kelly\" on their list of \"The 66 Worst Films of All Time\", and \"International Business Times\" included the film on its list of Hollywood's top 5 worst movies ever made. In a later interview, Clarkson expressed regret over \"From Justin to Kelly\", stating she only did it because she was contractually obligated to do so: \"I knew when I read the script it was going to be real, real bad, but when I won, I signed that piece of paper, and I could not get out of it.\"\n\nThe independently produced \"The Room\", about an amiable banker whose friends betray him one by one, has been called \"the \"Citizen Kane\" of bad movies\" by some critics. Though the film's star, writer, producer and director Tommy Wiseau, has claimed it is a black comedy and its numerous flaws are intentional, other actors involved in the production have denied this, saying that Wiseau intended it as a melodramatic romance. \"The Room\" has been noted for its bizarre and non-sequiturial dialogue, protracted sex scenes, various subplots that are inadequately resolved or simply disappear altogether (most notably, a character announces that she has breast cancer, but this is never mentioned again), and infamous use of green-screen for \"outdoor\" rooftop scenes. In contrast to almost all of the movies on this list, \"The Room\" has a rating as \"high\" as 35% on Rotten Tomatoes. It made its broadcast premiere as an April Fools' Day special in 2009 on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block, edited down from its original R rating to a TV-14/DSLV rating. The day after its appearance, its DVD became the top-selling independent film on Amazon.com. In June 2010, \"The Room\" started playing at the American Film Institute Silver Theatre in Silver Spring, Maryland. \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" alumni Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett produced an audio commentary track to accompany the movie through their site RiffTrax.com. In 2013, the book \"The Disaster Artist\", written by Greg Sestero and Tom Bissell, was published; the book is Sestero's memoir of his involvement in the production of the movie. The book was adapted into a film of the same name, directed by and starring James Franco as Wiseau and his brother Dave Franco as Sestero.\n\nThe Martin Brest movie \"Gigli\" features Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck, with appearances by Al Pacino and Christopher Walken. \"Gigli\" was originally a black comedy with no romantic subplot. The producers demanded script rewrites throughout filming, hoping to cash in on the Lopez-Affleck romance that was big news in celebrity-watching publications of the time, such as \"Us\" and \"People\". This film cost $54 million to make but grossed only $6 million, making it one of the biggest box office bombs of all time. \"The Times\" gave the film a zero, making \"Gigli\" the lowest scored film review in the publication's history at that time. \"International Business Times\", which included \"Gigli\" in its list of Hollywood's top five worst movies ever made, described reviewers calling it \"the ultimate turkey of all time\". \"The Wall Street Journal\" stated that it was \"[t]he worst movie—all right, the worst allegedly major movie—of our admittedly young century\", while Roger Friedman of Fox News claimed it was \"[t]he worst movie ever made\". It was also the winner of seven Razzies (including 2005's Worst \"Comedy\" of Our First 25 Years), and in 2010 the film was nominated at the 30th Golden Raspberry Awards for \"Worst Picture of the Decade\". It is in Rotten Tomatoes' Top 100 worst reviewed movies of the 2000s, where it has a 6% rating. It was also featured in \"Empire\"'s poll of the 50 worst films ever made.\n\nThe British sex comedy \"Sex Lives of the Potato Men\" is about a group of potato delivery men. The film received strongly hostile reviews from the British media. Reviews claimed \"Sex Lives of the Potato Men\" was unfunny, disgusting, and depressing. Writing in the \"Daily Mirror\", film critic Kevin O'Sullivan called \"Sex Lives of the Potato Men\" \"one of the worst films ever made\". Novelist Will Self, in his review for \"The Evening Standard\", called \"Sex Lives of the Potato Men\" \"mirthless, worthless, toothless, useless\". \"The Times\" reviewer James Christopher dubbed \"Sex Lives of the Potato Men\" \"one of the two most nauseous films ever made ... a masterclass in film-making ineptitude\". \"The Sunday Express\" film critic, Henry Fitzherbert, also strongly condemned the film: \"\"Sex Lives\" is so awful it left me slack-jawed in disbelief ... it must be one of the worst British comedies.\" Catherine Shoard, in a critique in \"The Sunday Telegraph\", stated \"It's hard to know what to say to this – it's like finding the right words at a nasty accident ... \"Sex Lives of the Potato Men\" is probably the lewdest Brit-com since \"Confessions of a Window Cleaner\", and certainly the worst.\" Shoard also described the film as \"Less a film than an appetite suppressant.\" Alan Morrison in the Scottish \"Daily Record\" described it as \"puerile smut of the very worst kind ... \"Sex Lives of the Potato Men\" should never have been made\". \"The Irish Times\" later noted that \"\"Sex Lives of the Potato Men\" attracted some of the worst reviews in living memory.\" \"The Birmingham Post\" described \"Sex Lives of the Potato Men\" as \"quite possibly the worst film ever made\", while \"The Independent on Sunday\" stated that the film was \"a strong contender for the title of worst film of all time\". It was also featured in \"Empire\"'s \"50 Worst Movies Ever\" poll. The film currently has a 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes out of 13 reviews.\n\nNominally based on the DC Comics character, \"Catwoman\" stars Halle Berry as the titular character. It bears little resemblance to the Batman antagonist: the cinematic Catwoman has superpowers, unlike in the comics, and leaps from rooftop to rooftop in stiletto heels. The character's signature lycra catsuit was replaced with slashed leather trousers and matching bra, and a mask that also acts as a hat. She also has a different name, Patience Phillips, to the established DC Catwoman character, Selina Kyle. As the movie character differs so widely from her comic book source, the character, as portrayed in this film, has been cited as \"Catwoman in Name Only\". The film was the result of various rewrites by a total of 28 different screenwriters, though only four were credited after arbitration with the WGA. It has a 9% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and was declared \"arguably the worst superhero film ever made\" by the \"Orlando Sentinel\". Jean Lowerison of the \"San Diego Metropolitan\" said in her review that \"Catwoman\" \"goes on my 'worst' list for the year, and quite possibly for all time\". \"The Village Voice\" summed up reviews of the film under the title \"Me-Ouch\". The movie was the winner of four Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Actress, Worst Director (Pitof) and Worst Screenplay. Berry arrived at the ceremony to accept her Razzie in person (with her Best Actress Oscar for \"Monster's Ball\" in hand), saying: \"First of all, I want to thank Warner Brothers. Thank you for putting me in a piece of shit, god-awful movie ... It was just what my career needed.\" It is on Roger Ebert's \"most hated\" list and \"International Business Times\" included it on its list of Hollywood's top 5 worst movies ever made.\n\nThe German film \"Daniel – Der Zauberer\" was directed by Ulli Lommel and stars pop singer and ex-\"Deutschland sucht den Superstar\" contestant Daniel Küblböck, who appeared as a fictionalized version of himself. The title is inaccurate as it implies that Küblböck is \"Der Zauberer\" (\"The Wizard\"), while the sorcerer is actually a different character (played by Ulli Lommel, the writer/director of the film). The website filmstarts.de states that \"Daniel – Der Zauberer\" was \"unbearable for non-fans of Küblböck\", adding that \"the performances of the actors were some of the worst in the history of German cinema\", and alleging that Ulli Lommel and producer Peter Schamoni had \"damaged their reputation\". The film became the lowest-ranked film on the IMDb Bottom 100, where it remained for a considerable amount of time, and \"wieistderfilm.de\" stated it was fair to call it the worst German film ever made. It appeared on \"Total Film\"s list of the 66 worst films of all time. In an interview conducted several years after its release, Daniel Küblböck admitted that, in retrospect, \"[Y]ou have to say this is the worst movie of all time really\".\n\nThe family-oriented comedy \"\" was the last film directed by Bob Clark before his death. It is a sequel to the 1999 film \"Baby Geniuses\" and like its predecessor, it received negative reviews from film critics, earning 0% positive rating on review website Rotten Tomatoes. Following the plot of the first film, four babies can communicate with each other using 'baby talk', and have knowledge of many secrets. The \"baby geniuses\" become involved in a scheme by media mogul Bill Biscane (Jon Voight), a notorious kidnapper of children, who intends to use a satellite system to brainwash the world's population and force them to watch television for the rest of their lives. The film was a box office bomb, only receiving $9 million from its $20 million budget. Tom Long of \"The Deseret News\" said \"It is perhaps the most incompetent and least funny comic film ever made.\" MaryAnn Johanson of FlickFilosopher said in her review \"To call this immeasurably terrible movie 'stupid and nonsensical' would be an insult to stupid and nonsensical movies.\" Eric D. Snider wrote that, \"\"Superbabies\" couldn't be worse if it had been written and produced by actual babies, and I mean babies who are retarded and who hate movies\", and Nathan Rabin at The \"A.V. Club\" called it \"The most perversely unnecessary sequel in recent memory.\" Rotten Tomatoes ranked it 6th in the 100 worst reviewed films of the 2000s, with a rating of 0%. It was nominated for four Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Picture, Worst Director (Bob Clark), Worst Supporting Actor (Jon Voight) and Worst Screenplay (Steven Paul (story) & Gregory Poppen). Eric Henderson at \"Slant Magazine\" wrote that \"\"Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2\" had the rare distinction of briefly unseating the obstinate \"Manos: The Hands of Fate\"—the film that \"MST3K\" single-handedly popularized as the 'official worst movie of all time'—from its perch atop the IMDb's list of 100 worst movies\" and David Cornelius at efilmcritic wondered \"Why would anyone want to make a follow-up to what is universally viewed as one of the very worst movies ever produced is a mystery for the ages.\"\n\nLoosely based on a series of video games by Infogrames and directed by Uwe Boll, the German-Canadian-American film \"Alone in the Dark\" was panned by critics for a multitude of reasons, including poor script and production values, quick cuts to optimize the gory content, almost no connection to the game, and bad acting. The movie has received a 1% rating at Rotten Tomatoes, and was included in their Top 100 worst reviewed movies of the 2000s at number two. It appeared on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list. Roger Moore of \"The Orlando Sentinel\" stated: \"\"Alone in the Dark\" shows just how tenuous \"Plan 9 from Outer Space\" 's hold on that 'worst movie ever' title really is.\" Likewise, Peter Hartlaub, the \"San Francisco Chronicle\"'s pop culture critic, called the film \"the best Ed Wood movie ever made ... a film so mind-blowingly horrible that it teeters on the edge of cinematic immortality\". In 2009, he named it the worst film of the decade. Jeffrey Lyles of \"The Gazette\" considered it so bad that \"other legendary bad films ... await a film of this magnitude because it gets awfully lonely on the island of misfit movies\", while Scott Nash of \"Three Movie Buffs\" dubbed it \"one of the worst movies ever made\". Screenwriter Blair Erickson wrote about his experience dealing with Boll and his original script, which was closer to the actual game itself, and Boll's script change demands on the comedy website \"Something Awful\". It received two 2005 Golden Raspberry Awards nominations for Worst Director (Uwe Boll) and Worst Actress (Tara Reid), and won three 2005 Stinkers Awards, for Worst Picture, Worst Director, and Worst Special Effects.\n\n\"Aag\" is a remake of one of the most successful Bollywood films, \"Sholay\", directed by Ram Gopal Varma. This film was widely panned, with critics such as Rajeev Masand giving it a zero out of five. \"Times of India\" stated that \"Aag\" \"destroyed Bollywood's greatest film\" and acknowledged that some \"consider it the world's worst film\". \"Hindustan Times\" awarded it the \"Lifetime's Worst Ever Movie Award\". It came in first in a \"FHM India\" list of the 57 worst movies ever made. \"Total Film\" included it in their list of the 66 worst films of all time. Amitabh Bachchan, who appeared in the original film and returned for the remake, later admitted that the film was \"a mistake\".\n\nAn independently produced film that is an apparent homage to Alfred Hitchcock's \"The Birds\", \"\" tells the story of a romance between the two leading characters, played by Alan Bagh and Whitney Moore, as their small town is attacked by birds (which do not appear until 47 minutes into the film). Written, directed, and produced by James Nguyen, it was intended as a \"romantic thriller\" but is notable due to its poor quality, with reviewers calling out its wooden acting, bad dialogue, amateurish sound and editing, nonsensical plot and, in particular, its special effects, consisting primarily of poorly rendered CGI eagles and vultures that perform physically awkward aerial maneuvers and explode upon impact with the ground. The film, which cost $10,000 to make, was called by the \"Huffington Post\" \"truly, one of the worst films ever made\" and by \"The Village Voice\" as \"one more in the pantheon of beloved trash-terpieces\". \"Flavorwire\" named it the worst movie ever made, \"Slate\" deemed it among the worst movies ever made, while \"Salon\" referred to it as \"a cult hit among bad-movie fans\" and \"Variety\" stated that the film displayed \"all the revered hallmarks of hilariously bad filmmaking\". Following the home media release of \"Birdemic\", Michael J. Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" fame produced an audio commentary track to accompany the movie through Rifftrax. They later riffed upon the film again theatrically. In response to the cult status of the first film, a sequel—\"\"—was released in 2013, and included many returning members of the cast and crew.\n\n\"Disaster Movie\" is a parody film written and directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, spoofing films in the disaster film genre. The film, like most films by Friedberg and Seltzer, received extremely negative reviews, and has a 1% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 71 reviews. The site's consensus states: \"Returning to their seemingly bottomless well of flatulence humor, racial stereotypes, and stale pop culture gags, Friedberg and Seltzer have produced what is arguably their worst \"Movie\" yet\". It was ranked by Rotten Tomatoes as one of the worst reviewed films of the 2000s. Jason Solomons of \"The Guardian\" stated that \"Nothing can convey the grimness of \"Disaster Movie\", which would be the Worst Movie Ever Made were it actually a movie at all.\" Adam Tobias of \"Watertown Daily Times\" claimed that \"I just don't see how anyone could not find \"Disaster Movie\" one of the worst films of all time.\" Tobias went on to write that the title was appropriate because the film is \"a disaster\". It was featured in Empire's \"50 Worst Movies Ever\" poll, Total Film's \"66 Worst Movies Ever\" list Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list (where it holds a score of 17, the lowest score on the site). \"Disaster Movie\" became the lowest ranked film on IMDb's Bottom 100 list days after its premiere. The film is also notable for being the motion picture debut of Kim Kardashian, whose performance garnered a nomination for Worst Supporting Actress at the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards. It received five additional Razzie nominations.\n\nThe romantic comedy \"The Hottie and the Nottie\" starring Paris Hilton, Joel Moore, Christine Lakin, and The Greg Wilson opened to poor box-office takings and strongly negative reviews with a 4% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. The British newspaper \"The People\", reviewing \"The Hottie and the Nottie\", claimed \"Paris Hilton is the world's worst actress and she's starring in the worst movie ever made.\" Nathan Lee of The Village Voice called it \"crass, shrill, disingenuous, tawdry, mean-spirited, vulgar, idiotic, boring, slapdash, half-assed, and very, very unfunny\". Online film critic James Berardinelli described the film's comedy as \"about as funny as the anal rape scene in \"The War Zone\"\". Richard Roeper called it \"excruciatingly, painfully, horribly, terribly awful\", and argued that \"nobody in this movie really should have a career in movies\". Connie Ogle in the \"Miami Herald\" described \"The Hottie and the Nottie\" thus: \"Imagine the worst movie you've ever seen. Got it? Now try to think of something worse. That something is this movie – wretched, embarrassing and a waste of the time and energy of everyone involved.\" The film appears on Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films, and the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list.\n\n\"The Last Airbender\" is a fantasy/adventure film written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and is based on the Nickelodeon animated series \"\" Upon release, the film received extremely negative reviews, with critics panning the bad acting, numerous plot holes, screenplay, poor special effects (despite its reported $150 million budget) and especially M. Night Shyamalan's directing. It was also ridiculed for the poor quality of its post-converted 3-D, which was described as barely noticeable. Further criticism came from fans of the original cartoon series, who said the film differed tremendously from its critically acclaimed source material. It garnered nine nominations at the 31st Golden Raspberry Awards, and won five: Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst Supporting Actor, and a special award, \"Worst Eye-Gouging Mis-Use of 3D\". Roger Ebert wrote \"\"The Last Airbender\" is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented. The laws of chance suggest that something should have gone right. Not here. It puts a nail in the coffin of low-rent 3D, but it will need a lot more coffins than that.\" When asked if \"Last Airbender\" had been the worst film he has ever seen, Mike Ryan of \"Vanity Fair\" answered, \"Yes\". \"Hi\" highlighted the film in their \"The Worst Films Ever\" series, and David Onda of Comcast wrote \"this film has also been called one of the worst ever made. The movie was universally panned by critics and failed to make back its production budget domestically. Although director M. Night Shyamalan reportedly wrote a rough draft for the second film it is highly unlikely it will ever get made. Very, very unlikely.\" The film currently holds a 6% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 183 reviews, and has a Metascore of 20 on Metacritic. The film also appeared in the top ten of a poll of the worst movies of all time conducted by RiffTrax.\n\nThe casting of white and Indian actors to portray characters who were East Asian or Inuit in the source material triggered negative reactions from some fans marked by accusations of racism and whitewashing, a letter-writing campaign, and various protests. Richard Corliss of \"Time\", speaking of the controversy, wrote \"The actors who didn't get to be in \"The Last Airbender\" are like the passengers who arrived too late to catch the final flight of the Hindenburg.\" Corliss also stated that this was the worst movie epic in 32 years. Shyamalan responded to critics, saying, \"Anime is based on ambiguous facial features. It's meant to be interpretive. It's meant to be inclusive of all races, and you can see yourself in all these characters ... This is a multicultural movie and I'm going to make it even more multicultural in my approach to its casting ... The irony that [protesters] would label this with anything but the greatest pride, that the movie poster has Noah and Dev on it and my name on it. I don't know what else to do.\"\n\n\"\" was produced by Happy Madison Productions and featured Nick Swardson in the titular role as a small-town manchild who pursues a career in the pornographic film industry after learning that his parents were porn stars in the 1970s. On Rotten Tomatoes, \"Bucky Larson\" has a 0% rating based on 35 reviews. Linda Cook of the \"Quad-City Times\" described the film as \"the worst of the worst\", while \"hollywoodchicago.com\" called it \"one of the worst comedies of all time\". In listing it as one of the ten worst comedies ever, Michael Musto stated that \"Bucky Larson\" was \"a badness the world had forgotten was capable of existing\". Screen Rant included it in its list of the 25 worst movies in film history and Mental Floss named it the fifth worst movie ever. \"Bucky Larson\" also appears on MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list, and Metacritic's list of the all-time lowest-scoring films. The film earned six nominations at the 32nd Golden Raspberry Awards, but lost in every category to \"Jack and Jill\", which was also produced by Happy Madison Productions.\n\n\"Jack and Jill\" is a comedy film starring Adam Sandler as Jack, a commercial director, who is visited by his \"identical\" twin sister, Jill (played by Sandler, in drag), during the holidays. \"Salon\" stated that \"Jack and Jill\" \"received some of the worst reviews of any movie ever\" upon its release. In the film, Jill is wooed by Al Pacino, whom Jack wants to be in his Dunkin' Donuts commercial. Richard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" noted the irony of Pacino's presence, as the actor is best known for playing Michael Corleone in \"The Godfather\", which is widely considered one of the best films ever made, in this film, which he called \"one of the worst movies in the history of cinema!\" Ramin Setoodeh of \"The Daily Beast\" and Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" reviewed it together in an article entitled \"Adam Sandler's 'Jack and Jill' Is the Worst Movie Ever Made\". After an hour-long critique, RedLetterMedia claimed that it was \"so egregious that it ceased to be a film\", and the site also later called it \"the worst thing in the world\". Mike McGranaghan wrote, on his website \"The Aisle Seat\": \"\"Howard the Duck\", \"Gigli\", \"Showgirls\", \"From Justin to Kelly\". What do they all have in common? They're all widely considered among the worst big studio movies ever made. You know what else they have in common? They're all better than \"Jack and Jill\".\" \"Jack and Jill\" was featured in the top ten worst films of all time poll conducted by RiffTrax. \"Jack and Jill\" won a record 10 awards at the 32nd Golden Raspberry Awards, sweeping every category. It broke the record previously held by \"Battlefield Earth\" for having the most Razzies earned by a single film and is the only film to win every possible award. The film currently holds a 3% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 105 reviews.\n\nAnother comedy film starring Adam Sandler, \"That's My Boy\" concerns a middle school student named Donny Berger who has sex with his teacher, gets her pregnant, and in turn, earns a lifestyle of a minor celebrity, something he never intended to happen. Years later, Donny (played by Sandler) crashes his now-adult son's (Andy Samberg) wedding and bachelor party to get his money so he can pay his taxes, therefore avoiding prison. The film has been widely panned due to its comedic portrayal of incest, ephebophilia, statutory rape, and gerontophilia, with film critic Andrew O'Hehir of \"Salon\" stating, \"[Sandler's] new movie about a rape survivor and his estranged son is supposed to be funny, but radiates pain and rage.\" Richard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" proclaimed, \"To say \"That's My Boy\" is one of the worst movies of the year is to insult 2012. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen\", while Richard Haridly of \"Quickflix\" called it \"one of the saddest and most exhausting\" films he has ever seen. MaryAnn Johanson of \"Flick Filosopher\" outright panned the film for its inability to generate laughs as well as its depraved content, calling it \"a disgusting excuse for a comedy\" and possibly \"the most repulsive movie I've ever seen\", and Jonathan Lack of \"We Got This Covered\" declared, \"\"That's My Boy\" isn't just the worst film of 2012, it's one of the most morally reprehensible comedies of all time, a disgusting movie you should stay far, far away from.\" Furthermore, Ed Whitfield of \"The Ooh Tray\" stated, \"It may be the worst film, in any genre, ever made\", while Chris Sawin of \"Examiner.com\" called it \"the equivalent of recreational brain trauma with a slice of shoving a railroad spike through one of your eyes just to pass the time\", and said that \"Gargling paint thinner is better entertainment.\" In addition to the movie's overwhelmingly negative reviews, \"That's My Boy\" earned eight nominations at the 33rd Golden Raspberry Awards, such as Worst Picture and Worst Director, and won the awards for Worst Actor (Sandler) and Worst Screenplay. It holds a 20% rating on Rotten Tomatoes as of July 29, 2015 based on 113 reviews.\n\nA British comedy film based on the stage farce of the same name, \"Run for Your Wife\" starred Danny Dyer as John Smith, a bigamist, and Denise van Outen and Sarah Harding as his wives. \"Run for Your Wife\" was directed by the author of the play, Ray Cooney (who also makes an uncredited cameo appearance). Upon release, \"Run for Your Wife\" was savaged by film critics, with the South African newspaper \"Daily News\" saying \"\"Run for Your Wife\" could be the worst film in history\", the Studio Briefing website reporting that \"Some writers are making the case that the British comedy may be 'the worst film ever, and \"The Daily Mirror\" claiming \"Run For Your Wife\" \"was branded the worst British film ever\". \"Run for Your Wife\" met with such overwhelmingly negative reviews upon release that the reviews themselves were widely reported in the UK media. The film was variously described as \"a catastrophe\", \"as funny as leprosy\" and \"30 years past its sell-by-date\", with \"The Guardian\" reviewer Peter Bradshaw saying that it \"makes \"The Dick Emery Show\" look edgy and contemporary\". \"The Independent's\" Anthony Quinn wrote, \"The stage play ran for nine years – it [the film] will be lucky to run for nine days. Perhaps never in the field of light entertainment have so many actors sacrificed so much dignity in the cause of so few jokes ... From the look of it, Cooney hasn't been in a cinema for about 30 years\". The cast featured numerous British celebrities in cameo roles, which was commented upon by several reviewers. The \"Metro\" commented that \"no one emerges unscathed among the cameo-packed cast that reads largely like a roll-call for Brit TV legends you'd previously suspected deceased\". The \"Daily Record\" described the film as \"an exasperating farce containing not one single, solitary laugh. people losing their trousers and falling over, the film looks like a pilot for a (mercifully) never-commissioned 70s sitcom\". An article in the \"Independent\" described \"Run for Your Wife\" (along with the similarly panned \"Movie 43\") as contenders for the title of the \"worst film in history\". \"The Berkhamsted & Tring Gazette\" reported \"critics have being queuing up to batter recent release \"Run for Your Wife\", with general agreement that it ranks among the worst British comedies of all time\". \"Run for Your Wife\" was also a box office bomb, earning only £602 in its opening weekend at the British box office to its £900,000 budget. \"Run for Your Wife\" has a \"0%\" rating on \"Rotten Tomatoes\" as of July 29, 2015.\n\nProduced and co-directed by Peter Farrelly among others, \"Movie 43\" is a comedy film consisting of several vignettes each by a different director and a sizable cast of recognizable actors and actresses including Dennis Quaid, Greg Kinnear, Hugh Jackman, Kate Winslet, Liev Schreiber, Naomi Watts, Anna Faris, Emma Stone, Richard Gere, Uma Thurman, Chloë Grace Moretz, Gerard Butler, Halle Berry, Stephen Merchant, Kristen Bell, Terrence Howard, Elizabeth Banks, and Julianne Moore. Several critics have called it one of the worst films ever made, including Peter Howell of the \"Toronto Star\", who said \"There's just one use for \"Movie 43\", apart from it being ground into the landfill that it deserves to become sooner rather than later. It provides me with a handy new answer to a question I'm often asked: 'What's the worst film you've ever seen? Elizabeth Weitzman of the \"New York Daily News\" also considered it the worst movie she ever saw. Brady Murphy of Murphy Reviews wrote, \"A world where a film like this can exist only reminds me of the other contemptible acts performed by human kind since the dawn of time, and is rather eye-opening in that respect. That probably wasn't intentional, though\"; he went on to say that \"The idea that anyone could think that this would be in any way humorous is simply unbelievable.\" He concluded his review by saying the movie \"had no heart\", and gave it the site's first zero out of ten rating. Richard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" voiced similar hatred, calling it \"aggressively tasteless\" and \"the \"Citizen Kane\" of awful\". Lou Lumenick of the \"New York Post\" stated, \"If you mashed-up the worst parts of the infamous \"Howard the Duck\", \"Gigli\", \"Ishtar\" and every other awful movie I've seen since I started reviewing professionally in 1981, it wouldn't begin to approach the sheer soul-sucking badness of the cringe-inducing \"Movie 43\".\" \"Movie 43\" is on the MRQE's 50 Worst Movies list. It currently holds a 4% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 76 reviews, averaging out at a 2.3/10 rating. It won three awards at the 34th Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture, Worst Director, and Worst Screenplay. In the worst director category all 13 directors won the award.\n\nA Bollywood comedy film directed by Sajid Khan, \"Humshakals\" featured Indian actors Saif Ali Khan, Ram Kapoor and Riteish Deshmukh. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 0%, based on five reviews, with an average rating of 2/10. Mihir Fadnavis wrote in his \"Firstpost\" review, \"sexual tomfoolery, shrieking and hamming aside, there's much more to hate about this 'family movie'. It's disturbing to see such an atrocious, regressive, misogynistic, sexist, homophobic cinematic product force-fed to paying audiences. I can understand that a comedy need not be 'safe', but what goes on in \"Humshakals\" is simply too horrifying to bear.\" Critic Sonia Chopra of Sify.com wrote \"there are bad movies, and then there's \"Humshakals\". The worst film of 2014 so far, in my book\". Saurabh Dwivedi of \"India Today\" stated \"I can only say that \"Humshakals\" will be listed in one of the worst films of the century.\" \"Dainik Bhaskar\" rated the movie as one of the worst films of the decade. Writing in \"Emirates 24/7\", Sneha May Francis said that it succeeded Khan's previous endeavor, \"Himmatwala\", in becoming the worst Bollywood film ever. Itrath Syed of \"The Georgia Straight\" stated that \"Humshakals\" was \"the absolute bottom of the cinematic barrel\". The film received five Golden Kela Award nominations, and won for Worst Film. It also won two Ghanta Awards; the film won Worst Picture and Ram Kapoor, Saif Ali Khan and Riteish Deshmukh shared the Worst Actor award.\n\nSeveral of the cast members also lamented their involvement in the film. Despite being the film's leading actress, Bipasha Basu did not participate in the film's promotions because she was \"extremely disturbed by the end result\" and stated that \"\"Humshakals\" was the worst experience of my life\". Another cast member, actress Esha Gupta, warned her family to not watch the film. After the release of the film, leading actor Saif Ali Khan lamented that \"I've been introspecting a lot and will never repeat a mistake that was \"Humshakals\".\"\n\n\"Saving Christmas\" is a faith-based Christmas comedy film starring Kirk Cameron, who plays a fictionalized version of himself attempting to convince his brother-in-law (played by the film's director, Darren Doane) that Christmas is still a Christian holiday. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a rating of 0%, based on 13 reviews, with an average rating of 1.7/10. Critic David Keyes described \"Saving Christmas\" as \"The worst holiday movie ever made\", \"Billings Gazette\" selected the film as the worst Christmas movie of all time, and Will Nicol of \"Digital Trends\" included it on his list of the ten worst movies ever made. Christy Lemire picked \"Saving Christmas\" as the worst film she has ever reviewed. In response to the criticism, Cameron asked fans to give the film positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. This resulted in a backlash in which Internet users traveled to the Rotten Tomatoes page and condemned the film. Three weeks after its release, \"Saving Christmas\" became the lowest-rated film on IMDb's bottom 100 list. Cameron blamed the low rating on a Reddit campaign by \"haters and atheists\" to purposely lower the film's ratings. The film won four awards, including Worst Picture, at the 35th Golden Raspberry Awards.\n\nA 2014 English-language French drama film about the origins of the soccer world governing body Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), \"United Passions\" starred Tim Roth (as FIFA President Sepp Blatter), Gérard Depardieu and Sam Neill, and was directed by Frédéric Auburtin. \"United Passions\" release in the U.S. occurred simultaneously with the 2015 FIFA corruption case, in which several current and former members of FIFA's executive committee were arrested for charges of corruption, and Blatter himself resigned following repeated accusations of corruption at FIFA under his leadership. \"United Passions\" was accused of ignoring these long-running claims. \"London Evening Standard\"s Des Kelly wrote that \"United Passions\" was \"the worst movie ever made\" and \"the most extraordinary vanity exercise; a vile, self-aggrandizing, sugar-coated pile of manure where Blatter and Co. manage to make North Korea's Kim Jong-un look self-effacing\". Daniel Gold of \"The New York Times\" claimed \"United Passions\" is \"one of the most unwatchable films in recent memory, a dishonest bit of corporate-suite sanitizing that's no good even for laughs\", later stating it would make the top three of his list of all time bad films. Several critics noted the irony of the film's depiction of Blatter as an anti-corruption campaigner. Paul Field of the \"Daily Mirror\" said that this created \"unintentional comedy gold\", while Sara Stewart of the \"New York Post\" described it as \"hilariously ill-timed\". The soccer website Goal.com said of \"United Passions\": \"The portrayal of FIFA is farcical from start to finish\", and added: \"Films believed to be among the worst of all time are watched by thousands of people eager to see just how bad they are. This piece of cinematic garbage belongs to that list.\" On Rotten Tomatoes, \"United Passions\" currently has a rating of 0%, based on 16 reviews, while on Metacritic, the film currently holds a score of 1 out of 100, based on 9 critics, and is on their list of the all-time lowest-scoring films.\n\n\"United Passions\" was also a box office bomb, becoming the lowest-grossing film of all time in American history (with $918), surpassing the previous record held by \"I Kissed a Vampire\" ($1,380) in 2012, while going straight to DVD in France and lacking any distribution in a number of other European countries. Several of the people involved in \"United Passions\" later expressed regret over the film. Director Auburtin called \"United Passions\" \"a disaster\" and added \"Now I'm seen as bad as the guy who brought AIDS to Africa or the guy who caused the financial crisis ... apparently I am a propaganda guy making films for corrupt people.\" Tim Roth apologized for taking part in the film and admitted that he took the job in \"United Passions\" for the money.\n\n\n",

His father, Donald Edwin King, was a merchant seaman. Donald was born under the surname Pollock, but as an adult, used the surname King. King's mother was Nellie Ruth (née Pillsbury).\n\nWhen Stephen King was two years old, his father left the family under the pretense of \"going to buy a pack of cigarettes\", leaving his mother to raise Stephen and his older brother, David, by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. The family moved to De Pere, Wisconsin, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Stratford, Connecticut. When King was 11, the family returned to Durham, Maine, where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths. She then became a caregiver in a local residential facility for the mentally challenged. King was raised Methodist and remains religious as an adult.\n\nAs a child, King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train, though he has no memory of the event. His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned, speechless and seemingly in shock. Only later did the family learn of the friend's death. Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King's darker works, but King makes no mention of it in his memoir \"\" (2000).\n\nKing related in detail his primary inspiration for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction \"Danse Macabre\" (1981), in a chapter titled \"An Annoying Autobiographical Pause\". King compares his uncle's successfully dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an H. P. Lovecraft collection of short stories he remembers as \"The Lurker in the Shadows\", that had belonged to his father. King told Barnes & Noble Studios during a 2009 interview, \"I knew that I'd found home when I read that book.\"\n\nKing attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from Lisbon Falls High School, in Lisbon Falls, Maine. He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of EC's horror comics, including \"Tales from the Crypt\" (he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for \"Creepshow\"). He began writing for fun while still in school, contributing articles to \"Dave's Rag\", the newspaper his brother published with a mimeograph machine, and later began selling to his friends stories based on movies he had seen (though when discovered by his teachers, he was forced to return the profits). The first of his stories to be independently published was \"I Was a Teenage Grave Robber\"; it was serialized over four issues (three published and one unpublished) of a fanzine, \"Comics Review\", in 1965. That story was published the following year in a revised form as \"In a Half-World of Terror\" in another fanzine, \"Stories of Suspense\", edited by Marv Wolfman. As a teen, King also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.\n\nFrom 1966, King studied at the University of Maine, graduating in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in English. That year, his daughter Naomi Rachel was born. He wrote a column, \"Steve King's Garbage Truck\", for the student newspaper, \"The Maine Campus\" and participated in a writing workshop organized by Burton Hatlen. King held a variety of jobs to pay for his studies, including janitor, gas pump attendant, and worker at an industrial laundry.\n\nKing sold his first professional short story, \"The Glass Floor\", to \"Startling Mystery Stories\" in 1967. The Fogler Library at the University of Maine now holds many of King's papers.\n\nAfter leaving the university, King earned a certificate to teach high school but, unable to find a teaching post immediately, initially supplemented his laboring wage by selling short stories to men's magazines such as \"Cavalier\". Many of these early stories have been republished in the collection \"Night Shift\". The short story \"The Raft\" was published in \"Adam\", a men's magazine. After being arrested for driving over a traffic cone, he was fined $250 and had no money to pay the petty larceny fine. Luckily payment arrived for the short story \"The Raft\", then entitled \"The Float\", and \"all I did was cash the check and pay the fine.\" The In 1971, King married Tabitha Spruce, a fellow student at the University of Maine whom he had met at the University's Fogler Library after one of Professor Hatlen's workshops. That fall, King was hired as a teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine. He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels. During that time, King developed a drinking problem which would plague him for more than a decade.\n\nIn 1973, King's first novel \"Carrie\" was accepted by publishing house Doubleday. King had thrown an early draft of the novel into the trash after becoming discouraged with his progress writing about a teenage girl with psychic powers. His wife retrieved the manuscript and encouraged him to finish it. His advance for \"Carrie\" was $2,500; King's paperback rights later earned $400,000.\n\nKing and his family moved to southern Maine because of his mother's failing health. At this time, he began writing a book titled \"Second Coming\", later titled \"Jerusalem's Lot\", before finally changing the title to \"Salem's Lot\" (published 1975). In a 1987 issue of \"The Highway Patrolman\" magazine, he stated, \"The story seems sort of down home to me. I have a special cold spot in my heart for it!\" Soon after \"Carrie\"s release in 1974, King's mother died of uterine cancer. His Aunt Emrine had read the novel to her before she died. King has written of his severe drinking problem at this time, stating that he was drunk delivering the eulogy at his mother's funeral.\n\nAfter his mother's death, King and his family moved to Boulder, Colorado, where King wrote \"The Shining\" (published 1977). The family returned to western Maine in 1975, where King completed his fourth novel, \"The Stand\" (published 1978). In 1977, the family, with the addition of Owen Phillip (his third and last child), traveled briefly to England, returning to Maine that fall, where King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine. He has kept his primary residence in Maine ever since.\n\nIn 1985, King wrote his first work for the comic book medium, writing a few pages of the benefit X-Men comic book \"Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men\". The book, whose profits were donated to assist with famine relief in Africa, was written by a number of different authors in the comic book field, such as Chris Claremont, Stan Lee, and Alan Moore, as well as authors not primarily associated with that industry, such as Harlan Ellison. The following year, King wrote the introduction to \"Batman\" No. 400, an anniversary issue in which he expressed his preference for that character over Superman.\n\nIn the late 1970s, King began what became a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the \"Man in Black\" in an alternate-reality universe that is a cross between J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth and the American Wild West as depicted by Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone in their spaghetti Westerns. The first of these stories, \"\", was initially published in five installments by \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\" under the editorship of Edward L. Ferman, from 1977 to 1981. \"The Gunslinger\" was continued as an eight-book epic series called \"The Dark Tower\", whose books King wrote and published infrequently over four decades.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, King published a handful of short novels—\"Rage\" (1977), \"The Long Walk\" (1979), \"Roadwork\" (1981), \"The Running Man\" (1982) and \"Thinner\" (1984)—under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. The idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident. An alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year. He picked up the name from the hard rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive, of which he is a fan.\n\nRichard Bachman was exposed as King's pseudonym by a persistent Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, who noticed similarities between the works and later located publisher's records at the Library of Congress that named King as the author of one of Bachman's novels. This led to a press release heralding Bachman's \"death\"—supposedly from \"cancer of the pseudonym\". King dedicated his 1989 book \"The Dark Half\", about a pseudonym turning on a writer, to \"the deceased Richard Bachman\", and in 1996, when the Stephen King novel \"Desperation\" was released, the companion novel \"The Regulators\" carried the \"Bachman\" byline.\n\nIn 2006, during a press conference in London, King declared that he had discovered another Bachman novel, titled \"Blaze\". It was published on June 12, 2007. In fact, the original manuscript had been held at King's alma mater, the University of Maine in Orono, for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts. King rewrote the original 1973 manuscript for its publication.\n\nKing has used other pseudonyms. The short story \"The Fifth Quarter\" was published under the pseudonym John Swithen (the name of a character in the novel \"Carrie\"), that was published in \"Cavalier\" in April 1972. The story was later reprinted in King's collection \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes\" in 1993 under his own name. In the introduction to the Bachman novel \"Blaze\", King claims, with tongue-in-cheek, that \"Bachman\" was the person using the Swithen pseudonym.\n\nThe \"children's book\" \"Charlie the Choo-Choo: From the World of The Dark Tower\" was published under the pseudonym Beryl Evans, who was portrayed by actress Allison Davies during a book signing at San Diego Comic-Con, and illustrated by Ned Dameron. It is adapted from a fictional book central to the plot of King's previous novel \"\" and published in 2016.\n\nIn 2000, King published online a serialized horror novel, \"The Plant\". At first the public presumed that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful, but King later stated that he had simply run out of stories. The unfinished epistolary novel is still available from King's official site, now free. Also in 2000, he wrote a digital novella, \"Riding the Bullet\", and has said he sees e-books becoming 50% of the market \"probably by 2013 and maybe by 2012\". But he also warns: \"Here's the thing—people tire of the new toys quickly.\"\n\nIn August 2003, King began writing a column on pop culture appearing in \"Entertainment Weekly\", usually every third week. The column, called \"The Pop of King\" (a play on the nickname \"The King of Pop\" commonly attributed to Michael Jackson).\n\nIn 2006, King published an apocalyptic novel, \"Cell\". The book features a sudden force in which every cell phone user turns into a mindless killer. King noted in the book's introduction that he does not use cell phones.\n\nIn 2008, King published both a novel, \"Duma Key\", and a collection, \"Just After Sunset\". The latter featured 13 short stories, including a novella, \"N.\", which was later released as a serialized animated series that could be seen for free, or, for a small fee, could be downloaded in a higher quality; it then was adopted into a limited comic book series.\n\nIn 2009, King published \"Ur\", a novella written exclusively for the launch of the second-generation Amazon Kindle and available only on Amazon.com, and \"Throttle\", a novella co-written with his son Joe Hill and released later as an audiobook titled \"Road Rage\", which included Richard Matheson's short story \"Duel\". King's novel \"Under the Dome\" was published on November 10 of that year; it is a reworking of an unfinished novel he tried writing twice in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and at 1,074 pages, it is the largest novel he has written since \"It\" (1986). \"Under the Dome\" debuted at No. 1 in \"The New York Times\" Bestseller List.\n\nOn February 16, 2010, King announced on his website that his next book would be a collection of four previously unpublished novellas called \"Full Dark, No Stars\". In April of that year, King published \"Blockade Billy\", an original novella issued first by independent small press Cemetery Dance Publications and later released in mass-market paperback by Simon & Schuster. The following month, DC Comics premiered \"American Vampire\", a monthly comic book series written by King with short-story writer Scott Snyder, and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque, which represents King's first original comics work. King wrote the background history of the very first American vampire, Skinner Sweet, in the first five-issues story arc. Scott Snyder wrote the story of Pearl.\n\nKing's next novel, \"11/22/63\", was published November 8, 2011, and was nominated for the 2012 World Fantasy Award Best Novel. The eighth \"Dark Tower\" volume, \"\", was published in 2012. King's next book was \"Joyland\", a novel about \"an amusement-park serial killer\", according to an article in \"The Sunday Times\", published on April 8, 2012. It was followed by the sequel to \"The Shining\" (1977), titled \"Doctor Sleep\", published in September 2013.\n\nDuring his Chancellor's Speaker Series talk at University of Massachusetts Lowell on December 7, 2012, King indicated that he was writing a crime novel about a retired policeman being taunted by a murderer. With a working title \"Mr. Mercedes\" and inspired by a true event about a woman driving her car into a McDonald's restaurant, it was originally meant to be a short story just a few pages long. In an interview with \"Parade\", published May 26, 2013, King confirmed that the novel was \"more or less\" completed he published it in June 2013. Later, on June 20, 2013, while doing a video chat with fans as part of promoting the upcoming \"Under the Dome\" TV series, King mentioned he was halfway through writing his next novel, \"Revival\", which was released November 11, 2014.\n\nKing announced in June 2014 that \"Mr. Mercedes\" is part of a trilogy; the second book, \"Finders Keepers\", was released on June 2, 2015. On April 22, 2015, it was revealed that King is currently working on the third book of the trilogy which name was later revealed to be \"End of Watch\". The book was released on June 7, 2016, and hit the top of the \"New York Times\" bestseller list.\n\nOn November 3, 2015, King released his tenth collection of short stories, \"The Bazaar of Bad Dreams\". The book was released to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\nDuring a tour to promote \"End of Watch\", King revealed that he had collaborated on a novel, set in a women's prison in West Virginia, with his son, Owen King to be titled \"Sleeping Beauties\". When the novel was released in October 2017, it reached the top of the \"New York Times\" Best Seller List.\n\nKing has written two novels with horror novelist Peter Straub: \"The Talisman\" (1984) and a sequel, \"Black House\" (2001). King has indicated that he and Straub will likely write the third and concluding book in this series, the tale of Jack Sawyer, but has set no time for its completion.\n\nKing produced an artist's book with designer Barbara Kruger, \"My Pretty Pony\" (1989), published in a limited edition of 250 by the Library Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Alfred A. Knopf released it in a general trade edition and the short story was later included in King's collection \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes\" published in 1993.\n\n\"\" (2001) was a paperback tie-in for the King-penned miniseries \"Rose Red\" (2002). Published under anonymous authorship, the book was written by Ridley Pearson. The novel is written in the form of a diary by Ellen Rimbauer, and annotated by the fictional professor of paranormal activity, Joyce Reardon. The novel also presents a fictional afterword by Ellen Rimbauer's grandson, Steven. Intended to be a promotional item rather than a stand-alone work, its popularity spawned a 2003 prequel television miniseries to \"Rose Red\", titled \"The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer\". This spin-off is a rare occasion of another author's being granted permission to write commercial work using characters and story elements invented by King. The novel tie-in idea was repeated on Stephen King's next project, the miniseries \"Kingdom Hospital\". Richard Dooling, King's collaborator on \"Kingdom Hospital\" and writer of several episodes in the miniseries, published a fictional diary, \"The Journals of Eleanor Druse\", in 2004. Eleanor Druse is a key character in \"Kingdom Hospital\", much as Dr. Joyce Readon and Ellen Rimbauer are key characters in \"Rose Red.\"\n\nKing also wrote the nonfiction book, \"Faithful\" (2004), with novelist and fellow Red Sox fanatic Stewart O'Nan.\n\n\"Throttle\" (2009), a novella written in collaboration with his son Joe Hill, appears in the anthology \"He Is Legend: Celebrating Richard Matheson\". Their second novella collaboration, \"In the Tall Grass\" (2012), was published in two parts in \"Esquire\". It was later released in e-book and audiobook formats, the latter read by Stephen Lang.\n\nStephen King and Richard Chizmar co-wrote \"Gwendy's Button Box\" which was released in May 2017 from Cemetery Dance Publications (in trade hardcover format) and in audiobook from Simon & Schuster Audio (the audiobook has a bonus short story \"The Music Room\" which was originally published in \"Playboy\").\n\nKing and his son Owen King co-wrote the novel \"Sleeping Beauties\", released in 2017, that is set in a women's prison.\n\nKing is a fan of the Ramones, to the extent that he wrote the liner notes for the 2003 Ramones tribute album \"\". He states that he agreed to write them because he \"loved The Ramones from the first time (he) heard them\". Furthermore, King has referred to the band several times in his writing, both in his fiction and non-fiction. Non-fiction references include a mention in King's book \"Danse Macabre\" where he calls the Ramones \"an amusing punk-rock band that surfaced some four years ago\". He also wrote about them in \"On Writing\", making reference to \"dancing to the Ramones—gabba gabba hey\" as one of the reasons he has maintained a good marriage. King included further Ramones references in his fictional work. He quotes the lyrics to the Ramones' debut single \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" in his novel \"Pet Sematary\" on numerous occasions, as in the sentence \"What is it the Ramones say? Hey-ho, let's go\"! In \"The Dark Tower\" novel \"\" the Ramones get a further mention by the character Eddie Dean who states that \"Roland stage-dives like Joey Ramone\". Critics have also noted the Ramones references. \"Entertainment Weekly\", for example, in their review of \"Black House\" by King and Peter Straub, note that King's \"trademark references\" are in evidence, quoting Dee Dee Ramone. In turn, the Ramones have referenced King on their song \"It's Not My Place (In the 9 to 5 World)\", from their \"Pleasant Dreams\" album of 1981 in the line: \"Ramones are hangin' out in Kokomo / Roger Corman's on a talk show / With Allan Arkush and Stephen King\". Further, Dee Dee Ramone wrote the song \"Pet Sematary\" in King's basement after King handed him a copy of the novel. The song was eventually featured as the title song for the \"Pet Sematary\" (1989) film and also appeared on the Ramones album \"Brain Drain\" (1989).\n\nKing is also a fan of hard rock such as AC/DC; he arranged for their album \"Who Made Who\" to feature as the score for the film he directed in 1986, \"Maximum Overdrive\". King has also stated that he likes heavy metal and has named bands like Anthrax, Judas Priest and Metallica as amongst his favourites to write to. In 1988, the band Blue Öyster Cult recorded an updated version of its 1974 song \"Astronomy\". The single released for radio play featured a narrative intro spoken by King. The Blue Öyster Cult song \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" was also used in the King TV series \"The Stand\".\n\nKing collaborated with Michael Jackson to create \"Ghosts\" (1996), a 40-minute musical video. King states he was motivated to collaborate as he is \"always interested in trying something new, and for (him), writing a minimusical would be new\". In 2012 King collaborated with musician Shooter Jennings and his band Hierophant, providing the narration for their album, \"Black Ribbons\". King played guitar for the rock band Rock Bottom Remainders, several of whose members are authors. Other members include Dave Barry, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Amy Tan, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount, Jr., Matt Groening, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, Sam Barry, and Greg Iles. King and the other band members collaborated to release an e-book called \"Hard Listening: The Greatest Rock Band Ever (of Authors) Tells All\" (June 2013). King wrote a musical play \"Ghost Brothers of Darkland County\" (2012) with musician John Mellencamp.\n\nKing's formula for learning to write well is: \"Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer.\" He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met. He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: \"If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented.\"\n\nShortly after his accident, King wrote the first draft of the book \"Dreamcatcher\" with a notebook and a Waterman fountain pen, which he called \"the world's finest word processor\".\n\nWhen asked why he writes, King responds: \"The answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do.\" He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: \"Why do you assume I have a choice?\" King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a \"what if\" scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.\n\nKing often uses authors as characters, or includes mention of fictional books in his stories, novellas and novels, such as Paul Sheldon who is the main character in \"Misery\", adult Bill Denbrough in \"It\", Ben Mears in \"Salem's Lot\", and Jack Torrance in \"The Shining\". He has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including \"himself\" as a character in the \"Dark Tower\" series from \"Wolves of the Calla\" onwards. See also List of fictional books in the works of Stephen King for a complete list. In September 2009 it was announced he would serve as a writer for \"Fangoria\".\n\nKing has called Richard Matheson \"the author who influenced me most as a writer\". In a current edition of Matheson's \"The Shrinking Man\", King is quoted: \"A horror story if there ever was one...a great adventure story—it is certainly one of that select handful that I have given to people, envying them the experience of the first reading.\" Ray Bradbury is another influence, with King himself stating \"without Ray Bradbury, there is no Stephen King\".\n\nKing refers to H. P. Lovecraft several times in \"Danse Macabre\". \"Gramma\", a short story made into a film in the 1980s anthology horror show \"The New Twilight Zone\", mentions Lovecraft's notorious fictional creation \"Necronomicon\", also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein. \"I Know What You Need\" from the 1976 collection \"Night Shift\", and \"'Salem's Lot\" also mention the tome. Despite this, in \"On Writing\", King is critical of Lovecraft's dialogue-writing skills, using passages from \"The Colour Out of Space\" as particularly poor examples. There are also several examples of King's referring to Lovecraftian characters and settings in his work, such as Nyarlathotep and Yog-Sothoth.\n\nKing acknowledges the influence of Bram Stoker, particularly on his novel \"Salem's Lot\", which he envisioned as a retelling of \"Dracula\". Its related short story \"Jerusalem's Lot\" is reminiscent of Stoker's \"The Lair of the White Worm\". He also gives Joseph Payne Brennan credit for being one of his inspirations; \"Joseph Payne Brennan is one of the most effective writers in the horror genre, and he is certainly one of the writers I have patterned my own career upon; one of the writers whom I studied and with whom I kept school.\"\n\nKing's \"The Shining\" is immersed in gothic influences, including \"The Masque of the Red Death\" by Edgar Allan Poe (which was directly influenced by the first gothic novel, Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto\"). The Overlook Hotel acts as a replacement for the traditional gothic castle, and Jack Torrance is a tragic villain seeking redemption.\n\nKing has also referred to author Shirley Jackson. \"Salem's Lot\" opens with a quotation from Jackson's \"The Haunting of Hill House\", and a character in \"\" references the Jackson book \"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\". King's book \"11/22/63\" mentions the Jackson story \"The Summer People\". King is a fan of John D. MacDonald, and dedicated the novella \"Sun Dog\" to MacDonald, saying \"I miss you, old friend.\" For his part, MacDonald wrote an admiring preface to \"Night Shift\", and even had his famous character, Travis McGee, reading \"Cujo\" in one of the last McGee novels and \"Pet Sematary\" in the last McGee novel, \"The Lonely Silver Rain.\"\n\nIn 1987, King's Philtrum Press published Don Robertson's novel \"The Ideal, Genuine Man\". In his forenote to the novel, King wrote, \"Don Robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to 'become' a novelist (the other two being Richard Matheson and John D. MacDonald).\" Robert A. Heinlein's book \"The Door into Summer\" is repeatedly mentioned in King's \"Wolves of the Calla\" (2003), as are several other works. \"Wolves of the Calla\" is the King work in which \"The Dark Tower\" begins to follow a meta-fictional path.\n\nIn an interview with King, published in the \"USA Weekend\" in March 2009, the author stated, \"People look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource. I do. Elmore Leonard, every day I wake up and—not to be morbid or anything, although morbid is my life to a degree—don't see his obituary in the paper, I think to myself, \"Great! He's probably working somewhere. He's gonna produce another book, and I'll have another book to read. Because when he's gone, there's nobody else.\"\n\nKing partly dedicated his book \"Cell\" to film director George Romero, and wrote an essay for the Elite DVD version of \"Night of the Living Dead\".\nHis favorite books are (in order): \"The Golden Argosy\"; \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\"; \"The Satanic Verses\"; \"McTeague\"; \"Lord of the Flies\"; \"Bleak House\"; \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\"; \"The Raj Quartet\"; \"Light in August\"; and \"Blood Meridian\".\n\nAlthough critical reaction to King's work has been mostly positive, he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers.\n\nScience fiction editors John Clute and Peter Nichols offer a largely favorable appraisal of King, noting his \"pungent prose, sharp ear for dialogue, disarmingly laid-back, frank style, along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty (especially to children) [all of which rank] him among the more distinguished 'popular' writers.\"\n\nIn his book \"The Philosophy of Horror\" (1990), Noël Carroll discusses King's work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction. Analyzing both the narrative structure of King's fiction and King's non-fiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing, Carroll writes that for King, \"the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and, therefore, affirmed.\"\n\nIn his analysis of post–World War II horror fiction, \"The Modern Weird Tale\" (2001), critic S. T. Joshi devotes a chapter to King's work. Joshi argues that King's best-known works (his supernatural novels), are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to \"deus ex machina\" endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since \"Gerald's Game\" (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written. Joshi suggests that King's strengths as a writer include the accessible \"everyman\" quality of his prose, and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence. Joshi cites two early non-supernatural novels—\"Rage\" (1977) and \"The Running Man\" (1982)—as King's best, suggesting both are riveting and well-constructed suspense thrillers, with believable characters.\n\nIn 1996, King won an O. Henry Award for his short story \"The Man in the Black Suit\".\n\nIn his short story collection \"A Century of Great Suspense Stories\", editor Jeffery Deaver noted that King \"singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up. While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that \"'Salem's Lot\" was \"\"Peyton Place\" meets \"Dracula\". And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. ‘Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters.\"\n\nIn 2003, King was honored by the National Book Awards with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: Richard E. Snyder, the former CEO of Simon & Schuster, described King's work as \"non-literature\", and critic Harold Bloom denounced the choice:\n\nThe decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for \"distinguished contribution\" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.\n\nHowever, others came to King's defense, such as writer Orson Scott Card, who responded:\n\nLet me assure you that King's work most definitely is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration. What Snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite.\n\nKing himself later stated:\n\n[Harold] Bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there, and he's one of them, who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess. He might be able to say that Mark Twain is a great writer, but it's impossible for him to say that there's a direct line of descent from, say, Nathaniel Hawthorne to Jim Thompson because he doesn't read guys like Thompson. He just thinks, \"I never read him, but I know he's terrible.\"\n\nIn Roger Ebert's review of the 2004 movie \"Secret Window\", he stated, \"A lot of people were outraged that [King] was honored at the National Book Awards, as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously. But after finding that his book \"On Writing\" had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since Strunk and White's \"The Elements of Style\", I have gotten over my own snobbery.\"\n\nIn 2008, King's book \"On Writing\" was ranked 21st on \"Entertainment Weekly\" list of \"The New Classics: The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008\".\n\nKing and his wife Tabitha own Zone Radio Corp, a radio station group consisting of WZON/620 AM, WKIT-FM/100.3 & WZLO/103.1.\n\nKing has stated that his favorite book-to-film adaptations are \"Stand by Me\", \"The Shawshank Redemption\", and \"The Mist\".\n\nKing's first film appearance was in George Romero's \"Knightriders\" as a buffoonish audience member. His first featured role was in \"Creepshow\", in particular the segment \"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\" (King also having written the original story), where he plays the titular character. He has since made cameos in several adaptations of his works. He appeared in \"Pet Sematary\" as a minister at a funeral, in \"Thinner\" as a pharmacist, in \"Rose Red\" as a pizza deliveryman, as a news reporter in \"The Storm of the Century\", in \"The Stand\" as \"Teddy Wieszack,\" in the \"Shining\" miniseries as a band member, in \"The Langoliers\" as Tom Holby; in \"Sleepwalkers\" as the cemetery caretaker and \"Golden Years\" as a bus driver. He has also appeared in \"Chappelle's Show\" and, along with fellow author Amy Tan, on \"The Simpsons\" as himself. In addition to acting, King tried his hand at directing with \"Maximum Overdrive\", in which he also made a cameo appearance as a man using a malfunctioning ATM. King had also been approached to appear in the 1985 Romero film \"Day of the Dead\" as a zombie. Although King declined due to scheduling conflicts, a copy of one of his works makes an appearance being held by the foremost zombie \"Bub\". King would once again work with Romero in 1993 when his work \"The Dark Half\" was filmed and directed by George Romero.\n\nKing produced and acted in a television series, \"Kingdom Hospital\", which is based on the Danish miniseries \"Riget\" by Lars von Trier. He also co-wrote \"The X-Files\" season-5 episode \"Chinga\" with the creator of the series Chris Carter.\n\nKing made an appearance as a contestant on \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" in 1995, playing to benefit the Bangor Public Library.\n\nKing provided the voice of Abraham Lincoln in the audiobook version of \"Assassination Vacation\".\n\nIn 2010, King appeared in a cameo role as a cleaner named Bachman (a reference to his pen name \"Richard Bachman\") on the FX series \"Sons of Anarchy\".\n\nThe Syfy TV series \"Haven\" is based on King's novella, \"The Colorado Kid\".\n\nOn June 19, 1999, at about 4:30 p.m., King was walking on the shoulder of Maine State Route 5, in Lovell, Maine. Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (4 meters) from the pavement of Route 5. According to Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker, King was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking. In his book \"On Writing\" King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic. Shortly before the accident took place, a woman in a car also heading north passed first King and then the light blue Dodge van. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other and the woman told her passenger she hoped \"that guy in the van doesn't hit him\".\n\nKing was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family, but was in considerable pain. The author was first transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by helicopter to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in Lewiston. His injuries—a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg, but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator. After five operations in ten days and physical therapy, King resumed work on \"On Writing\" in July, though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about forty minutes before the pain became unbearable.\n\nKing's lawyer and two others purchased Smith's van for $1,500, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on eBay. The van was later crushed at a junkyard, much to King's disappointment, as he fantasized about smashing it up. King later mentioned during an interview with \"Fresh Air's\" Terry Gross that he wanted the vehicle destroyed at a charity event in which individuals would donate money for an opportunity to smash it with a sledgehammer.\n\nDuring this time, Tabitha King was inspired to redesign his studio. King visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away. What he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died, providing a seed for his novel \"Lisey's Story\" (2006).\n\nIn 2002, King announced he would stop writing, apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries, which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina. He has since resumed writing, but states on his website:\n\nIn April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the Massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18. Although King stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby, he criticized the proposed law, which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture, and to act as surrogate parents to other peoples' children, which he asserted is usually \"disastrous\" and \"undemocratic.\" He also saw the law as inconsistent, as it would forbid a 17-year-old, legally able to see \"\", from buying or renting \"\", which is violent but less graphic. While conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games, King also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society, which would not be lessened by such a law, and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games. King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor, and the easy availability of guns, which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence. Regarding video games, he later stated that he enjoys playing light gun shooter arcade games such as \"Time Crisis\".\n\nA controversy emerged on May 5, 2008, when Noel Sheppard posted a clip of King at a Library of Congress reading event on the website NewsBusters. King, talking to high-school students, had said: \"If you can read, you can walk into a job later on. If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that.\" The comment was described by the blog as \"another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military,\" and likened to John Kerry's similar remark from 2006. King responded later that day, saying, \"That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise.\" King again defended his comment in an interview with the \"Bangor Daily News\" on May 8, saying, \"I'm not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school, so they have more options. Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm not going to change their minds.\" King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. He characterized the comment as originating from a \"brain cramp\", and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in, saying that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some, and for others, a sacrifice of two years of one's life. King added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism.\n\nKing's website states that he is a supporter of the Democratic Party. During the 2008 presidential election, King voiced his support for Democratic candidate Barack Obama. King was quoted as calling conservative commentator Glenn Beck \"Satan's mentally challenged younger brother.\"\n\nOn March 8, 2011, King spoke at a political rally in Sarasota aimed against Governor Rick Scott (R-FL), voicing his opposition to the Tea Party movement.\n\nOn April 30, 2012, King published an article in \"The Daily Beast\" calling for rich Americans, including himself, to pay more taxes, citing it as \"a practical necessity and moral imperative that those who have received much should be obligated to pay ... in the same proportion\".\n\nOn January 25, 2013, King published an essay titled \"Guns\" via Amazon.com's Kindle single feature, which discusses the gun debate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. King called for gun owners to support a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, writing, \"Autos and semi-autos are weapons of mass destruction...When lunatics want to make war on the unarmed and unprepared, these are the weapons they use.\" The essay became the fifth-bestselling non-fiction title for the Kindle.\n\nKing has publicly criticized Donald Trump and his 2016 presidential campaign for his controversial remarks critical of Mexican immigrants to the United States. On August 6, 2015, King posted on Twitter: \"How's this for a Trump campaign slogan: IF YOU'RE WHITE, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT! ANY OTHER HUE, I DON'T TRUST YOU.\" On June 5, 2016, King referred to Trump on Twitter as \"a thin-skinned racist with the temperament of a 3-year-old.\" Trump later blocked him on Twitter, with King responding: “I am hereby blocking him from seeing IT or Mr Mercedes. No clowns for you, Donald. Go float yourself.”\n\nKing had endorsed Shenna Bellows in the 2014 U.S. Senate election for the seat held by Republican Susan Collins.\n\nKing is a public critic of Paul LePage, the Republican Governor of Maine, and has referred to LePage as one of the Three Stooges, along with Florida Governor Rick Scott and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on March 18, 2015, that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office but no apology was issued. King said LePage was \"full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green\" and demanded that LePage \"man up and apologize\". LePage declined to apologize to King, stating \"I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said.\" LePage further told King that he should \"make me the villain of your next book and I won’t charge you royalties\".\n\nThe attention garnered by the LePage criticism has led to efforts to encourage King to run for Governor of Maine in 2018. Bangor city councilor Joe Baldacci posted on his Facebook page that he was starting a Draft Stephen King effort, and Democratic State Rep. Diane Russell launched a petition drive to encourage King to run. His spokeswoman posted to Baldacci's Facebook comment that he would likely decline to run, and King himself stated he would not run or serve on March 23 while still criticizing what he said was the \"laziness that made him mad\" about not checking his tax payments and that LePage had \"a problem finding a comfortable pair of big-boy pants\".\n\nKing sent a tweet on June 30, 2015, stating that LePage is \"a terrible embarrassment to the state I live in and love. If he won't govern, he should resign.\" He later clarified that he was not calling on LePage to resign, but to \"go to work or go back home\". On August 27, 2016, King sent another tweet about LePage, calling him \"a bigot, a homophobe, and a racist\".\n\nKing has stated that he donates approximately $4 million per year \"to libraries, local fire departments that need updated lifesaving equipment (Jaws of Life tools are always a popular request), schools, and a scattering of organisations that underwrite the arts.\"\n\nThe Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, chaired by the author and his wife, ranks 6th among Maine charities in terms of average annual giving with over $2.8 million in grants per year, according to The Grantsmanship Center.\n\nIn November 2011, the STK Foundation donated $70,000 in matched funding via his radio station to help pay the heating bills for families in need in his home town of Bangor, Maine, during the winter.\n\nKing married Tabitha Spruce in 1971. She too is a novelist and philanthropic activist. The couple own and occupy three different houses: one in Bangor, Maine, one in Lovell, Maine, and for the winter a waterfront mansion located off the Gulf of Mexico in Sarasota, Florida. The Kings have three children, a girl and two boys, and four grandchildren. Their daughter Naomi is a Unitarian Universalist Church minister in Plantation, Florida, with her same-sex partner, Rev. Dr. Thandeka. Both of the Kings' sons are authors: Owen King published his first collection of stories, \"We're All in This Together: A Novella and Stories\", in 2005. Joseph Hillstrom King, who writes as Joe Hill, published a collection of short stories, \"20th Century Ghosts\", in 2005. His debut novel, \"Heart-Shaped Box\" (2007), was optioned by Warners Bros. \n\nKing's addictions to alcohol and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he acknowledged in \"On Writing\" in 2000, he can barely remember writing \"Cujo\". Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the rug in front of him evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since. The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was \"Needful Things\".\n\nKing is a fan of baseball, and of the Boston Red Sox in particular; he frequently attends the team's home and away games, and occasionally mentions the team in his novels and stories. He helped coach his son Owen's Bangor West team to the Maine Little League Championship in 1989. He recounts this experience in the \"New Yorker\" essay \"Head Down\", which appears also in the collection \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes\". In 1999, King wrote \"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,\" featuring former Red Sox pitcher Tom Gordon as the protagonist's imaginary companion. In 2004, King co-wrote a book titled \"Faithful: Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season\" with Stewart O'Nan, recounting the authors' roller-coaster reaction to the Red Sox's 2004 season, a season culminating in the Sox winning the 2004 American League Championship Series and World Series. In the 2005 film \"Fever Pitch,\" about an obsessive Boston Red Sox fan, King tosses out the first pitch of the Sox's opening-day game.\n\n\n\n\n"

                "The Shining (film)\n\nThe Shining is a 1980 horror film produced and directed by Stanley Kubrick and co-written with novelist Diane Johnson. The film is based on Stephen King's 1977 novel \"The Shining\".\n\n\"The Shining\" is about Jack Torrance (Jack Nicholson), an aspiring writer and recovering alcoholic, who accepts a position as the off-season caretaker of the isolated historic Overlook Hotel in the Colorado Rockies. Wintering over with Jack is his wife Wendy Torrance (Shelley Duvall) and young son Danny Torrance (Danny Lloyd), who possesses \"the shining\", an array of psychic abilities that allow Danny to see the hotel's horrific past. The hotel's current cook, Dick Hallorann (Scatman Crothers), also has this ability and is able to telepathically communicate with Danny. The hotel had a previous winter caretaker who went crazy and killed his wife, two daughters and then himself. After a winter storm leaves the Torrances snowbound, Jack's sanity deteriorates due to the influence of the supernatural forces that inhabit the hotel, placing his wife and son in danger. Supporting roles are provided by Barry Nelson, Philip Stone, Joe Turkel, Anne Jackson, and Tony Burton.\n\nProduction took place almost exclusively at EMI Elstree Studios with sets strongly based on real locations. Kubrick often worked with a small crew which allowed him to do many takes, sometimes to the exhaustion of the actors and staff. The new Steadicam was used in several scenes giving it an innovative and immersive look and feel. Because of inconsistencies, ambiguities, symbolism, and differences from the book, there has been much speculation into the meanings and actions in the movie.\n\nUnlike Kubrick's previous works, which developed audiences gradually through word-of-mouth, \"The Shining\" was released as a mass-market film, initially opening in two U.S. cities on Memorial Day, then nationwide within a month. The European release of \"The Shining\" a few months later was 25 minutes shorter due to Kubrick's removal of most of the scenes taking place outside the environs of the hotel.\n\nAlthough contemporary responses from critics were mixed, assessment became more favorable in following decades, and it is now widely regarded as one of the greatest horror films ever made. American director Martin Scorsese ranked it one of the 11 scariest horror movies of all time. Critics, scholars, and crew members (such as Kubrick's producer Jan Harlan) have discussed the film's enormous influence on popular culture.\n\nJack Torrance arrives at the mountain-isolated Overlook Hotel, which is twenty-five miles from the closest town, to be interviewed for the position of winter caretaker. Once hired, Jack plans to use the hotel's solitude to write. The hotel, built on the site of a Native American burial ground, becomes snowed-in during the winter; it is closed from October to May. Manager Stuart Ullman warns Jack that a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, developed cabin fever and killed his family and himself. In Boulder, Jack's son, Danny Torrance, has a terrifying premonition about the hotel, viewing a cascade of blood emerging from an elevator door, and then falls into a trance. Jack's wife, Wendy, tells a doctor that Danny has an imaginary friend named Tony, and that Jack has given up drinking because he dislocated Danny's shoulder following a binge.\n\nThe family arrives at the hotel on closing day and is given a tour. The chef, Dick Hallorann, surprises Danny by telepathically offering him ice cream. Dick explains to Danny that he and his grandmother shared this telepathic ability, which he calls \"shining\". Danny asks if there is anything to be afraid of in the hotel, particularly room 237. Hallorann denies it, but tells Danny that the hotel has a \"shine\" to it along with many memories, not all of which are good. He also tells Danny to stay away from room 237.\n\nA month passes; while Jack's writing goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy explore the hotel's hedge maze, and Hallorann goes to Florida. Wendy learns that the phone lines are out due to the heavy snowfall, and Danny has frightening visions. Jack, increasingly frustrated, starts behaving strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts. Danny's curiosity about room 237 overcomes him when he sees the room's door open. Later, Wendy finds Jack screaming during a nightmare while asleep at his typewriter. After she awakens him, Jack says he dreamed that he killed her and Danny. Danny arrives and is visibly traumatized with a bruise on his neck, causing Wendy to accuse Jack of abusing him. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room and meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Lloyd serves him bourbon whiskey while Jack complains about his marriage. Wendy later tells Jack that Danny told her a \"crazy woman in one of the rooms\" attempted to strangle him. Jack investigates room 237, encountering the ghost of a dead woman, but tells Wendy that he saw nothing. Wendy and Jack argue over whether Danny should be removed from the hotel and a furious Jack returns to the Gold Room, now filled with ghosts attending a ball. He meets the ghost of Grady who tells Jack that he must \"correct\" his wife and child and that Danny has reached out to Hallorann using his \"talent\". Meanwhile, Hallorann grows concerned about what's going on at the hotel and flies back to Colorado. Danny starts calling out \"redrum\" and goes into a trance, referring to himself as \"Tony\".\n\nWhile searching for Jack, Wendy discovers he has been typing pages of a repetitive manuscript: \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\". She begs Jack to leave the hotel with Danny, but he threatens her before she knocks him unconscious with a baseball bat. She drags him into the kitchen and locks him in the pantry, but she and Danny are both trapped at the hotel: Jack has disabled the hotel's two-way radio and snowcat. Later, Jack converses through the pantry door with Grady, who unlocks the door.\n\nDanny writes \"REDRUM\" on the outside of the bathroom door in the family's living quarters. When Wendy sees the word reversed in the bedroom mirror, the word is revealed to be \"MURDER\". Jack begins hacking through the quarters' main door with a firefighter's axe. Wendy sends Danny through the bathroom window, but it will not open sufficiently for her to pass. Jack breaks through the bathroom door, shouting \"Here's Johnny!\", but retreats after Wendy slashes his hand with a butcher's knife. Hearing Hallorann arriving in a snowcat he borrowed, Jack leaves the room. He murders Hallorann with the axe in the lobby and pursues Danny into the hedge maze. Wendy runs through the hotel looking for Danny, encountering ghosts and the cascade of blood Danny envisioned in Boulder. She also finds Hallorann's corpse in the lobby. Danny lays a false trail to mislead Jack, who is following his footprints, before hiding behind a drift. Danny escapes from the maze and reunites with Wendy; they escape in Hallorann's snowcat, while Jack freezes to death in the snow. In an old photograph in the hotel hallway dated July 4, 1921, Jack Torrance smiles front and center amid a crowd of party revelers at the Overlook.\n\nIn the shorter European cut, all of the scenes involving Jackson and Burton are cut (although their names still appear in the credits). Dennen is on-screen in both versions of the film, albeit to a limited degree (and with no dialogue) in the shorter cut.\n\nThe actresses who played the ghosts of the murdered Grady daughters, Lisa and Louise Burns, are identical twins; however, the characters in the book and film script are merely sisters, not twins. In the film's dialogue, Mr. Ullman says he thinks they were \"about eight and ten\". Nonetheless, they are frequently referred to in discussions about the film as \"the Grady twins\".\n\nThe resemblance in the staging of the Grady girls and the \"Twins\" photograph by Diane Arbus has been noted both by Arbus' biographer, Patricia Bosworth, the Kubrick assistant who cast and coached them, Leon Vitali, and by numerous Kubrick critics. Although Kubrick both met Arbus personally and studied photography under her during his youthful days as photographer for \"Look\" magazine, Kubrick's widow says he did not deliberately model the Grady girls on Arbus' photograph, in spite of widespread attention to the resemblance.\n\nBefore making \"The Shining\", Stanley Kubrick had directed the 1975 movie \"Barry Lyndon\", a highly visual period film about an Irish man who attempts to make his way into the British aristocracy. Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow. Kubrick, disappointed with \"Barry Lyndon\"&apos;s lack of success, realized he needed to make a film that would be commercially viable as well as artistically fulfilling. Stephen King was told that Kubrick had his staff bring him stacks of horror books as he planted himself in his office to read them all: \"Kubrick's secretary heard the sound of each book hitting the wall as the director flung it into a reject pile after reading the first few pages. Finally one day the secretary noticed it had been a while since she had heard the thud of another writer's work biting the dust. She walked in to check on her boss and found Kubrick deeply engrossed in reading \"The Shining.\"\"\n\nSpeaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that \"there's something inherently wrong with the human personality. There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\".\n\nNicholson was Kubrick's first choice for the role of Jack Torrance; other actors considered included Robert De Niro (who claims the film gave him nightmares for a month), Robin Williams, and Harrison Ford, all of whom met with Stephen King's disapproval. In his search to find the right actor to play Danny, Kubrick sent a husband and wife team, Leon and Kersti Vitali, to Chicago, Denver, and Cincinnati to create an interview pool of 5,000 boys over a six-month period. These cities were chosen since Kubrick was looking for a boy with an accent which fell in between Jack Nicholson's and Shelley Duvall's speech patterns.\n\nHaving chosen King's novel as a basis for his next project, and after a pre-production phase, Kubrick had sets constructed on soundstages at EMI Elstree Studios in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, Britain. Some of the interior designs of the Overlook Hotel set were based on those of the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite National Park. To enable him to shoot the scenes in chronological order, he used several stages at EMI Elstree Studios in order to make all sets available during the complete duration of production. The set for the Overlook Hotel was at the time the largest ever built at Elstree, including a life-size re-creation of the exterior of the hotel. In February 1979, the set at Elstree was badly damaged in a fire, causing a delay in the production.\n\nWhile most of the interior shots, and even some of the Overlook exterior shots, were shot on studio sets, a few exterior shots were shot on location by a second-unit crew headed by Jan Harlan. Saint Mary Lake and Wild Goose Island in Glacier National Park, Montana was the filming location for the aerial shots of the opening scenes, with the Volkswagen Beetle driving along Going-to-the-Sun Road. The Timberline Lodge on Mount Hood in Oregon was filmed for a few of the exterior shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel; notably absent in these shots is the hedge maze, something the Timberline Lodge does not have.\n\nOuttakes of the opening panorama shots were later used by Ridley Scott for the closing moments of the original cut of the film \"Blade Runner\" (1982).\n\n\"The Shining\" had a prolonged and arduous production period, often with very long workdays. Principal photography took over a year to complete, due to Kubrick's highly methodical nature. Actress Shelley Duvall did not get along with Kubrick, frequently arguing with him on set about lines in the script, her acting techniques and numerous other things. Duvall eventually became so overwhelmed by the stress of her role that she became physically ill for months. At one point, she was under so much stress that her hair began to fall out. The shooting script was being changed constantly, sometimes several times a day, adding more stress. Jack Nicholson eventually became so frustrated with the ever-changing script that he would throw away the copies that the production team would give to him to memorize, knowing that it was just going to change anyway. He learned most of his lines just minutes before filming them. Nicholson was living in London with his then-girlfriend Anjelica Huston and her younger sister, Allegra, who testified to his long shooting days. Joe Turkel stated in a 2014 interview that they rehearsed the \"bar scene\" for six weeks, and that the shoot day lasted from 9a.m. to 10:30p.m., with Turkel recollecting that his clothes were soaked in his own sweat by the end of the day's shoot. He also added that it was his favorite scene in the film.\n\nFor the final Gold Room sequence, Kubrick instructed the extras (via megaphone) not to talk, \"but to mime conversation to each other. Kubrick knew from years of scrutinizing thousands of films that extras could often mime their business by nodding and using large gestures that look fake. He told them to act naturally to give the scene a chilling sense of time-tripping realism as Jack walks from the seventies into the roaring twenties\".\n\nFor the international versions of the film, Kubrick shot different takes of Wendy reading the typewriter pages in different languages. For each language, a suitable idiom was used: German (\"Was du heute kannst besorgen, das verschiebe nicht auf morgen\" — \"Never put off till tomorrow what may be done today\"), Italian (\"Il mattino ha l’oro in bocca\" — \"The morning has gold in its mouth\"), French (\"Un «Tiens» vaut mieux que deux «Tu l'auras»\" — \"One 'here you go' is worth more than two 'you'll have it, the equivalent of \"A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush\"), Spanish (\"No por mucho madrugar amanece más temprano\" — \"No matter how early you get up, you can't make the sun rise any sooner.\") These alternate shots were not included with the DVD release, where only the English phrase \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" was used.\n\nThe door that Jack chops through with the axe near the end of the film was a real door. Kubrick had originally shot this scene with a fake door, but Nicholson, who had worked as a volunteer fire marshal, tore it down too quickly. Jack's line, \"Heeeere's Johnny!\", is taken from Ed McMahon's famous introduction to \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\", and was improvised by Nicholson. Kubrick, who had lived in England for some time, was unaware of the significance of the line, and nearly used a different take. Carson later used the Nicholson clip to open his 1980 anniversary show on NBC.\n\nDuring production, Kubrick screened David Lynch's \"Eraserhead\" (1977) to the cast and crew, to convey the mood he wanted to achieve for the film.\n\n\"The Shining\" was among the first half-dozen films (after the 1976 films \"Bound for Glory\", \"Marathon Man\", and \"Rocky\"), to use the newly developed Steadicam, a stabilizing mount for a motion picture camera, which mechanically separates the operator's movement from the camera's, allowing smooth tracking shots while the operator is moving over an uneven surface. It essentially combines the stabilized steady footage of a regular mount with the fluidity and flexibility of a handheld camera. The inventor of the Steadicam, Garrett Brown, was heavily involved with the production of \"The Shining\". Brown has described his excitement taking his first tour of the sets which offered \"further possibilities for the Steadicam\". This tour convinced Brown to become personally involved with the production. Kubrick was not \"just talking of stunt shots and staircases\". Rather he would use the Steadicam \"as it was intended to be used — as a tool which can help get the lens where it's wanted in space and time without the classic limitations of the dolly and crane\". Brown used an 18 mm Cooke lens that allowed the Steadicam to pass within an inch of walls and door frames. Brown published an article in \"American Cinematographer\" about his experience, and contributed to the audio commentary on the 2007 DVD release.\nKubrick personally aided in modifying the Steadicam's video transmission technology. Brown states his own abilities to operate the Steadicam were refined by working on Kubrick's film. For this film, Brown developed a two-handed technique, which enabled him to maintain the camera at one height while panning and tilting the camera. In addition to tracking shots from behind, the Steadicam enabled shooting in constricted rooms without flying out walls, or backing the camera into doors. Brown notes that:\nThis required the Steadicam to be on a special mount modeled on a wheelchair in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the sound man. The weight of the rig and its occupants proved to be too much for the original tires however, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused a serious crash. Solid tires were then mounted on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform take after identical take. Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a Steadicam.\n\nThe stylistically modernist art-music chosen by Kubrick is similar to the repertoire he first explored in \"\". Although the repertoire was selected by Kubrick, the process of matching passages of music to motion picture was left almost entirely at the discretion of music editor Gordon Stainforth, whose work on this film is known for the attention to fine details and remarkably precise synchronization without excessive splicing.\n\nThe soundtrack album on LP was withdrawn due to problems with licensing of the music. It remains only available on vinyl (there has never been a CD release) and is difficult to find. The LP soundtrack omits some pieces heard in the film, and also includes complete versions of pieces of which only fragments are heard in the film.\n\nThe non-original music on the soundtrack is as follows:\n\nUpon their arrival at Elstree Studios, Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind were shown the first version of the film by Kubrick: \"The film was a little on the long side. There were great gobs of scenes that never made it to the film. There was a whole strange and mystical scene in which Jack Nicholson discovers objects that have been arranged in his working space in the ballroom with arrows and things. He walks down and thinks he hears a voice and a ghost throws a ball back to him. None of that made it to the final film. We scored a lot of those. We didn't know what was going to be used for sure\". Carlos has said that she was so disillusioned by Kubrick's actions that she vowed never to work with him again. Her own music was released in its near entirety in 2005 as part of her \"Rediscovering Lost Scores\" compilation.\n\nAfter its premiere and a week into the general run (with a running time of 146 minutes), Kubrick cut a scene at the end that took place in a hospital. The scene shows Wendy in a bed talking with Mr. Ullman who explains that Jack's body could not be found; he then gives Danny a yellow tennis ball, presumably the same one that Jack was throwing around the hotel. This scene was subsequently physically cut out of prints by projectionists and sent back to the studio by order of Warner Bros., the film's distributor. This cut the film's running time to 144 minutes. As noted by Roger Ebert:\nFor its release in Europe, Kubrick cut about 25 minutes from the film. The excised scenes included a longer meeting between Jack and Watson at the hotel, Danny being attended by a doctor (Anne Jackson) including references to Tony and how Danny was once injured by Jack in a drunken rage, more footage of Hallorann's attempts to get to the hotel during the snowstorm including a sequence with a garage attendant (Tony Burton), extended dialogue scenes at the hotel, and a scene where Wendy discovers a group of skeletons in the hotel lobby during the climax. Jackson and Burton are credited in the European print, despite their scenes being excised from the movie. According to Harlan, Kubrick decided to cut some sequences because the film was \"not very well received\", and after Warner Bros. complained about its ambiguity and length.\n\nThe scene where Jack writes obsessively on the typewriter \"\"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\"\" was shot changing the language of the typescript in Italian, French, Spanish, and German, because the film would be dubbed in these languages in their respective countries. In the Italian version, Nicholson was dubbed by Giancarlo Giannini; Kubrick sent him a congratulations letter for his excellent work as voice actor.\n\nTwo alternative takes were used in a British television commercial.\n\nThe U.S. premiere by ABC on May 6, 1983 started with a placard saying, \"TONIGHT’S FILM DEALS WITH THE SUPERNATURAL, AS A POSSESSED MAN ATTEMPTS TO DESTROY HIS FAMILY.\" With the movie's ambiguities, it is not known how Kubrick felt about or if he agreed with this proclamation. The placard also said that the film was edited for television and warned about the content.\n\nThe U.S. region 1 DVD of the film is the longer (144 minute) edit of the film. The European (including UK) region 2 DVD is the shorter (119 minute) version. On British television, the short version played on Channel 4 once and on Sky Movies numerous times in the mid-nineties. All other screenings, before and since these, have been on either ITV or ITV4 and have been the longer U.S. edit. The German DVD shows the short version, as seen in German television screenings.\n\nIn accordance with stipulations contained in Kubrick's will, DVD releases show the film in open matte (i.e., with more picture content visible than in movie theaters). The scene in which Wendy discovers her husband's work (consisting only of a simple proverb: \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" repeatedly typed on numerous pages) was shot with different proverbs in at least five languages (English, French, Spanish, Italian and German). Nevertheless, most DVD releases show the English version, disregarding the dub language.\n\nDVDs in both regions contain a candid fly-on-the-wall 33-minute documentary made by Kubrick's daughter Vivian (who was 17 when she filmed it) entitled \"Making The Shining\", originally shown on British television in 1980. She also provided an audio commentary track about her documentary for its DVD release. It appears even on pre-2007 editions of \"The Shining\" on DVD, although most DVDs of Kubrick films before then were devoid of documentaries or audio commentaries. It has some candid interviews and very private moments caught on set, such as arguments with cast and director, moments of a no-nonsense Kubrick directing his actors, Scatman Crothers being overwhelmed with emotion during his interview, Shelley Duvall collapsing from exhaustion on the set, and Jack Nicholson enjoying playing up to the behind-the-scenes camera.\n\n\"The Shining\" had a slow start at the box office, but gained momentum, eventually doing well commercially during the summer of 1980 and making Warner Bros. a profit. It opened at first to mixed reviews. Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" lauded Nicholson's performance and praised the Overlook Hotel as an effective setting for horror, but wrote that \"the supernatural story knows frustratingly little rhyme or reason […] Even the film's most startling horrific images seem overbearing and perhaps even irrelevant.\" \"Variety\" was critical, saying, \"With everything to work with, ... Kubrick has teamed with jumpy Jack Nicholson to destroy all that was so terrifying about Stephen King's bestseller.\" A common initial criticism was the slow pacing, which was highly atypical of horror films of the time. Roger Ebert did not review the film on his television show when first released, and in print complained that it was hard to connect with any of the characters. It was the only one of Kubrick's last nine films to receive no nominations at all from either the Oscars or Golden Globes, but was nominated for a pair of Razzie Awards, including Worst Director and Worst Actress (Duvall), in the first year that award was given.\n\nTim Cahill of \"Rolling Stone\" noted in an interview with Kubrick that by 1987 there was already a \"critical reevaluation of [\"The Shining\"] in process\". As with most Kubrick films, more recent analyses have treated the film more favorably. Viewers subsequently decided the slow pacing actually contributes to the film's hypnotic quality. Film website Rotten Tomatoes, which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics, gave the film a 'Certified Fresh' score of 87% based on 69 reviews with an average rating of 8.4/10.\n\nIn 2006, Roger Ebert, who was initially critical of the work, inducted \"The Shining\" into his Great Movies series, saying, \"Stanley Kubrick's cold and frightening \"The Shining\" challenges us to decide: Who is the reliable observer? Whose idea of events can we trust? […] It is this elusive open-endedness that makes Kubrick's film so strangely disturbing.\"\n\nHorror film critic Peter Bracke reviewing the Blu-ray release in \"Hi-Def Digest\" writes:\n\nJust as the ghostly apparitions of the film's fictional Overlook Hotel would play tricks on the mind of poor Jack Torrance, so too has the passage of time changed the perception of \"The Shining\" itself. Many of the same reviewers who lambasted the film for \"not being scary\" enough back in 1980 now rank it among the most effective horror films ever made, while audiences who hated the film back then now vividly recall being \"terrified\" by the experience. \"The Shining\" has somehow risen from the ashes of its own bad press to redefine itself not only as a seminal work of the genre, but perhaps the most stately, artful horror ever made.\n\n\"The Shining\" is widely acclaimed by today's critics, and has become a staple of pop culture. In 2001, the film was ranked 29th on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Thrills list and Jack Torrance was named the 25th greatest villain on the AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains list in 2003. In 2005, the quote \"Here's Johnny!\" was ranked 68 on AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movie Quotes list. It was named the all-time scariest film by Channel 4, Total Film labeled it the 5th greatest horror film, and Bravo TV named one of the film's scenes 6th on their list of the 100 Scariest Movie Moments. In addition, film critics Kim Newman and Jonathan Romney both placed it in their top ten lists for the 2002 \"Sight & Sound\" poll. Director Martin Scorsese placed \"The Shining\" on his list of the 11 scariest horror films of all time.\nMathematicians at London's King's College used statistical modeling in a study commissioned by \"Sky Movies\" to conclude that \"The Shining\" was the \"perfect scary movie\" due to a proper balance of various ingredients including shock value, suspense, gore and size of the cast. It was voted the 62nd greatest American film ever made in a 2015 poll conducted by BBC.\n\nIn 1999, Jonathan Romney discussed Kubrick's perfectionism and dispelled others' initial arguments that the film lacked complexity: \"The final scene alone demonstrates what a rich source of perplexity \"The Shining\" offers [...] look beyond the simplicity and the Overlook reveals itself as a palace of paradox\". Romney further explains:The dominating presence of the Overlook Hotel – designed by Roy Walker as a composite of American hotels visited in the course of research – is an extraordinary vindication of the value of mise en scène. It's a real, complex space that we don't just see but come to virtually inhabit. The confinement is palpable: horror cinema is an art of claustrophobia, making us loath to stay in the cinema but unable to leave. Yet it's combined with a sort of agoraphobia – we are as frightened of the hotel's cavernous vastness as of its corridors' enclosure. ... The film sets up a complex dynamic between simple domesticity and magnificent grandeur, between the supernatural and the mundane in which the viewer is disoriented by the combination of spaciousness and confinement, and an uncertainty as to just what is real or not.\n\nSpeaking about the theme of the film, Kubrick stated that \"there's something inherently wrong with the human personality. There's an evil side to it. One of the things that horror stories can do is to show us the archetypes of the unconscious; we can see the dark side without having to confront it directly\". Stephen King has been quoted as saying that although Kubrick made a film with memorable imagery, it was poor as an adaptation and that it is the only adaptation of his novels that he could \"remember hating\". However, in King's 1981 nonfiction book \"Danse Macabre\", he listed Kubrick's film among those he considered to have \"contributed something of value to the [horror] genre\" and mentioned it as one of his \"personal favorites\". Before the 1980 movie King often said he gave little attention to the film adaptations of his work.\n\nKing himself was suffering from alcoholism at the time he wrote the novel, therefore giving a strong autobiographical element to the story. He has expressed disappointment that his novel's important themes, such as the disintegration of family and the dangers of alcoholism, are less prevalent in the film. King also viewed the casting of Nicholson as a mistake, arguing it would result in a rapid realization among audiences that Jack would ultimately go mad, due to Nicholson's famous identification with the character of McMurphy in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\" (1975). King had suggested that a more “everyman”-like actor such as Jon Voight, Christopher Reeve, or Michael Moriarty play the role, so that Jack's subsequent descent into madness would be more unnerving.\n\nIn an interview with the BBC, King also criticized Shelley Duvall's performance in the film, stating \"(S)he's basically just there to scream and be stupid, and that's not the woman that I wrote about.\"\n\nOver the years, contradictions have arisen in the discussion of King's criticisms. The author once suggested that he disliked the film's downplaying of the supernatural; King had envisioned Jack as a victim of the genuinely external forces haunting the hotel, whereas King felt Kubrick had viewed the haunting and its resulting malignancy as coming from within Jack himself. In October 2013, however, journalist Laura Miller wrote that the discrepancy between the two was almost the complete opposite: the Jack Torrance of the novel was corrupted by his own choices – particularly alcoholism – whereas in Kubrick's adaptation the causes are actually more surreal and ambiguous:King is, essentially, a novelist of morality. The decisions his characters make — whether it’s to confront a pack of vampires or to break 10 years of sobriety — are what matter to him. But in Kubrick’s \"The Shining\", the characters are largely in the grip of forces beyond their control. It’s a film in which domestic violence occurs, while King’s novel is about domestic violence as a choice certain men make when they refuse to abandon a delusional, defensive entitlement. As King sees it, Kubrick treats his characters like “insects” because the director doesn’t really consider them capable of shaping their own fates. Everything they do is subordinate to an overweening, irresistible force, which is Kubrick’s highly developed aesthetic; they are its slaves. In King’s “The Shining”, the monster is Jack. In Kubrick’s, the monster is Kubrick.\n\nKing's oft-cited remark about Kubrick being a man who “thinks too much and feels too little” is often misconstrued as a remark on Kubrick's obsessive and detached approach to directing actors, but it is actually a less disparaging reference to Kubrick's skepticism regarding the verisimilitude of the supernatural, which emerged in pre-production conversations between King and Kubrick. The full context of King's well-known quote is:\n\nMark Browning, a critic of King's work, observed that King's novels frequently contain a narrative closure that completes the story, which Kubrick's film lacks. Browning has in fact argued that King has exactly the opposite problem of which he accused Kubrick. King, he believes, \"feels too much and thinks too little\".\n\nKing was also disappointed by Kubrick's decision not to film at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, which inspired the story (a decision Kubrick made since the hotel lacked sufficient snow and electricity). However, King finally supervised the 1997 television adaptation also titled \"The Shining\", filmed at The Stanley Hotel.\n\nThe animosity of King toward Kubrick's adaptation has dulled over time. During an interview segment on the Bravo channel, King stated that the first time he watched Kubrick's adaptation, he found it to be \"dreadfully unsettling\".\n\nNonetheless, writing in the afterword of \"Doctor Sleep\", King professed continued dissatisfaction with the Kubrick film. He said of it \"...of course there was Stanley Kubrick's movie which many seem to remember — for reasons I have never quite understood — as one of the scariest films they have ever seen. If you have seen the movie but not read the novel, you should note that \"Doctor Sleep\" follows the latter which is, in my opinion, the True History of the Torrance Family.\"\n\nFilm critic Jonathan Romney writes that the film has been interpreted in many different ways; as being about the crisis in masculinity, sexism, corporate America, and racism: \"It's tempting to read \"The Shining\" as an Oedipal struggle not just between generations but between Jack's culture of the written word and Danny's culture of images...\" Romney writes, \"Jack also uses the written word to more mundane purpose – to sign his 'contract' with the Overlook. 'I gave my word,' [..] which we take to mean 'gave his soul' in the [..] Faustian sense. But maybe he means it more literally – by the end [..] he has renounced language entirely, pursuing Danny through the maze with an inarticulate animal roar. What he has entered into is a conventional business deal that places commercial obligation [..] over the unspoken contract of compassion and empathy that he seems to have neglected to sign with his family.\" These varied interpretations spawned the 2012 documentary \"Room 237\", directed by Rodney Ascher, which provides an in-depth exploration of various interpretations of, and myths surrounding, the film.\n\nAmong interpreters who see the film reflecting more subtly the social concerns that animate other Kubrick films, one of the earliest and most well-known viewpoints was discussed in an essay by ABC reporter Bill Blakemore entitled \"Kubrick's 'Shining' Secret: Film's Hidden Horror Is The Murder Of The Indian\", first published in \"The Washington Post\" on July 12, 1987. He believes that indirect references to American killings of Native Americans pervade the film, as exemplified by the Amerindian logos on the baking powder in the kitchen, and the Amerindian artwork that appears throughout the hotel, though no Native Americans are ever seen. Stuart Ullman tells Wendy that when building the hotel, a few Indian attacks had to be fended off since it was constructed on an Indian burial ground.\n\nBlakemore's general argument is that the film as a whole is a metaphor for the genocide of Native Americans. He notes that when Jack kills Hallorann, the dead body is seen lying on a rug with an Indian motif. The blood in the elevator shafts is, for Blakemore, the blood of the Indians in the burial ground on which the hotel was built. As such, the fact that the date of the final photograph is July 4 is meant to be deeply ironic. Blakemore writes:\n\nAs with some of his other movies, Kubrick ends \"The Shining\" with a powerful visual puzzle that forces the audience to leave the theater asking, \"What was that all about?\" \"The Shining\" ends with an extremely long camera shot moving down a hallway in the Overlook, reaching eventually the central photo among 21 photos on the wall. The caption reads: \"Overlook Hotel-July 4th Ball-1921.\" The answer to this puzzle, is that most Americans overlook the fact that July Fourth was no ball, nor any kind of Independence day, for native Americans; that the weak American villain of the film is the re-embodiment of the American men who massacred the Indians in earlier years; that Kubrick is examining and reflecting on a problem that cuts through the decades and centuries.\nAlso likely significant is that before Jack's behavior starts becoming aberrant, he is seen throwing a tennis ball hard against Amerindian artwork on the walls and floor, and just a few feet over a mounted buffalo head (which was an animal key to the Plains Indians' economy and culture before it was hunted and slaughtered nearly to extinction in the 19th century, mostly by Euro-Americans). Later, Jack murders Halloran, and tries to murder his family, using an axe, which resembles the tomahawk, a frequently depicted weapon of the Amerindians.\n\nFilm writer John Capo sees the film as an allegory of American imperialism. This is exemplified by many clues, such as the closing photo of Jack in the past at a 4th of July party, or Jack's earlier citation of the Rudyard Kipling poem \"The White Man's Burden\". The poem has been interpreted as rationalizing the European colonization of non-white people, while Jack's line has been interpreted as referring to alcoholism, from which he suffers.\n\nFilm historian Geoffrey Cocks has extended Blakemore's idea that the film has a subtext about Native Americans to arguing that the film indirectly reflects Stanley Kubrick's concerns about the Holocaust (Both Cocks' book and Michael Herr's memoir of Kubrick discuss how he wanted his entire life to make a film dealing directly with the Holocaust, but could never quite get the handle on it that satisfied him). Cocks is a cultural historian best known for describing the impact of the Holocaust on subsequent Western culture. Cocks, writing in his book \"The Wolf at the Door: Stanley Kubrick, History and the Holocaust\", proposed a controversial theory that all of Kubrick's work is informed by the Holocaust; there is, he says, a strong (though hidden) holocaust subtext in \"The Shining\". This, Cocks believes, is why Kubrick's screenplay goes to emotional extremes, omitting much of the novel's supernaturalism and making the character of Wendy much more hysteria-prone. Cocks places Kubrick's vision of a haunted hotel in line with a long literary tradition of hotels in which sinister events occur, from Stephen Crane's short story \"The Blue Hotel\" (which Kubrick admired) to the Swiss Berghof in Thomas Mann's novel \"The Magic Mountain\", about a snowbound sanatorium high in the Swiss Alps in which the protagonist witnesses a series of events which are a microcosm of the decline of Western culture. In keeping with this tradition, Kubrick's film focuses on domesticity and the Torrances' attempt to use this imposing building as a home which Jack Torrance describes as \"homey\".\n\nCocks claims that Kubrick has elaborately coded many of his historical concerns into the film with manipulations of numbers and colors and his choice of musical numbers, many of which are post-war compositions influenced by the horrors of World War II. Of particular note is Kubrick's use of Penderecki's \"The Awakening of Jacob\" to accompany Jack Torrance's dream of killing his family and Danny's vision of past carnage in the hotel, a piece of music originally associated with the horrors of the Holocaust. As such, Kubrick's pessimistic ending in contrast to Stephen King's optimistic one is in keeping with the motifs that Kubrick wove into the story.\n\nCocks' work has been anthologized and discussed in other works on Stanley Kubrick films, but sometimes with skepticism. In particular, Julian Rice writing in the opening chapter of his book \"Kubrick's Hope\" believes Cocks' views are excessively speculative and contain too many strained \"critical leaps\" of faith. Rice holds that what went on in Kubrick's mind cannot be replicated or corroborated beyond a broad vision of the nature of good and evil (which included concern about the Holocaust), but Kubrick's art is not governed by this one single obsession. Diane Johnson, co-screenwriter for \"The Shining\", commented on Cocks' observations and holds that preoccupation with the Jewish Holocaust on Kubrick's part could very likely have motivated his decision to place the hotel on a Native American burial ground, although Kubrick never directly mentioned it to her.\n\nGeoffrey Cocks notes that the film contains many allusions to fairy tales, both \"Hansel and Gretel\" and the \"Three Little Pigs\", with Jack Torrance identified as the Big Bad Wolf, which Bruno Bettelheim interprets as standing for \"all the asocial unconscious devouring powers\" that must be overcome by a child's ego.\n\nThe saying \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" appeared first in James Howell's \"Proverbs in English, Italian, French and Spanish\" (1659).\n\nRoger Ebert notes that the film does not really have a \"reliable observer\", with the possible exception of Dick Hallorann. Ebert believes various events call into question the reliability of Jack, Wendy, and Danny at various points. This leads Ebert to conclude that:\nEbert ultimately concludes that \"The movie is not about ghosts but about madness and the energies\". Likewise, film critic James Berardinelli (who is generally much less impressed with the film than Ebert), notes that \"King would have us believe that the hotel is haunted. Kubrick is less definitive in the interpretations he offers.\" He dubs the film a failure as a ghost story, but brilliant as a study of \"madness and the unreliable narrator.\"\n\nIn some sequences, there is a question of whether or not there are ghosts present. In the scenes where Jack sees ghosts he is always facing a mirror, or in the case of his storeroom conversation with Grady, a reflective, highly polished door. Film reviewer James Berardinelli notes \"It has been pointed out that there's a mirror in every scene in which Jack sees a ghost, causing us to wonder whether the spirits are reflections of a tortured psyche.\"\nIn \"Hollywood's Stephen King\", Tony Magistrale writes:\n\nKubrick's reliance on mirrors as visual aids for underscoring the thematic meaning of this film portrays visually the internal transformations and oppositions that are occurring to Jack Torrance psychologically. Through...these devices, Kubrick dramatizes the hotel's methodical assault on Torrance's identity, its ability to stimulate the myriad of self-doubts and anxieties by creating opportunities to warp Torrance's perspective on himself and [his family]. Furthermore the fact that Jack looks into a mirror whenever he \"speaks\" to the hotel means, to some extent, that Kubrick implicates him directly into the hotel's \"consciousness\", because Jack is, in effect, talking to himself.\nGhosts are the implied explanation for Jack's escape from the locked storeroom. In an interview by scholar Michel Ciment, Kubrick stated:\n\nIt seemed to strike an extraordinary balance between the psychological and the supernatural in such a way as to lead you to think that the supernatural would eventually be explained by the psychological: 'Jack must be imagining these things because he's crazy.' This allowed you to suspend your doubt of the supernatural until you were so thoroughly into the story that you could accept it almost without noticing...It's not until Grady, the ghost of the former caretaker who axed to death his family, slides open the bolt of the larder door, allowing Jack to escape, that you are left with no other explanation but the supernatural.\nEarly in the film, Stuart Ullman tells Jack of a previous caretaker, Charles Grady, who, in 1970, succumbed to cabin fever, murdered his family and then killed himself. Later, Jack meets a ghostly butler named Grady. Jack says he knows about the murders, claiming to recognize Grady from pictures; however, the butler introduces himself as \"Delbert\" Grady.\n\nGordon Dahlquist of \"The Kubrick FAQ\" argues that the name change \"deliberately mirrors Jack Torrance being both the husband of Wendy/father of Danny and the mysterious man in the July Fourth photo. It is to say he is two people: the man with choice in a perilous situation and the man who has 'always' been at the Overlook. It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does, and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that \"The Shining\" brings up. In the same way Charles had a chance – once more, perhaps – to not take on Delbert's legacy, so Jack may have had a chance to escape his role as 'caretaker' to the interests of the powerful. It's the tragic course of this story that he chooses not to.\" Dahlquist's argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two different people or the same are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance, but nor is he someone entirely different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook, Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel. The film's assistant editor Gordon Stainforth has commented on this issue, attempting to steer a course between the continuity-error explanation on one side and the hidden-meaning explanation on the other; \"I don't think we'll ever quite unravel this. Was his full name Charles Delbert Grady? Perhaps Charles was a sort of nickname? Perhaps Ullman got the name wrong? But I also think that Stanley did NOT want the whole story to fit together too neatly, so [it is] absolutely correct, I think, to say that 'the sum of what we learn refuses to add up neatly'.\"\n\nAmong Kubrick's other doubling / mirroring effects in the film:\n\n\nAt the end of the film, the camera moves slowly towards a wall in the Overlook and a 1921 photograph, revealed to include Jack Torrance seen at the middle of a 1921 party. In an interview with Michel Ciment, Kubrick overtly declared that the photograph suggests that Jack was a reincarnation of an earlier official at the hotel. Still, this has not stopped interpreters from developing alternative readings, such as that Jack has been \"absorbed\" into the Overlook Hotel. Film critic Jonathan Romney, while acknowledging the absorption theory, wroteAs the ghostly butler Grady (Philip Stone) tells him during their chilling confrontation in the men's toilet, 'You're the caretaker, sir. You've always been the caretaker.' Perhaps in some earlier incarnation Jack really was around in 1921, and it's his present-day self that is the shadow, the phantom photographic copy. But if his picture has been there all along, why has no one noticed it? After all, it's right at the center of the central picture on the wall, and the Torrances have had a painfully drawn-out winter of mind-numbing leisure in which to inspect every corner of the place. Is it just that, like Poe's purloined letter, the thing in plain sight is the last thing you see? When you do see it, the effect is so unsettling because you realise the unthinkable was there under your nose – overlooked – the whole time.\n\nScreenwriter Todd Alcott has noted:\n\nArtist Juli Kearns first identified and created maps of spatial discrepancies in the overall layout of the Overlook Hotel location, the interiors of which were constructed in studios in England. These spatial discrepancies included windows appearing in impossible places, such as in Stuart Ullman's office which is surrounded by interior hallways, and apartment doorways positioned in places where they cannot possibly lead to apartments. Rob Ager is another proponent of this theory. Jan Harlan, an Executive Producer on \"The Shining\", was asked about the discontinuity of sets by Xan Brooks of \"The Guardian\" and confirmed the discontinuity was intentional, \"The set was very deliberately built to be offbeat and off the track, so that the huge ballroom would never actually fit inside. The audience is deliberately made not to know where they're going. People say The Shining doesn't make sense. Well spotted! It's a ghost movie. It's not supposed to make sense.\" Harlan further elaborated to Kate Abbot for the same newspaper, \"Stephen King gave him the go-ahead to change his book, so Stanley agreed – and wrote a much more ambiguous script. It's clear instantly there's something foul going on. At the little hotel, everything is like Disney, all kitsch wood on the outside – but the interiors don't make sense. Those huge corridors and ballrooms couldn't fit inside. In fact, nothing makes sense.\"\n\nThe film differs from the novel significantly with regard to characterization and motivation of action. The most obvious differences are those regarding the personality of Jack Torrance (the source of much of author Stephen King’s dissatisfaction with the film).\n\nIn the film, the motive of the ghosts is apparently to \"reclaim\" Jack (even though Grady expresses an interest in Danny's \"shining\" ability), who seems to be a reincarnation of a previous caretaker of the hotel, as suggested by the 1920s photograph of Jack at the end of the film and Jack's repeated claims to have \"not just a deja vu\". The film is even more focused on Jack (as opposed to Danny) than the novel.\n\nThe room number 217 has been changed to 237. Timberline Lodge, located on Mt. Hood in Oregon, was used for the exterior shots of the fictional Overlook Hotel. The Lodge requested that Kubrick not depict Room 217 (featured in the book) in \"The Shining\", because future guests at the Lodge might be afraid to stay there, and a nonexistent room, 237, was substituted in the film. Contrary to the hotel's expectations, Room 217 is requested more often than any other room at Timberline.\n\nThere are fringe analyses relating this number change to rumors that Kubrick faked the first moon landing, as there are approximately 237,000 miles between Earth and Moon (average is 238,855 miles) and the movie is a subtle confession of his involvement. Another theory is an obsession with the number 42 and its forms in the movie and the product of the digits in 237 is 42.\n\nThe novel presents Jack as initially likable and well-intentioned but haunted by the demons of alcohol and authority issues. Nonetheless, he becomes gradually overwhelmed by the evil forces in the hotel. At the novel's conclusion, the hotel forces have possessed Jack's body and proceed to destroy all that is left of his mind during a final showdown with Danny, leaving a monstrous entity that Danny is able to divert while he, Wendy and Dick Halloran escape. The film's Jack is established as somewhat sinister much earlier in the story and dies in a different manner. Jack actually kills Dick Hallorann in the film, but only wounds him in the novel. King attempted to talk Stanley Kubrick out of casting Jack Nicholson even before filming began, on the grounds that he seemed vaguely sinister from the very beginning of the film, and had suggested Jon Voight among others for the role.\n\nOnly in the novel does Jack hear the haunting, heavy-handed voice of his father with whom he had a troubled relationship. In both the novel and film, Jack's encounter with the ghostly bartender is pivotal to Jack's deterioration. However, the novel gives much more detail about Jack's problems with drinking and alcohol.\n\nThe film prolongs Jack's struggle with writer's block. Kubrick's co-screenwriter Diane Johnson believes that in King's novel, Jack's discovery of the scrapbook of clippings in the boiler room of the hotel which gives him new ideas for a novel catalyzes his possession by the ghosts of the hotel, while at the same time unblocking his writing. Jack is no longer a blocked writer, but now filled with energy. In her contribution to the screenplay, Johnson wrote an adaptation of this scene, which to her regret Kubrick later excised, as she felt this left the father's change less motivated. Kubrick showed Jack's continued blockage quite late in the film with the \"all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy\" scene, which does not appear in the novel.\n\nStephen King has openly stated on the DVD commentary of the 1997 mini-series of \"The Shining\" that the character of Jack Torrance was partially autobiographical, as he was struggling with both alcoholism and unprovoked rage toward his family at the time of writing. Tony Magistrale wrote about Kubrick's version of Jack Torrance in \"Hollywood's Stephen King\":\nFrom Thomas Allen Nelson's \"Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze\": \"When Jack moves through the reception area on his way to a 'shining' over the model maze, he throws a yellow tennis ball past a stuffed bear and Danny's Big Wheel, which rests on the very spot (a Navajo circle design) where Hallorann will be murdered.\"\nJack's tennis ball mysteriously rolls into Danny's circle of toy cars just before the boy walks through the open door of Room 237.\n\n\"In the film's opening, the camera from above moves over water and through mountains with the ease of a bird in flight. Below, on a winding mountain road, Jack's diminutive yellow Volkswagen journeys through a tree-lined maze, resembling one of Danny's toy cars or the yellow tennis ball seen later outside of Room 237.\"\n\nDanny Torrance is considerably more open about his supernatural abilities in the novel, discussing them with strangers such as his doctor. In the film, he is quite secretive about them even with his prime mentor Dick Halloran, who also has these abilities. (The same is true of Dick Halloran, who in his journey back to the Overlook in the book, talks with others with the \"shining\" ability, while in the film he lies about his reason for returning to the Overlook.) Danny in the novel is generally portrayed as unusually intelligent across the board. In the film, he is more ordinary, though with a preternatural gift. In the novel, Danny is much more bonded to his father than in the film.\n\nAlthough Danny has supernatural powers in both versions, the novel makes it clear that his apparent imaginary friend \"Tony\" really is a projection of hidden parts of his own psyche, though heavily amplified by Danny's psychic \"shining\" abilities. At the end it is revealed that Danny Torrance's middle name is \"Anthony\".\n\nWendy Torrance in the film is relatively meek, submissive, passive, gentle, and mousy; this is shown by the way she defends Jack even in his absence to the doctor examining Danny. It is implied she has perhaps been abused by him as well. In the novel, she is a far more self-reliant and independent personality who is tied to Jack in part by her poor relationship with her parents. In the novel, she never displays hysteria or collapses the way she does in the film, but remains cool and self-reliant. Writing in \"Hollywood's Stephen King\", author Tony Magistrale writes about the mini-series remake:\nDe Mornay restores much of the steely resilience found in the protagonist of King's novel and this is particularly noteworthy when compared to Shelley Duvall's exaggerated portrayal of Wendy as Olive Oyl revisited: A simpering fatality of forces beyond her capacity to understand, much less surmount.\nCo-screenwriter Diane Johnson stated that in her contributions to the script, Wendy had more dialogue, and that Kubrick cut many of her lines, possibly due to his dissatisfaction with actress Shelley Duvall's delivery. Johnson believes the earlier draft of the script portrayed Wendy as a more-rounded character.\n\nIn the novel, Jack's authority issues are triggered by the fact that his interviewer, Ullman, is highly authoritarian, a kind of snobbish martinet. The film's Ullman is far more humane and concerned about Jack's well-being, as well as smooth and self-assured. Only in the novel does Ullman state that he disapproves of hiring Jack but higher authorities have asked that Jack be hired. Ullman's bossy nature in the novel is one of the first steps in Jack's deterioration, whereas in the film, Ullman serves largely as an expositor.\n\nIn \"Stanley Kubrick and the Art of Adaptation\", author Greg Jenkins writes \"A toadish figure in the book, Ullman has been utterly reinvented for the film; he now radiates charm, grace and gentility.\"\n\nFrom \"Kubrick: Inside a Film Artist's Maze\": Ullman tells Jack that the hotel's season runs from May 15 to October 30, meaning the Torrances moved in on Halloween. On Ullmann's desk next to a small American flag sits a metal cup containing pencils and a pen—and a miniature replica of an ax.\n\n\"When Ullman, himself all smiles, relates as a footnote the story about the former caretaker who 'seemed perfectly normal' but nevertheless cut up his family with an ax, Jack's obvious interest (as if he's recalling one of his own nightmares) and his insincere congeniality (early signs of a personality malfunction) lead the viewer to believe that the film's definition of his madness will be far more complex.\"\n\nStephen King provides the reader with a great deal of information about the stress in the Torrance family early in the story, including revelations of Jack's physical abuse of Danny and Wendy's fear of Danny's mysterious spells. Kubrick tones down the early family tension and reveals family disharmony much more gradually than does King. In the film, Danny has a stronger emotional bond with Wendy than with Jack, which fuels Jack's rather paranoid notion that the two are conspiring against him.\n\nIn the novel Jack recovers his sanity and goodwill through the intervention of Danny while this does not occur in the film. Writing in \"Cinefantastique\" magazine, Frederick Clarke suggests \"Instead of playing a normal man who becomes insane, Nicholson portrays a crazy man attempting to remain sane.\" In the novel, Jack's final act is to enable Wendy and Danny to escape the hotel before it explodes due to a defective boiler, killing him. The film ends with the hotel still standing. More broadly, the defective boiler is a major element of the novel's plot, entirely missing from the film version.\n\nBecause of the limitations of special effects at the time, the living topiary animals of the novel were omitted and a hedge maze was added, acting as a final trap for Jack Torrance as well as a refuge for Danny.\n\nIn the film, the hotel possibly derives its malevolent energy from being built on an Indian burial ground. In the novel, the reason for the hotel's manifestation of evil is possibly explained by a theme present in King's previous novel \"Salem's Lot\" as well as Shirley Jackson's \"The Haunting of Hill House\": a physical place may absorb the evils that transpire there and manifest them as a vaguely sentient malevolence. The film's Hallorann speaks to Danny about that phenomenon occurring at the Overlook. In the novel, Jack does a great deal of investigation of the hotel's past through a scrapbook, a subplot almost omitted from the film aside from two touches: a brief appearance of the scrapbook beside the typewriter, and Jack's statement to the ghost of Grady that he knows his face from an old newspaper article describing the latter's horrific acts. Kubrick in fact shot a scene where Jack discovers the scrapbook but removed it during post-production, a decision which co-screenwriter Diane Johnson lamented.\n\nSome of the film's most famous iconic scenes, such as the ghost girls in the hallway and the torrent of blood from the elevators, are unique to the film. The most notable of these would be the typewritten pages Wendy discovers on Jack's desk. Similarly, many of the most memorable lines of dialogue (\"Words of wisdom\" and \"Here's Johnny!\") are heard exclusively in the film.\n\nAlthough Stephen King fans were critical of the novel's adaptation on the grounds that Kubrick altered and reduced the novel's themes, a defense of Kubrick's approach was made in Steve Biodrowski's review of the film. He argues that as in earlier films, Kubrick stripped out the back story of the film, reducing it down to a \"basic narrative line\", making the characters more like archetypes.\nHis review of the film is one of the few to go into detailed comparison with the novel. He writes, \"The result ...[is] a brilliant, ambitious attempt to shoot a horror film without the Gothic trappings of shadows and cobwebs so often associated with the genre.\"\n\nBoth parodies and homages to \"The Shining\" are prominent in UK and U.S. popular culture, particularly in films, TV shows, video games and music. Images and scenes frequently referenced are: the Grady girls in the hallway, the word \"Redrum\", the blood spilling out of the elevator doors and Jack sticking his head through the hole in the bathroom door, saying, \"Here's Johnny.\" The tricycle scene in which Danny sees the Grady girls and the \"here's Johnny\" scene are seen on a drive-in theatre screen in the movie \"Twister\" just before a tornado rips the screen down.\n\nDirector Tim Burton (who credits Kubrick as an influence) modeled the characters of Tweedledum and Tweedledee on the Grady girls in his version of \"Alice in Wonderland\" (like so many viewers of the film, Burton identifies the girls as twins in spite of Ullman's dialogue to the contrary).\n\n\"The Simpsons\" episode \"Treehouse of Horror V\" includes a parody titled \"The Shinning\". In addition, Sherri and Terri, the twins in Bart's 4th grade class, are visually similar to the Grady girls.\n\n\"Remington Steele\" episode \"Etched In Steele\" includes a reference to \"The Shining\" when Steele uses one of his customary cinematic references to explain the concept of writer's block to his colleague Laura Holt.\n\nFive episodes of the drama \"Gilmore Girls\" reference the film. One episode contains Lorelai's line \"Well, we like our Internet slow, okay? We can turn it on, walk around, dance, make a sandwich. With DSL, there's no dancing, no walking, and we'd starve. It'd be all work and no play. Have you not seen \"The Shining\", Mom?\"\n\nKate Bush's 1982 album \"The Dreaming\" contains the song \"Get Out of My House\", inspired primarily by the novel.\n\nSound clips of Ullman warning Jack about cabin fever with Jack's reassurances appear in Swedish goth band Katatonia's song \"Endtime\" on the album \"Brave Murder Day\".\n\nThe plot of the film is the basis for the music video for \"The Kill\" by Thirty Seconds to Mars.\n\nAmerican heavy metal band Slipknot pay homage to the film in their first music video for their song \"Spit It Out\", directed by Thomas Mignone. The video consists of conceptual imagery of the bandmembers each portraying characters enacting iconic scenes from the film, with Joey Jordison as Danny Torrance; Shawn Crahan and Chris Fehn as the Grady sisters; Corey Taylor as Jack Torrance; Mick Thomson as Lloyd the Bartender; Craig Jones as Dick Hallorann; James Root as Wendy Torrance; Paul Gray as Harry Derwent; and Sid Wilson as the corpse in the bathtub. The video was banned from MTV for overtly graphic and violent depictions, including Corey Taylor's smashing through a door with an axe and the scene wherein James Root viciously assaults Corey Taylor with a baseball bat. Mignone and the band eventually re-edited a less violent version, which was subsequently aired on MTV.\n\n\"Here's Johnny!\" was parodied by British comedian Lenny Henry in a controversial advertisement for Premier Inn.\n\nJohnny Cage parodies the \"here's Johnny\" scene as part of his fatality in \"Mortal Kombat X\" where he shoves his hands behind the opponent in which he then says the line by peeping his face through the opened torso.\n\nIn the \"Scream Queens\" episode \"Pumpkin Patch\", Chanel demands that her pumpkin patch party have an exact replica of the hedge maze which plays a central part of the episode. Also in the episode, Chanel #5 has two twin boyfriends, Rodger and Dodger.\n\nThe Little Sisters in the fallen underwater utopia Rapture, introduced in the 2007 video game \"BioShock\", were partly inspired by the Grady sisters.\n\"The Angry Birds Movie\" contains a scene with two pigs dressed as the Grady sisters.\n\nThe song \"Enjoy Your Slay\" by American metalcore band Ice Nine Kills is inspired primarily by the novel as well as the film adaption. The song also features Stanley Kubrick's grandson Sam Kubrick as guest vocalist.\n\nThe TV show \"Psych\" has an episode titled \"Heeeeere's Lassie\" in which the plot and characters are based on film.\n\nShowrunner Vince Gilligan, being a fan of Kubrick and his \"non-submersible moments\", has included references to Kubrick movies in many of his works. \"I'm happy to see that his inspiration has shown in noticeable ways in our work in \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Better Call Saul\",\" says Gilligan. \"Breaking Bad's\" episode \"Sunset\" has a cop radioing for assistance and begins, \"KDK-12\" — the radio address at the Overlook, before being axed. The axe-murdered Grady twins in \"The Shining\" are turned into the axe-murdering Salamanca twins in \"Breaking Bad\". The descent of the main character, school teacher Walt, into the dark killer has some similarities to Jack's arc. Reflections are used in both to show the characters change. \"Better Call Saul\" has a \"Here's Johnny\" scare in a flashback. Gilligan has also likened his early writing situation, getting snowed in and not writing, to feeling like Jack while going insane.\n\n\n",
                "Stephen King\n\nStephen Edwin King (born September 21, 1947) is an American author of horror, supernatural fiction, suspense, science fiction, and fantasy. His books have sold more than 350 million copies, many of which have been adapted into feature films, miniseries, television series, and comic books. King has published 54 novels, including seven under the pen name Richard Bachman, and six non-fiction books. He has written around 200 short stories, most of which have been collected in book collections. \n\nHis novella \"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\" was the basis for the film \"The Shawshank Redemption\" which is widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time and was in fact voted the greatest film of all time by \"Empire\" magazine readers in \"The 201 Greatest Movies of All Time\" poll in March, 2006.\n\nMany of his stories are set in his home state of Maine.\n\nKing was born September 21, 1947, in Portland, Maine. His father, Donald Edwin King, was a merchant seaman. Donald was born under the surname Pollock, but as an adult, used the surname King. King's mother was Nellie Ruth (née Pillsbury).\n\nWhen Stephen King was two years old, his father left the family under the pretense of \"going to buy a pack of cigarettes\", leaving his mother to raise Stephen and his older brother, David, by herself, sometimes under great financial strain. The family moved to De Pere, Wisconsin, Fort Wayne, Indiana, and Stratford, Connecticut. When King was 11, the family returned to Durham, Maine, where his mother cared for her parents until their deaths. She then became a caregiver in a local residential facility for the mentally challenged. King was raised Methodist and remains religious as an adult.\n\nAs a child, King apparently witnessed one of his friends being struck and killed by a train, though he has no memory of the event. His family told him that after leaving home to play with the boy, King returned, speechless and seemingly in shock. Only later did the family learn of the friend's death. Some commentators have suggested that this event may have psychologically inspired some of King's darker works, but King makes no mention of it in his memoir \"\" (2000).\n\nKing related in detail his primary inspiration for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction \"Danse Macabre\" (1981), in a chapter titled \"An Annoying Autobiographical Pause\". King compares his uncle's successfully dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization of what he wanted to do for a living. That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an H. P. Lovecraft collection of short stories he remembers as \"The Lurker in the Shadows\", that had belonged to his father. King told Barnes & Noble Studios during a 2009 interview, \"I knew that I'd found home when I read that book.\"\n\nKing attended Durham Elementary School and graduated from Lisbon Falls High School, in Lisbon Falls, Maine. He displayed an early interest in horror as an avid reader of EC's horror comics, including \"Tales from the Crypt\" (he later paid tribute to the comics in his screenplay for \"Creepshow\"). He began writing for fun while still in school, contributing articles to \"Dave's Rag\", the newspaper his brother published with a mimeograph machine, and later began selling to his friends stories based on movies he had seen (though when discovered by his teachers, he was forced to return the profits). The first of his stories to be independently published was \"I Was a Teenage Grave Robber\"; it was serialized over four issues (three published and one unpublished) of a fanzine, \"Comics Review\", in 1965. That story was published the following year in a revised form as \"In a Half-World of Terror\" in another fanzine, \"Stories of Suspense\", edited by Marv Wolfman. As a teen, King also won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.\n\nFrom 1966, King studied at the University of Maine, graduating in 1970 with a Bachelor of Arts in English. That year, his daughter Naomi Rachel was born. He wrote a column, \"Steve King's Garbage Truck\", for the student newspaper, \"The Maine Campus\" and participated in a writing workshop organized by Burton Hatlen. King held a variety of jobs to pay for his studies, including janitor, gas pump attendant, and worker at an industrial laundry.\n\nKing sold his first professional short story, \"The Glass Floor\", to \"Startling Mystery Stories\" in 1967. The Fogler Library at the University of Maine now holds many of King's papers.\n\nAfter leaving the university, King earned a certificate to teach high school but, unable to find a teaching post immediately, initially supplemented his laboring wage by selling short stories to men's magazines such as \"Cavalier\". Many of these early stories have been republished in the collection \"Night Shift\". The short story \"The Raft\" was published in \"Adam\", a men's magazine. After being arrested for driving over a traffic cone, he was fined $250 and had no money to pay the petty larceny fine. Luckily payment arrived for the short story \"The Raft\", then entitled \"The Float\", and \"all I did was cash the check and pay the fine.\" The In 1971, King married Tabitha Spruce, a fellow student at the University of Maine whom he had met at the University's Fogler Library after one of Professor Hatlen's workshops. That fall, King was hired as a teacher at Hampden Academy in Hampden, Maine. He continued to contribute short stories to magazines and worked on ideas for novels. During that time, King developed a drinking problem which would plague him for more than a decade.\n\nIn 1973, King's first novel \"Carrie\" was accepted by publishing house Doubleday. King had thrown an early draft of the novel into the trash after becoming discouraged with his progress writing about a teenage girl with psychic powers. His wife retrieved the manuscript and encouraged him to finish it. His advance for \"Carrie\" was $2,500; King's paperback rights later earned $400,000.\n\nKing and his family moved to southern Maine because of his mother's failing health. At this time, he began writing a book titled \"Second Coming\", later titled \"Jerusalem's Lot\", before finally changing the title to \"Salem's Lot\" (published 1975). In a 1987 issue of \"The Highway Patrolman\" magazine, he stated, \"The story seems sort of down home to me. I have a special cold spot in my heart for it!\" Soon after \"Carrie\"s release in 1974, King's mother died of uterine cancer. His Aunt Emrine had read the novel to her before she died. King has written of his severe drinking problem at this time, stating that he was drunk delivering the eulogy at his mother's funeral.\n\nAfter his mother's death, King and his family moved to Boulder, Colorado, where King wrote \"The Shining\" (published 1977). The family returned to western Maine in 1975, where King completed his fourth novel, \"The Stand\" (published 1978). In 1977, the family, with the addition of Owen Phillip (his third and last child), traveled briefly to England, returning to Maine that fall, where King began teaching creative writing at the University of Maine. He has kept his primary residence in Maine ever since.\n\nIn 1985, King wrote his first work for the comic book medium, writing a few pages of the benefit X-Men comic book \"Heroes for Hope Starring the X-Men\". The book, whose profits were donated to assist with famine relief in Africa, was written by a number of different authors in the comic book field, such as Chris Claremont, Stan Lee, and Alan Moore, as well as authors not primarily associated with that industry, such as Harlan Ellison. The following year, King wrote the introduction to \"Batman\" No. 400, an anniversary issue in which he expressed his preference for that character over Superman.\n\nIn the late 1970s, King began what became a series of interconnected stories about a lone gunslinger, Roland, who pursues the \"Man in Black\" in an alternate-reality universe that is a cross between J. R. R. Tolkien's Middle-earth and the American Wild West as depicted by Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone in their spaghetti Westerns. The first of these stories, \"\", was initially published in five installments by \"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\" under the editorship of Edward L. Ferman, from 1977 to 1981. \"The Gunslinger\" was continued as an eight-book epic series called \"The Dark Tower\", whose books King wrote and published infrequently over four decades.\n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s, King published a handful of short novels—\"Rage\" (1977), \"The Long Walk\" (1979), \"Roadwork\" (1981), \"The Running Man\" (1982) and \"Thinner\" (1984)—under the pseudonym Richard Bachman. The idea behind this was to test whether he could replicate his success again and to allay his fears that his popularity was an accident. An alternate explanation was that publishing standards at the time allowed only a single book a year. He picked up the name from the hard rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive, of which he is a fan.\n\nRichard Bachman was exposed as King's pseudonym by a persistent Washington, D.C. bookstore clerk, Steve Brown, who noticed similarities between the works and later located publisher's records at the Library of Congress that named King as the author of one of Bachman's novels. This led to a press release heralding Bachman's \"death\"—supposedly from \"cancer of the pseudonym\". King dedicated his 1989 book \"The Dark Half\", about a pseudonym turning on a writer, to \"the deceased Richard Bachman\", and in 1996, when the Stephen King novel \"Desperation\" was released, the companion novel \"The Regulators\" carried the \"Bachman\" byline.\n\nIn 2006, during a press conference in London, King declared that he had discovered another Bachman novel, titled \"Blaze\". It was published on June 12, 2007. In fact, the original manuscript had been held at King's alma mater, the University of Maine in Orono, for many years and had been covered by numerous King experts. King rewrote the original 1973 manuscript for its publication.\n\nKing has used other pseudonyms. The short story \"The Fifth Quarter\" was published under the pseudonym John Swithen (the name of a character in the novel \"Carrie\"), that was published in \"Cavalier\" in April 1972. The story was later reprinted in King's collection \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes\" in 1993 under his own name. In the introduction to the Bachman novel \"Blaze\", King claims, with tongue-in-cheek, that \"Bachman\" was the person using the Swithen pseudonym.\n\nThe \"children's book\" \"Charlie the Choo-Choo: From the World of The Dark Tower\" was published under the pseudonym Beryl Evans, who was portrayed by actress Allison Davies during a book signing at San Diego Comic-Con, and illustrated by Ned Dameron. It is adapted from a fictional book central to the plot of King's previous novel \"\" and published in 2016.\n\nIn 2000, King published online a serialized horror novel, \"The Plant\". At first the public presumed that King had abandoned the project because sales were unsuccessful, but King later stated that he had simply run out of stories. The unfinished epistolary novel is still available from King's official site, now free. Also in 2000, he wrote a digital novella, \"Riding the Bullet\", and has said he sees e-books becoming 50% of the market \"probably by 2013 and maybe by 2012\". But he also warns: \"Here's the thing—people tire of the new toys quickly.\"\n\nIn August 2003, King began writing a column on pop culture appearing in \"Entertainment Weekly\", usually every third week. The column, called \"The Pop of King\" (a play on the nickname \"The King of Pop\" commonly attributed to Michael Jackson).\n\nIn 2006, King published an apocalyptic novel, \"Cell\". The book features a sudden force in which every cell phone user turns into a mindless killer. King noted in the book's introduction that he does not use cell phones.\n\nIn 2008, King published both a novel, \"Duma Key\", and a collection, \"Just After Sunset\". The latter featured 13 short stories, including a novella, \"N.\", which was later released as a serialized animated series that could be seen for free, or, for a small fee, could be downloaded in a higher quality; it then was adopted into a limited comic book series.\n\nIn 2009, King published \"Ur\", a novella written exclusively for the launch of the second-generation Amazon Kindle and available only on Amazon.com, and \"Throttle\", a novella co-written with his son Joe Hill and released later as an audiobook titled \"Road Rage\", which included Richard Matheson's short story \"Duel\". King's novel \"Under the Dome\" was published on November 10 of that year; it is a reworking of an unfinished novel he tried writing twice in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and at 1,074 pages, it is the largest novel he has written since \"It\" (1986). \"Under the Dome\" debuted at No. 1 in \"The New York Times\" Bestseller List.\n\nOn February 16, 2010, King announced on his website that his next book would be a collection of four previously unpublished novellas called \"Full Dark, No Stars\". In April of that year, King published \"Blockade Billy\", an original novella issued first by independent small press Cemetery Dance Publications and later released in mass-market paperback by Simon & Schuster. The following month, DC Comics premiered \"American Vampire\", a monthly comic book series written by King with short-story writer Scott Snyder, and illustrated by Rafael Albuquerque, which represents King's first original comics work. King wrote the background history of the very first American vampire, Skinner Sweet, in the first five-issues story arc. Scott Snyder wrote the story of Pearl.\n\nKing's next novel, \"11/22/63\", was published November 8, 2011, and was nominated for the 2012 World Fantasy Award Best Novel. The eighth \"Dark Tower\" volume, \"\", was published in 2012. King's next book was \"Joyland\", a novel about \"an amusement-park serial killer\", according to an article in \"The Sunday Times\", published on April 8, 2012. It was followed by the sequel to \"The Shining\" (1977), titled \"Doctor Sleep\", published in September 2013.\n\nDuring his Chancellor's Speaker Series talk at University of Massachusetts Lowell on December 7, 2012, King indicated that he was writing a crime novel about a retired policeman being taunted by a murderer. With a working title \"Mr. Mercedes\" and inspired by a true event about a woman driving her car into a McDonald's restaurant, it was originally meant to be a short story just a few pages long. In an interview with \"Parade\", published May 26, 2013, King confirmed that the novel was \"more or less\" completed he published it in June 2013. Later, on June 20, 2013, while doing a video chat with fans as part of promoting the upcoming \"Under the Dome\" TV series, King mentioned he was halfway through writing his next novel, \"Revival\", which was released November 11, 2014.\n\nKing announced in June 2014 that \"Mr. Mercedes\" is part of a trilogy; the second book, \"Finders Keepers\", was released on June 2, 2015. On April 22, 2015, it was revealed that King is currently working on the third book of the trilogy which name was later revealed to be \"End of Watch\". The book was released on June 7, 2016, and hit the top of the \"New York Times\" bestseller list.\n\nOn November 3, 2015, King released his tenth collection of short stories, \"The Bazaar of Bad Dreams\". The book was released to critical acclaim and commercial success.\n\nDuring a tour to promote \"End of Watch\", King revealed that he had collaborated on a novel, set in a women's prison in West Virginia, with his son, Owen King to be titled \"Sleeping Beauties\". When the novel was released in October 2017, it reached the top of the \"New York Times\" Best Seller List.\n\nKing has written two novels with horror novelist Peter Straub: \"The Talisman\" (1984) and a sequel, \"Black House\" (2001). King has indicated that he and Straub will likely write the third and concluding book in this series, the tale of Jack Sawyer, but has set no time for its completion.\n\nKing produced an artist's book with designer Barbara Kruger, \"My Pretty Pony\" (1989), published in a limited edition of 250 by the Library Fellows of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Alfred A. Knopf released it in a general trade edition and the short story was later included in King's collection \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes\" published in 1993.\n\n\"\" (2001) was a paperback tie-in for the King-penned miniseries \"Rose Red\" (2002). Published under anonymous authorship, the book was written by Ridley Pearson. The novel is written in the form of a diary by Ellen Rimbauer, and annotated by the fictional professor of paranormal activity, Joyce Reardon. The novel also presents a fictional afterword by Ellen Rimbauer's grandson, Steven. Intended to be a promotional item rather than a stand-alone work, its popularity spawned a 2003 prequel television miniseries to \"Rose Red\", titled \"The Diary of Ellen Rimbauer\". This spin-off is a rare occasion of another author's being granted permission to write commercial work using characters and story elements invented by King. The novel tie-in idea was repeated on Stephen King's next project, the miniseries \"Kingdom Hospital\". Richard Dooling, King's collaborator on \"Kingdom Hospital\" and writer of several episodes in the miniseries, published a fictional diary, \"The Journals of Eleanor Druse\", in 2004. Eleanor Druse is a key character in \"Kingdom Hospital\", much as Dr. Joyce Readon and Ellen Rimbauer are key characters in \"Rose Red.\"\n\nKing also wrote the nonfiction book, \"Faithful\" (2004), with novelist and fellow Red Sox fanatic Stewart O'Nan.\n\n\"Throttle\" (2009), a novella written in collaboration with his son Joe Hill, appears in the anthology \"He Is Legend: Celebrating Richard Matheson\". Their second novella collaboration, \"In the Tall Grass\" (2012), was published in two parts in \"Esquire\". It was later released in e-book and audiobook formats, the latter read by Stephen Lang.\n\nStephen King and Richard Chizmar co-wrote \"Gwendy's Button Box\" which was released in May 2017 from Cemetery Dance Publications (in trade hardcover format) and in audiobook from Simon & Schuster Audio (the audiobook has a bonus short story \"The Music Room\" which was originally published in \"Playboy\").\n\nKing and his son Owen King co-wrote the novel \"Sleeping Beauties\", released in 2017, that is set in a women's prison.\n\nKing is a fan of the Ramones, to the extent that he wrote the liner notes for the 2003 Ramones tribute album \"\". He states that he agreed to write them because he \"loved The Ramones from the first time (he) heard them\". Furthermore, King has referred to the band several times in his writing, both in his fiction and non-fiction. Non-fiction references include a mention in King's book \"Danse Macabre\" where he calls the Ramones \"an amusing punk-rock band that surfaced some four years ago\". He also wrote about them in \"On Writing\", making reference to \"dancing to the Ramones—gabba gabba hey\" as one of the reasons he has maintained a good marriage. King included further Ramones references in his fictional work. He quotes the lyrics to the Ramones' debut single \"Blitzkrieg Bop\" in his novel \"Pet Sematary\" on numerous occasions, as in the sentence \"What is it the Ramones say? Hey-ho, let's go\"! In \"The Dark Tower\" novel \"\" the Ramones get a further mention by the character Eddie Dean who states that \"Roland stage-dives like Joey Ramone\". Critics have also noted the Ramones references. \"Entertainment Weekly\", for example, in their review of \"Black House\" by King and Peter Straub, note that King's \"trademark references\" are in evidence, quoting Dee Dee Ramone. In turn, the Ramones have referenced King on their song \"It's Not My Place (In the 9 to 5 World)\", from their \"Pleasant Dreams\" album of 1981 in the line: \"Ramones are hangin' out in Kokomo / Roger Corman's on a talk show / With Allan Arkush and Stephen King\". Further, Dee Dee Ramone wrote the song \"Pet Sematary\" in King's basement after King handed him a copy of the novel. The song was eventually featured as the title song for the \"Pet Sematary\" (1989) film and also appeared on the Ramones album \"Brain Drain\" (1989).\n\nKing is also a fan of hard rock such as AC/DC; he arranged for their album \"Who Made Who\" to feature as the score for the film he directed in 1986, \"Maximum Overdrive\". King has also stated that he likes heavy metal and has named bands like Anthrax, Judas Priest and Metallica as amongst his favourites to write to. In 1988, the band Blue Öyster Cult recorded an updated version of its 1974 song \"Astronomy\". The single released for radio play featured a narrative intro spoken by King. The Blue Öyster Cult song \"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\" was also used in the King TV series \"The Stand\".\n\nKing collaborated with Michael Jackson to create \"Ghosts\" (1996), a 40-minute musical video. King states he was motivated to collaborate as he is \"always interested in trying something new, and for (him), writing a minimusical would be new\". In 2012 King collaborated with musician Shooter Jennings and his band Hierophant, providing the narration for their album, \"Black Ribbons\". King played guitar for the rock band Rock Bottom Remainders, several of whose members are authors. Other members include Dave Barry, Ridley Pearson, Scott Turow, Amy Tan, James McBride, Mitch Albom, Roy Blount, Jr., Matt Groening, Kathi Kamen Goldmark, Sam Barry, and Greg Iles. King and the other band members collaborated to release an e-book called \"Hard Listening: The Greatest Rock Band Ever (of Authors) Tells All\" (June 2013). King wrote a musical play \"Ghost Brothers of Darkland County\" (2012) with musician John Mellencamp.\n\nKing's formula for learning to write well is: \"Read and write four to six hours a day. If you cannot find the time for that, you can't expect to become a good writer.\" He sets out each day with a quota of 2000 words and will not stop writing until it is met. He also has a simple definition for talent in writing: \"If you wrote something for which someone sent you a check, if you cashed the check and it didn't bounce, and if you then paid the light bill with the money, I consider you talented.\"\n\nShortly after his accident, King wrote the first draft of the book \"Dreamcatcher\" with a notebook and a Waterman fountain pen, which he called \"the world's finest word processor\".\n\nWhen asked why he writes, King responds: \"The answer to that is fairly simple—there was nothing else I was made to do. I was made to write stories and I love to write stories. That's why I do it. I really can't imagine doing anything else and I can't imagine not doing what I do.\" He is also often asked why he writes such terrifying stories and he answers with another question: \"Why do you assume I have a choice?\" King usually begins the story creation process by imagining a \"what if\" scenario, such as what would happen if a writer is kidnapped by a sadistic nurse in Colorado.\n\nKing often uses authors as characters, or includes mention of fictional books in his stories, novellas and novels, such as Paul Sheldon who is the main character in \"Misery\", adult Bill Denbrough in \"It\", Ben Mears in \"Salem's Lot\", and Jack Torrance in \"The Shining\". He has extended this to breaking the fourth wall by including \"himself\" as a character in the \"Dark Tower\" series from \"Wolves of the Calla\" onwards. See also List of fictional books in the works of Stephen King for a complete list. In September 2009 it was announced he would serve as a writer for \"Fangoria\".\n\nKing has called Richard Matheson \"the author who influenced me most as a writer\". In a current edition of Matheson's \"The Shrinking Man\", King is quoted: \"A horror story if there ever was one...a great adventure story—it is certainly one of that select handful that I have given to people, envying them the experience of the first reading.\" Ray Bradbury is another influence, with King himself stating \"without Ray Bradbury, there is no Stephen King\".\n\nKing refers to H. P. Lovecraft several times in \"Danse Macabre\". \"Gramma\", a short story made into a film in the 1980s anthology horror show \"The New Twilight Zone\", mentions Lovecraft's notorious fictional creation \"Necronomicon\", also borrowing the names of a number of the fictional monsters mentioned therein. \"I Know What You Need\" from the 1976 collection \"Night Shift\", and \"'Salem's Lot\" also mention the tome. Despite this, in \"On Writing\", King is critical of Lovecraft's dialogue-writing skills, using passages from \"The Colour Out of Space\" as particularly poor examples. There are also several examples of King's referring to Lovecraftian characters and settings in his work, such as Nyarlathotep and Yog-Sothoth.\n\nKing acknowledges the influence of Bram Stoker, particularly on his novel \"Salem's Lot\", which he envisioned as a retelling of \"Dracula\". Its related short story \"Jerusalem's Lot\" is reminiscent of Stoker's \"The Lair of the White Worm\". He also gives Joseph Payne Brennan credit for being one of his inspirations; \"Joseph Payne Brennan is one of the most effective writers in the horror genre, and he is certainly one of the writers I have patterned my own career upon; one of the writers whom I studied and with whom I kept school.\"\n\nKing's \"The Shining\" is immersed in gothic influences, including \"The Masque of the Red Death\" by Edgar Allan Poe (which was directly influenced by the first gothic novel, Horace Walpole's \"The Castle of Otranto\"). The Overlook Hotel acts as a replacement for the traditional gothic castle, and Jack Torrance is a tragic villain seeking redemption.\n\nKing has also referred to author Shirley Jackson. \"Salem's Lot\" opens with a quotation from Jackson's \"The Haunting of Hill House\", and a character in \"\" references the Jackson book \"We Have Always Lived in the Castle\". King's book \"11/22/63\" mentions the Jackson story \"The Summer People\". King is a fan of John D. MacDonald, and dedicated the novella \"Sun Dog\" to MacDonald, saying \"I miss you, old friend.\" For his part, MacDonald wrote an admiring preface to \"Night Shift\", and even had his famous character, Travis McGee, reading \"Cujo\" in one of the last McGee novels and \"Pet Sematary\" in the last McGee novel, \"The Lonely Silver Rain.\"\n\nIn 1987, King's Philtrum Press published Don Robertson's novel \"The Ideal, Genuine Man\". In his forenote to the novel, King wrote, \"Don Robertson was and is one of the three writers who influenced me as a young man who was trying to 'become' a novelist (the other two being Richard Matheson and John D. MacDonald).\" Robert A. Heinlein's book \"The Door into Summer\" is repeatedly mentioned in King's \"Wolves of the Calla\" (2003), as are several other works. \"Wolves of the Calla\" is the King work in which \"The Dark Tower\" begins to follow a meta-fictional path.\n\nIn an interview with King, published in the \"USA Weekend\" in March 2009, the author stated, \"People look on writers that they like as an irreplaceable resource. I do. Elmore Leonard, every day I wake up and—not to be morbid or anything, although morbid is my life to a degree—don't see his obituary in the paper, I think to myself, \"Great! He's probably working somewhere. He's gonna produce another book, and I'll have another book to read. Because when he's gone, there's nobody else.\"\n\nKing partly dedicated his book \"Cell\" to film director George Romero, and wrote an essay for the Elite DVD version of \"Night of the Living Dead\".\nHis favorite books are (in order): \"The Golden Argosy\"; \"Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\"; \"The Satanic Verses\"; \"McTeague\"; \"Lord of the Flies\"; \"Bleak House\"; \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\"; \"The Raj Quartet\"; \"Light in August\"; and \"Blood Meridian\".\n\nAlthough critical reaction to King's work has been mostly positive, he has occasionally come under fire from academic writers.\n\nScience fiction editors John Clute and Peter Nichols offer a largely favorable appraisal of King, noting his \"pungent prose, sharp ear for dialogue, disarmingly laid-back, frank style, along with his passionately fierce denunciation of human stupidity and cruelty (especially to children) [all of which rank] him among the more distinguished 'popular' writers.\"\n\nIn his book \"The Philosophy of Horror\" (1990), Noël Carroll discusses King's work as an exemplar of modern horror fiction. Analyzing both the narrative structure of King's fiction and King's non-fiction ruminations on the art and craft of writing, Carroll writes that for King, \"the horror story is always a contest between the normal and the abnormal such that the normal is reinstated and, therefore, affirmed.\"\n\nIn his analysis of post–World War II horror fiction, \"The Modern Weird Tale\" (2001), critic S. T. Joshi devotes a chapter to King's work. Joshi argues that King's best-known works (his supernatural novels), are his worst, describing them as mostly bloated, illogical, maudlin and prone to \"deus ex machina\" endings. Despite these criticisms, Joshi argues that since \"Gerald's Game\" (1993), King has been tempering the worst of his writing faults, producing books that are leaner, more believable and generally better written. Joshi suggests that King's strengths as a writer include the accessible \"everyman\" quality of his prose, and his unfailingly insightful observations about the pains and joys of adolescence. Joshi cites two early non-supernatural novels—\"Rage\" (1977) and \"The Running Man\" (1982)—as King's best, suggesting both are riveting and well-constructed suspense thrillers, with believable characters.\n\nIn 1996, King won an O. Henry Award for his short story \"The Man in the Black Suit\".\n\nIn his short story collection \"A Century of Great Suspense Stories\", editor Jeffery Deaver noted that King \"singlehandedly made popular fiction grow up. While there were many good best-selling writers before him, King, more than anybody since John D. MacDonald, brought reality to genre novels. He has often remarked that \"'Salem's Lot\" was \"\"Peyton Place\" meets \"Dracula\". And so it was. The rich characterization, the careful and caring social eye, the interplay of story line and character development announced that writers could take worn themes such as vampirism and make them fresh again. Before King, many popular writers found their efforts to make their books serious blue-penciled by their editors. ‘Stuff like that gets in the way of the story,' they were told. Well, it's stuff like that that has made King so popular, and helped free the popular name from the shackles of simple genre writing. He is a master of masters.\"\n\nIn 2003, King was honored by the National Book Awards with a lifetime achievement award, the Medal of Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. Some in the literary community expressed disapproval of the award: Richard E. Snyder, the former CEO of Simon & Schuster, described King's work as \"non-literature\", and critic Harold Bloom denounced the choice:\n\nThe decision to give the National Book Foundation's annual award for \"distinguished contribution\" to Stephen King is extraordinary, another low in the shocking process of dumbing down our cultural life. I've described King in the past as a writer of penny dreadfuls, but perhaps even that is too kind. He shares nothing with Edgar Allan Poe. What he is is an immensely inadequate writer on a sentence-by-sentence, paragraph-by-paragraph, book-by-book basis.\n\nHowever, others came to King's defense, such as writer Orson Scott Card, who responded:\n\nLet me assure you that King's work most definitely is literature, because it was written to be published and is read with admiration. What Snyder really means is that it is not the literature preferred by the academic-literary elite.\n\nKing himself later stated:\n\n[Harold] Bloom never pissed me off because there are critics out there, and he's one of them, who take their ignorance about popular culture as a badge of intellectual prowess. He might be able to say that Mark Twain is a great writer, but it's impossible for him to say that there's a direct line of descent from, say, Nathaniel Hawthorne to Jim Thompson because he doesn't read guys like Thompson. He just thinks, \"I never read him, but I know he's terrible.\"\n\nIn Roger Ebert's review of the 2004 movie \"Secret Window\", he stated, \"A lot of people were outraged that [King] was honored at the National Book Awards, as if a popular writer could not be taken seriously. But after finding that his book \"On Writing\" had more useful and observant things to say about the craft than any book since Strunk and White's \"The Elements of Style\", I have gotten over my own snobbery.\"\n\nIn 2008, King's book \"On Writing\" was ranked 21st on \"Entertainment Weekly\" list of \"The New Classics: The 100 Best Reads from 1983 to 2008\".\n\nKing and his wife Tabitha own Zone Radio Corp, a radio station group consisting of WZON/620 AM, WKIT-FM/100.3 & WZLO/103.1.\n\nKing has stated that his favorite book-to-film adaptations are \"Stand by Me\", \"The Shawshank Redemption\", and \"The Mist\".\n\nKing's first film appearance was in George Romero's \"Knightriders\" as a buffoonish audience member. His first featured role was in \"Creepshow\", in particular the segment \"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill\" (King also having written the original story), where he plays the titular character. He has since made cameos in several adaptations of his works. He appeared in \"Pet Sematary\" as a minister at a funeral, in \"Thinner\" as a pharmacist, in \"Rose Red\" as a pizza deliveryman, as a news reporter in \"The Storm of the Century\", in \"The Stand\" as \"Teddy Wieszack,\" in the \"Shining\" miniseries as a band member, in \"The Langoliers\" as Tom Holby; in \"Sleepwalkers\" as the cemetery caretaker and \"Golden Years\" as a bus driver. He has also appeared in \"Chappelle's Show\" and, along with fellow author Amy Tan, on \"The Simpsons\" as himself. In addition to acting, King tried his hand at directing with \"Maximum Overdrive\", in which he also made a cameo appearance as a man using a malfunctioning ATM. King had also been approached to appear in the 1985 Romero film \"Day of the Dead\" as a zombie. Although King declined due to scheduling conflicts, a copy of one of his works makes an appearance being held by the foremost zombie \"Bub\". King would once again work with Romero in 1993 when his work \"The Dark Half\" was filmed and directed by George Romero.\n\nKing produced and acted in a television series, \"Kingdom Hospital\", which is based on the Danish miniseries \"Riget\" by Lars von Trier. He also co-wrote \"The X-Files\" season-5 episode \"Chinga\" with the creator of the series Chris Carter.\n\nKing made an appearance as a contestant on \"Celebrity Jeopardy!\" in 1995, playing to benefit the Bangor Public Library.\n\nKing provided the voice of Abraham Lincoln in the audiobook version of \"Assassination Vacation\".\n\nIn 2010, King appeared in a cameo role as a cleaner named Bachman (a reference to his pen name \"Richard Bachman\") on the FX series \"Sons of Anarchy\".\n\nThe Syfy TV series \"Haven\" is based on King's novella, \"The Colorado Kid\".\n\nOn June 19, 1999, at about 4:30 p.m., King was walking on the shoulder of Maine State Route 5, in Lovell, Maine. Driver Bryan Edwin Smith, distracted by an unrestrained dog moving in the back of his minivan, struck King, who landed in a depression in the ground about 14 feet (4 meters) from the pavement of Route 5. According to Oxford County Sheriff deputy Matt Baker, King was hit from behind and some witnesses said the driver was not speeding, reckless, or drinking. In his book \"On Writing\" King states he was heading north, walking against the traffic. Shortly before the accident took place, a woman in a car also heading north passed first King and then the light blue Dodge van. The van was looping from one side of the road to the other and the woman told her passenger she hoped \"that guy in the van doesn't hit him\".\n\nKing was conscious enough to give the deputy phone numbers to contact his family, but was in considerable pain. The author was first transported to Northern Cumberland Hospital in Bridgton and then flown by helicopter to Central Maine Medical Center (CMMC) in Lewiston. His injuries—a collapsed right lung, multiple fractures of his right leg, scalp laceration and a broken hip—kept him at CMMC until July 9. His leg bones were so shattered that doctors initially considered amputating his leg, but stabilized the bones in the leg with an external fixator. After five operations in ten days and physical therapy, King resumed work on \"On Writing\" in July, though his hip was still shattered and he could sit for only about forty minutes before the pain became unbearable.\n\nKing's lawyer and two others purchased Smith's van for $1,500, reportedly to prevent it from appearing on eBay. The van was later crushed at a junkyard, much to King's disappointment, as he fantasized about smashing it up. King later mentioned during an interview with \"Fresh Air's\" Terry Gross that he wanted the vehicle destroyed at a charity event in which individuals would donate money for an opportunity to smash it with a sledgehammer.\n\nDuring this time, Tabitha King was inspired to redesign his studio. King visited the space while his books and belongings were packed away. What he saw was an image of what his studio would look like if he died, providing a seed for his novel \"Lisey's Story\" (2006).\n\nIn 2002, King announced he would stop writing, apparently motivated in part by frustration with his injuries, which had made sitting uncomfortable and reduced his stamina. He has since resumed writing, but states on his website:\n\nIn April 2008, King spoke out against HB 1423, a bill pending in the Massachusetts state legislature that would restrict or ban the sale of violent video games to anyone under the age of 18. Although King stated that he had no personal interest in video games as a hobby, he criticized the proposed law, which he sees as an attempt by politicians to scapegoat pop culture, and to act as surrogate parents to other peoples' children, which he asserted is usually \"disastrous\" and \"undemocratic.\" He also saw the law as inconsistent, as it would forbid a 17-year-old, legally able to see \"\", from buying or renting \"\", which is violent but less graphic. While conceding that he saw no artistic merit in some violent video games, King also opined that such games reflect the violence that already exists in society, which would not be lessened by such a law, and would be redundant in light of the ratings system that already exists for video games. King argued that such laws allow legislators to ignore the economic divide between the rich and poor, and the easy availability of guns, which he felt were the more legitimate causes of violence. Regarding video games, he later stated that he enjoys playing light gun shooter arcade games such as \"Time Crisis\".\n\nA controversy emerged on May 5, 2008, when Noel Sheppard posted a clip of King at a Library of Congress reading event on the website NewsBusters. King, talking to high-school students, had said: \"If you can read, you can walk into a job later on. If you don't, then you've got the Army, Iraq, I don't know, something like that.\" The comment was described by the blog as \"another in a long line of liberal media members bashing the military,\" and likened to John Kerry's similar remark from 2006. King responded later that day, saying, \"That a right-wing-blog would impugn my patriotism because I said children should learn to read, and could get better jobs by doing so, is beneath contempt...I live in a national guard town, and I support our troops, but I don't support either the war or educational policies that limit the options of young men and women to any one career—military or otherwise.\" King again defended his comment in an interview with the \"Bangor Daily News\" on May 8, saying, \"I'm not going to apologize for promoting that kids get better education in high school, so they have more options. Those that don't agree with what I'm saying, I'm not going to change their minds.\" King later expressed regret for the remark, saying that he misspoke. He characterized the comment as originating from a \"brain cramp\", and the reality of no longer living in the world he grew up in, saying that during the Vietnam War, serving in the military was a great career for some, and for others, a sacrifice of two years of one's life. King added that he does believe that each person should be obligated to some type of government service or altruism.\n\nKing's website states that he is a supporter of the Democratic Party. During the 2008 presidential election, King voiced his support for Democratic candidate Barack Obama. King was quoted as calling conservative commentator Glenn Beck \"Satan's mentally challenged younger brother.\"\n\nOn March 8, 2011, King spoke at a political rally in Sarasota aimed against Governor Rick Scott (R-FL), voicing his opposition to the Tea Party movement.\n\nOn April 30, 2012, King published an article in \"The Daily Beast\" calling for rich Americans, including himself, to pay more taxes, citing it as \"a practical necessity and moral imperative that those who have received much should be obligated to pay ... in the same proportion\".\n\nOn January 25, 2013, King published an essay titled \"Guns\" via Amazon.com's Kindle single feature, which discusses the gun debate in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. King called for gun owners to support a ban on automatic and semi-automatic weapons, writing, \"Autos and semi-autos are weapons of mass destruction...When lunatics want to make war on the unarmed and unprepared, these are the weapons they use.\" The essay became the fifth-bestselling non-fiction title for the Kindle.\n\nKing has publicly criticized Donald Trump and his 2016 presidential campaign for his controversial remarks critical of Mexican immigrants to the United States. On August 6, 2015, King posted on Twitter: \"How's this for a Trump campaign slogan: IF YOU'RE WHITE, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT! ANY OTHER HUE, I DON'T TRUST YOU.\" On June 5, 2016, King referred to Trump on Twitter as \"a thin-skinned racist with the temperament of a 3-year-old.\" Trump later blocked him on Twitter, with King responding: “I am hereby blocking him from seeing IT or Mr Mercedes. No clowns for you, Donald. Go float yourself.”\n\nKing had endorsed Shenna Bellows in the 2014 U.S. Senate election for the seat held by Republican Susan Collins.\n\nKing is a public critic of Paul LePage, the Republican Governor of Maine, and has referred to LePage as one of the Three Stooges, along with Florida Governor Rick Scott and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker. He was critical of LePage for incorrectly suggesting in a weekly radio address on March 18, 2015, that King avoided paying Maine income taxes by living out of state for part of the year. The statement was later corrected by the Governor's office but no apology was issued. King said LePage was \"full of the stuff that makes the grass grow green\" and demanded that LePage \"man up and apologize\". LePage declined to apologize to King, stating \"I never said Stephen King did not pay income taxes. What I said was, Stephen King's not in Maine right now. That's what I said.\" LePage further told King that he should \"make me the villain of your next book and I won’t charge you royalties\".\n\nThe attention garnered by the LePage criticism has led to efforts to encourage King to run for Governor of Maine in 2018. Bangor city councilor Joe Baldacci posted on his Facebook page that he was starting a Draft Stephen King effort, and Democratic State Rep. Diane Russell launched a petition drive to encourage King to run. His spokeswoman posted to Baldacci's Facebook comment that he would likely decline to run, and King himself stated he would not run or serve on March 23 while still criticizing what he said was the \"laziness that made him mad\" about not checking his tax payments and that LePage had \"a problem finding a comfortable pair of big-boy pants\".\n\nKing sent a tweet on June 30, 2015, stating that LePage is \"a terrible embarrassment to the state I live in and love. If he won't govern, he should resign.\" He later clarified that he was not calling on LePage to resign, but to \"go to work or go back home\". On August 27, 2016, King sent another tweet about LePage, calling him \"a bigot, a homophobe, and a racist\".\n\nKing has stated that he donates approximately $4 million per year \"to libraries, local fire departments that need updated lifesaving equipment (Jaws of Life tools are always a popular request), schools, and a scattering of organisations that underwrite the arts.\"\n\nThe Stephen and Tabitha King Foundation, chaired by the author and his wife, ranks 6th among Maine charities in terms of average annual giving with over $2.8 million in grants per year, according to The Grantsmanship Center.\n\nIn November 2011, the STK Foundation donated $70,000 in matched funding via his radio station to help pay the heating bills for families in need in his home town of Bangor, Maine, during the winter.\n\nKing married Tabitha Spruce in 1971. She too is a novelist and philanthropic activist. The couple own and occupy three different houses: one in Bangor, Maine, one in Lovell, Maine, and for the winter a waterfront mansion located off the Gulf of Mexico in Sarasota, Florida. The Kings have three children, a girl and two boys, and four grandchildren. Their daughter Naomi is a Unitarian Universalist Church minister in Plantation, Florida, with her same-sex partner, Rev. Dr. Thandeka. Both of the Kings' sons are authors: Owen King published his first collection of stories, \"We're All in This Together: A Novella and Stories\", in 2005. Joseph Hillstrom King, who writes as Joe Hill, published a collection of short stories, \"20th Century Ghosts\", in 2005. His debut novel, \"Heart-Shaped Box\" (2007), was optioned by Warners Bros. \n\nKing's addictions to alcohol and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he acknowledged in \"On Writing\" in 2000, he can barely remember writing \"Cujo\". Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the rug in front of him evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since. The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was \"Needful Things\".\n\nKing is a fan of baseball, and of the Boston Red Sox in particular; he frequently attends the team's home and away games, and occasionally mentions the team in his novels and stories. He helped coach his son Owen's Bangor West team to the Maine Little League Championship in 1989. He recounts this experience in the \"New Yorker\" essay \"Head Down\", which appears also in the collection \"Nightmares & Dreamscapes\". In 1999, King wrote \"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,\" featuring former Red Sox pitcher Tom Gordon as the protagonist's imaginary companion. In 2004, King co-wrote a book titled \"Faithful: Two Diehard Boston Red Sox Fans Chronicle the Historic 2004 Season\" with Stewart O'Nan, recounting the authors' roller-coaster reaction to the Red Sox's 2004 season, a season culminating in the Sox winning the 2004 American League Championship Series and World Series. In the 2005 film \"Fever Pitch,\" about an obsessive Boston Red Sox fan, King tosses out the first pitch of the Sox's opening-day game.\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Danny Torrance\n\nDaniel Anthony \"Danny\" Torrance is a fictional character that first appears in the 1977 novel \"The Shining\" by Stephen King as a child with \"the shining\", meaning psychic powers. His parents are father Jack Torrance and mother Wendy Torrance. The character also appears in the 1980 film adaptation \"The Shining\" and was played by Danny Lloyd. The character also appears in the 1997 TV miniseries \"The Shining\" and was played by Courtland Mead. In 2013, Stephen King released the novel \"Doctor Sleep\", a sequel to the 1977 novel that features an adult Danny Torrance as the protagonist.\n\nDanny Torrance in \"The Shining\" is one of several child characters in Stephen King's early fiction who deal with parental abandonment or the fear of it; other characters include Carrie White in \"Carrie\" and Charlene \"Charlie\" McGee in \"Firestarter\". Heidi Strengell, in \"Dissecting Stephen King\", says, \"In King's view children, like Danny Torrance, are able to deal with fantasy and terror on their own terms better than adults because of the size of their imaginative capacity and their unique position in life.\" The reference guide \"Characters in 20th-Century Literature\" wrote, \"Some critics complain that Danny displays an improbable maturity for a child his age.\" Author Dale Bailey, writing about haunted houses, said King's writing of Danny, a psychic in a haunted setting, borrowed the link made by Shirley Jackson and Richard Matheson in their works. Bailey perceives Danny as having ambivalence toward his father, being devoted but also learning psychically how emotionally disturbed his father is. The author said there was evidence of parallels between Danny and his father, \"Danny, like Jack himself, may someday fall into behavioral patterns of the father \"he\" both loves and fears.\"\n\nIn the novel \"The Shining\", Danny shares his power of \"the shining\" with several strangers, where in the film adaptation, he is secretive about it, even when sharing with Dick Halloran. In the novel, Danny has an extraordinary intelligence, a large vocabulary, is attached to his father and is able to foresee all of Hotel Overlook's horrors. In contrast, in the film, he is portrayed as an ordinary boy with only the extraordinary power and has visions that change with events that happen at the hotel. Academic Greg Jenkins says the primary reason for Danny being less talkative was the difficulty for a child actor to memorize lines, but he said the minimal dialogue also created more suspense.\n\nIn the various appearances, Danny has an imaginary friend Tony, who is portrayed in different ways. \"The Dissolve\" said King portrayed Tony as \"a part of Danny, a piece of future adult potential made manifest\". In Kubrick's film, Tony is only imaginary, and the TV miniseries portrays Tony as an invisible presence to warn Danny of danger. Bailey said of the incarnation of Tony in the original novel was \"a projection of Danny's mind, giving voice to anxieties which otherwise transcend his understanding\", citing as evidence the interlinking of the male Torrances' names: grandfather Mark \"Anthony\" Torrance, John \"Daniel\" \"Jack\" Torrance, and Daniel \"Anthony\" Torrance.\n\nStephen King said he had been asked what happened to Danny Torrance after the events of \"The Shining\", and he decided to write its sequel \"Doctor Sleep\". In the novel, Danny is depicted as an alcoholic drifter who is haunted by the memory of his father. \"The Guardian\" said of the portrayal of Danny, \"It... captures the reality of a recovering alcoholic, a state with which King is intimately familiar.\" King said he wanted to depict Danny as avoiding being like his parents and trying to escape his roots.\n"

                "PlayStation (console)\n\nThe PlayStation (officially abbreviated to PS, and commonly known as the PS1 or PSX) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. The console was released on 3 December in Japan, 9 September 1995 in North America, 29 September 1995 in Europe, and for 15 November 1995 in Australia. The console was the first of the PlayStation lineup of home video game consoles. It primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn as part of the fifth generation of video game consoles.\n\nThe PlayStation is the first \"computer entertainment platform\" to ship 100 million units, which it had reached 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. In 2000, a redesigned, \"slim\" version called the PS one was released, replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor, the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with the PlayStation's DualShock controller and games, was announced in 1999 and launched in 2000. The last PS one units were sold in winter 2004 before it was officially discontinued in 2006, for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch 11 years earlier. Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of both the PlayStation and PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 – over 11 years after it had been released, and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe inception of what would become the released PlayStation dates back to 1986 with a joint venture between Nintendo and Sony. Nintendo had already produced floppy disk technology to complement cartridges, in the form of the Family Computer Disk System, and wanted to continue this complementary storage strategy for the Super Famicom. Nintendo approached Sony to develop a CD-ROM add-on, tentatively titled the \"Play Station\" or \"SNES-CD\". A contract was signed, and work began. Nintendo's choice of Sony was due to a prior dealing: Ken Kutaragi, the person who would later be dubbed \"The Father of the PlayStation\", was the individual who had sold Nintendo on using the Sony SPC-700 processor for use as the eight-channel ADPCM sound set in the Super Famicom/SNES console through an impressive demonstration of the processor's capabilities.\n\nKutaragi was nearly fired by Sony because he was originally working with Nintendo on the side without Sony's knowledge (while still employed by Sony). It was then-CEO, Norio Ohga, who recognised the potential in Kutaragi's chip, and in working with Nintendo on the project. Ohga kept Kutaragi on at Sony, and it was not until Nintendo cancelled the project that Sony decided to develop its own console.\n\nSony also planned to develop a Super NES-compatible, Sony-branded console, but one which would be more of a home entertainment system playing both Super NES cartridges and a new CD format which Sony would design. This was also to be the format used in SNES-CDs, giving a large degree of control to Sony despite Nintendo's leading position in the video gaming market.\n\nThe product, dubbed the \"Play Station\" was to be announced at the May 1991 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). However, when Nintendo's Hiroshi Yamauchi read the original 1988 contract between Sony and Nintendo, he realised that the earlier agreement essentially handed Sony complete control over any and all titles written on the SNES CD-ROM format. Yamauchi decided that the contract was totally unacceptable and he secretly cancelled all plans for the joint Nintendo-Sony SNES CD attachment. Instead of announcing a partnership between Sony and Nintendo, at 9 am the day of the CES, Nintendo chairman Howard Lincoln stepped onto the stage and revealed that Nintendo was now allied with Philips, and Nintendo was planning on abandoning all the previous work Nintendo and Sony had accomplished. Lincoln and Minoru Arakawa had, unbeknownst to Sony, flown to Philips' global headquarters in the Netherlands and formed an alliance of a decidedly different nature—one that would give Nintendo total control over its licenses on Philips machines.\n\nAfter the collapse of the joint-Nintendo project, Sony briefly considered allying itself with Sega to produce a stand-alone console. The Sega CEO at the time, Tom Kalinske, took the proposal to Sega's Board of Directors in Tokyo, who promptly vetoed the idea. Kalinske, in a 2013 interview recalled them saying \"that’s a stupid idea, Sony doesn't know how to make hardware. They don’t know how to make software either. Why would we want to do this?\". This prompted Sony into halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what it had developed so far with both Nintendo and Sega to make it into a complete console based upon the Super Famicom. As a result, Nintendo filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in US federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of what was originally christened the \"Play Station\", on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction and, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the aforementioned brand new game system was revealed. However, it is theorised that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.\n\nBy the end of 1992, Sony and Nintendo reached a deal whereby the \"Play Station\" would still have a port for SNES games, but Nintendo would own the rights and receive the bulk of the profits from the games, and the SNES would continue to use the Sony-designed audio chip. However, Sony decided in early 1993 to begin reworking the \"Play Station\" concept to target a new generation of hardware and software. As part of this process the SNES cartridge port was dropped and the space between the names \"Play Station\" was removed becoming \"PlayStation\", thereby ending Nintendo's involvement with the project. According to a Sony engineer, all work on the console from the time of the partnership with Nintendo was eventually scrapped, and the PlayStation design was restarted from scratch. Sony's North American division, known as Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), originally planned to market the new console under the alternative branding \"PSX\" following the negative feedback regarding \"PlayStation\" in focus group studies. Early advertising prior to the console's launch in North America referenced PSX, but the term was scrapped before launch.\n\nAccording to SCE's producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, there was uncertainty over whether the console should primarily focus on 2D sprite graphics or 3D polygon graphics. It was only after witnessing the success of Sega's \"Virtua Fighter\" in Japanese arcades that \"the direction of the PlayStation became instantly clear\" and 3D polygon graphics became the console's primary focus.\n\nUnlike Sega, Sony had no arcade division from which to draw console-selling ports, or any in-house development to speak of. To solve this problem, Sony acquired studios such as Psygnosis and signed exclusivity deals with hot arcade publishers Namco and Williams Entertainment.\n\nIndustry hype for the console spread quickly, and in early 1994 \"GamePro\" reported that \"many video game companies [feel] that in the near future, the video game platforms to contend with will be from Nintendo, Sega... and \"Sony\".\" [emphasis in original]\n\nThe PlayStation was released in Japan on 3 December 1994, North America on 9 September 1995, Europe on 29 September 1995, and Oceania on 15 November 1995. The console was an immediate success in Japan, selling over 2 million units within its first six months on the market. In the US, 800,000 were sold in 1995 (i.e. four months on the market), giving the PlayStation a commanding lead over the other consoles of its generation, though it was still being outsold by the older Super NES and Sega Genesis. The launch price in the US market was US$299 and Sony enjoyed a very successful launch with titles of almost every genre, including \"Battle Arena Toshinden\", \"Warhawk\", \"Air Combat\", \"Philosoma\", \"Ridge Racer\" and \"Rayman\". Unlike the vast majority of gaming consoles of the time, the PlayStation did not include a pack-in game at launch. Sony reported strong software sales in the months following launch, with an attach rate of 4:1.\n\nThen Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, preferred Sony's console to the competition from Sega, saying \"Our game designer likes the Sony machine.\" Microsoft would later compete with Sony with its Xbox console. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" would score the PlayStation console a 19 out of 40. The staff of \"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation a few weeks after its North American launch. They commented that while the CPU is \"fairly average\", the supplementary custom hardware such as the GPU and sound processor is stunningly powerful. They particularly praised its focus on 3D, and also remarked positively on the comfort of the controller and the convenience of the memory cards. Giving the system 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, they concluded, \"To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war.\" An advertisement slogan used in marketing the console was, \"\"Live in your world. Play in ours.\"\" It is stylised as, \"LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS.\" Another briefly used advertising campaign was titled \"You Are Not Ready\" or \"U R NOT .\" Sony's CCO Lee Clow explained that \"it's the ultimate challenge. Gamers love to respond to that tag line and say 'Bullshit. Let me show you how ready I am.'\"\n\nOne of the key factors in the PlayStation's success was Sony's approach to third party developers. Whereas Sega and Nintendo took an isolationist approach, focusing on first party development while generally leaving third party developers to their own devices, Sony took efforts to streamline game production by providing a range of programming libraries which were constantly updated online, organising third party technical support teams, and in some cases giving direct development support to third party companies.\n\nWhile the Sega Saturn was marketed towards 18 to 34 year-olds, the PlayStation was marketed roughly, but not exclusively, towards 12 to 24 year-olds. Both Sega and Sony reasoned that because younger players typically look up to older, more experienced players, they would be drawn in by advertising targeted at teens and adults. Additionally, Sony found that adults are best targeted by advertising geared towards teenagers; according to Lee Clow, \"One of the first things we resolved early on was that everyone is 17 when they play videogames. The young people look up to the best gamer who is usually a little older and more practiced and talented. Then there are people who start working and grow up, but when they go into their room and sit down with their videogames, they're regressing and becoming 17 again.\" Initially PlayStation demographics were skewed towards adults, but after the first price drop the audience began broadening.\n\nIn 1996, the high demand for PlayStation games contributed to Sony's decision to expand their CD production facilities in Springfield, Oregon, increasing their monthly output from 4 million discs to 6.5 million discs. PlayStation sales were running at twice the rate of Saturn sales, and dramatically increased their lead when both the PlayStation and Saturn dropped in price to $199 in May, in large part because some retailers (such as KB Toys) did not stock the Saturn. The PlayStation was outselling the Saturn at a similar ratio in Europe as well during 1996.\n\nThe PlayStation took more time to achieve dominance in Japan. After the PlayStation and Saturn had been on the market for nearly two years, Sony Computer Entertainment president Teruhisa Tokunaka said the competition between them was still \"very close\", and that neither console had yet held the lead in sales for any meaningful length of time.\n\nIn addition to playing games, select PlayStation models have the ability to play audio CDs; further, Asian model SCPH-5903 can also play Video CDs. Like most domestic CD players, the PlayStation has the ability to shuffle the playback order, play the songs in a programmed order, and repeat one song or the entire disc. Later PlayStation models can utilise a music visualisation function called SoundScope. This function, as well as a memory card manager, can be accessed by starting the console either without inserting a game or keeping the CD tray open, thereby accessing a GUI for the PlayStation BIOS.\n\nThe actual GUI for both PS one and PlayStation differ graphically depending on firmware versions: the original PlayStation GUI had a dark blue background with rainbow graffiti used as buttons; the early PAL PlayStation and PS one GUI had a grey blocked background with 2 icons in the middle, different on each version. If the CD lid is closed with a game inside at any time while at the menu, the game will immediately start.\n\nAs of 30 June 2007, a total of 7,918 software titles have been released worldwide (counting games released in multiple regions as separate titles). As of 31 March 2007, the cumulative software shipment was at 962 million units. The last game for the system released in the United States was \"FIFA Football 2005\". However, several reprinted and remastered editions were released in later years. \"Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection\" was released on 26 July 2007, which contained \"Metal Gear Solid\" in the original PlayStation format. In 2011, Capcom released the \"Resident Evil 15th Anniversary Collection\", and in 2012, Square Enix released the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" in Japan containing all of the \"Final Fantasy\" titles, a majority of which were also in the original PlayStation format.\n\nThe \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons on most of the Japanese PlayStation games are reversed in their North American and European releases. In Japan, the button (\"maru\", right) is used as the OK button, while the button (\"batsu\", wrong) is used as Cancel. North American and European releases have the button or the buttons as the OK button, while either the or the button is used as Cancel (some titles like \"Xenogears\" used the button for cancelling actions and selections, along with the PlayStation 2 system browser and the XrossMedia Bar on the PlayStation 3 and the PSP). However, a few games, such as Square's \"Vagrant Story\", \"Final Fantasy VII\" (which used the button as cancel) and \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", Namco's \"Ridge Racer Type 4\", and Konami's \"Metal Gear Solid\", use the Japanese button layout worldwide. Some other games, like the Japanese version of \"Gran Turismo\", had used different controls that are similar to North American games. These Japanese button layouts still apply to other PlayStation consoles. This is because in the early years Sony America (SCEA), Sony Europe (SCEE), and Sony Japan (SCEJ) had different development and testing documents (TRCs) for their respective territories.\n\nHardware designer Ken Kutaragi stated, \"The technology came from an original idea to create a synthesizer for graphics, something that takes a basic graphic and then adds various effects to it quickly and easily.\"\n\nWith the early units, particularly the early 1000 models, many gamers experience skipping full-motion video or physical \"ticking\" noises coming from their PlayStation units. The problem appears to have come from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments—the plastic mouldings inside the console can warp very slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly. The solution is to ensure that the console sits on a surface which dissipates heat efficiently in a well vented area, or raise the unit up slightly from its resting surface.\nThe first batch of PlayStations used a KSM-440AAM laser unit whose case and all movable parts were completely made out of plastic. Over time, friction causes the plastic lens sled rail to wear out—usually unevenly. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerated wear because of the additional heat, which makes the plastic even more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, one side of the lens sled can become so worn that the laser can tilt, no longer pointing directly at the CD. This would cause data read errors and games would no longer load. One common fix is to turn the PlayStation upside down, making the lens sled rest on the unworn top rails. Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the sled out of die-cast metal and placing the laser unit slightly farther away from the power supply on later models of the PlayStation.\n\nDue to an engineering oversight, the PlayStation does not produce a proper signal on several older models of televisions, causing the display to flicker or bounce around the screen. Since only a small percentage of PlayStation owners used such televisions, Sony decided not to change the console design, and instead gave consumers the option of sending their PlayStation unit to a Sony service centre to have an official modchip installed, which would allow it to play on older televisions.\n\nPrior to the PlayStation, the reproduction of copyrighted material for game consoles was restricted to either enthusiasts with exceptional technical ability, or others that had access to CD manufacturers. However, the increased availability of cheap CD burners at this time led Sony to modify the shape of the first portion of the data track on PlayStation formatted discs: A normal data track follows a smooth spiral path around a disc, whereas the modified portion of the data track followed wavy spiral path. As a result, any discs that did not contain the modified data track such as CD-R copies or standard pirated discs could not boot on the console. This modified portion of the data path was used to encode the disc \"region\", for example a disc destined for distribution in the NTSC-U/C region would encode the letters \"SCEA\"; in Europe, \"SCEE\"; in Japan, \"SCEI\". This served as copy protection as well as region-locking.\n\nThe installation of an unofficial modchip allowed the PlayStation to play games recorded on a regular CD-R. Since it worked by injecting the correct region data into the stream it also allowed the console to play games from any region.\n\nSeveral open source modchips were designed using readily available electronic parts, by the end of the system's life cycle almost anyone with minimal soldering experience was able to perform these modifications. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using free, unofficial tools, as well as the reproduction of original discs. With the introduction of such devices the console became very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers alike, as well as those who merely wished to protect the lifespan of their lawful, original discs. In 1996 Sony filed lawsuits against a number of companies which advertised such modchips and pirated games, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\nSome companies (notably Datel) did manage to produce discs that booted on unmodified retail units while using special equipment.\n\nInstead of a D-pad, which is used for directional movement in nearly every other console then on the market, the PlayStation controller uses four directional buttons.\n\nPeripherals released for the PlayStation include memory cards, the PlayStation Mouse, the PlayStation Analog Joystick, the PlayStation Link Cable, the Multiplayer Adapter (a four-player multitap), the Memory Drive (a disk drive for 3.5 inch floppy disks), the GunCon (a light gun), and the Glasstron (a monoscopic head-mounted display).\n\n\nThe PlayStation went through a number of variants during its production run. From an external perspective, the most notable change between variants was the reduction in the number of connectors. The RCA jacks were removed in the first revision, and the Parallel I/O port was removed in the final revision.\n\nSony marketed a development kit for hobbyists and developers also known as the Net Yaroze, which launched in June 1996 in Japan and in 1997 in other countries. Sold only through an ordering service, the development console came with the necessary documentation and software to program PlayStation games and applications.\n\nOn 7 July 2000, Sony released the PS one, a smaller, redesigned version of the original PlayStation. It was the highest-selling console through the end of the year, outselling all other consoles - including Sony's own PlayStation 2. A total of 28.15 million PS one units had been sold by the time it was discontinued in March 2006.\nA version of the PS one included a LCD screen, referred to as the \"Combo pack\".\n\nSony's successor to the PlayStation is the PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with its predecessor in that it can play almost every original PlayStation game.\n\nThe third generation of the PlayStation, the PlayStation 3, was launched on 11 November 2006 in Japan, 17 November 2006 in North America, and 23 March 2007 in Europe. The backward compatibility of the PlayStation 3 differs by model. The newer PlayStation 3 models, like the Slim, are only backwards compatible with original PlayStation games; however, the older 60 GB model (the first PS3 model released) will play PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games through either having the Emotion Engine and/or Reality Synthesizer and emulating one or the other. While PlayStation 3 games are not region-locked, PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games are only playable on PlayStation 3 consoles from the same region.\n\nA third successor, the PlayStation 4, was announced by Sony on 20 February 2013 and was released in the US on 15 November, Europe on 29 November 2013, and Japan and Asia on 22 February 2014. However, it is backwards compatible with select PS3 Games through a download service dubbed PlayStation Now.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable, or PSP, is a handheld game console first released in late 2004. The PSP is capable of playing PlayStation games downloaded via Sony's online store, and can also play any PlayStation game by using the PlayStation 3's remote play feature while the disc is in the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe successor to the PSP, the PlayStation Vita, was introduced as a part of the 8th generation of video game consoles, and is backwards compatible with original PSP as well as original PlayStation games downloaded from the PlayStation Store.\n\nSony Computer Entertainment was an upstart in the video game industry in late 1994, as the early 1990s were dominated by Nintendo and Sega. Nintendo had been the clear leader in the video game industry since the introduction of the NES in 1985 and the Nintendo 64 was initially expected to maintain this position for Nintendo. The PlayStation's target audience included 15- to 17-year-olds who were not the primary focus of Nintendo, and 18- to 29-year-olds, who represented the first generation to grow up playing video games. By the late 1990s, Sony became a highly regarded console brand due to the PlayStation, with a significant lead over second-place Nintendo, while Sega was relegated to a distant third.\n\nThe PlayStation's lead in installed base and developer support paved the way for the success of the next-generation PlayStation 2, which overcame an early launch from the Sega Dreamcast and then fended off competition from the Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube.\n\nThe success of the PlayStation is widely believed to have influenced the demise of the cartridge-based home console. While not the first system to utilise an optical disc format, it is the first highly successful one, and ended up going head-to-head with the last major home console to rely on proprietary cartridges—the Nintendo 64. Sony Computer Entertainment president Teruhisa Tokunaka remarked in 1996: \n\nNintendo was very public about its scepticism toward using CDs and DVDs to store games, citing longer load times and durability issues. It was widely speculated that the company was even more concerned with the proprietary cartridge format's ability to help enforce copy protection, given its substantial reliance on licensing and exclusive titles for its revenue. Piracy was rampant on the PlayStation due to the relative ease of the installation of a modchip, allowing the PlayStation to play games region free and/or recorded on a regular CD-R, making the console very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers.\n\nThe increasing complexity of games (in content, graphics, and sound) pushed cartridges to their storage limits and this gradually turned off some third-party developers. Part of the CD format's appeal to publishers was that they could be produced at a significantly lower cost and offered more production flexibility to meet demand. As a result, some third-party developers switched to the PlayStation, such as Squaresoft, whose \"Final Fantasy VII\", and Enix (later merged with Squaresoft to create Square Enix), whose \"Dragon Quest VII\" titles were initially pre-planned for the N64; while some who remained released fewer games to the Nintendo 64 (Konami, releasing only thirteen N64 games but over fifty on the PlayStation). While new games were coming out rapidly for the PlayStation, new Nintendo 64 game releases were less frequent and that system's biggest successes were developed by either Nintendo itself or by second-parties, such as Rare. The lower production costs also allowed publishers an additional source of profit: budget-priced reissues of titles which had already recouped their development costs.\n",

                "Cytus\n\nCytus is a rhythm game developed by Rayark Games, an independent game developer in Taiwan. It was first released on the iOS platform on January 12, 2012. The game was later released on Android on August 7, 2012. A port for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Mobile, titled Cytus: Lambda, was released on June 26, 2013. An arcade version titled Cytus: Omega in collaboration with Capcom is revealed at JAEPO in February 2015 and is set for location testing in July 2015.\n\nThe name \"Cytus\" is taken from Cocytus, the Greek mythological river of wailing or lamentation. \"Cytus\" features a story plot that is carried through its 10 main chapters as well as a prologue. The story revolves around the protagonist, Vanessa, who lives in a 22nd-century world where robots with human memories are the only remaining sentient beings while living humans are killed by a mutant virus. Due to limited memory space, human emotions are stored in the form of music in \"Cytus\", and by playing the songs, the robots are able to revive their human emotions. The plot features the disaster and the protagonist's struggle with identity. The story is told in-game through various cut-scenes that are unique to the chapter title songs; in comparison, the other individual songs within each chapter are at most only marginally relevant to the plot, except for a limited few.\n\nEven though it is a mobile game, it needs high specification. It requires 950MB of storage space. (9.X version). The data of the songs not purchased have to be downloaded together even though it’s not needed. And after the update to Cytus 10.0, the storage amount increased to 1.54GB in iOS.\n\nThe game needs at least iOS 7.0 on the basis of 2016/09/06 Cytus 10.0 update. An iPhone must be at least iPhone 5, and it will not work under iOS 7. If older versions of the game were previously installed, then it can be played normally. This app is a 64-bit app, which means it is also compatible with iOS 11 and later.\n\nThe game needs at least 600MB of storage and 1GHz of CPU and 140MB of relaxation in memory of 512MB RAM on Android 2.2. Playing the game on power save mode is almost impossible. Specifically, in Galaxy S3, auto haptic is released.\n\nThe game was released on 2013/6/26. It is a Play Station game, and can be downloaded in PSM store (A store for PS games). The game is optimized well, but it takes a long time to load. 0.5 seconds~ 3 seconds is taken to load, affected by the environment of the Play Station.\nThe storage amount is 599MB (Version 5.00). Almost nothing is different from the phone game Cytus. The price is 1,234￥(Japan), 9.69￡(England), 18.95 (Australia Dollar), 11.99 (American Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro). One of the uncomfortable parts of the game is update. The game cannot be updated by just downloading the patch file. The whole game file has to be downloaded again.\n\nThe game was revealed in 2015 February. It was revealed in the event ‘crossbeats REV.’ However, the game isn’t released yet. It isn’t much different from the phone game cytus, but it shows the note that has to be touched first. Also, notes that have to be touched at the same time have small horns to be distinguished easily.\n\nThe game was revealed in 2015 December. It was revealed at RayarkCon 2015. As of January 18, 2018, the game is now available to the public. Cytus II features similar game mechanics to the previous title.\n\nThe main gameplay of \"Cytus\" features the Active Scan Line, a black line that move up and down across the screen. The player taps circular objects, referred to as Notes, as the Active Scan Line passes over them, following the music.\n\nThree types of Notes are used. The Click Note, a single circular note, requires tapping the object in time. The Drag Note, a continuous track of notes, requires dragging along the track. The Hold Note, a note with an extended ribbon meter, requires holding over the note until the meter is filled. Notes to be hit as the line rises are colored blue and purple, while those as the line drops are colored yellow and green.\n\nEach Note is judged by the accuracy to be either Perfect, Good, Bad or Miss. The better the accuracy, the higher score is given. The maximum score is 1,000,000, and a minimum of 700,000 is required to clear a stage. Basic score is 900,000, the score is divided equally into every note. Combo score is 100,000, the score is proportional to square of the maximum combo. Also, the maximum TP score is 100, and TP Perfect, NM Perfect, Good, Bad, Miss is calculated 100%, 70%, 30%, 0%, 0%, respectively. After a stage ends, various metrics are provided to show the player's performance, including score, TP, a letter grade, and numbers of hits in each type of judgement. Score system is referred: Fail below 700,000, C below 800,000, B below 900,000, A below 950,000, S below 1,000,000, Million Master at 1,000,000.\n\n\"Cytus\" includes more than 100 songs available for play in the game, spanning a variety of genres including pop music, trance music and drum and bass.

Gestures used includes tapping, swiping and holding at a specific timing and location.\n\n\"Cytus\" also includes a series of songs in image of the overarching plot, collectively named Cytus: Alive, added in version 6.0 in July 2014. Unlike normal songs, \"Cytus: Alive\" songs contains added plot animation during gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll composed by VGO(Video Game Orchestra).\n\n\n\nAll composed by Ice & gaQden. tap \"L\" silhouette to play insane mode each song.\n\n\nAll composed by Night Keepers, except Times Difference War.\n\n\n\"Cytus\" is available through the Apple App Store and Google Play. The full game charges a base price plus optional in-app purchases for players to purchase additional chapters of playable songs.\n\nThe release on Google Play is free but features a cooldown timer before starting each song. The cooldown will be removed when the full price is paid.\n\nThe PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Mobile port \"Cytus: Lambda\" includes the then-exclusive chapter Prologue: Live, otherwise identical to its smartphone releases. A teaser video was released onto YouTube prior to release on June 7, 2013.\n\nRayark Games announced the Million Downloads Plan () in the wake of \"illegal piracy harming the sales figures of \"Cytus\"\".

                "Rhythm game\n\nRhythm game or rhythm action is a genre of music-themed action video game that challenges a player's sense of rhythm. Games in the genre typically focus on dance or the simulated performance of musical instruments, and require players to press buttons in a sequence dictated on the screen. Doing so causes the game's protagonist or avatar to dance or to play their instrument correctly, which increases the player's score. Many rhythm games include multiplayer modes in which players compete for the highest score or cooperate as a simulated musical ensemble. While conventional control pads may be used as input devices, rhythm games often feature novel game controllers that emulate musical instruments. Certain dance-based games require the player to physically dance on a mat, with pressure-sensitive pads acting as the input device.\n\nThe 1996 title \"PaRappa the Rapper\" has been deemed the first influential rhythm game, whose basic template formed the core of subsequent games in the genre. In 1997, Konami's \"Beatmania\" sparked an emergent market for rhythm games in Japan. The company's music division, Bemani, released a series of music-based games over the next several years. The most successful of these was the 1998 dance mat game \"Dance Dance Revolution\", which was the only Bemani title to achieve large-scale success outside Japan, and would see numerous imitations of the game from other publishers.\n\nOther Japanese games, particularly \"Guitar Freaks\", led to development of \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" series that used instrument-shaped controllers to mimic the playing of actual instruments. Spurred by the inclusion of popular rock music, the two series revitalized the rhythm genre in the Western Market, significantly expanded the console video game market and its demographics. The games provided a new source of revenue for the artists whose music appeared on the soundtracks. The later release of \"Rock Band 3\" as well as the even later \"Rocksmith\" would allow players to play the songs using a real electric guitar. By 2008, rhythm games were considered to be one of the most popular video game genres, behind other action games. However, by 2009, the market was saturated by spin-offs from the core titles, which led to a nearly 50% drop in revenue for music game publishers; within a few years, both series announced they would be taking a hiatus from future titles.\n\nDespite these setbacks, the rhythm game market continues to expand, introducing a number of danced-based games like Ubisoft's \"Just Dance\" and Harmonix's \"Dance Central\" that incorporate the use of motion controllers and camera-based controls like the Kinect. Existing games also continue to thrive on new business models, such as the reliance on downloadable content to provide songs to players. The introduction of the new generation of console hardware has also spurred return of Activision's \"Guitar Hero\" and Harmonix's \"Rock Band\" titles in late 2015.\n\nRhythm game, or rhythm action, is a subgenre of action game that challenges a player's sense of rhythm. The genre includes dance games such as \"Dance Dance Revolution\" and music-based games such as \"Donkey Konga\" and \"Guitar Hero\". Games in the genre challenge the player to press buttons at precise times: the screen shows which button the player is required to press, and the game awards points both for accuracy and for synchronization with the beat. The genre also includes games that measure rhythm and pitch, in order to test a player's singing ability, and games that challenge the player to control their volume by measuring how hard they press each button. While songs can be sight read, players usually practice to master more difficult songs and settings. Certain rhythm games offer a challenge similar to that of Simon says, in that the player must watch, remember, and repeat complex sequences of button-presses. Rhythm-action can take a minigame format with some games blending rhythm with other genres or entirely comprising minigame collections.\n\nIn some rhythm games, the screen displays an avatar who performs in reaction to the player's controller inputs. However, these graphical responses are usually in the background, and the avatar is more important to spectators than it is to the player. In single-player modes, the player's avatar competes against a computer-controlled opponent, while multiplayer modes allow two player-controlled avatars to compete head-to-head. The popularity of rhythm games has created a market for speciality input devices. These include controllers that emulate musical instruments, such as guitars, drums, or maracas. A dance mat, for use in dancing games, requires the player to step on pressure-sensitive pads. However, most rhythm games also support more conventional input devices, such as control pads.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Kasco (Kansei Seiki Seisakusho) created a rhythm-based electro-mechanical arcade game, designed by Kenzou Furukawa and produced by Kenji Nagata. According to Nagata, it was Furukawa's \"idea for a game where you’d lift girls skirts in time to some rhythm\", inspired by the 1969 Japanese \"Oh! Mouretsu\" commercials. The arcade game was released in Japan. Another early rhythm-based electronic game was the handheld game \"Simon\", created in 1978 by Ralph Baer (who created the Magnavox Odyssey) and Howard Morrison. The game used the \"call and response\" mechanic, in which players take turns repeating increasingly complicated sequences of button presses.\n\nHuman Entertainment's \"Dance Aerobics\" was an early rhythm-based video game released in 1987, and allows players to create music by stepping on Nintendo's Power Pad peripheral for the NES video game console. The 1996 title \"PaRappa the Rapper\" has been credited as the first true rhythm game, and as one of the first music-based games in general. It requires players to press buttons in the order that they appear on the screen, a basic mechanic that formed the core of future rhythm games. The success of \"PaRappa the Rapper\" sparked the popularity of the music game genre. In 1997, Konami released the DJ-themed rhythm game \"Beatmania\" in Japanese arcades. Its arcade cabinet features buttons similar to those of a musical keyboard, and a rubber pad that emulates a vinyl record. \"Beatmania\" was a surprise hit, inspiring Konami's Games and Music Division to change its name to Bemani in honor of the game, and to begin experimenting with other rhythm game concepts. Its successes include \"GuitarFreaks\", which features a guitar-shaped controller, and 1998's \"Pop'n Music\", a game similar to \"Beatmania\" in which multiple colorful buttons must be pressed. While the \"GuitarFreaks\" franchise continues to receive new arcade releases in Japan, it was never strongly marketed outside of the country. This allowed Red Octane and Harmonix to capitalize on the formula in 2005 with the Western-targeted \"Guitar Hero\". In general, few Japanese arcade rhythm games were exported abroad because of the cost of producing the peripherals and the resulting increases in retail prices. The 1999 Bemani title \"DrumMania\" featured a drum kit controller, and could be linked with \"GuitarFreaks\" for simulated jam sessions. Similarly, this concept was later appropriated by Harmonix for their game \"Rock Band\".\n\n\"Dance Dance Revolution\", released in 1998, is a rhythm game in which players dance on pressure-sensitive pads in an order dictated by on-screen instructions. The game was highly successful both in and outside Japan, unlike games such as \"GuitarFreaks\", \"DrumMania\" and \"Beatmania\", though the latter had some success in Europe. Released the same year, Enix's \"Bust a Groove\" features a similar focus on dancing but employs a more conventional input method. The game contains competitive one-on-one battles, and grants the player more freedom than typical rhythm games.\n\nNanaOn-Sha, the creators of \"PaRappa the Rapper\", released \"Vib-Ribbon\" in 1999. It eschews instrument-shaped controllers; instead, players maneuver the protagonist through an obstacle course by pressing buttons at correct times. The game's levels are generated by the background music, which players may change by inserting audio CDs. While it was praised for its unique style and artistry, \"Vib-Ribbon\"s simple vector graphics proved difficult to market, and the game was never released in North America. Sega's \"Samba de Amigo\", released in arcades in 1999 and on the Dreamcast in 2000, features maraca-shaped, motion sensitive controllers. The game allows for two-player gameplay, provides a spectacle for onlookers and allows players to socialise while gaming. In 2000, \"Taiko no Tatsujin\" combined traditional Japanese drums with contemporary pop music, and became highly successful in Japanese arcades. The game was later released on consoles in the West as \"Taiko Drum Master\", and the franchise continues to receive new installments in Japan. \"Gitaroo Man\" featured a guitar-playing protagonist four years before the release of \"Guitar Hero\", though the game employed a conventional rather than guitar-shaped controller. \"Gitaroo Man\"'s creator, Keiichi Yano, later created \"Osu! Tatakae! Ouendan\", a rhythm game for the Nintendo DS that utilizes the handheld's touchscreen features. It became a highly demanded import title, which led to the release of an altered version of the game in the West—\"Elite Beat Agents\"—and a sequel in Japan.\n\nHarmonix was formed in 1995 from a computer music group at MIT. Beginning in 1998, the company developed music games inspired by \"PaRappa the Rapper\". In 2001, the company released \"Frequency\", which puts the player in control of multiple instrument tracks. Ryan Davis of GameSpot wrote that the game provides a greater sense of creative freedom than earlier rhythm titles. \"Frequency\" was critically acclaimed; however, marketing was made difficult by the game's abstract style, which removed the player's ability to perform for onlookers. In 2003, Harmonix followed up \"Frequency\" with the similar \"Amplitude\". The company later released a more socially driven, karaoke-themed music game in \"Karaoke Revolution\" (2003). \"Donkey Konga\", a GameCube title developed by Namco and released in 2003, achieved widespread success by leveraging Nintendo's \"Donkey Kong\" brand.\n\nIn 2005, Harmonix and the small publisher RedOctane released \"Guitar Hero\", a game inspired by Bemani's \"GuitarFreaks\". However, instead of the Japanese pop that comprises the earlier title's soundtrack, \"Guitar Hero\" features Western rock music. The game reinvigorated the rhythm genre, which had stagnated because of a flood of \"Dance Dance Revolution\" sequels and imitations. \"Guitar Hero\" spawned several sequels, and the franchise overall earned more than $1 billion, with the third installment ranking as the best selling game in North America in 2007. Harmonix followed \"Guitar Hero\" with the \"Rock Band\" franchise, which also earned over $1 billion. \"Rock Band\" titles support multiple instrument controllers and cooperative multiplayer, allowing players to play as a full band. The \"Guitar Hero\" franchise followed suit with the band-oriented, Neversoft-developed \"Guitar Hero World Tour\". \"Guitar Hero\" installments based on specific bands, such as Metallica and Aerosmith, were also published. Additional songs for \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" were made available for purchase via the Internet, which generated further revenue. Artists whose work is featured in the games receive royalties, and the increased publicity in turn generates further sales of their music. The success of the \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" franchises widened the console video game market and its demographics, and the popularity of the genre drove increased sales of consoles. In 2008, it was reported that music games had become the second most popular video game genre (behind action) in the United States, with 53% of players being female. At its height in 2008, music games represented about 18% of the video game market.\n\nVideo game industry analysts considered 2009 to be a critical year for rhythm games, and they believed that it would allow them to gauge the future success of the genre. Both the \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" franchises were expanded, and they received entries for handheld gaming devices and mobile phones. Specialized titles that targeted specific genres and demographics, such as \"Band Hero\" for pop music and \"Lego Rock Band\" for younger players, were released. Sales of music games were down in the first half of the year. This decline was attributed to fewer purchases of instrument controllers; it was assumed that players had already bought such controllers and were reusing them. While analysts had expected that United States sales of \"Guitar Hero 5\" and \"\" would be high—close to or exceeding one million units each in the first month of their release—sales only reached roughly half of those projections. The failure to meet sales projections was partly attributed to the impact of the late-2000s recession on the video game industry; Harmonix's CEO Alex Rigopolis considered that at the time, both \"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" were the most expensive video games on the market. Analysts also considered it to be a sign of market saturation. Further contributing to the decline was genre stagnation; the franchises retained the same basic gameplay over several iterations, giving consumers less incentive to buy additional titles. Harmonix CEO Alex Rigopulos felt that the aggressive competition between the \"Rock Band\" and \"Guitar Hero\" brands on the belief that the market could only support one franchise also contributed to the decline of these games. As a result, analysts lowered their expectations for future music games; for example, projections of first quarter U.S. sales of \"DJ Hero\", a \"Guitar Hero\" \"spin-off\", were reduced from 1.6 million units to only 600,000. Sales of rhythm games, which totalled $1.47 billion in 2008, reached only $700 million in 2009. Analysts predicted that the market would settle at the same \"healthy\" $500–600 million level of the \"Call of Duty\" series. Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter concluded that the saturation of the rhythm game market accounted for one-third of the industry's 12% sales decline in 2009.\n\nThe fallout of the weakening rhythm game market affected game developers, publishers and distributors. Companies in the latter two categories believed that most consumers would own at least one set of instrument controllers by 2010, which would increase the importance of software and downloadable content sales.\nActivision scaled back its 2010 \"Guitar Hero\" release schedule to just two games, reducing the number of SKUs from 25 in 2009 to 10 in 2010. The company closed several in-house developers, including RedOctane, Neversoft's \"Guitar Hero\" division, and Underground Development. Viacom, which had paid Harmonix $150 million following the success of \"Rock Band\" in 2007, began seeking a \"substantial\" refund on that investment after weak sales in 2009. Viacom also sought to negotiate new deals with music publishers to reduce the costs of the \"Rock Band\" series' licensed music. Ultimately, the company began to seek a buyer for Harmonix during the third quarter of 2010.\n\nIn 2010, rhythm game developers included new features in their products. For example, \"Rock Band 3\" and \"\" support guitar controllers with strings, and both contain modes that teach players accurate fingering. Despite this new content, sales of music games faltered in 2010. \"Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock\" and \"DJ Hero 2\" sold only 86,000 and 59,000 copies, respectively, in North America during their first week on the market. This was in sharp contrast to \"Guitar Hero III\", which had sold nearly 1.4 million units in its first week in 2008. Through October 2010, music games achieved net sales of around $200 million, one-fifth of the genre's revenue during the same period in 2008. Analysts believed that the market likely would not break $400 million in revenue by the end of the year. End year sales were less than $300 million.\n\nBy the end of 2010, the rhythm market was considered \"well past its prime\", and developers shifted their focus to downloadable content and potential integration with motion control systems. In late 2010, Viacom sold Harmonix to an investment-backed group and allowed it to continue developing \"Rock Band\" and \"Dance Central\". Citing the downturn in rhythm games, Activision shuttered their \"Guitar Hero\" division in February 2011. Analysts suggested that the market for peripheral-based rhythm games may remain stagnant for three to five years, after which sales could resurge because of digital distribution models or the release of new video game consoles. However, by 2013, the era of peripheral-based music games was considered at an end, as Harmonix announced that it would cease regular updates of \"Rock Band\" downloadable content on April 2, 2013 as the company shifts to newer games.\n\nIn Japanese amusement arcade, arcade-based collectible card games became popular. In 2004, Sega released which was a fashion coordinate game with collectible card game and rhythm game elements. The Oshare Majo was a big hit in Japan and then other game companies also entered in this game genre.\n\nThose games have only aimed at young girls, however some of those games also hit at some adults which are often mentioned as \"Ōkina otomodachi\" (lit. Big Friends). In 2016, as for PriPara, Tomy mentioned that \"When all users [of the game] are counted as its main target of from 6 to 9 years old [Japanese] girls, we succeed to expand the market scale as many as every one of the main target.\" in its financial results.\n\nIn Japan, such as The Idolmaster and Vocaloids became popular in the Nico Nico Douga, a Japanese video sharing service and then many virtual-idol-featured rhythm games were released. The early examples are The Idolmaster Live For You! (2008, BNEI) and (2009-, Sega) but there were only aimed to Japanese market.\n\nIn January 2012, Taiwanese video game maker, released Cytus, a SF-themed rhythm game, for smartphones. Cytus was a big hit in Asia, including Japan and due to this, smartphone-based rhythm games became popular in Japan. In spring 2012, Sega released Miku Flick, a spin-off game from \"Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA\" series, for smartphone not only in Japanese market but also in world market. In April 2013, BNEI released the iOS port of The Idolmaster Shiny Festa for world market. The iOS port became the first English support game in The Idolmaster series. In the same month, Bushiroad released Love Live! School Idol Festival for smartphones in Japanese market and then in 2014, they released the international version of the game for world market.\n\nSmartphone-based idol-featured rhythm games become more and more popular in Japan. The new games have been released every year: Show by Rock!! (2013-), (2014-), (2014-2015), (2014-2016), (2014-), Hello Pro Tap Live (2014-), (2015-), Girl Friend Note (2015-), IDOLiSH7 (2015-), (2015-), Yumeiro Cast (2015-), School Star Dream! (2015-2016), AiPara! IDOL PARADISE (2015-2015), Syachihokōru (2015-), Pretty Rhythm Shake (2015-), (2015-2016), (2016-), 8 beat Story (2016-), Idol Connect (2016), (2016-), : Kirameki Note (2016-), (2016-), Idol Incidents (2016-2017), Pop in Q: Dance for Quintet! (2017-), BanG Dream! Girls Band Party! (2017-), (2017-), Idol Rhythm Party (2017-), (2017-), B-PROJECT: Muteki*Dangerous (2017-), Doru-on (2017-), Re:Stage! Prism Step (2017-), (2017-), King of Prism: Prism Rush! Live (2017-), Uta no Prince-sama: Shining Live (2017), : LIVE ON ST@GE! (2017-), Schoolgirl Strikers: Twinkle Melodies (2017-), and Legenne: be a star (2017-).\n\nWith the introduction of motion controllers for the Xbox 360 (Kinect) and the PlayStation 3 (PlayStation Move) in 2010 and 2011, some analysts stated that the rhythm market would resurge thanks to dance- and band-based games that use platform-agnostic controllers. Dance games such as \"Just Dance\", \"Dance Central\" and \"\" were based on the new motion sensing technology. Industry pundits believe that, because sales of peripheral-based music games are lagging and the popularity of pop music is surging, dance-based games will continue to thrive. Dance games such as Ubisoft's \"Just Dance\" and Harmonix's \"Dance Central\" boosted the rhythm genre's late-2010 sales; the latter was the top-selling game for the Kinect in North America in November 2010. Both games helped the genre increase its sales by 38% over November 2009, according to NPD. Harmonix is expected to post more than $100 million in profit for 2011 buoyed by sales of \"Dance Central\" and downloadable content for the game, according to Bloomberg. \"Just Dance\" overcame a poor critical reception to topple \"\" best-seller status, while \"Just Dance 2\" (2010) became the best selling non-Nintendo game for the Wii. The \"Just Dance\" series competed with top action franchises for sales. \"Tap Tap Revenge\", the first installment of the iPhone rhythm series \"Tap Tap\", was the platform's most downloaded game in 2008. The \"Tap Tap\" franchise ultimately generated 15 million downloads and received a Guinness World Record as the \"most popular iPhone game series\".\n\nOver the course of 2014, the phenomenon of indie games produced several variations of the genre. The game Jungle Rumble uses a mechanic where players drum on a touch screen to control the game. Different rhythms correspond with different verbs to control entities in an RTS like environment. The game \"Crypt of the NecroDancer\" uses a mechanic where the player controls the main character in sync with the soundtrack's beat.\n\nHarmonix returned to its core rhythm games in 2014. In 2014, it successfully funded a Kickstarter to produce a remake of the PS2 title, \"Amplitude\" for the PlayStation 3 and 4, with release expected in 2015. Further, in March 2015, the company announced \"Rock Band 4\" to be released later in the same year, with plans to keep the game as a platform with continued free and paid updates and downloadable content, while refocusing on the core social and music enjoyment of the game. Activision also announced \"Guitar Hero Live\", slated for late 2015, which rebuilds the game from the ground up, keeping the core mechanics but using a 3-button with dual position controller, and using recorded footage of a rock concert taken from the lead guitarist's perspective to increase immersion. Guitar rhythm game industry is going for the VR market with games like Rocksmith and \"Rock Band VR\" .\n\nIn 2016, Konami returned to the western arcade market with \"Dance Dance Revolution A\" after a successful location test.\n\nRhythm games have been used for health purposes. For example, research has found that dancing games dramatically increase energy expenditure over that of traditional video games, and that they burn more calories than walking on a treadmill. Scientists have further suggested that, due to the large amount of time children spend playing video games and watching television, games that involve physical activity could be used to combat obesity. Studies have found that playing \"Dance Dance Revolution\" can provide an aerobic workout, in terms of a sufficiently intense heart rate, but not the minimum levels of VO2 max. Based on successful preliminary studies, West Virginia, which has one of the highest rates of obesity and its attendant diseases in the US, introduced \"Dance Dance Revolution\" into its schools' physical education classes. According to \"The New York Times\", more than \"several hundred schools in at least 10 states\" have used \"Dance Dance Revolution\" (along with \"In the Groove\") in their curricula. Plans have been made to increase the number into the thousands in an effort to mitigate the country's obesity epidemic. Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Governor of California, was a noted proponent of the game's use in schools. In Japan, celebrities reported losing weight after playing \"Dance Dance Revolution\", which drove sales of the game's home console version. Bemani's testers also found themselves losing weight while working on the game. There is further anecdotal evidence that these games aid weight loss, though the University of Michigan Health System has cautioned that dance games and other exergames should only be a starting point towards traditional sports, which are more effective. Dance games have also been used in rehabilitation and fall-prevention programs for elderly patients, using customised, slower versions of existing games and mats. Researchers have further experimented with prototypes of games allowing wider and more realistic stepping than the tapping actions found in commercial dance games.\n\n\"Guitar Hero\" games have been used alongside physical therapy to help recovering stroke patients, because of the multiple limb coordination that the titles require. Blondie drummer Clem Burke has worked with researchers at the University of Chichester and the University of Gloucestershire to determine how games like \"Guitar Hero\" can address issues of \"child and adult obesity, autism, stroke patients and health and mental well-being in the workplace\". Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have used \"Guitar Hero III\" and its controller to help amputee patients, and to develop new prosthetic limbs for these patients. Researchers at University of Nevada, Reno modified a haptic feedback glove to work with the \"Guitar Hero\" freeware clone \"Frets on Fire\", resulting in \"Blind Hero\", a music game for visually impaired players that is played with only touch and audio. MIT students collaborated with the government of Singapore and a professor at the National University of Singapore to create \"AudiOdyssey\", a game which allows both blind and sighted gamers to play together. \"Guitar Hero\" was used as part of a Trent University youth sleep study, which showed that, in general, players who played a song were better at it twelve hours later if that period included normal sleep.\n\n\"Guitar Hero\" and \"Rock Band\" have introduced people to rock music and inspired them to learn how to play the guitar. A study by Youth Music found that 2.5 million out of 12 million children in the United Kingdom have begun learning how to play real instruments after playing music video games such as \"Guitar Hero\". The group believes that these video games can be incorporated into music educational programs. Guitar teachers in the US have reported an increase in students who cite \"Guitar Hero\" as their inspiration to start learning. On the other hand, industry professionals, such the inventor of the Fretlight practice tool, have expressed scepticism over the game's educational value. There is anecdotal evidence that \"Guitar Hero\" aids rhythm and general hand-coordination, but also that it creates a false preconception of the difficulty of learning guitar, which can lead students to discontinue their studies. Guitar Center conducted a survey which found that a majority of instrument-based rhythm gamers intended to take up a real instrument in the future while a majority of those who were already musicians had been inspired to play their instruments more. Despite such popularity the guitar remains less popular than it was in the 1960s. Some musicians have been critical of \"Guitar Hero\"'s impact on music education. Jack White of The White Stripes stated that he was disappointed to learn that video games are the most likely venue where younger audiences will be exposed to new works, while Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin does not believe that people can learn how to play real instruments from their video game counterparts. Similarly, Prince has turned down opportunities to have his music in the \"Guitar Hero\" series, stating that he felt that it was \"more important that kids learn how to actually play the guitar\". Other commentators have pointed to drum controllers (including the expanded, lifelike Drum Rocker kit) used in such games as potentially useful in learning and creating music with real drums.\n\n",
                "Rhythm Tengoku\n\nRhythm Tengoku is a rhythm game developed by Nintendo SPD and published by Nintendo. It was released on August 3, 2006, and was the last game developed by Nintendo for the Game Boy Advance. An arcade version of the game was reprogrammed and published by Sega on September 20, 2007. Both versions were released in Japan exclusively. The game has spawned three sequels; \"Rhythm Heaven\", \"Rhythm Heaven Fever\", and \"Rhythm Heaven Megamix\". It began as an idea created by its composer and supervisor Tsunku who proposed it to Nintendo due to his belief that they could do a better job with it than he could.\n\n\"Rhythm Tengoku\"s gameplay focuses on audio cues rather than visual cues to convey information to players. It features a number of unique stages which have their own type of rhythm and gameplay. Players follow the rhythm (in some rhythm games as a character) until the end where they are given a score based on their performance. The gameplay and music were both well received by critics and consumers. Parallels have been drawn between it and the developer's previous work on the \"WarioWare\" series.\n\n\"Rhythm Tengoku\" is a rhythm game similar to the \"WarioWare\" series of video games due in part to its simplistic controls and art style. It features eight sets which consist of six rhythm games each (all of which are unique to each other). Each set's sixth stage is a remix of the previous games all at once. The games change in turn throughout the remix, which is accompanied by a new song. Some remixes (such as Remix 5) might even have characters wearing alternate costumes. The seventh and eighth sets consist of stages that were based on previous games, but are much harder. Players unlock more rhythm games by completing the rhythm games in order. The object of each rhythm game is to match the rhythm the game expects of players which varies from stage to stage. The game primarily relies on audio cues to indicate the rhythm; while it uses visual cues as well, it will sometimes subvert players' expectations with them. Players are given one of three ratings at the end of every stage - Try Again, OK, and Superb. Players must achieve an OK rank in order to proceed to the next game. Players who achieve Superb receive a medal which can be used to unlock Endless Games, Rhythm Toys, and Drum Lessons. Players are allowed to attempt a Perfect Campaign of a randomly selected stage. If players make any misses in the stage while making the attempt, a life/chance is lost, and the player must restart the stage from the beginning. Players have three lives/chances to attempt this before it either disappears or moves on to another rhythm game. Players who succeed receive an in-game certificate as well as a gift (varying on the rhythm game). If they obtain all certificates, they get a special certificate as well as access to all songs in the drum mode. The game's drum controls allow players to use the different buttons on the Game Boy Advance to control various aspects of the drums.\n\nThere are 40 Rhythm Games and 8 Remixes (45 Rhythm Games and 9 Remixes in the Arcade Version), and 4 Endless Games in the GBA and Arcade versions of Rhythm Tengoku. The following Rhythm Games, Remixes and Endless Games are playable.\n Uses the song \"Love's Honey Sweet Angel\".</small><br>\n\n\"Rhythm Tengoku\" was released in Japan only during August 3, 2006 for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) and was developed by Nintendo SPD and published by Nintendo. Key staff members include Kazuyoshi Osawa, Tsunku (music composer and supervisor), Masami Yone (sound designer), and Ko Takeuchi (graphic designer). It was first revealed in an issue of \"Famitsu\". The project began when Tsunku brought his proposal to Nintendo of a rhythm game that did not rely on visual indicators for its rhythm. Osawa was wary that people would enjoy it due to its lack of a music score as he felt that it might only appeal to a niche audience. It was decided to be released on the GBA due to Osawa's desire for a smaller screen and portability. The staff took dance lessons in order to improve their rhythm by the recommendation of the game's music composer Tsunku. One stage that made an impression was \"Rhythm Tweezers\", a level that featured an onion with a face from which players pluck its hair. It was originally going to be a real face, but it was deemed \"a little too gross.\" Another stage is called \"The Bon Odori\" and is based on the real-world Bon Festival.\n\nBefore the game's release, a Kiosk Demo named \"Rhythm Tengoku: Trial Version\" was playable in shops, allowing people to try out the game before it was released. The Kiosk Demo only lets the player play three of the Rhythm Games from Set 1; \"Karate Man\", \"Rhythm Tweezers\" and \"The Clappy Trio\", as well as the Rhythm Test (only the first part of it can be played through). The Kiosk Demo also reminds the game's price of 3,800 Yen on the title screen, the Rhythm Game select menu, and even in the Rhythm Games (appearing at the end of \"The Clappy Trio\" and \"Rhythm Tweezers\", and even in the background during \"Karate Man\" once the player reaches 50% (three hearts or more) on the Rhythm Meter).\n\nOne year after the game's release, Sega approached the staff with an offer to co-develop an arcade version of the game for the Sega Naomi (under the title of \"Rhythm Tengoku: HD Remixed Edition\"), which was released September 20, 2007. This was due to the popularity of the game with its development staff. Osawa brought this offer to the attention of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata and others who approved of the idea. Yone had to make adjustments in the arcade version due to the differences between arcade mechanics and console mechanics. The HD Remixed Edition had remastered graphics (One rhythm game to have this change in the arcade version (most notably) was \"Karate Man\".) The HD Remixed Edition also featured an extra set based on Set 1, but at 150% speed and with remade music to match (Note: The vocals in the \"Karate Man: Tempo Up!\" extra stage are the same.)\n\nThe HD Remixed Edition also features multiplayer, even though the first main Rhythm Heaven game to have multiplayer was \"Rhythm Heaven Fever\" for the Wii. \"Rhythm Tengoku: HD Remixed Edition\" was also the only game licensed by Nintendo for the Sega Naomi, and it was one of the very few games developed by Nintendo and Sega respectively.\n\n\"Rhythm Tengoku\" has since received three sequels. The first was titled \"Rhythm Heaven\" for the Nintendo DS and was the first game in the series to be released outside of Japan. It uses touchscreen controls rather than buttons. The next game was titled \"Rhythm Heaven Fever\". It was released on the Wii, then it was re-released on the Wii U 5 years after the game came out on the Wii in Japan. It featured button controls and had unlockable extra stages that originate from this game. The games were titled \"Rhythm Paradise\" and \"Beat the Beat: Rhythm Paradise\" in Europe respectively.\n\nThe fourth game in the series is titled \"Rhythm Heaven Megamix\" and features games from \"Tengoku,\" \"Heaven\" and \"Fever\". Rhythm Heaven Megamix also includes some brand new games made specifically for it, including \"Catchy Tune\", \"LumBEARjack\", and \"Sumo Brothers\".\n\n\"Rhythm Tengoku\" and its sequels were the source of inspiration for independent video games such as \"Beat Sneak Bandit\" and \"Karateka Man\". Simon Flesser (designer of \"Beat Sneak Bandit\") cites \"Rhythm Tengoku\"s artistic design and mixture of beats and back beats as influences in its design.\n\n\"Rhythm Tengoku\" has received generally positive reception. While it did not receive much attention before its release it was very well received by consumers. The game received an Excellence Prize for Entertainment at the 10th annual Japan Media Arts Festival in 2006. Video game designer Frank Lantz listed \"Rhythm Tengoku\" amongst his five favourite games. Eurogamer's staff ranked it the 36th best game of 2006 while its readership voted it the 50th best. Tom of Eurogamer called it the best Game Boy Advance game of the year while he and fellow Eurogamer staff member James felt that it was at least on par with \"Elite Beat Agents\" (which also received positive reception). GameSpy's Andrew Alfonso praised its music, gameplay, and variety; he felt however that it was not long enough. GamesRadar staff included the game's drum lessons in its list of the \"20 Magical Nintendo moments\". A reviewer at \"Computer and Video Games\" (\"CVG\") gave praise to it for its \"WarioWare\"-like humour and its quality music but felt that the game lacked replay value and length. Kotaku's Brian Ashcraft called it \"one of the Game Boy Advance's most interesting (and enjoyable) titles\". GamesRadar's Shane Patterson recommended it for people who liked \"WarioWare\"s art aesthetics and music. \"CVG\"s Andy Kelly included the Bon Odori song in his list of the 100 best video game themes ever. He called it \"insanely catchy.\" Eurogamer's Chris Schilling used \"Rhythm Tengoku\" as an example of a game that would be overlooked if the Game Boy Advance was region-locked. 1UP.com's Bob Mackey called its lack of an American release \"one of the great Game Boy Advance injustices of 2006\". \"Wired\"s Chris Kohler noted that \"Rhythm Tengoku\" (as well as other games) should be released on the Virtual Console or WiiWare services, but it was not.\n\n"

                "PlayStation (console)\n\nThe PlayStation (officially abbreviated to PS, and commonly known as the PS1 or PSX) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. The console was released on 3 December in Japan, 9 September 1995 in North America, 29 September 1995 in Europe, and for 15 November 1995 in Australia. The console was the first of the PlayStation lineup of home video game consoles. It primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn as part of the fifth generation of video game consoles.\n\nThe PlayStation is the first \"computer entertainment platform\" to ship 100 million units, which it had reached 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. In 2000, a redesigned, \"slim\" version called the PS one was released, replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor, the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with the PlayStation's DualShock controller and games, was announced in 1999 and launched in 2000. The last PS one units were sold in winter 2004 before it was officially discontinued in 2006, for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch 11 years earlier. Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of both the PlayStation and PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 – over 11 years after it had been released, and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe inception of what would become the released PlayStation dates back to 1986 with a joint venture between Nintendo and Sony. Nintendo had already produced floppy disk technology to complement cartridges, in the form of the Family Computer Disk System, and wanted to continue this complementary storage strategy for the Super Famicom. Nintendo approached Sony to develop a CD-ROM add-on, tentatively titled the \"Play Station\" or \"SNES-CD\". A contract was signed, and work began. Nintendo's choice of Sony was due to a prior dealing: Ken Kutaragi, the person who would later be dubbed \"The Father of the PlayStation\", was the individual who had sold Nintendo on using the Sony SPC-700 processor for use as the eight-channel ADPCM sound set in the Super Famicom/SNES console through an impressive demonstration of the processor's capabilities.\n\nKutaragi was nearly fired by Sony because he was originally working with Nintendo on the side without Sony's knowledge (while still employed by Sony). It was then-CEO, Norio Ohga, who recognised the potential in Kutaragi's chip, and in working with Nintendo on the project. Ohga kept Kutaragi on at Sony, and it was not until Nintendo cancelled the project that Sony decided to develop its own console.\n\nSony also planned to develop a Super NES-compatible, Sony-branded console, but one which would be more of a home entertainment system playing both Super NES cartridges and a new CD format which Sony would design. This was also to be the format used in SNES-CDs, giving a large degree of control to Sony despite Nintendo's leading position in the video gaming market.\n\nThe product, dubbed the \"Play Station\" was to be announced at the May 1991 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). However, when Nintendo's Hiroshi Yamauchi read the original 1988 contract between Sony and Nintendo, he realised that the earlier agreement essentially handed Sony complete control over any and all titles written on the SNES CD-ROM format. Yamauchi decided that the contract was totally unacceptable and he secretly cancelled all plans for the joint Nintendo-Sony SNES CD attachment. Instead of announcing a partnership between Sony and Nintendo, at 9 am the day of the CES, Nintendo chairman Howard Lincoln stepped onto the stage and revealed that Nintendo was now allied with Philips, and Nintendo was planning on abandoning all the previous work Nintendo and Sony had accomplished. Lincoln and Minoru Arakawa had, unbeknownst to Sony, flown to Philips' global headquarters in the Netherlands and formed an alliance of a decidedly different nature—one that would give Nintendo total control over its licenses on Philips machines.\n\nAfter the collapse of the joint-Nintendo project, Sony briefly considered allying itself with Sega to produce a stand-alone console. The Sega CEO at the time, Tom Kalinske, took the proposal to Sega's Board of Directors in Tokyo, who promptly vetoed the idea. Kalinske, in a 2013 interview recalled them saying \"that’s a stupid idea, Sony doesn't know how to make hardware. They don’t know how to make software either. Why would we want to do this?\". This prompted Sony into halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what it had developed so far with both Nintendo and Sega to make it into a complete console based upon the Super Famicom. As a result, Nintendo filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in US federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of what was originally christened the \"Play Station\", on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction and, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the aforementioned brand new game system was revealed. However, it is theorised that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.\n\nBy the end of 1992, Sony and Nintendo reached a deal whereby the \"Play Station\" would still have a port for SNES games, but Nintendo would own the rights and receive the bulk of the profits from the games, and the SNES would continue to use the Sony-designed audio chip. However, Sony decided in early 1993 to begin reworking the \"Play Station\" concept to target a new generation of hardware and software. As part of this process the SNES cartridge port was dropped and the space between the names \"Play Station\" was removed becoming \"PlayStation\", thereby ending Nintendo's involvement with the project. According to a Sony engineer, all work on the console from the time of the partnership with Nintendo was eventually scrapped, and the PlayStation design was restarted from scratch. Sony's North American division, known as Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), originally planned to market the new console under the alternative branding \"PSX\" following the negative feedback regarding \"PlayStation\" in focus group studies. Early advertising prior to the console's launch in North America referenced PSX, but the term was scrapped before launch.\n\nAccording to SCE's producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, there was uncertainty over whether the console should primarily focus on 2D sprite graphics or 3D polygon graphics. It was only after witnessing the success of Sega's \"Virtua Fighter\" in Japanese arcades that \"the direction of the PlayStation became instantly clear\" and 3D polygon graphics became the console's primary focus.\n\nUnlike Sega, Sony had no arcade division from which to draw console-selling ports, or any in-house development to speak of. To solve this problem, Sony acquired studios such as Psygnosis and signed exclusivity deals with hot arcade publishers Namco and Williams Entertainment.\n\nIndustry hype for the console spread quickly, and in early 1994 \"GamePro\" reported that \"many video game companies [feel] that in the near future, the video game platforms to contend with will be from Nintendo, Sega... and \"Sony\".\" [emphasis in original]\n\nThe PlayStation was released in Japan on 3 December 1994, North America on 9 September 1995, Europe on 29 September 1995, and Oceania on 15 November 1995. The console was an immediate success in Japan, selling over 2 million units within its first six months on the market. In the US, 800,000 were sold in 1995 (i.e. four months on the market), giving the PlayStation a commanding lead over the other consoles of its generation, though it was still being outsold by the older Super NES and Sega Genesis. The launch price in the US market was US$299 and Sony enjoyed a very successful launch with titles of almost every genre, including \"Battle Arena Toshinden\", \"Warhawk\", \"Air Combat\", \"Philosoma\", \"Ridge Racer\" and \"Rayman\". Unlike the vast majority of gaming consoles of the time, the PlayStation did not include a pack-in game at launch. Sony reported strong software sales in the months following launch, with an attach rate of 4:1.\n\nThen Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, preferred Sony's console to the competition from Sega, saying \"Our game designer likes the Sony machine.\" Microsoft would later compete with Sony with its Xbox console. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" would score the PlayStation console a 19 out of 40. The staff of \"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation a few weeks after its North American launch. They commented that while the CPU is \"fairly average\", the supplementary custom hardware such as the GPU and sound processor is stunningly powerful. They particularly praised its focus on 3D, and also remarked positively on the comfort of the controller and the convenience of the memory cards. Giving the system 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, they concluded, \"To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war.\" An advertisement slogan used in marketing the console was, \"\"Live in your world. Play in ours.\"\" It is stylised as, \"LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS.\" Another briefly used advertising campaign was titled \"You Are Not Ready\" or \"U R NOT .\" Sony's CCO Lee Clow explained that \"it's the ultimate challenge. Gamers love to respond to that tag line and say 'Bullshit. Let me show you how ready I am.'\"\n\nOne of the key factors in the PlayStation's success was Sony's approach to third party developers. Whereas Sega and Nintendo took an isolationist approach, focusing on first party development while generally leaving third party developers to their own devices, Sony took efforts to streamline game production by providing a range of programming libraries which were constantly updated online, organising third party technical support teams, and in some cases giving direct development support to third party companies.\n\nWhile the Sega Saturn was marketed towards 18 to 34 year-olds, the PlayStation was marketed roughly, but not exclusively, towards 12 to 24 year-olds. Both Sega and Sony reasoned that because younger players typically look up to older, more experienced players, they would be drawn in by advertising targeted at teens and adults. Additionally, Sony found that adults are best targeted by advertising geared towards teenagers; according to Lee Clow, \"One of the first things we resolved early on was that everyone is 17 when they play videogames. The young people look up to the best gamer who is usually a little older and more practiced and talented. Then there are people who start working and grow up, but when they go into their room and sit down with their videogames, they're regressing and becoming 17 again.\" Initially PlayStation demographics were skewed towards adults, but after the first price drop the audience began broadening.\n\nIn 1996, the high demand for PlayStation games contributed to Sony's decision to expand their CD production facilities in Springfield, Oregon, increasing their monthly output from 4 million discs to 6.5 million discs. PlayStation sales were running at twice the rate of Saturn sales, and dramatically increased their lead when both the PlayStation and Saturn dropped in price to $199 in May, in large part because some retailers (such as KB Toys) did not stock the Saturn. The PlayStation was outselling the Saturn at a similar ratio in Europe as well during 1996.\n\nThe PlayStation took more time to achieve dominance in Japan. After the PlayStation and Saturn had been on the market for nearly two years, Sony Computer Entertainment president Teruhisa Tokunaka said the competition between them was still \"very close\", and that neither console had yet held the lead in sales for any meaningful length of time.\n\nIn addition to playing games, select PlayStation models have the ability to play audio CDs; further, Asian model SCPH-5903 can also play Video CDs. Like most domestic CD players, the PlayStation has the ability to shuffle the playback order, play the songs in a programmed order, and repeat one song or the entire disc. Later PlayStation models can utilise a music visualisation function called SoundScope. This function, as well as a memory card manager, can be accessed by starting the console either without inserting a game or keeping the CD tray open, thereby accessing a GUI for the PlayStation BIOS.\n\nThe actual GUI for both PS one and PlayStation differ graphically depending on firmware versions: the original PlayStation GUI had a dark blue background with rainbow graffiti used as buttons; the early PAL PlayStation and PS one GUI had a grey blocked background with 2 icons in the middle, different on each version. If the CD lid is closed with a game inside at any time while at the menu, the game will immediately start.\n\nAs of 30 June 2007, a total of 7,918 software titles have been released worldwide (counting games released in multiple regions as separate titles). As of 31 March 2007, the cumulative software shipment was at 962 million units. The last game for the system released in the United States was \"FIFA Football 2005\". However, several reprinted and remastered editions were released in later years. \"Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection\" was released on 26 July 2007, which contained \"Metal Gear Solid\" in the original PlayStation format. In 2011, Capcom released the \"Resident Evil 15th Anniversary Collection\", and in 2012, Square Enix released the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" in Japan containing all of the \"Final Fantasy\" titles, a majority of which were also in the original PlayStation format.\n\nThe \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons on most of the Japanese PlayStation games are reversed in their North American and European releases. In Japan, the button (\"maru\", right) is used as the OK button, while the button (\"batsu\", wrong) is used as Cancel. North American and European releases have the button or the buttons as the OK button, while either the or the button is used as Cancel (some titles like \"Xenogears\" used the button for cancelling actions and selections, along with the PlayStation 2 system browser and the XrossMedia Bar on the PlayStation 3 and the PSP). However, a few games, such as Square's \"Vagrant Story\", \"Final Fantasy VII\" (which used the button as cancel) and \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", Namco's \"Ridge Racer Type 4\", and Konami's \"Metal Gear Solid\", use the Japanese button layout worldwide. Some other games, like the Japanese version of \"Gran Turismo\", had used different controls that are similar to North American games. These Japanese button layouts still apply to other PlayStation consoles. This is because in the early years Sony America (SCEA), Sony Europe (SCEE), and Sony Japan (SCEJ) had different development and testing documents (TRCs) for their respective territories.\n\nHardware designer Ken Kutaragi stated, \"The technology came from an original idea to create a synthesizer for graphics, something that takes a basic graphic and then adds various effects to it quickly and easily.\"\n\nWith the early units, particularly the early 1000 models, many gamers experience skipping full-motion video or physical \"ticking\" noises coming from their PlayStation units. The problem appears to have come from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments—the plastic mouldings inside the console can warp very slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly. The solution is to ensure that the console sits on a surface which dissipates heat efficiently in a well vented area, or raise the unit up slightly from its resting surface.\nThe first batch of PlayStations used a KSM-440AAM laser unit whose case and all movable parts were completely made out of plastic. Over time, friction causes the plastic lens sled rail to wear out—usually unevenly. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerated wear because of the additional heat, which makes the plastic even more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, one side of the lens sled can become so worn that the laser can tilt, no longer pointing directly at the CD. This would cause data read errors and games would no longer load. One common fix is to turn the PlayStation upside down, making the lens sled rest on the unworn top rails. Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the sled out of die-cast metal and placing the laser unit slightly farther away from the power supply on later models of the PlayStation.\n\nDue to an engineering oversight, the PlayStation does not produce a proper signal on several older models of televisions, causing the display to flicker or bounce around the screen. Since only a small percentage of PlayStation owners used such televisions, Sony decided not to change the console design, and instead gave consumers the option of sending their PlayStation unit to a Sony service centre to have an official modchip installed, which would allow it to play on older televisions.\n\nPrior to the PlayStation, the reproduction of copyrighted material for game consoles was restricted to either enthusiasts with exceptional technical ability, or others that had access to CD manufacturers. However, the increased availability of cheap CD burners at this time led Sony to modify the shape of the first portion of the data track on PlayStation formatted discs: A normal data track follows a smooth spiral path around a disc, whereas the modified portion of the data track followed wavy spiral path. As a result, any discs that did not contain the modified data track such as CD-R copies or standard pirated discs could not boot on the console. This modified portion of the data path was used to encode the disc \"region\", for example a disc destined for distribution in the NTSC-U/C region would encode the letters \"SCEA\"; in Europe, \"SCEE\"; in Japan, \"SCEI\". This served as copy protection as well as region-locking.\n\nThe installation of an unofficial modchip allowed the PlayStation to play games recorded on a regular CD-R. Since it worked by injecting the correct region data into the stream it also allowed the console to play games from any region.\n\nSeveral open source modchips were designed using readily available electronic parts, by the end of the system's life cycle almost anyone with minimal soldering experience was able to perform these modifications. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using free, unofficial tools, as well as the reproduction of original discs. With the introduction of such devices the console became very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers alike, as well as those who merely wished to protect the lifespan of their lawful, original discs. In 1996 Sony filed lawsuits against a number of companies which advertised such modchips and pirated games, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\nSome companies (notably Datel) did manage to produce discs that booted on unmodified retail units while using special equipment.\n\nInstead of a D-pad, which is used for directional movement in nearly every other console then on the market, the PlayStation controller uses four directional buttons.\n\nPeripherals released for the PlayStation include memory cards, the PlayStation Mouse, the PlayStation Analog Joystick, the PlayStation Link Cable, the Multiplayer Adapter (a four-player multitap), the Memory Drive (a disk drive for 3.5 inch floppy disks), the GunCon (a light gun), and the Glasstron (a monoscopic head-mounted display).\n\n\nThe PlayStation went through a number of variants during its production run. From an external perspective, the most notable change between variants was the reduction in the number of connectors. The RCA jacks were removed in the first revision, and the Parallel I/O port was removed in the final revision.\n\nSony marketed a development kit for hobbyists and developers also known as the Net Yaroze, which launched in June 1996 in Japan and in 1997 in other countries. Sold only through an ordering service, the development console came with the necessary documentation and software to program PlayStation games and applications.\n\nOn 7 July 2000, Sony released the PS one, a smaller, redesigned version of the original PlayStation. It was the highest-selling console through the end of the year, outselling all other consoles - including Sony's own PlayStation 2. A total of 28.15 million PS one units had been sold by the time it was discontinued in March 2006.\nA version of the PS one included a LCD screen, referred to as the \"Combo pack\".\n\nSony's successor to the PlayStation is the PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with its predecessor in that it can play almost every original PlayStation game.\n\nThe third generation of the PlayStation, the PlayStation 3, was launched on 11 November 2006 in Japan, 17 November 2006 in North America, and 23 March 2007 in Europe. The backward compatibility of the PlayStation 3 differs by model. The newer PlayStation 3 models, like the Slim, are only backwards compatible with original PlayStation games; however, the older 60 GB model (the first PS3 model released) will play PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games through either having the Emotion Engine and/or Reality Synthesizer and emulating one or the other. While PlayStation 3 games are not region-locked, PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games are only playable on PlayStation 3 consoles from the same region.\n\nA third successor, the PlayStation 4, was announced by Sony on 20 February 2013 and was released in the US on 15 November, Europe on 29 November 2013, and Japan and Asia on 22 February 2014. However, it is backwards compatible with select PS3 Games through a download service dubbed PlayStation Now.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable, or PSP, is a handheld game console first released in late 2004. The PSP is capable of playing PlayStation games downloaded via Sony's online store, and can also play any PlayStation game by using the PlayStation 3's remote play feature while the disc is in the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe successor to the PSP, the PlayStation Vita, was introduced as a part of the 8th generation of video game consoles, and is backwards compatible with original PSP as well as original PlayStation games downloaded from the PlayStation Store.\n\nSony Computer Entertainment was an upstart in the video game industry in late 1994, as the early 1990s were dominated by Nintendo and Sega. Nintendo had been the clear leader in the video game industry since the introduction of the NES in 1985 and the Nintendo 64 was initially expected to maintain this position for Nintendo. The PlayStation's target audience included 15- to 17-year-olds who were not the primary focus of Nintendo, and 18- to 29-year-olds, who represented the first generation to grow up playing video games. By the late 1990s, Sony became a highly regarded console brand due to the PlayStation, with a significant lead over second-place Nintendo, while Sega was relegated to a distant third.\n\nThe PlayStation's lead in installed base and developer support paved the way for the success of the next-generation PlayStation 2, which overcame an early launch from the Sega Dreamcast and then fended off competition from the Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube.\n\nThe success of the PlayStation is widely believed to have influenced the demise of the cartridge-based home console. While not the first system to utilise an optical disc format, it is the first highly successful one, and ended up going head-to-head with the last major home console to rely on proprietary cartridges—the Nintendo 64. Sony Computer Entertainment president Teruhisa Tokunaka remarked in 1996: \n\nNintendo was very public about its scepticism toward using CDs and DVDs to store games, citing longer load times and durability issues. It was widely speculated that the company was even more concerned with the proprietary cartridge format's ability to help enforce copy protection, given its substantial reliance on licensing and exclusive titles for its revenue. Piracy was rampant on the PlayStation due to the relative ease of the installation of a modchip, allowing the PlayStation to play games region free and/or recorded on a regular CD-R, making the console very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers.\n\nThe increasing complexity of games (in content, graphics, and sound) pushed cartridges to their storage limits and this gradually turned off some third-party developers. Part of the CD format's appeal to publishers was that they could be produced at a significantly lower cost and offered more production flexibility to meet demand. As a result, some third-party developers switched to the PlayStation, such as Squaresoft, whose \"Final Fantasy VII\", and Enix (later merged with Squaresoft to create Square Enix), whose \"Dragon Quest VII\" titles were initially pre-planned for the N64; while some who remained released fewer games to the Nintendo 64 (Konami, releasing only thirteen N64 games but over fifty on the PlayStation). While new games were coming out rapidly for the PlayStation, new Nintendo 64 game releases were less frequent and that system's biggest successes were developed by either Nintendo itself or by second-parties, such as Rare. The lower production costs also allowed publishers an additional source of profit: budget-priced reissues of titles which had already recouped their development costs.\n",

                "Cytus\n\nCytus is a rhythm game developed by Rayark Games, an independent game developer in Taiwan. It was first released on the iOS platform on January 12, 2012. The game was later released on Android on August 7, 2012. A port for PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Mobile, titled Cytus: Lambda, was released on June 26, 2013. An arcade version titled Cytus: Omega in collaboration with Capcom is revealed at JAEPO in February 2015 and is set for location testing in July 2015.\n\nThe name \"Cytus\" is taken from Cocytus, the Greek mythological river of wailing or lamentation. \"Cytus\" features a story plot that is carried through its 10 main chapters as well as a prologue. The story revolves around the protagonist, Vanessa, who lives in a 22nd-century world where robots with human memories are the only remaining sentient beings while living humans are killed by a mutant virus. Due to limited memory space, human emotions are stored in the form of music in \"Cytus\", and by playing the songs, the robots are able to revive their human emotions. The plot features the disaster and the protagonist's struggle with identity. The story is told in-game through various cut-scenes that are unique to the chapter title songs; in comparison, the other individual songs within each chapter are at most only marginally relevant to the plot, except for a limited few.\n\nEven though it is a mobile game, it needs high specification. It requires 950MB of storage space. (9.X version). The data of the songs not purchased have to be downloaded together even though it’s not needed. And after the update to Cytus 10.0, the storage amount increased to 1.54GB in iOS.\n\nThe game needs at least iOS 7.0 on the basis of 2016/09/06 Cytus 10.0 update. An iPhone must be at least iPhone 5, and it will not work under iOS 7. If older versions of the game were previously installed, then it can be played normally. This app is a 64-bit app, which means it is also compatible with iOS 11 and later.\n\nThe game needs at least 600MB of storage and 1GHz of CPU and 140MB of relaxation in memory of 512MB RAM on Android 2.2. Playing the game on power save mode is almost impossible. Specifically, in Galaxy S3, auto haptic is released.\n\nThe game was released on 2013/6/26. It is a Play Station game, and can be downloaded in PSM store (A store for PS games). The game is optimized well, but it takes a long time to load. 0.5 seconds~ 3 seconds is taken to load, affected by the environment of the Play Station.\nThe storage amount is 599MB (Version 5.00). Almost nothing is different from the phone game Cytus. The price is 1,234￥(Japan), 9.69￡(England), 18.95 (Australia Dollar), 11.99 (American Dollar, Canadian Dollar, Euro). One of the uncomfortable parts of the game is update. The game cannot be updated by just downloading the patch file. The whole game file has to be downloaded again.\n\nThe game was revealed in 2015 February. It was revealed in the event ‘crossbeats REV.’ However, the game isn’t released yet. It isn’t much different from the phone game cytus, but it shows the note that has to be touched first. Also, notes that have to be touched at the same time have small horns to be distinguished easily.\n\nThe game was revealed in 2015 December. It was revealed at RayarkCon 2015. As of January 18, 2018, the game is now available to the public. Cytus II features similar game mechanics to the previous title.\n\nThe main gameplay of \"Cytus\" features the Active Scan Line, a black line that move up and down across the screen. The player taps circular objects, referred to as Notes, as the Active Scan Line passes over them, following the music.\n\nThree types of Notes are used. The Click Note, a single circular note, requires tapping the object in time. The Drag Note, a continuous track of notes, requires dragging along the track. The Hold Note, a note with an extended ribbon meter, requires holding over the note until the meter is filled. Notes to be hit as the line rises are colored blue and purple, while those as the line drops are colored yellow and green.\n\nEach Note is judged by the accuracy to be either Perfect, Good, Bad or Miss. The better the accuracy, the higher score is given. The maximum score is 1,000,000, and a minimum of 700,000 is required to clear a stage. Basic score is 900,000, the score is divided equally into every note. Combo score is 100,000, the score is proportional to square of the maximum combo. Also, the maximum TP score is 100, and TP Perfect, NM Perfect, Good, Bad, Miss is calculated 100%, 70%, 30%, 0%, 0%, respectively. After a stage ends, various metrics are provided to show the player's performance, including score, TP, a letter grade, and numbers of hits in each type of judgement. Score system is referred: Fail below 700,000, C below 800,000, B below 900,000, A below 950,000, S below 1,000,000, Million Master at 1,000,000.\n\n\"Cytus\" includes more than 100 songs available for play in the game, spanning a variety of genres including pop music, trance music and drum and bass. The music is composed and performed by independent composers and artists from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. Vocaloid engines are also used. A number of songs also has alternate version(s) in addition to the normal version. These can be called upon by interacting with the song artwork in the song selection screen. Gestures used includes tapping, swiping and holding at a specific timing and location.\n\n\"Cytus\" also includes a series of songs in image of the overarching plot, collectively named Cytus: Alive, added in version 6.0 in July 2014. Unlike normal songs, \"Cytus: Alive\" songs contains added plot animation during gameplay.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll composed by VGO(Video Game Orchestra).\n\n\n\nAll composed by Ice & gaQden. tap \"L\" silhouette to play insane mode each song.\n\n\nAll composed by Night Keepers, except Times Difference War.\n\n\n\"Cytus\" is available through the Apple App Store and Google Play. The full game charges a base price plus optional in-app purchases for players to purchase additional chapters of playable songs.\n\nThe release on Google Play is free but features a cooldown timer before starting each song. The cooldown will be removed when the full price is paid.\n\nThe PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Mobile port \"Cytus: Lambda\" includes the then-exclusive chapter Prologue: Live, otherwise identical to its smartphone releases. A teaser video was released onto YouTube prior to release on June 7, 2013.\n\nRayark Games announced the Million Downloads Plan () in the wake of \"illegal piracy harming the sales figures of \"Cytus\"\". Starting from Version 2.0.0, a 10-song chapter will be made available to all players for free for each 100,000 paid downloads achieved, up to a million paid downloads or ten chapters. The plan is completed with Version 8.0, released in July 2015, opening ten chapters for free, including the special Chapter Million featuring remixes of past songs.\n\n\nMultiple \"Cytus\" soundtracks have been released both on iTunes and as physical CD, featuring playable music and background composition from the game. Cytus -Prologue-, was released on April 1, 2012, Cytus -Hindsight- on December 10, 2013 and Cytus -Foresight- on December 28, 2013. A story album called Cytus -Alive- has also been released on August 20, 2012; the album features songs composed by Sta and Cranky with the same names as the ten chapters of the game. Each song corresponds to each chapter in the story plot.\n\nCode: Cytus () is a multimedia video game music stage production based on the story of \"Cytus\", produced by Divertimento Media () as commissioned by Quanta Arts Foundation (). The production ran four shows in November 2014 in Taiwan.\n\n\n\n\n"

                "PlayStation\n\nThe original console in the series was the first video game console to ship 100 million units, 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. Its successor, the PlayStation 2, was released in 2000. The PlayStation 2 is the best-selling home console to date, having reached over 155 million units sold as of December 28, 2012. Sony's next console, the PlayStation 3, was released in 2006 and has sold over 80 million consoles worldwide as of November 2013. Sony's latest console, the PlayStation 4, was released in 2013, selling 1 million consoles in its first 24 hours on sale, becoming the fastest selling console in history.\n\nThe first handheld game console in the PlayStation series, the PlayStation Portable or PSP, sold a total of 80 million units worldwide by November 2013. Its successor, the PlayStation Vita, which launched in Japan on December 17, 2011 and in most other major territories in February 2012, had sold over 4 million units by January 2013. PlayStation TV is a microconsole and a non-portable variant of the PlayStation Vita handheld game console. Other hardware released as part of the PlayStation series includes the PSX, a digital video recorder which was integrated with the PlayStation and PlayStation 2, though it was short lived due to its high price and was never released outside Japan, as well as a Sony Bravia television set which has an integrated PlayStation 2. The main series of controllers utilized by the PlayStation series is the DualShock, which is a line of vibration-feedback gamepad having sold 28 million controllers as of June 28, 2008.\n\nThe PlayStation Network is an online service with over 110 million users worldwide (as of July 2013). It comprises an online virtual market, the PlayStation Store, which allows the purchase and download of games and various forms of multimedia, a subscription-based online service known as PlayStation Plus and a social gaming networking service called PlayStation Home, which had over 41 million users worldwide at the time of its closure in March 2015. PlayStation Mobile (formerly PlayStation Suite) is a software framework that provides PlayStation content on mobile devices. Version 1.xx supports both PlayStation Vita, PlayStation TV and certain devices that run the Android operating system, whereas version 2.00 released in 2014 would only target PlayStation Vita and (optionally) PlayStation TV. Content set to be released under the framework consist of only original PlayStation games currently.\n\n7th generation PlayStation products also use the XrossMediaBar, which is an award-winning graphical user interface. A touch screen-based user interface called LiveArea was launched for the PlayStation Vita, which integrates social networking elements into the interface. Additionally, the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 consoles also featured support for Linux-based operating systems; Linux for PlayStation 2 and OtherOS respectively, though this has since been discontinued. The series has also been known for its numerous marketing campaigns, the latest of which being the \"Greatness Awaits\" commercials in the United States.\n\nThe series also has a strong line-up of first-party titles due to Sony Interactive Entertainment Worldwide Studios, a group of fifteen first-party developers owned by Sony Interactive Entertainment which are dedicated to developing first-party games for the series. In addition, the series features various budget re-releases of titles by Sony with different names for each region; these include the Greatest Hits, Platinum, Essentials, Favorites and The Best ranges of titles.\n\nPlayStation was the brainchild of Ken Kutaragi, a Sony executive who had just finished managing one of the company's hardware engineering divisions at that time and would later be dubbed as \"The Father of the PlayStation\".\n\nThe console's origins date back to 1988 where it was originally a joint project between Nintendo and Sony to create a CD-ROM for the Super Famicom. Although Nintendo denied the existence of the Sony deal as late as March 1991, Sony revealed a Super Famicom with a built-in CD-ROM drive, that incorporated Green Book technology or CD-i, called \"Play Station\" (also known as SNES-CD) at the Consumer Electronics Show in June 1991. However, a day after the announcement at CES, Nintendo announced that it would be breaking its partnership with Sony, opting to go with Philips instead but using the same technology. The deal was broken by Nintendo after they were unable to come to an agreement on how revenue would be split between the two companies. The breaking of the partnership infuriated Sony President Norio Ohga, who responded by appointing Kutaragi with the responsibility of developing the PlayStation project to rival Nintendo.\n\nAt that time, negotiations were still on-going between Nintendo and Sony, with Nintendo offering Sony a \"non-gaming role\" regarding their new partnership with Philips. This proposal was swiftly rejected by Kutaragi who was facing increasing criticism over his work with regard to entering the video game industry from within Sony. Negotiations officially ended in May 1992 and in order to decide the fate of the PlayStation project, a meeting was held in June 1992, consisting of Sony President Ohga, PlayStation Head Kutaragi and several senior members of Sony's board. At the meeting, Kutaragi unveiled a proprietary CD-ROM-based system he had been working on which involved playing video games with 3D graphics to the board. Eventually, Sony President Ohga decided to retain the project after being reminded by Kutaragi of the humiliation he suffered from Nintendo. Nevertheless, due to strong opposition from a majority present at the meeting as well as widespread internal opposition to the project by the older generation of Sony executives, Kutaragi and his team had to be shifted from Sony's headquarters to Sony Music, a completely separate financial entity owned by Sony, so as to retain the project and maintain relationships with Philips for the MMCD development project (which helped lead to the creation of the DVD).\n\nAccording to SCE's producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, there was uncertainty over whether the console should primarily focus on 2D sprite graphics or 3D polygon graphics. It was only after witnessing the success of Sega's \"Virtua Fighter\" in Japanese arcades that \"the direction of the PlayStation became instantly clear\" and 3D polygon graphics became the console's primary focus.\n\nAt Sony Music Entertainment, Kutaragi worked closely with Shigeo Maruyama, the CEO of Sony Music, and with Akira Sato to form Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. (SCEI) on November 16, 1993. A building block of SCEI was its initial partnership with Sony Music which helped SCEI attract creative talent to the company as well as assist SCEI in manufacturing, marketing and producing discs, something that Sony Music had been doing with Music Discs. The final two key members of SCEI were Terry Tokunaka, the President of SCEI from Sony's headquarters, and Olaf Olafsson. Olafsson was CEO and president of New York-based Sony Interactive Entertainment which was the mother company for the 1994-founded Sony Computer Entertainment of America (SCEA).\n\nThe PlayStation project, SCEI's first official project, was finally given the green light by Sony executives in 1993 after a few years of development. Also in 1993, Phil Harrison, who would later become President of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, was recruited into SCEI to attract developers and publishers to produce games for their new PlayStation platform.\n\n\"Computer Gaming World\" in March 1994 reported a rumor that the \"Sony PS-X\" would be released in Japan \"before the end of this year and will retail for less than $400\". After a demonstration of Sony's distribution plan as well as tech demos of its new console to game publishers and developers in a hotel in Tokyo in 1994, numerous developers began to approach PlayStation. Two of whom later became major partners were Electronic Arts in the West and Namco in Japan. One of the factors which attracted developers to the platform was the use of a 3D-capable, CD-ROM-based console which was much cheaper and easier to manufacture for in comparison to Nintendo's rival console, which used cartridge systems. The project eventually hit Japanese stores in December 1994 and gained massive sales due to its lower price point than its competitor, the Sega Saturn. Popularity of the console spread after its release worldwide in North America and Europe.\n\nThe original PlayStation, released in Japan on December 3, , was the first of the ubiquitous PlayStation series of console and hand-held game devices. It has included successor consoles and upgrades including the Net Yaroze (a special black PlayStation with tools and instructions to program PlayStation games and applications), \"PS one\" (a smaller version of the original) and the PocketStation (a handheld which enhances PlayStation games and also acts as a memory card). It was part of the fifth generation of video game consoles competing against the Sega Saturn and the Nintendo 64. By December 2003, the PlayStation and PS one had shipped a combined total of 102.49 million units, eventually becoming the first video game console to sell 120 million units.\n\nReleased on July 7, , concurrently with its successor the PlayStation 2, the PS one was a considerably smaller, redesigned version of the original PlayStation video game console. The PS one went on to outsell all other consoles, including its successor, throughout the remainder of the year. It featured two main changes from its predecessor, the first being a cosmetic change to the console and the second being the home menu's Graphical User Interface; a variation of the GUI previously used only on PAL consoles up to that point. \n\nReleased in , 15 months after the Dreamcast and a year before its other competitors, the Xbox and the Nintendo GameCube, the PlayStation 2 is part of the sixth generation of video game consoles, and is backwards-compatible with most original PlayStation games. Like its predecessor, it has received a slimmer redesign. It is the most successful home console in the world, having sold over 155 million units as of December 28, 2012. On November 29, 2005, the PS2 became the fastest game console to reach 100 million units shipped, accomplishing the feat within 5 years and 9 months from its launch. This achievement occurred faster than its predecessor, the PlayStation, which took \"9 years and 6 months since launch\" to reach the same figure. PlayStation 2 shipments in Japan ended on December 28, 2012. \"The Guardian\" reported on January 4, 2013 that PS2 production had ended worldwide, but studies showed that many people all around the world still own one even if it is no longer in use. PlayStation 2 has been ranked as the best selling console of all time as of 2015.\n\nReleased in , four years after the launch of the original PlayStation 2, the PlayStation 2 Slimline was the first major redesign of the PlayStation 2. Compared to its predecessor, the Slimline was smaller, thinner, quieter and also included a built-in Ethernet port (in some markets it also has an integrated modem). In , Sony began shipping a revision of the Slimline which was lighter than the original Slimline together with a lighter AC adapter. In , Sony released yet another revision of the Slimline which had an overhauled internal design incorporating the power supply into the console itself like the original PlayStation 2 resulting in a further reduced total weight of the console.\nReleased on November 17, 2006 in North America, the PlayStation 3 is a seventh generation game console from Sony. It competes with the Microsoft Xbox 360 and the Nintendo Wii. The PS3 is the first console in the series to introduce the use of motion-sensing technology through its Sixaxis wireless controller. The console also incorporates a Blu-ray Disc player and features high-definition resolution. The PS3 was originally offered with either a 20 GB or 60 GB hard drive, but over the years its capacity increased in increments available up to 500 GB. The PlayStation 3 has sold over 80 million consoles worldwide as of November 2013.\n\nLike its predecessors, the PlayStation 3 was re-released in as a \"slim\" model. The redesigned model is 33% smaller, 36% lighter, and consumes 34% to 45% less power than previous models. In addition, it features a redesigned cooling system and a smaller Cell processor which was moved to a 45nm manufacturing process. It sold in excess of a million units within its first 3 weeks on sale. The redesign also features support for CEC (more commonly referred to by its manufacturer brandings of BraviaSync, VIERA Link, EasyLink and others) which allows control of the console over HDMI by using the remote control as the controller. The PS3 slim also runs quieter and is cooler than previous models due to its 45 nm Cell. The PS3 Slim no longer has the \"main power\" switch (similar to PlayStation 2 slim), like the previous PS3 models, which was located at the back of the console. It was officially released on September 1, 2009 in North America and Europe and on September 3, 2009 in Japan, Australia and New Zealand.\n\nIn 2012, Sony revealed a new \"Super Slim\" PlayStation 3. The new console, with a completely redesigned case which has a sliding door covering the disc drive (which has been moved to the top of the console), is 4.3 pounds, almost three pounds lighter than the previous \"slim\" model. The console comes with either 12GB flash memory or a 250GB, 500GB hard drive. Several bundles which include a Super Slim PS3 and a selection of games are available. \n\nThe PlayStation 4 (PS4) is the latest video game console from Sony Computer Entertainment announced at a press conference on February 20, 2013. In the meeting, Sony revealed some hardware specifications of the new console. The eighth-generation system, launched in the fourth quarter of 2013, introduced the x86 architecture to the PlayStation series. According to lead system architect, Mark Cerny, development on the PlayStation 4 began as early as 2008. PlayStation Europe CEO Jim Ryan emphasized in 2011 that Sony wanted to avoid launching the next-generation console behind the competition.\n\nAmong the new applications and services, Sony introduced the PlayStation App, allowing PS4 owners to turn smartphones and tablets into a second screen to enhance gameplay. The company also plans to debut PlayStation Now game streaming service, powered by technology from Gaikai. By incorporating a share button on the new controller and making it possible to view in-game content being streamed live from friends, Sony plans to place more focus on social gameplay as well. The PlayStation 4 was first released in North America on November 15, 2013. \n\nPlayStation 4 Slim (officially marketed simply as PlayStation 4 or PS4) was unveiled on September 7, 2016. It is a revision of the original PS4 hardware with a streamlined form factor. The new casing is 40% smaller, and carries a rounded body with a matte finish on the top of the console rather than a two-tone finish. The two USB ports on the front have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was also removed. It ships with a minor update to the DualShock 4 controller, with the light bar visible through the top of the touchpad and dark matte grey coloured exterior instead of a partially shiny black. The PS4 Slim was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price point as the original PS4 model. Its model number is CUH-2000.\n\nPlayStation 4 Pro or PS4 Pro for short (originally announced under the codename Neo) was unveiled on September 7, 2016. Its model number is CUH-7000. It is an updated version of the PlayStation 4 with improved hardware, including an upgraded GPU with 4.2 teraflops of processing power, and higher CPU clock. It is designed primarily to enable selected games to be playable at 4K resolution, and improved quality for PlayStation VR. All games are backwards and forward compatible between PS4 and PS4 Pro, but games with optimizations will have improved graphics performance on PS4 Pro. Although capable of streaming 4K video from online sources, PS4 Pro does not support Ultra HD Blu-ray. Additionally the PS4 Pro is the only PS4 model which can remote play at 1080p. The other models are limited to 720p.\n\nThe PocketStation was a miniature game console created by SCE as a peripheral for the original PlayStation. Released exclusively in Japan on December 23, 1999, it featured a monochrome LCD, a speaker, a real-time clock and infrared communication capability. It could also be used as a standard PlayStation memory card by connecting it to a PlayStation memory card slot. It was extremely popular in Japan and Sony originally had plans to release it in the United States but the plan was ultimately scrapped due to various manufacturing and supply-and-demand problems.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable (PSP) was Sony's first handheld console to compete with Nintendo's DS console. The original model (PSP-1000) was released in December and March , The console is the first to utilize a new proprietary optical storage medium known as Universal Media Disc (UMD), which can store both games and movies. It contains 32 MB of internal flash memory storage, expandable via Memory Stick PRO Duo cards. It has a similar control layout to the PS3 with its PlayStation logo button and its ('Triangle'), ('Circle/O'), ('Cross/X') and ('Square') buttons in their white-colored forms.\n\nThe PSP-2000 (also known as the Slim & Lite in PAL territories) was the first major hardware revision of the PlayStation Portable, released in September . The 2000 series was 33% lighter and 19% slimmer than the original PlayStation Portable. The capacity of the battery was also reduced by ⅓ but the run time remained the same as the previous model due to lower power consumption. Older model batteries will still work and they extend the amount of playing time. The PSP Slim & Lite has a new gloss finish. Its serial port was also modified in order to accommodate a new video-out feature (while rendering older PSP remote controls incompatible). On a PSP-2000, PSP games will only output to external monitors or TVs in progressive scan mode, so that televisions incapable of supporting progressive scan will not display PSP games; non-game video will output in either progressive or interlaced mode. USB charging was also made possible. Buttons are also reportedly more responsive on the PSP-2000. In , Sony released a second hardware revision called the PSP-3000 which included several features that were not present in the PSP-2000, such as a built-in microphone and upgraded screen, as well as the ability to output PSP games in interlaced mode.\n\nReleased in October , the PSP Go is the biggest redesign of the PlayStation Portable to date. Unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go does not feature a UMD drive but instead has 16 GB of internal flash memory to store games, videos and other media. This can be extended by up to 32GB with the use of a Memory Stick Micro (M2) flash card. Also unlike previous PSP models, the PSP Go's rechargeable battery is not removable or replaceable by the user. The unit is 43% lighter and 56% smaller than the original PSP-1000, and 16% lighter and 35% smaller than the PSP-3000. It has a 3.8\" 480 × 272 LCD (compared to the larger 4.3\" 480 × 272 pixel LCD on previous PSP models). The screen slides up to reveal the main controls. The overall shape and sliding mechanism are similar to that of Sony's mylo COM-2 internet device. The PSP Go is being produced and sold concurrently with its predecessor the PSP-3000 although it will not replace it. All games on the PSP Go must be purchased and downloaded from the PlayStation Store as the handheld is not compatible with the original PSP's physical media, the Universal Media Disc. The handheld also features connectivity with the PlayStation 3's controllers the Sixaxis and DualShock 3 via Bluetooth connection.\n\nThe PSP-E1000 is a budget-focused PSP model which, unlike previous PSP models, does not feature Wi-Fi or stereo speakers (replaced by a single mono speaker) and has a matte \"charcoal black\" finish similar to the slim PlayStation 3. The E1000 was announced at Gamescom 2011 and available across the PAL region for an RRP of €99.99.\n\nReleased in Japan on December 17, 2011 and North America on February 22, 2012, the PlayStation Vita was previously codenamed \"Next Generation Portable\" (\"NGP\"). It was officially unveiled by Sony on January 27, 2011 at the PlayStation Meeting 2011. The original model of the handheld, the PCH-1000 series features a 5-inch OLED touchscreen, two analog sticks, a rear touchpad, Sixaxis motion sensing and a 4 core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor.\n\nThe new PCH-2000 series system is a lighter redesign of the device that was announced at the SCEJA Press Conference in September 2013 prior to the Tokyo Game Show. This model is 20% thinner and 15% lighter compared to the original model, has an additional hour of battery life, an LCD instead of OLED, includes a micro USB Type B port, 1GB of internal storage memory. It was released in Japan on October 10, 2013 in six colors: white, black, pink, yellow, blue, and olive green, and in North America on May 6, 2014.\n\nReleased solely in Japan in , the Sony PSX was a fully integrated DVR and PlayStation 2 video game console. It was the first Sony product to utilize the XrossMediaBar (XMB) and can be linked with a PlayStation Portable to transfer videos and music via USB. It also features software for video, photo and audio editing. PSX supports online game compatibility using an internal broadband adapter. Games that utilize the PS2 HDD (for example, Final Fantasy XI) are supported as well. It was the first product released by Sony under the PlayStation brand that did not include a controller with the device itself.\n\nReleased in 2010, the Sony BRAVIA KDL22PX300 is a 22-inch 720p television which incorporates a PlayStation 2 console, along with 4 HDMI ports.\n\nA 24-inch 1080p PlayStation branded 3D television, officially called the PlayStation 3D Display, was released in late 2011. A feature of this 3D television is \"SimulView\". During multiplayer games, each player will only see their respective screen (in full HD) appear on the television through their respective 3D glasses, instead of seeing a split screen (e.g. player 1 will only see player 1's screen displayed through their 3D glasses).\n\nThe Xperia Play is an Android-powered smartphone with a slide-up gamepad resembling the PSP Go developed by Sony Ericsson aimed at gamers, and is the first to be PlayStation Certified. Also can download PlayStation Suite App.\n\nSony Tablets are PlayStation Certified Android tablets, released in 2011, 2012, and 2013. They offer connectivity with PlayStation 3 controllers, and integrate with the PlayStation network using a proprietary application. The following models were released between 2011 and 2013: S, Sony Tablet S, Sony Tablet P, Xperia Tablet S and Xperia Tablet Z.\n\nPlayStation TV, known in Asia as PlayStation Vita TV, is a microconsole and a non-portable variant of the PlayStation Vita handheld. It was announced on September 9, 2013 at a Sony Computer Entertainment Japan presentation. Instead of featuring a display screen, the console connects to a television via HDMI. Users can play using a DualShock 3 controller, although due to the difference in features between the controller and the handheld, certain games are not compatible with PS TV, such as those that are dependent on the system's touch-screen, rear touchpad, microphone or camera. The device is said to be compatible with over 100 Vita games, as well as various digital PlayStation Portable, PlayStation and PC Engine titles. The system supports Remote Play compatibility with the PlayStation 4, allowing players to stream games from the PS4 to a separate TV connected to PS TV, and also allows users to stream content from video services such as Hulu and Niconico, as well as access the PlayStation Store. The system was released in Japan on November 14, 2013, in North America on October 14, 2014, and in Europe and Australasia on November 14, 2014.\n\nPlayStation VR is a virtual reality device that is produced by Sony Computer Entertainment. It features a 5.7 inch 1920x1080 resolution OLED display, and operates at 120fps which can eliminate blur and produce a smooth image; the device also has a low latency of less than 18ms. Additionally, it produces two sets of images, one being visible on a TV and one for the headset, and includes 3D audio technology so the player can hear from all angles. The PlayStation VR was released in October 2016.\n\nEach console has a variety of games. Most games released on the original PlayStation are backwards compatible and can be played directly on its successors, the PlayStation 2, PSX and PlayStation 3. Some of these games can also be played on the PlayStation Portable but they must be purchased and downloaded from a list of PS one Classics from the PlayStation Store. Games released on the PlayStation 2 can currently only be played on the original console as well as the PSX and the early models of the PlayStation 3 which are backwards compatible. The PlayStation 3 has two types of games, those released on Blu-ray Discs and downloadable games from the PlayStation Store. The PlayStation Portable consists of numerous games available on both its physical media, the Universal Media Disc and the Digital Download from the PlayStation Store. However, some games are only available on the UMD while others are only available on the PlayStation Store. The PlayStation Vita consists of games available on both its physical media, the PlayStation Vita card and digital download from the PlayStation Store.\n\nSony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios is a group of video game developers owned by Sony Computer Entertainment. It is dedicated to developing video games exclusively for the PlayStation series of consoles. The series has produced several best-selling franchises such as the \"Gran Turismo\" series of racing video games as well as critically acclaimed titles such as the \"Uncharted\" series. Other notable franchises include \"God of War\", \"Twisted Metal\" and more recently, \"LittleBigPlanet\" (series), \" InFAMOUS\", and \"MotorStorm\".\n\nGreatest Hits (North America), Platinum Range (PAL territories) and The Best (Japan and Asia) are video games for the Sony PlayStation, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Portable consoles that have been officially re-released at a lower price by Sony. Each region has its own qualifications to enter the re-release program. Initially, during the PlayStation era, a game had to sell at least 150,000 copies (later 250,000) and be on the market for at least a year to enter the Greatest Hits range. During the PlayStation 2 era, the requirements increased with the minimum number of copies sold increasing to 400,000 and the game had to be on the market for at least 9 months. For the PlayStation Portable, games had to be on the market for at least 9 months with 250,000 copies or more sold. Currently, a PlayStation 3 game must be on the market for 10 months and sell at least 500,000 copies to meet the Greatest Hits criteria. PS one Classics were games that were released originally on the PlayStation and have been re-released on the PlayStation Store for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. Classics HD are compilations of PlayStation 2 games that have been remastered for the PlayStation 3 on a single disc with additional features such as upscaled graphics, PlayStation Move support, 3D support and PlayStation Network trophies. PlayStation Mobile (formerly PlayStation Suite) is a cross-platform, cross-device software framework aimed at providing PlayStation content, currently original PlayStation games, across several devices including PlayStation Certified Android devices as well as the PlayStation Vita.\n\nOnline gaming on PlayStation consoles first started in July 2001 with the release of PlayStation 2's unnamed online service in Japan. Later in August 2002 saw its release in North America, followed by the European release in June 2003. This service was shut down on March 31, 2016.\n\nReleased in 2006, the PlayStation Network is an online service focusing on online multiplayer gaming and digital media delivery. The service is provided and run by Sony Computer Entertainment for use with the PlayStation 3, and was later implemented on the PlayStation Portable, PlayStation Vita and PlayStation 4 video game consoles. The service currently has over 110 million users worldwide (as of July 2013). The Sony Entertainment Network provides other features for users like PlayStation Home, PlayStation Store, and Trophies.\n\nThe PlayStation Store is an online virtual market available to users of the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Portable game consoles via the PlayStation Network.

Folding@home is supported by Stanford University and volunteers make a contribution to society by donating computing power to this project. Research made by the project may eventually contribute to the creation of vital cures. The Folding@home client was developed by Sony Computer Entertainment in collaboration with Stanford University. Life with PlayStation also consisted of a 3D virtual view of the Earth and contained current weather and news information of various cities and countries from around the world, as well as a World Heritage channel which offered information about historical sites, and the United Village channel which is a project designed to share information about communities and cultures worldwide. As of PlayStation 3 system software update version 4.30 on October 24, 2012, the Life With PlayStation project has ended.\n\nPlayStation Plus, a subscription-based service on the PlayStation Network, compliments the standard PSN services. It enables an auto-download feature which allows the console to automatically download game patches and system software updates. Subscribers also gain early or exclusive access to some betas, game demos, premium downloadable content (such as full game trials of retail games like \"Infamous\" and \"LittleBigPlanet\") and other PlayStation Store items, as well as a free subscription to Qore.

A sub-site of the blog called PlayStation Blog Share was launched on March 17, 2010 and allowed readers of the blog as well as users of the PlayStation Blog to submit ideas to the PlayStation team about anything PlayStation-related and vote on the ideas of other submissions.\n\nThe PlayStation App is an application that was released on January 11, 2011 in several European countries for iOS (version 4 and above) and for Android (version 1.6 and above), and has been installed more than 3.6 million times as of March 2, 2014. It allows users to view their trophies, see which of their PSN friends are online and read up to date information about PlayStation. It does not feature any gaming functionality.\n\nThe PlayStation Mobile (formerly \"PlayStation Suite\") is a software framework that will be used to provide downloadable \"PlayStation\" content to devices running Android 2.3 and above as well as the PlayStation Vita. The framework will be cross-platform and cross-device, which is what Sony calls \"hardware-neutral\". It was set to release before the end of calendar year 2011. In addition, Android devices that have been certified to be able to play back PlayStation Suite content smoothly will be certified with the PlayStation Certified certification.\n\nPlayStation Now (PS Now) is a Gaikai-based video game streaming service used to provide PlayStation gaming content to PlayStation 3 (PS3), PlayStation 4 (PS4), PlayStation Vita, PlayStation TV and BRAVIA televisions. The service currently allows users to pay for access to a selection of original PlayStation 3 titles on either a per-game basis or via a subscription. PlayStation Now was announced on January 7, 2014 at the 2014 Consumer Electronic Show. At CES, Sony presented demos of The Last of Us, God of War: Ascension, Puppeteer and Beyond: Two Souls, playable through PS Now on Bravia TVs and PlayStation Vitas.

It is available directly from the PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar. Membership is free, and only requires a PSN account. Home has been in development since early 2005 and started an open public beta test on December 11, 2008. Home allows users to create a custom avatar, which can be made to suit the user's preference. Users can decorate their avatar's personal apartment (\"HomeSpace\") with default, bought, or won items. They can travel throughout the Home world (except cross region), which is constantly updated by Sony and partners. Each part of the world is known as a space. Public spaces can just be for display, fun, or for meeting people. Home features many mini-games which can be single player or multiplayer. Users can shop for new items to express themselves more through their avatars or HomeSpace. Home features video screens in many places for advertising, but the main video content is shown at the theatre for entertainment. Home plays host to a variety of special events which range from prize-giving events to entertaining events. Users can also use Home to connect with friends and customize content. \"Xi\", a once notable feature of Home, is the world's first console based Alternate Reality Game that took place in secret areas in Home and was created by nDreams.\n\n\"Room\" (officially spelled as \"R∞M\" with capital letters and the infinity symbol in place of the \"oo\") was being beta tested in Japan from October 2009 to April 2010. Development of Room has been halted on April 15, 2010 due to negative feedback from the community. Announced at TGS 2009, it was supposed to be a similar service to the PlayStation Home and was being developed for the PSP. Launching directly from the PlayStation Network section of the XMB was also to be enabled. Just like in Home, PSP owners would have been able to invite other PSP owners into their rooms to \"enjoy real time communication.\" A closed beta test had begun in Q4 2009 in Japan.\n\nThe XrossMediaBar, originally used on the PSX, is a graphical user interface currently used for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable, as well as a variety of other Sony devices. The interface features icons that are spread horizontally across the screen. Navigation moves the icons instead of a cursor. These icons are used as categories to organize the options available to the user. When an icon is selected on the horizontal bar, several more appear vertically, above and below it (selectable by the up and down directions on a directional pad). The XMB can also be accessed in-game albeit with restrictions, it allows players to access certain areas of the XMB menu from within the game and is only available for the PlayStation 3. Although the capacity to play users' own music in-game was added with this update, the feature is dependent on game developers who must either enable the feature in their games or update existing games.\n\nLiveArea, designed to be used on the PlayStation Vita, is a graphical user interface set to incorporate various social networking features via the PlayStation Network. It has been designed specifically as a touchscreen user interface for users.\n\nIn 2002, Sony released the first useful and fully functioning operating system for a video game console, after the Net Yaroze experiment for the original PlayStation. The kit, which included an internal hard disk drive and the necessary software tools, turned the PlayStation 2 into a full-fledged computer system running Linux. Users can utilize a network adapter to connect the PlayStation 2 to the internet, a monitor cable adaptor to connect the PlayStation 2 to computer monitors as well as a USB Keyboard and Mouse which can be used to control Linux on the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 (excluding PlayStation 3 Slim) also supports running Linux OS on firmware versions prior to 3.21 without the need for buying additional hardware purchase. Yellow Dog Linux provides an official distribution that can be downloaded, and other distributions such as Fedora, Gentoo and Ubuntu have been successfully installed and operated on the console. The use of Linux on the PlayStation 3 allowed users to access 6 of the 7 Synergistic Processing Elements; Sony implemented a hypervisor restricting access to the RSX. The feature to install a second operating system on a PlayStation 3 was removed in a firmware update released in 2010.\n\nReleased in 1994, the PlayStation control pad was the first controller made for the original PlayStation. It featured a basic design of a D-pad, 4 main select buttons ( ('Green Triangle'), ('Red Circle/Red O')), ('Blue Cross/Blue X') and ('Pink Square'), and start and select buttons on the face. 'Shoulder buttons' are also featured on the top [L1, L2, R1, R2] (named by the side [L=Left, R=Right] and 1 and 2 [top and bottom]). In 1996, Sony released the PlayStation Analog Joystick for use with flight simulation games. The original digital controller was then replaced by the Dual Analog in 1997, which added two analog sticks based on the same potentiometer technology as the Analog Joystick. This controller was then also succeeded by the DualShock controller.\n\nReleased in 1998, the DualShock controller for the PlayStation succeeded its predecessor, the Dual Analog, and would go on to become the longest running series of controllers for the PlayStation brand. In addition to the inputs of the original, digital, controller (, , , , L1, L2, R1, R2, Start, Select and a D-pad), the DualShock featured two analog sticks in a similar fashion to the previous Dual Analog controller, which can also be depressed to activate the L3 and R3 buttons.\n\nThe DualShock series consists of four controllers: the DualShock which was the fourth controller released for the PlayStation; the DualShock 2, the only standard controller released for the PlayStation 2, and the DualShock 3, the second and current controller released for the PlayStation 3, and the DualShock 4, which went through a massive redesign and is the default input of the PlayStation 4, and upon release was compatible with the PS3 originally only via USB and eventually with a firmware update, Bluetooth connectivity was enabled. The Sixaxis was the first official controller for the PlayStation 3, and is based on the same design as the DualShock series (but lacking the vibration motors of the DualShock series of controllers).\n\nLike the Dual Analog, the DualShock and DualShock 2 feature an \"Analog\" button between the analog sticks that toggles the analog sticks on and off (for use with games which support only the digital input of the original controller). On the PlayStation 3 Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers, the analog sticks are always enabled. Beginning with the Sixaxis, a 'PlayStation button' (which featured the incorporated PS logo and is similar in function to the Xbox 360 \"Guide\" button) was included on controllers. The PlayStation button replaces the \"Analog\" button of the DualShock and DualShock 2 controllers. Pressing the PS button on the PS3 brings up the XMB, while holding it down brings up system options (such as quit the game, change controller settings, turn off the system, and turn off the controller).\n\nPlayStation Move is a motion-sensing game controller platform for the PlayStation 3 video game console by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE). Based on the handheld motion controller wand, PlayStation Move uses the PlayStation Eye webcam to track the wand's position and the inertial sensors in the wand to detect its motion. First revealed on June 2, 2009, PlayStation Move was launched in Q3/Q4 2010. Hardware available at launch included the main PlayStation Move motion controller and an optional PlayStation Move sub-controller.\nAlthough PlayStation Move is implemented on the existing PlayStation 3 console, Sony states that it is treating Move's debut as its own major \"platform launch\", planning an aggressive marketing campaign to support it. In addition to selling the controllers individually, Sony also plans to provide several different bundle options for PlayStation Move hardware; including a starter kit with a PS Eye, a Move motion controller, and a demo/sampler disc, priced under US$100; a full console pack with a PS3 console, DualShock 3 gamepad, PS Eye, and Move motion controller; and bundles of a Move motion controller with select games.\n\nThe PlayStation brand has a wide series of magazines, from across different continents, covering PlayStation related articles and stories. Many of these magazines work closely with Sony and thus often come with demo discs for PlayStation games. Currently there are three magazines still in circulation namely \"\", \"PlayStation Official Magazine\", \"Official PlayStation Magazine (Australia)\". However, over the years, many PlayStation magazines have spawned while a few have also become defunct, these include the \"Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine\", \"Official UK PlayStation Magazine\", \"Official UK PlayStation 2 Magazine\".\n\n\"PlayStation Underground\" was a non-traditional magazine that Sony Computer Entertainment America produced and published between Spring 1997 to Spring 2001. Subscribers received two PlayStation CDs, along with a booklet and colorful packaging every quarter. The CDs contained interviews, cheats, programmers moves, game demos and one-of-a-kind Memory Card saves. Several issues showed how a game was created from basic design to final product. Since the CDs could only be run on a PlayStation, it proved a useful marketing tool which spawned a line of \"PlayStation Underground JamPacks\" Demo CDs and which contained highlights from recent issues of \"PlayStation Underground\", along with seemingly as many game demos that could be packed on a single CD. Unlike \"PlayStation Underground\" these were available in most stores for $4.95, were published twice a year in Summer and Winter and usually spotlighted newly released or coming soon games. By 2001, Sony had decided to phase out \"Underground\" to focus on the \"JamPacks\" with the release of the PlayStation 2. \"PlayStation Underground\" CDs are mainly in the hands of collectors these days.\n\nThe PlayStation has been known for several advertising campaigns.\n\nAdvertising slogans used for each PlayStation console iteration:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most notable of recent PlayStation commercials is the series of \"It Only Does Everything\" commercials featuring a fictional character called Kevin Butler who is a Vice President at PlayStation. These commercials usually advertise the PlayStation 3 and its games through a series of comedic answers to \"Dear PlayStation\" queries. These commercials garnered popularity among gamers, though its debut commercial received criticism from the Nigerian government due to a reference to the common 419 scams originating in Nigeria. Sony issued an apology and a new version of the advert with the offending line changed was produced.\n\nA spin-off of the campaign has been created for the PlayStation Portable which features similar campaign commercials called the \"Step Your Game Up\" campaign featuring a fictional teenage character named Marcus Rivers acting in a similar fashion to Kevin Butler but answering the \"Dear PlayStation\" queries about the PSP.\n\nIn July 2006, an advertising campaign in the Netherlands was released in which a white model dressed entirely in white and a black model dressed entirely in black was used to compare Sony's new Ceramic White PSP and the original Piano Black PSP. This series of ads depicted both models fighting with each other and drew criticism from the media for being racist, though Sony maintains that the ad did not feature any racist message.\n\nIn November 2006, a marketing company employed by Sony's American division created a website entitled \"\"All I want for Xmas is a PSP\"\", designed to promote the PSP virally. The site contained a blog which was purportedly written by \"Charlie\", a teenage boy attempting to get his friend Jeremy's parents to buy him a PSP, and providing a \"music video\" of either Charlie or Jeremy \"rapping\" about the PSP. Visitors to the website quickly recognized that the website was registered to a marketing company, exposing the campaign on sites such as YouTube and digg. Sony was forced to admit that the site was in fact a marketing campaign and in an interview with next-gen.biz, Sony admitted that the idea was \"\"poorly executed\"\".\n\nIn 2005, Australian newspaper The Age wrote an article about the PlayStation brand. Among the numerous interviews conducted with various people in the industry was an interview with Dr Jeffrey Brand, associate professor in communication and media at Bond University who said, \"PlayStation re-ignited our imagination with video games\". Game designers Yoshiki Okamoto called the brand \"revolutionary — PlayStation has changed gaming, distribution, sales, image and more\", while Evan Wells of Naughty Dog said \"PlayStation is responsible for making playing games cool.\"\n\nIn 2009, ViTrue, Inc. listed the PlayStation brand as number 13 on their \"The Vitrue 100: Top Social Brands of 2009\". The ranking was based on various aspects mainly dealing with popular social media sites in aspects such as Social Networking, Video Sharing, Photo Sharing and Blogs.\n\nIn 2010, Gizmodo stated that the PlayStation brand was one of the last Sony products to completely stand apart from its competitors, stating that \"If you ask the average person on the street what their favorite Sony product is, more often than not you'll hear PlayStation\". As of April 2012, the PlayStation brand is the \"most followed\" brand on social networking site, Facebook, with over 22 million fans and followers in total which is more than any other brand in the entertainment industry. A study by Greenlight's Entertainment Retail has also shown that the PlayStation brand is the most interactive making 634 posts and tweets on social networking sites Facebook and Twitter.\n\nIn July 2014, Sony boasted in a company release video that the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita sold a combined total of 100 million units. It was announced at Tokyo Game Show on September 1, 2014, that PlayStation home game consoles claim 78% market share of all home consoles in Japan.\n\n, PlayStation is the strongest selling console brand worldwide.\n",
                "PlayStation (console)\n\nThe PlayStation (officially abbreviated to PS, and commonly known as the PS1 or PSX) is a home video game console developed and marketed by Sony Computer Entertainment. The console was released on 3 December in Japan, 9 September 1995 in North America, 29 September 1995 in Europe, and for 15 November 1995 in Australia. The console was the first of the PlayStation lineup of home video game consoles. It primarily competed with the Nintendo 64 and the Sega Saturn as part of the fifth generation of video game consoles.\n\nThe PlayStation is the first \"computer entertainment platform\" to ship 100 million units, which it had reached 9 years and 6 months after its initial launch. In 2000, a redesigned, \"slim\" version called the PS one was released, replacing the original grey console and named appropriately to avoid confusion with its successor, the PlayStation 2.\n\nThe PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with the PlayStation's DualShock controller and games, was announced in 1999 and launched in 2000. The last PS one units were sold in winter 2004 before it was officially discontinued in 2006, for a total of 102 million units shipped since its launch 11 years earlier. Games for the PlayStation continued to sell until Sony ceased production of both the PlayStation and PlayStation games on 23 March 2006 – over 11 years after it had been released, and less than a year before the debut of the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe inception of what would become the released PlayStation dates back to 1986 with a joint venture between Nintendo and Sony. Nintendo had already produced floppy disk technology to complement cartridges, in the form of the Family Computer Disk System, and wanted to continue this complementary storage strategy for the Super Famicom. Nintendo approached Sony to develop a CD-ROM add-on, tentatively titled the \"Play Station\" or \"SNES-CD\". A contract was signed, and work began. Nintendo's choice of Sony was due to a prior dealing: Ken Kutaragi, the person who would later be dubbed \"The Father of the PlayStation\", was the individual who had sold Nintendo on using the Sony SPC-700 processor for use as the eight-channel ADPCM sound set in the Super Famicom/SNES console through an impressive demonstration of the processor's capabilities.\n\nKutaragi was nearly fired by Sony because he was originally working with Nintendo on the side without Sony's knowledge (while still employed by Sony). It was then-CEO, Norio Ohga, who recognised the potential in Kutaragi's chip, and in working with Nintendo on the project. Ohga kept Kutaragi on at Sony, and it was not until Nintendo cancelled the project that Sony decided to develop its own console.\n\nSony also planned to develop a Super NES-compatible, Sony-branded console, but one which would be more of a home entertainment system playing both Super NES cartridges and a new CD format which Sony would design. This was also to be the format used in SNES-CDs, giving a large degree of control to Sony despite Nintendo's leading position in the video gaming market.\n\nThe product, dubbed the \"Play Station\" was to be announced at the May 1991 Consumer Electronics Show (CES). However, when Nintendo's Hiroshi Yamauchi read the original 1988 contract between Sony and Nintendo, he realised that the earlier agreement essentially handed Sony complete control over any and all titles written on the SNES CD-ROM format. Yamauchi decided that the contract was totally unacceptable and he secretly cancelled all plans for the joint Nintendo-Sony SNES CD attachment. Instead of announcing a partnership between Sony and Nintendo, at 9 am the day of the CES, Nintendo chairman Howard Lincoln stepped onto the stage and revealed that Nintendo was now allied with Philips, and Nintendo was planning on abandoning all the previous work Nintendo and Sony had accomplished. Lincoln and Minoru Arakawa had, unbeknownst to Sony, flown to Philips' global headquarters in the Netherlands and formed an alliance of a decidedly different nature—one that would give Nintendo total control over its licenses on Philips machines.\n\nAfter the collapse of the joint-Nintendo project, Sony briefly considered allying itself with Sega to produce a stand-alone console. The Sega CEO at the time, Tom Kalinske, took the proposal to Sega's Board of Directors in Tokyo, who promptly vetoed the idea. Kalinske, in a 2013 interview recalled them saying \"that’s a stupid idea, Sony doesn't know how to make hardware. They don’t know how to make software either. Why would we want to do this?\". This prompted Sony into halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what it had developed so far with both Nintendo and Sega to make it into a complete console based upon the Super Famicom. As a result, Nintendo filed a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in US federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of what was originally christened the \"Play Station\", on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction and, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the aforementioned brand new game system was revealed. However, it is theorised that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.\n\nBy the end of 1992, Sony and Nintendo reached a deal whereby the \"Play Station\" would still have a port for SNES games, but Nintendo would own the rights and receive the bulk of the profits from the games, and the SNES would continue to use the Sony-designed audio chip. However, Sony decided in early 1993 to begin reworking the \"Play Station\" concept to target a new generation of hardware and software. As part of this process the SNES cartridge port was dropped and the space between the names \"Play Station\" was removed becoming \"PlayStation\", thereby ending Nintendo's involvement with the project. According to a Sony engineer, all work on the console from the time of the partnership with Nintendo was eventually scrapped, and the PlayStation design was restarted from scratch. Sony's North American division, known as Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), originally planned to market the new console under the alternative branding \"PSX\" following the negative feedback regarding \"PlayStation\" in focus group studies. Early advertising prior to the console's launch in North America referenced PSX, but the term was scrapped before launch.\n\nAccording to SCE's producer Ryoji Akagawa and chairman Shigeo Maruyama, there was uncertainty over whether the console should primarily focus on 2D sprite graphics or 3D polygon graphics. It was only after witnessing the success of Sega's \"Virtua Fighter\" in Japanese arcades that \"the direction of the PlayStation became instantly clear\" and 3D polygon graphics became the console's primary focus.\n\nUnlike Sega, Sony had no arcade division from which to draw console-selling ports, or any in-house development to speak of. To solve this problem, Sony acquired studios such as Psygnosis and signed exclusivity deals with hot arcade publishers Namco and Williams Entertainment.\n\nIndustry hype for the console spread quickly, and in early 1994 \"GamePro\" reported that \"many video game companies [feel] that in the near future, the video game platforms to contend with will be from Nintendo, Sega... and \"Sony\".\" [emphasis in original]\n\nThe PlayStation was released in Japan on 3 December 1994, North America on 9 September 1995, Europe on 29 September 1995, and Oceania on 15 November 1995. The console was an immediate success in Japan, selling over 2 million units within its first six months on the market. In the US, 800,000 were sold in 1995 (i.e. four months on the market), giving the PlayStation a commanding lead over the other consoles of its generation, though it was still being outsold by the older Super NES and Sega Genesis. The launch price in the US market was US$299 and Sony enjoyed a very successful launch with titles of almost every genre, including \"Battle Arena Toshinden\", \"Warhawk\", \"Air Combat\", \"Philosoma\", \"Ridge Racer\" and \"Rayman\". Unlike the vast majority of gaming consoles of the time, the PlayStation did not include a pack-in game at launch. Sony reported strong software sales in the months following launch, with an attach rate of 4:1.\n\nThen Microsoft chairman, Bill Gates, preferred Sony's console to the competition from Sega, saying \"Our game designer likes the Sony machine.\" Microsoft would later compete with Sony with its Xbox console. In a special Game Machine Cross Review in May 1995, \"Famicom Tsūshin\" would score the PlayStation console a 19 out of 40. The staff of \"Next Generation\" reviewed the PlayStation a few weeks after its North American launch. They commented that while the CPU is \"fairly average\", the supplementary custom hardware such as the GPU and sound processor is stunningly powerful. They particularly praised its focus on 3D, and also remarked positively on the comfort of the controller and the convenience of the memory cards. Giving the system 4 1/2 out of 5 stars, they concluded, \"To succeed in this extremely cut-throat market, you need a combination of great hardware, great games, and great marketing. Whether by skill, luck, or just deep pockets, Sony has scored three out of three in the first salvo of this war.\" An advertisement slogan used in marketing the console was, \"\"Live in your world. Play in ours.\"\" It is stylised as, \"LIVE IN YUR WRLD. PLY IN URS.\" Another briefly used advertising campaign was titled \"You Are Not Ready\" or \"U R NOT .\" Sony's CCO Lee Clow explained that \"it's the ultimate challenge. Gamers love to respond to that tag line and say 'Bullshit. Let me show you how ready I am.'\"\n\nOne of the key factors in the PlayStation's success was Sony's approach to third party developers. Whereas Sega and Nintendo took an isolationist approach, focusing on first party development while generally leaving third party developers to their own devices, Sony took efforts to streamline game production by providing a range of programming libraries which were constantly updated online, organising third party technical support teams, and in some cases giving direct development support to third party companies.\n\nWhile the Sega Saturn was marketed towards 18 to 34 year-olds, the PlayStation was marketed roughly, but not exclusively, towards 12 to 24 year-olds. Both Sega and Sony reasoned that because younger players typically look up to older, more experienced players, they would be drawn in by advertising targeted at teens and adults. Additionally, Sony found that adults are best targeted by advertising geared towards teenagers; according to Lee Clow, \"One of the first things we resolved early on was that everyone is 17 when they play videogames. The young people look up to the best gamer who is usually a little older and more practiced and talented. Then there are people who start working and grow up, but when they go into their room and sit down with their videogames, they're regressing and becoming 17 again.\" Initially PlayStation demographics were skewed towards adults, but after the first price drop the audience began broadening.\n\nIn 1996, the high demand for PlayStation games contributed to Sony's decision to expand their CD production facilities in Springfield, Oregon, increasing their monthly output from 4 million discs to 6.5 million discs. PlayStation sales were running at twice the rate of Saturn sales, and dramatically increased their lead when both the PlayStation and Saturn dropped in price to $199 in May, in large part because some retailers (such as KB Toys) did not stock the Saturn. The PlayStation was outselling the Saturn at a similar ratio in Europe as well during 1996.\n\nThe PlayStation took more time to achieve dominance in Japan. After the PlayStation and Saturn had been on the market for nearly two years, Sony Computer Entertainment president Teruhisa Tokunaka said the competition between them was still \"very close\", and that neither console had yet held the lead in sales for any meaningful length of time.\n\nIn addition to playing games, select PlayStation models have the ability to play audio CDs; further, Asian model SCPH-5903 can also play Video CDs. Like most domestic CD players, the PlayStation has the ability to shuffle the playback order, play the songs in a programmed order, and repeat one song or the entire disc. Later PlayStation models can utilise a music visualisation function called SoundScope. This function, as well as a memory card manager, can be accessed by starting the console either without inserting a game or keeping the CD tray open, thereby accessing a GUI for the PlayStation BIOS.\n\nThe actual GUI for both PS one and PlayStation differ graphically depending on firmware versions: the original PlayStation GUI had a dark blue background with rainbow graffiti used as buttons; the early PAL PlayStation and PS one GUI had a grey blocked background with 2 icons in the middle, different on each version. If the CD lid is closed with a game inside at any time while at the menu, the game will immediately start.\n\nAs of 30 June 2007, a total of 7,918 software titles have been released worldwide (counting games released in multiple regions as separate titles). As of 31 March 2007, the cumulative software shipment was at 962 million units. The last game for the system released in the United States was \"FIFA Football 2005\". However, several reprinted and remastered editions were released in later years. \"Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection\" was released on 26 July 2007, which contained \"Metal Gear Solid\" in the original PlayStation format. In 2011, Capcom released the \"Resident Evil 15th Anniversary Collection\", and in 2012, Square Enix released the \"Final Fantasy 25th Anniversary Ultimate Box\" in Japan containing all of the \"Final Fantasy\" titles, a majority of which were also in the original PlayStation format.\n\nThe \"OK\" and \"Cancel\" buttons on most of the Japanese PlayStation games are reversed in their North American and European releases. In Japan, the button (\"maru\", right) is used as the OK button, while the button (\"batsu\", wrong) is used as Cancel. North American and European releases have the button or the buttons as the OK button, while either the or the button is used as Cancel (some titles like \"Xenogears\" used the button for cancelling actions and selections, along with the PlayStation 2 system browser and the XrossMedia Bar on the PlayStation 3 and the PSP). However, a few games, such as Square's \"Vagrant Story\", \"Final Fantasy VII\" (which used the button as cancel) and \"Final Fantasy Tactics\", Namco's \"Ridge Racer Type 4\", and Konami's \"Metal Gear Solid\", use the Japanese button layout worldwide. Some other games, like the Japanese version of \"Gran Turismo\", had used different controls that are similar to North American games. These Japanese button layouts still apply to other PlayStation consoles. This is because in the early years Sony America (SCEA), Sony Europe (SCEE), and Sony Japan (SCEJ) had different development and testing documents (TRCs) for their respective territories.\n\nHardware designer Ken Kutaragi stated, \"The technology came from an original idea to create a synthesizer for graphics, something that takes a basic graphic and then adds various effects to it quickly and easily.\"\n\nWith the early units, particularly the early 1000 models, many gamers experience skipping full-motion video or physical \"ticking\" noises coming from their PlayStation units. The problem appears to have come from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments—the plastic mouldings inside the console can warp very slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly. The solution is to ensure that the console sits on a surface which dissipates heat efficiently in a well vented area, or raise the unit up slightly from its resting surface.\nThe first batch of PlayStations used a KSM-440AAM laser unit whose case and all movable parts were completely made out of plastic. Over time, friction causes the plastic lens sled rail to wear out—usually unevenly. The placement of the laser unit close to the power supply accelerated wear because of the additional heat, which makes the plastic even more vulnerable to friction. Eventually, one side of the lens sled can become so worn that the laser can tilt, no longer pointing directly at the CD. This would cause data read errors and games would no longer load. One common fix is to turn the PlayStation upside down, making the lens sled rest on the unworn top rails. Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the sled out of die-cast metal and placing the laser unit slightly farther away from the power supply on later models of the PlayStation.\n\nDue to an engineering oversight, the PlayStation does not produce a proper signal on several older models of televisions, causing the display to flicker or bounce around the screen. Since only a small percentage of PlayStation owners used such televisions, Sony decided not to change the console design, and instead gave consumers the option of sending their PlayStation unit to a Sony service centre to have an official modchip installed, which would allow it to play on older televisions.\n\nPrior to the PlayStation, the reproduction of copyrighted material for game consoles was restricted to either enthusiasts with exceptional technical ability, or others that had access to CD manufacturers. However, the increased availability of cheap CD burners at this time led Sony to modify the shape of the first portion of the data track on PlayStation formatted discs: A normal data track follows a smooth spiral path around a disc, whereas the modified portion of the data track followed wavy spiral path. As a result, any discs that did not contain the modified data track such as CD-R copies or standard pirated discs could not boot on the console. This modified portion of the data path was used to encode the disc \"region\", for example a disc destined for distribution in the NTSC-U/C region would encode the letters \"SCEA\"; in Europe, \"SCEE\"; in Japan, \"SCEI\". This served as copy protection as well as region-locking.\n\nThe installation of an unofficial modchip allowed the PlayStation to play games recorded on a regular CD-R. Since it worked by injecting the correct region data into the stream it also allowed the console to play games from any region.\n\nSeveral open source modchips were designed using readily available electronic parts, by the end of the system's life cycle almost anyone with minimal soldering experience was able to perform these modifications. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using free, unofficial tools, as well as the reproduction of original discs. With the introduction of such devices the console became very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers alike, as well as those who merely wished to protect the lifespan of their lawful, original discs. In 1996 Sony filed lawsuits against a number of companies which advertised such modchips and pirated games, under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act.\n\nSome companies (notably Datel) did manage to produce discs that booted on unmodified retail units while using special equipment.\n\nInstead of a D-pad, which is used for directional movement in nearly every other console then on the market, the PlayStation controller uses four directional buttons.\n\nPeripherals released for the PlayStation include memory cards, the PlayStation Mouse, the PlayStation Analog Joystick, the PlayStation Link Cable, the Multiplayer Adapter (a four-player multitap), the Memory Drive (a disk drive for 3.5 inch floppy disks), the GunCon (a light gun), and the Glasstron (a monoscopic head-mounted display).\n\n\nThe PlayStation went through a number of variants during its production run. From an external perspective, the most notable change between variants was the reduction in the number of connectors. The RCA jacks were removed in the first revision, and the Parallel I/O port was removed in the final revision.\n\nSony marketed a development kit for hobbyists and developers also known as the Net Yaroze, which launched in June 1996 in Japan and in 1997 in other countries. Sold only through an ordering service, the development console came with the necessary documentation and software to program PlayStation games and applications.\n\nOn 7 July 2000, Sony released the PS one, a smaller, redesigned version of the original PlayStation. It was the highest-selling console through the end of the year, outselling all other consoles - including Sony's own PlayStation 2. A total of 28.15 million PS one units had been sold by the time it was discontinued in March 2006.\nA version of the PS one included a LCD screen, referred to as the \"Combo pack\".\n\nSony's successor to the PlayStation is the PlayStation 2, which is backwards compatible with its predecessor in that it can play almost every original PlayStation game.\n\nThe third generation of the PlayStation, the PlayStation 3, was launched on 11 November 2006 in Japan, 17 November 2006 in North America, and 23 March 2007 in Europe. The backward compatibility of the PlayStation 3 differs by model. The newer PlayStation 3 models, like the Slim, are only backwards compatible with original PlayStation games; however, the older 60 GB model (the first PS3 model released) will play PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games through either having the Emotion Engine and/or Reality Synthesizer and emulating one or the other. While PlayStation 3 games are not region-locked, PlayStation and PlayStation 2 games are only playable on PlayStation 3 consoles from the same region.\n\nA third successor, the PlayStation 4, was announced by Sony on 20 February 2013 and was released in the US on 15 November, Europe on 29 November 2013, and Japan and Asia on 22 February 2014. However, it is backwards compatible with select PS3 Games through a download service dubbed PlayStation Now.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable, or PSP, is a handheld game console first released in late 2004. The PSP is capable of playing PlayStation games downloaded via Sony's online store, and can also play any PlayStation game by using the PlayStation 3's remote play feature while the disc is in the PlayStation 3.\n\nThe successor to the PSP, the PlayStation Vita, was introduced as a part of the 8th generation of video game consoles, and is backwards compatible with original PSP as well as original PlayStation games downloaded from the PlayStation Store.\n\nSony Computer Entertainment was an upstart in the video game industry in late 1994, as the early 1990s were dominated by Nintendo and Sega. Nintendo had been the clear leader in the video game industry since the introduction of the NES in 1985 and the Nintendo 64 was initially expected to maintain this position for Nintendo. The PlayStation's target audience included 15- to 17-year-olds who were not the primary focus of Nintendo, and 18- to 29-year-olds, who represented the first generation to grow up playing video games. By the late 1990s, Sony became a highly regarded console brand due to the PlayStation, with a significant lead over second-place Nintendo, while Sega was relegated to a distant third.\n\nThe PlayStation's lead in installed base and developer support paved the way for the success of the next-generation PlayStation 2, which overcame an early launch from the Sega Dreamcast and then fended off competition from the Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo GameCube.\n\nThe success of the PlayStation is widely believed to have influenced the demise of the cartridge-based home console. While not the first system to utilise an optical disc format, it is the first highly successful one, and ended up going head-to-head with the last major home console to rely on proprietary cartridges—the Nintendo 64. Sony Computer Entertainment president Teruhisa Tokunaka remarked in 1996: \n\nNintendo was very public about its scepticism toward using CDs and DVDs to store games, citing longer load times and durability issues. It was widely speculated that the company was even more concerned with the proprietary cartridge format's ability to help enforce copy protection, given its substantial reliance on licensing and exclusive titles for its revenue. Piracy was rampant on the PlayStation due to the relative ease of the installation of a modchip, allowing the PlayStation to play games region free and/or recorded on a regular CD-R, making the console very attractive to programmers and illegal copiers.\n\nThe increasing complexity of games (in content, graphics, and sound) pushed cartridges to their storage limits and this gradually turned off some third-party developers. Part of the CD format's appeal to publishers was that they could be produced at a significantly lower cost and offered more production flexibility to meet demand. As a result, some third-party developers switched to the PlayStation, such as Squaresoft, whose \"Final Fantasy VII\", and Enix (later merged with Squaresoft to create Square Enix), whose \"Dragon Quest VII\" titles were initially pre-planned for the N64; while some who remained released fewer games to the Nintendo 64 (Konami, releasing only thirteen N64 games but over fifty on the PlayStation). While new games were coming out rapidly for the PlayStation, new Nintendo 64 game releases were less frequent and that system's biggest successes were developed by either Nintendo itself or by second-parties, such as Rare. The lower production costs also allowed publishers an additional source of profit: budget-priced reissues of titles which had already recouped their development costs.\n",
                "Sony Interactive Entertainment\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment (abbreviated as SIE and formerly known as Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) and Sony Network Entertainment) is an American multinational video game and digital entertainment company and is a wholly owned subsidiary and part of the Consumer Products and Services Group of Sony Corporation.\n\nThe company was founded and established on November 16, 1993, as Sony Computer Entertainment, to handle Sony's venture into video game development with its PlayStation brand. Since the successful launch of the original PlayStation console in 1994, the company has since been developing the PlayStation lineup of home video game consoles and accessories. Expanding upon North America and other countries, the company soon became Sony's main resource for research and development in video games and interactive entertainment. In 1994, Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA), began to produce the original PlayStation console in North America. In April 2016, SCE and Sony Network Entertainment was restructured and reorganized into Sony Interactive Entertainment, carrying over the operations and primary objectives from both companies.\n\nSony Interactive Entertainment handles the research and development, production, and sales of both hardware and software for the PlayStation video game systems. Alongside, it is also a developer and publisher of video game titles and is composed of several subsidiaries of Sony's largest markets: North America, Europe and Asia. As of September 2016, the company has sold more than 486 million PlayStation consoles overall worldwide.\n\nSony Computer Entertainment, Inc. (SCEI) was jointly established by Sony and its subsidiary Sony Music Entertainment Japan in 1993 to handle the company's ventures into the video game hardware market. The original PlayStation console was released on December 3, 1994, in Japan.\n\nThe company's North American operations, Sony Computer Entertainment of America (SCEA), were originally established in May 1995 as a division of Sony Electronic Publishing. Located in Foster City, California, the North American office was originally headed by Steve Race.\n\nIn the months prior to the release of the PlayStation in Western markets, the operations were restructured: All videogame marketing from Sony Imagesoft was folded into SCEA in July 1995, with most affected employees transferred from Santa Monica, California, to Foster City. On August 7, 1995, Race unexpectedly resigned and was named CEO of Spectrum HoloByte three days later. He was replaced by Sony Electronics veteran Martin Homlish. This proved to be the beginning of a run of exceptional managerial turnover, with SCEA going through four presidents in a single year. The PS console was released in the United States on September 9, 1995.\n\nAs part of a worldwide restructuring at the beginning of 1997, SCEA (currently Sony Interactive Entertainment America) was re-established as a wholly owned subsidiary of SCEI.\n\nThe launch of the second PS console, the PlayStation 2 was released in Japan on March 4, 2000, and the U.S. on October 26, 2000.\n\nOn July 1, 2002, chairman of SCEI, Shigeo Maruyama, was replaced by Tamotsu Iba as chairman. Jack Tretton and Phil Harrison were also promoted to senior vice presidents of SCE.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable (PSP) was SCEI's first foray into the small handheld console market. Its development was first announced during SCE's E3 conference in 2003, and it was officially unveiled during their E3 conference on May 11, 2004. The system was released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in Europe and Australia on September 1, 2005.\n\nOn September 14, 2005, SCEI formed Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios (SCE WWS), a single internal entity to oversee all wholly owned development studios within SCEI. It became responsible for the creative and strategic direction of development and production of all computer entertainment software by all SCEI-owned studios—all software is produced exclusively for the PS family of consoles. Shuhei Yoshida was named as President of SCE WWS on May 16, 2008, replacing Kazuo Hirai, who was serving interim after Harrison left the company in early 2008.\n\nOn December 8, 2005, video game developer Guerrilla Games, developers of the \"Killzone\" series, was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment as part of its SCE WWS. On January 24, 2006, video game developer Zipper Interactive, developers of the \"Socom\" series, was acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment as part of its SCE WWS.\n\nIn March 2006, Sony announced the online network for its forthcoming PlayStation 3 (PS3) system at the 2006 PlayStation Business Briefing meeting in Tokyo, Japan, tentatively named \"PlayStation Network Platform\" and eventually called just PlayStation Network (PSN). Sony also stated that the service would always be connected, free, and include multiplayer support.\n\nThe launch date for the PS3 was announced by Hirai at the pre-Electronic Entertainment Expo conference held at Sony Pictures Studios in Los Angeles, U.S., on May 8, 2006. The PS3 was released in Japan on November 11, 2006, and the U.S. date was November 17, 2006. The PSN was also launched in November 2006.\n\nOn November 30, 2006, president of SCEI, Ken Kutaragi, was appointed as chairman of SCEI, while Hirai, then president of SCEA, was promoted to president of SCEI. On April 26, 2007, Ken Kutaragi resigned from his position as chairman of SCEI and group CEO, passing on his duties to the recently appointed president of SCE, Hirai.\n\nOn September 20, 2007, video game developers Evolution Studios and Bigbig Studios, creators of the MotorStorm series, were acquired by Sony Computer Entertainment as part of its SCE WWS.\n\nOn April 15, 2009, David Reeves, president and CEO of SCE Europe, announced his forthcoming resignation from his post. He had joined the company in 1995 and was appointed as chairman of SCEE in 2003, and then president in 2005. His role of president and CEO of SCEE would be taken over by Andrew House, who joined Sony Corporation in 1990. The PSP Go was released on October 1, 2009, for North America and Europe, and on November 1, 2009, for Japan.\n\nOn April 1, 2010, SCEI was restructured to bring together Sony's mobile electronics and personal computers divisions. The main Japanese division of SCEI was temporarily renamed \"SNE Platform Inc.\" (SNEP) on April 1, 2010, and was split into two divisions that focused on different aspects: \"Sony Computer Entertainment, Inc.\", consisting of 1,300 employees who focused on the console business, and the network service business consisting of 60 to 70 employees. The network service business of SCEI was absorbed into Sony Corp's Network Products & Service Group (NPSG), which had already been headed by Hirai since April 2009. The original SCEI was then dissolved after the restructure.\n\nThe North American and European branches of SCEI were affected by the restructure, and remained as SCEA and SCEE. Hirai, by that time SCEI CEO and Sony Corporation EVP, led both departments.\n\nOn March 2, 2010, video game developer Media Molecule, developers of the PlayStation 3 (PS3) game LittleBigPlanet, was acquired by SCEI as part of its SCE WWS. On August 23, 2010, the headquarters of the company moved from Minami-Aoyama to the (Sony Corporation's headquarters) in Kōnan, Minato, Tokyo.\n\nOn April 20, 2011, SCEI was the victim of an attack on its PlayStation Network system, which also affected its online division, Sony Online Entertainment.\n\nOn August 1, 2011, video game developer Sucker Punch Productions, developers of the Sly Cooper and Infamous series, was also acquired.\n\nOn January 2012, BigBig Studios was closed and Cambridge Studio—renamed Guerrilla Cambridge—becoming a sister studio of Guerrilla Games. On March 2012, Zipper Interactive, developers of the \"SOCOM\" series, \"MAG\" and \"Unit 13\", was closed. On June 25, 2012, Hirai retired as chairman of Sony Computer Entertainment; however, he remains on the board of directors.\n\nOn July 2, 2012, Sony Computer Entertainment acquired Gaikai, a cloud-based gaming service. On August 2012, Sony Liverpool developer of the \"Wipeout\" and \"Formula One\" series was closed.\n\nA press release was published on August 20, 2013, announcing the release date of the PlayStation 4 (PS4) console. On that date, SCEI introduced the CUH-1000A series system, and announced the launch date as November 15, 2013, for North American markets and November 29, 2013, for European, Australasian and Central and South American markets.\n\nFollowing a January 2014 announcement by the Chinese government that the country's 14-year game console ban would be lifted, the PS4 was scheduled to be the first Sony video game console to be officially and legally released in China since the PlayStation 2—the ban was enacted in 2000 to protect the mental health of young people.\n\nOn March 6, 2014, Sony Computer Entertainment of America President and CEO, Tretton, announced he was resigning from his position at the end of the month, citing a mutual agreement between himself and SCEA for the cessation of his contract. Tretton had worked at SCEA since 1995, and was a founding member of the company's executive team. He was involved in the launch of all PlayStation platforms in North America, including the original PlayStation, PS2, PSP, PS3, PSN, PS Vita, and PS4. Tretton was replaced by Shawn Layden, who was the vice-president and chief operating officer (COO) of Sony Network Entertainment International, effective April 1, 2014. On April 2, 2015, it was announced that Sony Computer Entertainment had acquired the intellectual property of the cloud gaming service OnLive, and that its services would cease by the end of the month.\n\nThe beta version of Sony's first-ever cloud-based television service, PlayStation Vue (PSVue), was launched in the U.S. in November 2014. It was only offered on an invite-only basis for PS3 and PS4 users, prior to its official launch in early 2015. Sony signed deals with major networks, including CBS, Discovery, Fox and Viacom, so that users can view live streaming video, as well as catch up and on-demand content, from more than 75 channels, such as Comedy Central and Nickelodeon. Although pricing and release dates for other regions was not publicized, Sony confirmed that PSVue will eventually be available on iPad, followed by other Sony and non-Sony devices.\n\nOn January 26, 2016, Sony announced that effective April 1, 2016, Sony Computer Entertainment and Sony Network Entertainment International would be re-organized and combined into a new company, Sony Interactive Entertainment. Unlike SCE, Sony Interactive Entertainment is based in San Mateo, California, and represents the entire PlayStation brand, regional subsidiaries, and its content operations.\n\nOn March 24, 2016, Sony announced the establishment of ForwardWorks, a new studio dedicated to producing \"full-fledged\" games based on Sony intellectual properties for mobile platforms such as smartphones.\n\nThe president, and CEO of SIE is John Kodera, replacing Andrew House, who stepped down in October 2017. House will serve as chairman until the end of 2017. House replaced Kaz Hirai as president and CEO in 2011, who himself had replaced longtime CEO Ken Kutaragi, also known as \"The Father of the PlayStation\". Kutaragi retired from his executive position at SIE on June 19, 2007, and holds the title of honorary chairman at the company. Shawn Layden and Jim Ryan currently serve as chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios and Head of Global Sales and Marketing, respectively. Shuhei Yoshida is the current president of SIE Worldwide Studios.\n\nSIE currently has three main headquarters around the world: the global headquarters in San Mateo, California, US (Sony Interactive Entertainment LLC & Sony Interactive Entertainment America); Kōnan, Minato, Tokyo, Japan (Sony Interactive Entertainment Inc. and Sony Interactive Entertainment Japan Asia) which control operations in Asia and was also formerly the headquarters for Sony Computer Entertainment; and London, United Kingdom (Sony Interactive Entertainment Europe) which controls operations in Europe and Oceania. SIE also has smaller offices and distribution centers in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, San Diego, California US; Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Melbourne, Australia; and Seocho-gu, Seoul, South Korea and Liverpool, UK.\n\nSIE evaluates and approves games for its consoles. The process is more strict than for the Nintendo Seal of Quality, and developers submit game concepts to Sony early in the design process. Each SIE unit has its own evaluation process; SIEE, for example, approved \"Billy the Wizard\" for its consumers but SIEA did not. The company sometimes imposes additional restrictions, such as when it prohibited PS and PS2 games from being ported to the PSP without 30% of content being new to the Sony console.\n\nSCEI produces the PlayStation line of video game hardware that consists of consoles and handhelds. Sony's first wide home console release, the PlayStation (codenamed \"PSX\" during development,), was initially designed to be a CD-ROM drive add-on for Nintendo's Super NES (a.k.a. \"Super Famicom\" in Japan) video game console, in response to add-ons for competing platforms such as the TurboGrafx-CD and the Sega CD (sold as the PC Engine CD-ROM² System and Mega CD in Japan respectively). When the prospect of releasing the system as an add-on dissolved, Sony redesigned the machine into a standalone unit.\n\nThe PlayStation was released in Japan on December 3, 1994, and later in North America on September 9, 1995. By the end of the console 12-year production cycle, the PlayStation had sold 102 million units.\n\nSCEI's second home console, the PlayStation 2 (PS2) was released in Japan on March 4, 2000, and later in North America and Europe in October and November 2000, respectively. The PS2 is powered by a proprietary central processing unit, the Emotion Engine, and was the first video game console to have DVD playback functionality included out of the box.\n\nThe PS2 consisted of a DVD drive and retailed in the U.S. for US$299. SCEI received heavy criticism after the launch of the PS2 due to the games released as part of the launch, difficulties that it presented for video game designers, and users who struggled to port Sega Dreamcast games to the system. However, despite these complaints, the PlayStation 2 received widespread support from third party developers throughout its lifespan on the market.\n\nOn December 28, 2012, Sony confirmed that it would cease production of the PS2 through a gradual process that started in Japan—the continuing popularity of the console in markets like Brazil and India meant that PS2 products would still be shipped, while games for the console were released in March 2013. The PS2 stands as the best-selling home video game console in history, with a total of 155 million consoles sold.\n\nWriting for the ExtremeTech website at the end of 2012, James Plafke described the PS2 as revolutionary and proclaimed that the console \"turn[ed] the gaming industry on its head\":\nAside from being the “first” next-gen console, as well as providing many, many people with their first DVD player, the PlayStation 2 launched in something of a Golden Age of the non-PC gaming industry. Gaming tech was becoming extremely sophisticated ... Sony seemingly knew the exact route toward popularity, turning the console with the least powerful hardware of that generation into a juggernaut of success.\n\nThe PlayStation Portable (PSP) was SCEI's first foray into the small handheld console market. Its development was first announced during SCE's E3 conference in 2003, and it was officially unveiled during their E3 conference on May 11, 2004. The system was released in Japan on December 12, 2004, in North America on March 24, 2005, and in Europe and Australia on September 1, 2005. The console has since seen two major redesigns, with new features including a smaller size, more internal memory, a better quality LCD screen and a lighter weight.\n\nThe launch date for the PS3 was announced by Hirai at the pre-Electronic Entertainment Expo conference held at Sony Pictures Studios in Los Angeles, U.S., on May 8, 2006. The PS3 was released in Japan on November 11, 2006, and the U.S. date was November 17, 2006. Technology journalists observed that Sony had followed what Microsoft did with the Xbox 360, and produced the PS3 in two versions: one with a 20GB hard drive and the other with a 60GB hard drive.\n\nThe PS3 utilizes a unique processing architecture, the Cell microprocessor, a proprietary technology developed by Sony in conjunction with Toshiba and IBM. The graphics processing unit, the RSX 'Reality Synthesizer', was co-developed by Nvidia and Sony. Several variations of the PS3 have been released, each with slight hardware and software differences, and each denoted by the varying size of the included hard disk drive.\n\nThe PS Vita is the successor to the PlayStation Portable. It was released in Japan and other parts of Asia on December 17, 2011, and then in Europe, Australia and North America on February 22, 2012.\n\nInternally, the Vita features a 4-core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore processor and a 4-core SGX543MP4+ graphics processing unit, as well as LiveArea software as its main user interface, which succeeds the XrossMediaBar.\n\nThe PS4 was announced as the successor to the PS3 and was launched in North America on November 15, 2013, in Europe on November 29, 2013 and in Japan on February 23, 2014.\n\nDescribed by Sony as a \"next generation\" console, the PS4 included features such as enhanced social capabilities, second-screen options involving devices like the handheld PlayStation Vita, a membership service and compatibility with the Twitch live streaming platform.\n\nFollowing a January 2014 announcement by the Chinese government that the country's 14-year game console ban would be lifted, the PS4 was scheduled to be the first Sony video game console to be officially and legally released in China since the PlayStation 2—the ban was enacted in 2000 to protect the mental health of young people. Around 70 game developers, including Ubisoft and Koei, will service Chinese PlayStation users.\n\nThe Chinese release dates and price details were announced in early December, with January 11, 2015, confirmed by SCEI. The makers announced that both the PS4 and Vita consoles will be released in China, and the former's package will also consist of a 500GB hard drive and controller.\n\nThe 20th anniversary of the original PS console was celebrated on December 6, 2014, with the release of a limited-edition, anniversary-edition PS4 with an aesthetic design that recalled the original 1994 PlayStation.\n\n\n"
