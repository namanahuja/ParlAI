                "Hulk Hogan\n\nTerry Gene Bollea (, born August 11, 1953), better known by his ring name Hulk Hogan, is an American retired professional wrestler, actor, television personality, entrepreneur and musician.\n\nHogan is regarded by many as the greatest professional wrestler of all time. According to IGN, he is \"the most recognized wrestling star worldwide and the most popular wrestler of the 1980s\". Hogan enjoyed considerable mainstream popularity between 1984 and 1993 as a face in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), which continued for the remainder of the 1990s in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), where he turned heel in 1996 and performed as the New World Order (nWo) leader \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan.\n\nA regular pay-per-view main eventer and box office draw in both organizations, Hogan headlined the premier annual events of the WWF and WCW, WrestleMania and Starrcade, multiple times; against Sting, he closed the most profitable WCW pay-per-view ever at the 1997 edition of Starrcade. Aside from those promotions, he has notably performed for the American Wrestling Association (AWA), New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). He is a twelve-time world champion: a six-time WWF World Heavyweight Champion/WWF Champion (with his last reign being as Undisputed WWF/WWE Champion) and a six-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion. He was the first wrestler to win consecutive Royal Rumbles, in 1990 and 1991, and was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2005, by Sylvester Stallone.\n\nDuring and after wrestling, Hogan had an extensive acting career, beginning with his 1982 antagonist role in \"Rocky III\". He has starred in several movies (including \"No Holds Barred\", \"Suburban Commando\" and \"Mr. Nanny\") and three television shows (\"Thunder in Paradise\", \"Hogan Knows Best\" and \"China, IL\"), as well as in Right Guard commercials and the video game, \"Hulk Hogan's Main Event\". He was also the frontman for The Wrestling Boot Band, whose sole record, \"Hulk Rules\", reached #12 on the \"Billboard\" Top Kid Audio chart in 1995. \n\nTerry Eugene Bollea was born in Augusta, Georgia on August 11, 1953, the son of construction foreman Pietro \"Peter\" Bollea (December 6, 1913 – December 18, 2001) and homemaker and dance teacher Ruth V. (\"née\" Moody; 1922 – January 1, 2011). He is of French, Italian, Panamanian, and Scottish descent. When he was one and a half years old, his family moved to Port Tampa, Florida. As a boy, he was a pitcher in Little League Baseball. He attracted scouts from the New York Yankees and the Cincinnati Reds, but an injury ended his baseball career. He began watching professional wrestling at 16 years old. While in high school, he revered Dusty Rhodes, and he regularly attended cards at the Tampa Sportatorium. It was at one of those wrestling cards where he first turned his attention towards Superstar Billy Graham and looked to him for inspiration; since he first saw Graham on TV, Hogan wanted to match his \"inhuman\" look.\n\nHogan was also a musician, spending a decade playing fretless bass guitar in several Florida-based rock bands. He went on to study at Hillsborough Community College and the University of South Florida. After music gigs began to get in the way of his time in college, Hogan decided to drop out of the University of South Florida before receiving a degree. Eventually, Hogan and two local musicians formed a band called Ruckus in 1976. The band soon became popular in the Tampa Bay region. During his spare time, Hogan worked out at Hector's Gym in the Tampa Bay area, where he began lifting. Many of the wrestlers who were competing in the Florida region visited the bars where Ruckus was performing. Among those attending his performances were Jack and Gerald Brisco, two brothers who wrestled together as a tag team in the Florida region.\n\nImpressed by Hogan's physical stature, the Brisco brothers asked Hiro Matsudathe man who trained wrestlers working for Championship Wrestling from Florida (CWF)to make him a potential trainee. In 1976, the two brothers asked Hogan to try wrestling. Hogan eventually agreed. At first, however, Mike Graham, the son of CWF promoter Eddie Graham, refused to put Hogan in the ring; according to Hogan, he met Graham while in high school and the two did not get along. However, after Hogan quit Ruckus and started telling people in town that he was going to be a wrestler, Graham finally agreed to accept the Brisco Brothers' request.\n\nIn mid-1977, after training for more than a year with Matsuda, the Brisco brothers dropped by Matsuda's gym to see Hogan. During this visit, Jack Brisco handed Hogan a pair of wrestling boots and informed him that he was scheduled to wrestle his first match the following week. In his professional wrestling debut, Eddie Graham booked him against Brian Blair in Fort Myers, Florida on August 10, 1977 in CWF. A short time later, Bollea donned a mask and assumed the persona of \"The Super Destroyer\", a hooded character first played by Don Jardine and subsequently used by other wrestlers.\n\nHogan eventually could no longer work with Hiro Matsuda, whom he felt was an overbearing trainer, and left CWF. After declining an offer to wrestle for the Kansas City circuit, Hogan took a hiatus from wrestling and managed The Anchor club, a private club in Cocoa Beach, Florida, for a man named Whitey Bridges. Eventually, Whitey and Hogan became close friends, and decided to open a gym together; the gym became known as Whitey and Terry's Olympic gym.\n\nSoon after, Hogan's friend Ed Leslie (later known as Brutus Beefcake) came to Cocoa Beach to help Hogan and Bridges manage both the Anchor Club and the Whitey and Terry's Olympic Gym. On his spare time, he and Leslie worked out in the gym together, and eventually, Beefcake developed a muscular physique; Hogan was impressed by Beefcake's physical stature and became convinced that the two of them should wrestle together as tag team partners. Depressed and yearning to return to wrestling, Hogan called Superstar Billy Graham in 1978 with hopes that Graham could find him a job wrestling outside of Florida; Graham agreed and Hogan soon joined Louie Tillet's Alabama territory. Hogan also convinced Leslie, who had yet to become a wrestler, to come with him and promised to teach him everything he knew about the sport.\n\nIn Alabama, Bollea and Leslie wrestled as Terry and Ed Boulder, known as The Boulder Brothers. These early matches as a tag team with the surname Boulder being used by both men prompted a rumor among wrestling fans unaware of the inner workings of the sport that Hogan and Leslie were brothers, as few people actually knew their real names outside of immediate friends, family, and the various promoters the two worked for. After wrestling a show for Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) in Memphis, Jerry Jarrett, the promoter for the CWA, approached Hogan and Leslie and offered them a job in his promotion for $800 a week; this was far more than the $175 a week they would make working for Tillet. Hogan and Leslie accepted this offer and left Tillet's territory.\n\nDuring his time in Memphis, Hogan appeared on a local talk show, where he sat beside Lou Ferrigno, star of the television series \"The Incredible Hulk\". The host commented on how Hogan, who stood 6 ft 7 in (201 cm) and weighed 295 pounds with 24 inch biceps, actually dwarfed \"The Hulk\". Watching the show backstage, Mary Jarrett noticed that Hogan was actually bigger than Ferrigno, who was well known at the time for having large muscles. As a result, Bollea began performing as Terry \"The Hulk\" Boulder and sometimes wrestled as Sterling Golden.\n\nIn May 1979, Bollea had an early shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, which at the time was generally recognized as the highest honor in wrestling, against Harley Race. On December 1, 1979, Bollea won his first professional wrestling championship, the NWA Southeastern Heavyweight Championship (Northern Division), recognized in Alabama and Tennessee, when he defeated Bob Roop in Knoxville, Tennessee. Bollea would drop the title in January 1980 to Bob Armstrong. Bollea briefly wrestled in the Georgia Championship Wrestling (GCW) territory from September thru December 1979 as Sterling Golden.\n\nLater that year, former NWA World Heavyweight Champion Terry Funk introduced Bollea to the company owner/promoter Vincent J. McMahon, who was impressed with his charisma and physical stature. McMahon, who wanted to use an Irish name, gave Bollea the last name Hogan, and also wanted him to dye his hair red. Hogan claims his hair was already beginning to fall out by that time, and he refused to dye it, simply replying, \"I'll be a blond Irish\". Hogan wrestled his first match in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) on November 17 defeating Harry Valdez on \"Championship Wrestling\". He made his first appearance at Madison Square Garden, defeating Ted DiBiase after a bearhug. After the match, Hogan thanked DiBiase for putting him over and told him that he \"owed him one\", a favor that he would end up repaying during DiBiase's second run with the company in the late 1980s and early 1990s as \"The Million Dollar Man\". McMahon gave Hogan former tag team champion Tony Altomare as chaperone and guide. At this time, Hogan wrestled Bob Backlund for the WWF Heavyweight Championship, and he started his first big feud with André the Giant, which culminated in a match with André at Shea Stadium in August 1980. During his initial run as a villain in the WWF, Hogan was paired with \"Classy\" Freddie Blassie, a wrestler-turned-manager.\n\nIn 1980, Hogan began appearing in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) where Japanese wrestling fans nicknamed him \"Ichiban\" (which translates to \"Number One\"). Hogan first appeared on May 13, 1980, while he was still with the WWF. He occasionally toured the country over the next few years, facing a wide variety of opponents ranging from Tatsumi Fujinami to Abdullah the Butcher. When competing in Japan, Hogan used a vastly different repertoire of wrestling moves, relying on more technical, traditional wrestling holds and maneuvers as opposed to the power-based, brawling style American fans became accustomed to seeing from him. In addition, Hogan used the \"Axe Bomber\", a crooked arm lariat, as his finisher in Japan instead of the running leg drop that has been his standard finisher in America. Hogan still made appearances for the WWF, even unsuccessfully challenging Pedro Morales for the Intercontinental Championship on March 26, 1981. On June 2, 1983, Hogan became the first International Wrestling Grand Prix (IWGP) tournament winner (although he held the IWGP Heavyweight Championship belt, this was not the beginning of the actual championship), defeating Antonio Inoki by knockout in the finals of a ten-man tournament. Hogan and Inoki also worked as partners in Japan, winning the MSG Tag League tournament two years in a row: in 1982 and 1983. In 1984, Hogan returned to NJPW to wrestle Inoki in the finals of the IWGP League, in which he lost the title belt by countout, thanks to interference from Riki Choshu. Hogan also defended his WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Inoki, Seiji Sakaguchi, and Tatsumi Fujinami among others, until the WWF ended their relationship with New Japan in October 1985.\n\nAfter filming his scene for \"Rocky III\" against the elder McMahon's wishes, Hogan made his debut in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), owned by Verne Gagne. Hogan started his AWA run as a villain, taking on \"Luscious\" Johnny Valiant as his manager. This did not last for long as the AWA fans fell in love with Hogan's presence and Hogan became the top fan favorite of the AWA, battling the Heenan Family and Nick Bockwinkel.\n\nHogan's turn as a fan favorite came at the end of July 1981, when during a television taping that aired in August, Jerry Blackwell, after suffering a pinfall loss to Brad Rheingans, began beating down Rheingans and easily fighting off anyone who tried to run in for the save; however, Hogan ran in, got the upper hand and ran Blackwell from the ring. Hogan was eventually victorious in his feud with Blackwell and by the end of 1981, gained his first title matches against Bockwinkel, and as word began spreading about Hogan's prolific role in the soon-to-be-released \"Rocky III\", Hogan's star power only grew.\n\nIt was through those encounters that Hogan began matching wits with Bobby Heenan, a man that he would feud with throughout the remainder of the 1980s.\n\nAfter purchasing the company from his father in 1982, Vincent K. McMahon had plans to expand the territory into a nationwide promotion, and he handpicked Hogan to be the company's showpiece attraction due to his charisma and name recognition. Hogan made his return at a television taping in St. Louis, Missouri on December 27, 1983 defeating Bill Dixon.\n\nOn the January 7, 1984, episode of \"Championship Wrestling\", Hogan confirmed his fan favorite status for the WWF fans by saving Bob Backlund from a three-way assault by The Wild Samoans. Hogan's turn was explained simply by Backlund: \"He's changed his ways. He's a great man. He's told me he's not gonna have Blassie around\". The storyline shortcut was necessary because less than three weeks later on January 23, Hogan won his first WWF World Heavyweight Championship, pinning The Iron Sheik (who had Blassie in his corner) in Madison Square Garden. The storyline accompanying the victory was that Hogan was a \"last minute\" replacement for the Sheik's original opponent Bob Backlund, and became the champion by way of being the first man to escape the camel clutch (the Iron Sheik's finishing move). The backstage story was that then champion Bob Backlund had refused to let Hogan win the title from him, demanding that any wrestler to whom he lost the title have a legitimate wrestling background. As a consequence, The Iron Sheik won the title from Backlund first and then dropped it to Hogan. However, this was mostly made to not make two fan favorites face each other.\nImmediately after the title win, commentator Gorilla Monsoon proclaimed: \"Hulkamania is here!\". Hogan frequently referred to his fans as \"Hulkamaniacs\" in his interviews and introduced his three \"demandments\": training, saying prayers, and eating vitamins. Eventually, a fourth demandment (believing in oneself) was added during his feud with Earthquake in 1990. Hogan's ring gear developed a characteristic yellow-and-red color scheme; his ring entrances involved him ritualistically ripping his shirt off his body, flexing, and listening for audience cheers in an exaggerated manner. The majority of Hogan's matches during this time involved him wrestling heels who had been booked as unstoppable monsters, using a format which became near-routine: Hogan would deliver steady offense, but eventually lose momentum, seemingly nearing defeat. After being hit with his opponent's finishing move, he would then experience a sudden second wind, fighting back while \"feeding\" off the energy of the audience, becoming impervious to attack a process described as \"Hulking up\". His signature maneuvers pointing at the opponent (which would later be accompanied by a loud \"you!\" from the audience), shaking his finger to scold him, three punches, an Irish whip, the big boot and running leg drop – would follow and ensure him a victory. That finishing sequence would occasionally change depending on the storyline and opponent; for instance, with \"giant\" wrestlers, the sequence might involve a body slam.\n\nIn 1984, similarities between Hogan's character and that of The Incredible Hulk led to an quitclaim deal between Titan Sports, Marvel Comics and himself wherein Marvel obtained the trademarks \"Hulk Hogan\", \"Hulkster\" and \"Hulkamania\" for 20 years, and Titan agreed to no longer refer to him as \"incredible\" nor simply \"Hulk\" or ever dress him in purple or green. Marvel also subsequently received .9% of reportable gross merchandise revenue associated with Hogan, $100 for each of his matches and 10% of Titan's portion of his other earnings under this name (or 10% of the earnings, if Titan held no interest). In 1988's \"Marvel Comics Presents #45\", Hogan was tossed through an arena roof by The Incredible Hulk, because he \"picked the wrong name.\"\n\nOver the next year, Hogan became the face of professional wrestling as McMahon pushed the WWF into a pop culture enterprise with The Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection on MTV, drawing record houses, pay-per-view buyrates, and television ratings in the process. The centerpiece attraction for the first WrestleMania on March 31, 1985, Hogan teamed with legit friend, TV and movie star Mr. T to defeat his archrival \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and \"Mr Wonderful\" Paul Orndorff when \"Cowboy\" Bob Orton, who had been in the corner of Piper and Orndorff, accidentally caused his team's defeat by knocking out Orndorff after he jumped from the top turnbuckle and hit him in the back of the head with his arm cast in a shot meant for Hogan. On the first episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", Hogan successfully defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Orton in a match that Hogan won by disqualification.\n\nHogan was named the most requested celebrity of the 1980s for the Make-a-Wish Foundation children's charity. He was featured on the covers of \"Sports Illustrated\" (the first and as of 2013, only professional wrestler to do so), \"TV Guide\", and \"People\" magazines, while also appearing on \"The Tonight Show\" and having his own CBS Saturday morning cartoon titled \"Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling\". Hogan, as the premier WWF icon, headlined seven of the first eight WrestleMania events. He also co-hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" on March 30, 1985 during this lucrative run. AT&T reported that the 900 number information line he ran while with the WWF was the single biggest 900 number from 1991 to 1993. Hogan continued to run a 900 number after joining World Championship Wrestling.\n\nOn the October 5, 1985 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", he successfully defended the title against Nikolai Volkoff in a flag match. He met long-time rival Roddy Piper in a WWF title match at the Wrestling Classic pay-per-view (PPV) event. Hogan retained the title by disqualification after Bob Orton interfered and hit Hogan with his cast. Hogan had many challengers in the way as the new year began. Throughout 1986, Hogan made successful title defenses against challengers such as Terry Funk, Don Muraco, King Kong Bundy (in a steel cage match at WrestleMania 2), Paul Orndorff, and Hercules Hernandez.\n\nIn the fall of 1986, Hogan occasionally wrestled in tag team matches with The Machines as Hulk Machine under a mask copied from NJPW's gimmick \"Super Strong Machine\". At WrestleMania III in 1987, Hogan was booked to defend the title against André the Giant, who had been the sport's premier star and was pushed as undefeated for the previous fifteen years. A new storyline was introduced in early 1987; Hogan was presented a trophy for being the WWF World Heavyweight Champion for three consecutive years. André the Giant, who was Hogan's good friend, came out to congratulate him. Shortly afterward, André was presented a slightly smaller trophy for being \"undefeated in the WWF for 15 years\". Hogan came out to congratulate André, who walked out in the midst of Hogan's speech. Then, on an edition of \"Piper's Pit\", Hogan was confronted by Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan, who announced that André was his new protégé, and Andre challenged Hogan to a title match at WrestleMania III, where Hogan successfully defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against André the Giant. During the match, Hogan hit a body slam on the 520-pound André (which was dubbed \"the bodyslam heard around the world\") and won the match after a leg drop.\n\nHogan remained WWF World Heavyweight Champion for four years (1,474 days). In front of 33 million viewers, however, Hogan finally lost the title to André on the February 5 episode of \"The Main Event\" after a convoluted scam involving \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase and Earl Hebner (who assumed the place of his twin brother Dave Hebner, the match's appointed referee). After André delivered a belly to belly suplex on Hogan, Hebner counted the pin while Hogan's left shoulder was clearly off the mat. After the match, André handed the title over to DiBiase to complete their business deal. As a result, the WWF World Heavyweight Championship was vacated for the first time in its 25-year history because then WWF President Jack Tunney decreed the championship could not be sold from one wrestler to another. At WrestleMania IV, Hogan participated in a tournament for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship to regain it; he and André were given a bye into quarter-finals, but their match resulted in a double disqualification. Later that night in the main event, Hogan came to ringside to stop André interfering which helped \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage defeat Ted DiBiase to win the title.\n\nTogether, Hogan, Savage, and manager Miss Elizabeth formed a partnership known as The Mega Powers. After Savage became WWF World Heavyweight Champion at WrestleMania IV, they feuded with The Mega Bucks (André the Giant and Ted DiBiase) and defeated them at the main event of the first SummerSlam. They then went on to feud with Slick's Twin Towers: Akeem and Big Boss Man.\n\nIn mid-1988, Hogan wrestled at house shows in singles competition with his \"War Bonnet\", a red and yellow gladiator helmet with a fist-shaped crest. This was notably used to give Bad News Brown his first WWF loss at a Madison Square Garden house show before it was discarded altogether. The War Bonnet gimmick was revisited in the WWE's online comedy series \"Are You Serious?\" in 2012.\n\nThe Mega Powers began to implode due to Savage's burgeoning jealousy of Hogan and his paranoid suspicions that Hogan and Elizabeth were more than friends. At the Royal Rumble in 1989, Hogan eliminated Savage from the Royal Rumble match while eliminating Bad News Brown, which caused tension, only to be eliminated by The Twin Towers himself. In early 1989, the duo broke up while wrestling The Twin Towers on the February 3 episode of \"The Main Event\", when Savage accidentally collided with Miss Elizabeth during the match, and Hogan took her backstage to receive medical attention, temporarily abandoning Savage, who slapped Hogan and left the ring, where Hogan eventually won the match by himself. After the match, Savage attacked Hogan backstage, which started a feud between the two. Their feud culminated in Hogan beating Savage for his second WWF World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania V.\n\nHogan's second run in 1989 lasted a year, during which he defended the title in two matches against Savage in April that he lost both times by countout, before defeating Big Boss Man in a steel cage match on the April 25 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", which was aired on May 27. In May on \"WWF on NESN\", Hogan retained the title by losing once again by countout against Savage. This was also the last time the WWF World Heavyweight Championship was referred to as such during a televised title defense, as Hogan's next successful title defense against The Honky Tonk Man on the July 18 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" saw the title being renamed and referred simply as the WWF Championship. Also during Hogan's second reign as champion, he starred in the movie \"No Holds Barred\", which was the inspiration of a feud with Hogan's co-star Tom Lister, Jr., who appeared at wrestling events as his movie character, Zeus (an \"unstoppable monster\" who was \"jealous\" over Hogan's higher billing and wanted revenge). However, Hogan was easily able to defeat Zeus in a series of matches across the country during late 1989, beginning with a tag team match at SummerSlam, in which Hogan and Brutus Beefcake topped Zeus and Savage. Hogan and Zeus would later meet at the Survivor Series, where the \"Hulkamaniacs\" faced the \"Million Dollar Team\"; in the early part of the match, Hogan put Zeus over by hitting him with everything to no effect before Zeus then dominated Hogan until Zeus was disqualified by referee Dave Hebner. Hogan and Beefcake then defeated Zeus and Savage in a rematch at the No Holds Barred pay-per-view to end the feud. Hogan also had defeated Savage to retain the WWF Championship in their official WrestleMania rematch on October 10, at United Kingdom-only pay-per-view First WWF UK Event at London Arena. During his second reign as the WWF Champion, Hogan won the 1990 Royal Rumble match, before dropping the title to then Intercontinental Champion The Ultimate Warrior in a title versus title match at WrestleMania VI on April 1, 1990.\n\nHogan soon became embroiled in a heated feud with the 468-pound Earthquake, who had crushed Hogan's ribs in a sneak attack on \"The Brother Love Show\" in May 1990. On television, announcers explained that Hogan's injuries and his WrestleMania VI loss to Warrior both took such a huge toll on his fighting spirit that he wanted to retire. Viewers were asked to write letters to Hogan and send postcards asking for his return (they got a postcard-sized picture in return, autographed by Hogan, as a \"thank you\"). Hogan returned by SummerSlam, and he for several months dominated Earthquake in a series of matches across the country. His defeat of this overwhelmingly large foe caused Hogan to add a fourth demandment – believing in yourself, and he also became known as \"The Immortal\" Hulk Hogan. Hogan became the first wrestler to win two Royal Rumble matches in a row, as he won the 1991 Royal Rumble match. At WrestleMania VII, Hogan stood up for the United States against Sgt. Slaughter, defeating him for his third WWF Championship, and then defeating him again in the rematch at United Kingdom-only pay-per-vew UK Rampage at London Arena. In the fall of 1991, Hogan was challenged by Ric Flair, the former NWA World Heavyweight Champion who recently arrived in the WWF. The feud remained unresolved, as Hogan lost the WWF Championship to The Undertaker at Survivor Series, and he won it back at This Tuesday in Texas six days later. Flair had interfered in both matches and due to the resulting controversy, the title was again declared vacant. The WWF Championship was decided at the 1992 Royal Rumble in the Royal Rumble match, but Hogan failed to regain the championship as he was eliminated by friend Sid Justice and in turn caused Sid to be eliminated, leaving Flair the winner and new champion. Hogan and Sid patched things up and teamed together on the February 8 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" against Flair and Undertaker, but during the match Sid abandoned Hogan, starting their feud. At WrestleMania VIII, Hogan defeated Sid via disqualification due to interference by Sid's manager Harvey Wippleman. Hogan was then attacked by Papa Shango and was saved by the returning Ultimate Warrior.\n\nAt this time, news sources began to allege that Dr. George Zahorian, a doctor for the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission, had been selling steroids illegally to wrestlers in general and Hogan in particular. Hogan appeared on an episode of \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" to deny the allegations. Due to intense public scrutiny, Hogan took a leave of absence from the company. Hogan returned to the WWF in February 1993, helping out his friend Brutus Beefcake in his feud with Money Inc. (Irwin R. Schyster and \"The Million Dollar Man\" Ted DiBiase), and officially renaming themselves The Mega-Maniacs, taking on Money Inc.'s former manager \"The Mouth of the South\" Jimmy Hart (a long time friend of Hogan's outside of wrestling) as their manager in what was the first time WWF audiences had seen Hart as a fan favorite. At WrestleMania IX, Hogan and Beefcake took on Money Inc. for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Hogan went into the match sporting a cut above a black eye. The WWF used Hogan's injury in a storyline that had DiBiase allegedly paying a group of thugs in a failed attempt to take Hogan out before WrestleMania. Later that night, Hogan won his fifth WWF Championship by pinning Yokozuna only moments after Yokozuna had defeated Bret Hart.\n\nAt the first annual King of the Ring pay-per-view on June 13, Hogan defended the championship against the former champion Yokozuna in his first title defense since defeating him at WrestleMania IX. Yokozuna kicked out of Hogan's signature leg drop and scored the pinfall win after Hogan was blinded by a fireball shot by a \"Japanese photographer\" (actually a disguised Harvey Wippleman). The victorious Yokozuna proceeded to give Hogan a \"Banzai Drop\". This was Hogan's last WWF pay-per-view appearance until 2002, as both he and Jimmy Hart were preparing to leave the promotion. Hogan continued his feud on the international house show circuit with Yokozuna until August 1993. After that, Hogan sat out the rest of his contract which expired later that year.\n\nOn May 3, 1993, Hogan returned to NJPW as WWF Champion and defeated IWGP Heavyweight Champion The Great Muta in a dream match at Wrestling Dontaku. Hogan wrestled against Muta again, this time under his real name (Keiji Mutoh), on September 26, 1993. Hogan also wrestled The Hell Raisers with Muta and Masahiro Chono as his tag team partners. His last match in Japan was on January 4, 1994 at Battlefield, when he defeated Tatsumi Fujinami.\n\nIn June 1994, Hogan signed with Ted Turner's World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and began appearing on television the next month, when he won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in his debut match, defeating Ric Flair in a \"dream match\" at Bash at the Beach. Hogan continued his feud with Flair (who defeated him by countout on the \"Clash of the Champions XXVIII\", thus Hogain retained the title), which culminated in a steel cage match (with Flair's career on the line and Mr. T as the special guest referee) that Hogan won. After Hogan headlined WCW's premier annual event Starrcade (Starrcade: Triple Threat) in December 1994 by defeating The Butcher for the title, his next feud was against Vader, who challenged him for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at SuperBrawl V, where Hogan won by disqualification after the returning Flair's interference. Hogan then defeated Vader (who was managed part-time by Flair) in a non-title leather strap match at Uncensored. Because of the controversial ending caused once again by Flair at Uncensored, Hogan's feud with Vader culminated in a steel cage match for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Bash at the Beach, where Hogan won by escpaing the cage. After successfully retaining the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against Big Bubba Rogers and Lex Luger in two separate matches on \"Nitro\" in September 1995, Hogan feuded with The Dungeon of Doom, which led to a WarGames match at Fall Brawl where Hogan's team (Lex Luger, Randy Savage, and Sting) won. Hogan's fifteen-month title reign (which is the longest WCW World Heavyweight Championship reign in the title history at 469 days) ended when he dropped the title to The Giant at Halloween Havoc via disqualification.\n\nFollowing the controversial loss (which was due to a \"contract clause\"), the WCW World Heavyweight Championship became vacant and a new champion to be crowned in a 60-man three-ring battle royal at World War III, where The Giant cost Hogan the title. This led to a steel cage match between Hogan and The Giant at SuperBrawl VI, where Hogan won to end their feud. In early 1996, Hogan reformed The Mega Powers with Randy Savage to feud with The Alliance to End Hulkamania, which culminated at Uncensored in a Doomsday Cage match that Hogan and Savage won. After coming out victorious from his feuds, Hogan began to only appear occasionally on WCW programming.\n\nAt Bash at the Beach in 1996, during a six-man tag team match pitting The Outsiders (Kevin Nash and Scott Hall) against WCW loyalists, Hogan interfered on behalf of Nash and Hall, attacking Randy Savage, thereby becoming a villainous character for the first time in nearly fifteen years. After the match, Hogan delivered a promo, accosting the fans and WCW for under-appreciating his talent and drawing power, and announcing the formation of the New World Order (nWo). The new stable gained prominence in the following weeks and months. Hogan grew a beard alongside his famous mustache and dyed it black, traded his red and yellow garb in for black and white clothing, often detailed with lightning bolts, and renamed himself \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan (often shortened to Hollywood Hogan). Hogan won his second WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Hog Wild defeating The Giant for the title. He spray painted \"nWo\" across the title belt, scribbled across the nameplate, and referred to the title as the \"nWo title\". Hogan then started a feud with Lex Luger after Luger and The Giant defeated Hogan and Dennis Rodman in a tag team match at Bash at the Beach.\n\nOn the August 4, 1997, episode of \"Nitro\", Hogan lost the title to Luger by submission. Five days later at Road Wild, Hogan defeated Luger to regain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Hogan then lost the title to Sting in a match at Starrcade. In the match, WCW's newly contracted Bret Hart accused referee Nick Patrick of fast-counting a victory for Hogan and had the match restarted – with himself as referee. Sting later won by submission. After a rematch the following night on \"Nitro\", where Sting controversially retained the title, the WCW World Heavyweight Championship became vacant. Sting went on to win the vacant title against Hogan at SuperBrawl VIII, and Hogan then developed a rivalry with former friend (and recent nWo recruit) Randy Savage, who had just cost Hogan the title match at SuperBrawl by hitting him with a spray can. The feud culminated in a steel cage match at Uncensored, which ended in a no contest. Savage took the WCW World Heavyweight Championship from Sting at Spring Stampede, while Hogan teamed with Kevin Nash to take on Roddy Piper and The Giant in the first-ever bat match.\n\nHogan betrayed Nash by hitting him with the bat and then challenged Savage the following night on \"Nitro\" for the world title. In the no disqualification match for Savage's newly won title, Nash entered the ring and hit a powerbomb on Hogan as retribution for the attack the previous night, but Bret Hart interfered moments later and jumped in to attack Savage and preserve the victory for Hogan, who won his fourth WCW World Heavyweight Championship. However, Nash's attack on him signified a split of the nWo into two separate factions – Hogan's became nWo Hollywood and Nash's became nWo Wolfpac that feuded with each other for the remainder of the year. Hogan defended the title until July of that year, when WCW booked him in a match against newcomer and then WCW United States Heavyweight Champion Goldberg, who had yet to lose a match in the company. Late in the match, Hogan was distracted by Karl Malone, and Goldberg pinned Hogan to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.\nHogan spent the rest of 1998 wrestling celebrity matches: his second tag team match with Dennis Rodman pitted them against Diamond Dallas Page and Karl Malone at Bash at the Beach, and at Road Wild he and Eric Bischoff lost to Page and Jay Leno thanks to interference from Kevin Eubanks. Hogan also had a critically panned rematch with The Warrior at Halloween Havoc, where his nephew Horace aided his victory.\n\nOn the Thanksgiving episode of \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\", Hogan officially announced his retirement from professional wrestling, as well as his candidacy for President of the United States. Campaign footage aired on \"Nitro\" of Hogan and Bischoff holding a press conference, making it appear legitimate. In the long run, however, both announcements were false and merely done as a publicity stunt attempting to draw some of the hype of Jesse Ventura's Minnesota gubernatorial win back to him. After some time off from WCW, Hogan returned on the January 4, 1999, episode of \"Nitro\" to challenge Kevin Nash for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship which Hogan won for the fifth time, but many people found the title change to be \"scandalous\". As a result, the warring factions of the nWo reunited into one group, which began feuding with Goldberg and The Four Horsemen.\n\nHogan lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to Ric Flair at Uncensored in a steel cage First Blood match. Later, Hogan was severely injured in a Texas tornado match for the world title featuring him, Diamond Dallas Page, Flair, and Sting at Spring Stampede On the July 12 episode of \"Nitro\", Hogan made his return as a fan favorite for the first time in three years and accepted an open challenge from Savage, who had gained the world title at Bash at the Beach the night before in a tag team match by pinning Kevin Nash. Thanks to interference from Nash, Hogan defeated Savage to win his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship. However, Nash turned on him the next week, and the two began a feud that lasted until Road Wild.\n\nOn August 9, 1999, Hogan started the night dressed in the typical black and white, but after a backstage scene with his son came out dressed in the traditional red and yellow for his main event six-man tag team match. Hogan then defeated Nash in a retirement match at Road Wild to retain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Injuries and frustrations were mounting up however, and he was absent from television from October 1999 to February 2000. In his book \"Hollywood Hulk Hogan\", Bollea said that he was asked to take time off by newly hired head of creative booking Vince Russo and was not told when he would be brought back at the time. Despite some reservations, he agreed to do so. On October 24 at Halloween Havoc, Hogan was to face Sting for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. However, Hogan came to the ring in street clothes, lay down for the pin, and left the ring.\nSoon after his return in February 2000, at Bash at the Beach on July 9, Hogan was involved in a controversial work with Vince Russo. Hogan was scheduled to challenge Jeff Jarrett for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Before the match, there was a backstage dispute between Hogan and Russo; Hogan wanted to take the title, but Russo was going to have Jarrett win, and lose it to Booker T. Russo told Hogan that he was going to have Jarrett lie down for him, simulating a real conflict, although Jarrett was not told it was a work. When the bell rang, Jarrett lay down in the middle of the ring while Russo threw the WCW World Heavyweight Championship belt in the ring and yelled at Hogan from ringside to pin Jarrett. A visibly confused Hogan complied with a foot on Jarrett's chest after getting on the microphone and telling Russo, \"Is this your idea, Russo? That's why this company is in the damn shape it's in, because of bullshit like this!\" After winning and being announced as the new WCW World Heavyweight Champion, Hogan immediately took the WCW title belt. Moments later, Russo returned to the ring, angrily proclaiming, \"I can guarantee you that this is the last time you will ever see that piece of shit in a WCW stadium!\" This is also when the public discovered, through Russo, the \"creative control\" clause that Hogan had, which meant that Hogan was able to control what would happen with his own character and be able to do so without anyone else being able to tell him no. In his Bash at the Beach shoot promo, Russo said that he was arguing with Hogan all day prior to the event in the back because he wanted to use the clause in the Jarrett match, saying, \"That means that, in the middle of this ring, when [Hogan] knew it was bullshit, he beats Jeff Jarrett!\". Since Hogan refused to job to Jarrett, a new WCW World Heavyweight Championship was created, setting the stage for a title match between Booker T and Jarrett later that night.\n\nAs a result, Hogan filed a defamation of character lawsuit against Russo soon after, which was eventually dismissed in 2002. Russo claims the whole thing was a work, and Hogan claims that Russo made it a shoot. Eric Bischoff agreed with Hogan's side of the story when he wrote that Hogan winning and leaving with the belt was a work (devised by Bischoff rather than Russo), and that he and Hogan celebrated after the event over the success of the angle, but that Russo coming out to fire Hogan was an unplanned shoot which led to the lawsuit filed by Hogan. It was the last time he was seen in WCW.\n\nIn the months following the eventual demise of WCW in March 2001, Hogan underwent surgery on his knees in order for him to wrestle again. As a test, Hogan worked a match in Orlando, Florida for the Xcitement Wrestling Federation (XWF) promotion run by his longtime handler Jimmy Hart. Hogan defeated Curt Hennig in this match and felt healthy enough to accept an offer to return to the WWF in February 2002.\n\nAt No Way Out in February 2002, Hogan returned to the WWF. Returning as leader of the original nWo with Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, the three got into a confrontation with The Rock and cost Stone Cold Steve Austin a chance at becoming the Undisputed WWF Champion against Chris Jericho in the main event. The nWo feuded with both Austin and The Rock, and Hogan accepted The Rock's challenge to a match at WrestleMania X8, where Hogan asked Hall and Nash not to interfere, wanting to defeat The Rock by himself. Despite the fact that Hogan was supposed to be the villain in the match, the crowd cheered for him heavily. The Rock cleanly won the contest, and befriended Hogan at the end of the bout and helped him fight off Hall and Nash, who were upset by Hogan's conciliatory attitude. After the match, Hogan was a definite fan favorite again, siding with The Rock, though he continued wearing black and white tights for a few weeks after WrestleMania X8 until he resumed wearing his signature red and yellow tights. During this period, the \"Hulk Rules\" logo of the 1980s was redone with the text \"Hulk Still Rules\", and Hogan also wore the original \"Hulk Rules\" attire twelve years earlier, when he headlined WrestleMania VI at the same arena, in the SkyDome. For a time, he was still known as \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan, notably keeping the Hollywood Hogan style blond mustache with black beard while wearing Hulkamania-like red and yellow tights and using the \"Voodoo Child\" entrance theme music he used in WCW. On April 4, Hogan feuded with Triple H and defeated him for the Undisputed WWF Championship and sixth and final WWF Championship at Backlash, thus becoming the last ever WWF Champion before the initials dispute against the World Wildlife Fund For Nature.\n\nOn May 19 at Judgment Day, Hogan lost the title to The Undertaker. After losing a number one contender match for the WWE Undisputed Championship to Triple H on June 6, Hogan began feuding with Kurt Angle resulting in a match between the two at the King of the Ring, which Angle won by submission. On the July 4 episode of \"SmackDown!\", Hogan teamed with Edge to defeat Billy and Chuck and capture the WWE Tag Team Championship for the first time. They celebrated by waving the American flag as the overjoyed audience sang along to Hogan's theme song \"Real American\". They later dropped the titles to The Un-Americans (Christian and Lance Storm), at Vengeance. In August 2002, Hogan was used in an angle with Brock Lesnar, culminating in a main event singles match, which Lesnar won by submission (the match was called after Hogan became unconscious from a bear hug hold). Lesnar became only the second WWE wrestler to defeat Hogan by submission (after Kurt Angle), and the first to defeat Hogan by having the match called. Following the match, Lesnar continued to beat on Hogan, leaving him bloody and unconscious in the ring.\n\nAs a result of Lesnar's assault, Hogan went on hiatus and was not able to return until early 2003, shaving off his black beard and dropping \"Hollywood\" from his name in his return. Hogan battled The Rock (who had turned villainous) once again at No Way Out and defeated Mr. McMahon at WrestleMania XIX in a match billed as \"twenty years in the making\". After WrestleMania XIX, he had a run as the masked Mr. America, who was supposed to be Hogan in disguise, wearing a mask. He used Hogan's \"Real American\" as entrance theme and all of Hogan's signature gestures, moves, and phrases. He was the subject of a storyline that took place after Hogan was forced by Mr. McMahon to sit out the rest of his contract. A WWE pre-debut push took place with mysterious Mr. America promos airing for weeks during \"SmackDown!\". There was also on-screen discussion on \"SmackDown!\" between then General Manager Stephanie McMahon and other players concerning her hiring Mr. America \"sight unseen\". On May 1, Mr. America debuted on \"SmackDown!\" on a \"Piper's Pit\" segment. McMahon appeared and claimed that Mr. America was Hogan in disguise; Mr. America shot back by saying, \"I am not Hulk Hogan, brother!\" (lampooning Hogan's use of \"brother\" in his promos). The feud continued through the month of May, with a singles match between Mr. America and Hogan's old rival Roddy Piper at Judgment Day.\n\nMr. America's last WWE appearance was on the June 26 episode of \"SmackDown!\" when Big Show and The World's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) defeated Brock Lesnar, Kurt Angle, and Mr. America in a six-man tag team match. After the show went off the air, Mr. America unmasked to show the fans that he was indeed Hogan, putting his finger to his lips telling the fans to keep quiet about his secret. The next week, Hogan quit WWE due to frustration with the creative team. On the July 3 episode of \"SmackDown!\", McMahon showed the footage of Mr. America unmasking as Hogan and \"fired\" him, although Hogan had already quit in real life. It was later revealed that Hogan was unhappy with the payoffs for his matches after his comeback under the Mr. America gimmick. McMahon decided to terminate Hogan's contract and Hogan left WWE in 2003.\n\nHogan returned to NJPW in October 2003, when he defeated Masahiro Chono at Ultimate Crush II in the Tokyo Dome.\n\nShortly after Hogan left WWE, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) began making overtures to Hogan, culminating in Jeff Jarrett, co-founder of TNA and then NWA World Heavyweight Champion, launching an on-air attack on Hogan in Japan in October 2003. The attack was supposed to be a precursor to Hogan battling Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at TNA's first three-hour pay-per-view. However, due to recurring knee and hip problems, Hogan did not appear in TNA. Still, the incident has been shown several times on TNA broadcasts, and was included in the TNA DVD \"TNA's Fifty Greatest Moments\".\n\nOn April 2, 2005, Hogan was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by actor and friend Sylvester Stallone. At WrestleMania 21 on April 3, Hogan came out to rescue Eugene, who was being attacked by Muhammad Hassan and Khosrow Daivari. The build-up to Hogan's Hall of Fame induction and preparation for his WrestleMania angle was shown on the first season of \"Hogan Knows Best\". The next night on \"Raw\", Hassan and Daivari came out to confront and assault fan favorite Shawn Michaels. The following week on \"Raw\", Michaels approached Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff demanding a handicap match with Hassan and Daivari. Bischoff refused, but told Michaels if he found a partner he would be granted a tag team match. Michaels then made a plea for Hogan to team with him. On the April 18 episode of \"Raw\", Hassan again led an attack on Michaels until Hogan appeared, saving Michaels and accepting his offer. At Backlash, Hassan and Daivari lost to Hogan and Michaels.\n\nHogan then appeared on July 4 episode of \"Raw\", as the special guest of Carlito on his talk-show segment \"Carlito's Cabana\". After being asked questions by Carlito concerning his daughter Brooke, Hogan attacked Carlito. Kurt Angle then also appeared, making comments about Brooke, which further upset Hogan, who was eventually double teamed by Carlito and Angle, but was saved by Shawn Michaels. Later that night, Michaels and Hogan defeated Carlito and Angle in a tag team match; during the post-match celebration, Michaels performed the \"Sweet Chin Music\" on Hogan and walked off. The following week on \"Raw\", Michaels appeared on \"Piper's Pit\" and challenged Hogan to face him one-on-one for the first time. Hogan appeared on \"Raw\" one week later and accepted the challenge. The match took place at SummerSlam, which Hogan won. After the match, Michaels extended his hand to him, telling him that he \"had to find out for himself\", and Hogan and Michaels shook hands as Michaels left the ring to allow Hogan to celebrate with the crowd.\n\nPrior to WrestleMania 22 in April 2006, Hogan inducted friend and former announcer \"Mean\" Gene Okerlund into the WWE Hall of Fame. Hogan returned on the July 15 episode of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\" with his daughter Brooke. During the show, Randy Orton kayfabe flirted with Brooke and later attacked Hogan in the parking lot. He later challenged Hogan to a match at SummerSlam, which Hogan won.\n\nAfter a brief fall out with McMahon and WWE, Hogan was lured to Memphis Wrestling with the proposal of wrestling Jerry Lawler. The match had been promoted on \"Memphis Wrestling Prime Time\" for several months. On April 12, 2007, however, Lawler announced in a news conference that WWE had barred him from wrestling Hogan on the basis that NBC performers (including Lawler, on the basis of co-hosting the NBC-owned USA Network's \"Raw\" and his appearances on the biannual WWE's \"Saturday Night's Main Event\") are contractually prohibited from appearing on VH1, the channel on which \"Hogan Knows Best\" airs. The situation resulted in a lawsuit being filed against WWE by event promoter Corey Maclin. Lawler was replaced with Paul Wight. Hogan defeated Wight at Memphis Wrestling's PMG Clash of Legends on April 27, 2007 when he picked up and hit a body slam on Wight before pinned him following his signature running leg drop.\n\nOn November 21, 24, 26 and 28, Hogan performed with a group of wrestlers including Spartan-3000, Heidenreich, Eugene, Brutus \"The Barber\" Beefcake and Orlando Jordan across Australia in a tour titled . The main event of each show was a rematch between Hogan and Ric Flair – the wrestler who defeated Hogan more times than any other. Hogan defeated Flair in all four matches.\n\nOn October 27, 2009, it was announced that Hogan had signed a contract to join TNA on a full-time basis. The footage of his signing and the press conference at Madison Square Garden following it were featured on the October 29 episode of \"Impact!\".\n\nOn December 5, 2009, Hogan announced on Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)'s \"The Ultimate Fighter\" that he would be making his official TNA debut on January 4, 2010, in a special live three-hour Monday night episode of \"Impact!\" to compete with WWE's \"Raw\" (which featured the return of Bret Hart). Dixie Carter revealed Hogan's role in the company in an interview with \"The UK Sun\" stating when his job came to question, \"He is involved with everything from looking at the talent to how we shoot the show\".\n\nOn the January 4 episode of \"Impact!\", Hogan debuted, reuniting briefly with former nWo partners Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and Sean Waltman, the latter two of whom made their returns to the company. He, however, refused to join them for a full-fledged reunion of their group claiming, \"it's a different time\", and stuck to his business relations with Bischoff, who made his appearance to declare that, the two of them would \"flip the company upside down\" and everyone would have to earn their spot. Hogan also encountered TNA founder Jeff Jarrett on the broadcast, appearing via video wall and interrupting Jarrett's company success speech, stating that Carter was instrumental to the company's survival, and that just like the rest, Jarrett would have to (kayfabe) earn his spot in TNA.\n\nOn the February 18 episode of \"Impact!\", Hogan took Abyss under his wing, and during this sequence, gave him his Hall of Fame ring and claimed it would make him a \"god of wrestling\". Hogan made his in-ring return on March 8, teaming with Abyss to defeat A.J. Styles and Ric Flair when Abyss scored a pinfall over Styles. Afterwards, the returning Jeff Hardy saved Hogan and Abyss from a beat down at the hands of Styles, Flair and Desmond Wolfe. The storyline became a Team Flair versus Team Hogan situation, with Jarrett and the debuting Rob Van Dam joining Team Hogan and Beer Money (James Storm and Robert Roode) and Sting joining Team Flair. At Lockdown, Team Hogan (Hulk Hogan, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Jeff Hardy and Rob Van Dam) defeated Team Flair (Ric Flair, Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) in a Lethal Lockdown match.\n\nOn the June 17 episode of \"Impact!\", Hogan's alliance with Abyss came to an abrupt end when Abyss became a villain. Abyss later claimed that he was controlled by some entity, that was coming to TNA. The next month, Hogan worked with Bischoff, Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe against Sting and Kevin Nash, who claimed that they knew that Hogan and Bischoff were up to something. During this time, Abyss went on a rampage, attacking Rob Van Dam to the point that he was forced to vacate the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and eventually put his hands on TNA president Dixie Carter, which led to her signing the paperwork, presented by Bischoff, that would have Abyss fired from TNA following his match with Van Dam at Bound for Glory. Hogan was set to wrestle with Jarrett and Joe against Sting, Nash and D'Angelo Dinero at Bound for Glory, but was forced to miss the event due to a back surgery. However, he would make an appearance at the end of the event, turning villain for the first time since 2002, helping Jeff Hardy win the vacant TNA World Heavyweight Championship and aligning himself with Hardy, Bischoff, Abyss and Jarrett. On the following episode of \"Impact!\", it was revealed that Bischoff had tricked Carter and the paperwork she had signed a week earlier, were not to release Abyss, but to turn the company over to him and Hogan. Meanwhile, Bischoff's and Hogan's new stable, now known as Immortal, formed an alliance with Ric Flair's Fortune. Dixie Carter returned on the November 25 episode of \"Reaction\", informing Hogan and Bischoff that a judge had filed an injunction against the two on her behalf over not having signatory authority, indefinitely suspending Hogan from TNA. During his absence, Hogan underwent a potentially career–ending spinal fusion surgery on December 21, 2010.\n\nHogan returned to TNA on the March 3, 2011 episode of \"Impact!\", declaring himself as the new owner of TNA, having won the court battle against Dixie Carter. In April, he began hinting at a possible return to the ring to face the TNA World Heavyweight Champion, Sting. On the May 12 episode of the newly renamed \"Impact Wrestling\", Hogan lost control of the program to Mick Foley, who revealed himself as the Network consultant who had been causing problems for Immortal ever since Hogan and Bischoff took over the company; however, this angle was cut short just three weeks later, when Foley left the promotion. During the following months, Hogan continued to interfere in Sting's matches, costing him the TNA World Heavyweight Championship first at Hardcore Justice, recruiting Kurt Angle to Immortal in the process, on the September 1 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\" and finally at No Surrender. On the September 15 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting defeated Immortal member Ric Flair to earn the right to face Hogan at Bound for Glory. On October 4, it was reported that Hogan had signed a contract extension with TNA. After feigning retirement from professional wrestling, Hogan accepted the match at Bound for Glory on the October 6 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", while also agreeing to hand TNA back to Dixie Carter, should Sting win the match.\n\nHogan was defeated by Sting at Bound For Glory, ending his storyline as the president of TNA. After the match, Immortal attacked Sting, but Hogan turned into a fan favorite once again by turning on Immortal and helping Sting. On the following episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Hogan, wearing his trademark yellow and red again, admitted to his mistakes, and put over Sting for winning.\n\nOn January 26, 2012, Hogan returned to the ring at a house show in Nottingham, England, where he, James Storm and Sting defeated Bobby Roode, Bully Ray and Kurt Angle in a six-man tag team main event. Hogan returned to \"Impact Wrestling\" on February 2, when he was revealed as Garett Bischoff's trainer. On the March 29 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Hogan returned and accepted Sting's offer to replace him as the new General Manager.\n\nIn July, Hogan, alongside Sting, began feuding with a mysterious group of masked men, who had dubbed themselves the \"Aces & Eights\". The group's attack on Hogan on the July 12 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\" was used to write Hogan off television as he was set to undergo another back surgery.\n\nIn November, Hogan moved into a storyline with Bully Ray after Austin Aries revealed a secret relationship between Ray and Hogan's daughter Brooke. After seeing them kissing in a parking garage on the December 20 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Hogan suspended Ray indefinitely. The following week on \"Impact Wrestling\", after Ray saved Brooke from a kidnapping by the Aces & Eights, Brooke accepted his marriage proposal. Despite Hogan's disapproval, he still walked Brooke down the aisle for her wedding on the next episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", during which Ray's groomsmen Taz interrupted and revealed himself as a member of the Aces & Eights, leading the group to attack Hogan, Ray, and the rest of the groomsmen.\n\nOn the January 31 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Hogan reinstated Ray so he could take on the Aces & Eights. Hogan named Ray the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship on the February 21 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\". However, at Lockdown, Ray betrayed Hogan, after Aces & Eights helped him win the title, and he revealed himself as the President of the Aces & Eights. Following Lockdown, Hogan blamed Sting for Ray winning the title as it was Sting who encouraged Hogan to give Ray the title shot. Sting returned and saved Hogan from an attack by Aces & Eights on the April 25 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\". The following week on \"Impact Wrestling\", Hogan and Sting managed to reconcile their differences. On the October 3 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Hogan refused an offer from Dixie Carter to become her business partner and quit; this was done to officially write Hogan off, as a result of his contract expiring with TNA.\n\nOn February 24, 2014 on \"Raw\", Hogan made his first WWE in-ring appearance since December 2007 to hype the WWE Network. On the March 24 episode of \"Raw\", Hogan came out to introduce the guest appearances of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Joe Manganiello; this was to promote the guests' new movie \"Sabotage\".\nAt WrestleMania XXX in March, Hogan served as the host, coming out at the start of the show to hype up the crowd. During his promo, he mistakenly referred to the Superdome, the venue the event was being held at, as the Silverdome, which became the subject of jokes throughout the night. Hogan was later joined by Stone Cold Steve Austin and The Rock, and they finished their promo by drinking beer together in the ring. Later in the show, Hogan shared a moment with Mr. T, Paul Orndorff and Roddy Piper, with whom he main evented the first WrestleMania.\n\nOn February 27, 2015, Hogan was honored at Madison Square Garden during a WWE live event dubbed \"Hulk Hogan Appreciation Night\" with a special commemorative banner hanging from the rafters, honoring his wrestling career and historic matches he had in the arena.\n\nOn the March 23 episode of \"Raw\", Hogan along with Snoop Dogg confronted Curtis Axel – who at the time had been \"borrowing\" Hogan's Hulkamania gimmick with Axel referring to himself as \"AxelMania\". On March 28, the night before WrestleMania, Hogan posthumously inducted longtime partner and rival \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage into the WWE Hall of Fame. The next night at WrestleMania 31, Hogan reunited with Hall and Nash to reform the nWo, appearing in Sting's corner in his match against Triple H, who himself was joined by D-Generation X members Billy Gunn, X-Pac, Road Dogg, and Shawn Michaels.\n\nOn July 24, 2015, WWE terminated their contract with Hogan, stating that they are \"committed to embracing and celebrating individuals from all backgrounds\", although Hogan's lawyer said Hogan chose to resign. A day prior, WWE removed virtually all references to Hogan from their website, including his listing as a judge for \"Tough Enough\", his merchandise from WWE Shop, and his entry from its WWE Hall of Fame page. His DLC appearance from \"WWE 2K15\" was taken down from sale, and his character was cut from then upcoming \"WWE 2K16\" game during development. The termination coincided with the publication by the \"National Enquirer\" and Radar Online of an anti-black rant made by Hogan on his controversial leaked sex tape in which he is heard expressing disgust with the notion of his daughter with any black man, referenced by repeated use of the racial slur \"nigger\". Hogan also admitted to being \"a racist, to a point\".\n\nOnce the recordings went public erupting in a media scandal, Hogan apologized for the remarks, which he said is \"language that is offensive and inconsistent with [his] own beliefs\". Three black wrestlers who worked in the WWF and WCW with Hogan made supportive comments. Virgil commented \"Hogan has never given me a reason to believe he is a racist\" while Dennis Rodman said he \"most certainly is not a racist\" and Kamala added \"I do not think Hogan meant harm by saying that. Hogan is my brother until he decides not to be\". Black wrestlers working in the WWE made different comments. Mark Henry said he was pleased by WWE's \"no tolerance approach to racism\" response, and that he was hurt and offended by Hogan's manner and tone. Booker T said he was shocked and called the statements unfortunate.\n\nIn response to the controversy, Mattel stopped producing Hogan action figures, while Hogan's merchandise was taken down from online stores of Target, Toys \"R\" Us, and Walmart. On July 28, Radar Online reported that Hogan had also used homophobic slurs on the leaked sex tape. Days later, it was reported that Hogan had used racist language in a 2008 call to his then-imprisoned son, Nick, and also said that he hoped they would not be reincarnated as black males.\n\nHogan gave an interview with \"ABC\" on August 31 in which he pleaded forgiveness for his racist comments, attributing these to a racial bias inherited from his neighborhood while growing up. Hogan claimed that the term \"nigger\" was used liberally among friends in Tampa; however, former neighbors have disputed this claim.\n\nWWE senior executive Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque is open to a Hogan return.\n\nHogan created and financed a restaurant called \"Pastamania\" located in the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota. It opened on the Labor Day weekend of 1995 and was heavily promoted on World Championship Wrestling's live show \"Monday Nitro\". The restaurant, which remained in operation for less than a year, featured such dishes as \"Hulk-U's\" and \"Hulk-A-Roos\".\n\nIn an interview on \"The Tonight Show\" and \"Late Night with Conan O'Brien\", Bollea claimed that the George Foreman Grill was originally offered to him, but he failed to respond in time, so Foreman endorsed the grill instead. Instead, Bollea endorsed a blender, known as the Hulk Hogan Thunder Mixer. He has since endorsed a grill known as \"The Hulk Hogan Ultimate Grill\".\n\nIn 2006, Bollea unveiled his own energy drink \"Hogan Energy\", distributed by Socko Energy. His name and likeness are also applied to a line of microwavable hamburgers, cheeseburgers, and chicken sandwiches sold at Wal-Mart called \"Hulkster Burgers\". On November 1, 2011, Bollea launched a new website called \"Hogan Nutrition\", which features many nutritional and dietary products.\n\nOn New Year's Eve 2012, Bollea opened a beachfront restaurant called \"Hogan's Beach\", located in the Tampa area. The restaurant dropped Hogan's name in October 2015.\n\nIn September 2008, Bollea's net worth was revealed to be over $30 million. In September 2011, Bollea revealed that his lavish lifestyle and divorce had cost him hundreds of millions of dollars and nearly bankrupted him.\n\nIn October 2007, Bollea transferred all trademarks referring to himself to his liability company named \"Hogan Holdings Limited\". The trademarks include Hulk Hogan, \"Hollywood\" Hulk Hogan, Hulkster, Hogan Knows Grillin, Hulkamania.com, and Hulkapedia.com.\n\nIn April 2008, Bollea announced that he would lend his license to video game developer Gameloft to create \"Hulkamania Wrestling\" for mobile phones. Hogan stated in a press release that the game would be \"true to [his] experiences in wrestling\" and use his classic wrestling moves like the Doublehand Choke Lift and Strong Clothesline. As of 2010, Hogan stars alongside Troy Aikman in commercials for Rent-A-Center. On March 24, 2011, Hogan made a special appearance on \"American Idol\", giving a big surprise to wrestling fans Paul McDonald and James Durbin. On October 15, 2010, Endemol Games UK (a subsidiary of media production group Endemol UK) announced a partnership with Bischoff Hervey Entertainment to produce \"Hulk Hogan's Hulkamania\", an online gambling game featuring video footage of Hogan.\n\nIn October 2013, Bollea partnered with Tech Assets, Inc. to open a web hosting service called \"Hostamania\". To promote the service, a commercial video was released, featuring Hogan parodying Jean-Claude Van Damme's GoDaddy.com commercials and Miley Cyrus' \"Wrecking Ball\" music video. On November 21, 2013, Hulk Hogan and GoDaddy.com appeared together on a live Hangout On Air on Google Plus, where Hulk Hogan had a casual conversation about Hostamania, fans, and business.\n\nHogan became a distributor for multi-level marketing company ViSalus Sciences after looking for business opportunities outside of wrestling. Hogan supports the American Diabetes Association.\n\nHogan's crossover popularity led to several television and movie roles. Early in his career Bollea played the part of Thunderlips in \"Rocky III\" (1982). He also appeared in \"No Holds Barred\" (1989), before starring in family films \"Suburban Commando\" (1991), \"Mr. Nanny\" (1993), \"Santa with Muscles\" (1996), and \"\" (1998). Hogan also appeared in 1992 commercials for Right Guard deodorant. He starred in his own television series, \"Thunder in Paradise\", in 1994. He is the star of \"The Ultimate Weapon\" (1997), in which Brutus Beefcake also appears in a cameo.\n\nBollea also starred in a pair of television movies, originally intended as a pilot for an ongoing series for TNT, produced by Eric Bischoff. The movies, \"Shadow Warriors: Assault on Devil's Island\" and \"Shadow Warriors: Hunt for The Death Merchant\", starred Hogan alongside Carl Weathers and Shannon Tweed as a freelance mercenary team. In 1995, he appeared on TBN's \"Kids Against Crime\". Bollea made cameo appearances in \"Muppets from Space\", \"\" (the theatrical cut) and \"Spy Hard\" as himself. Hogan also played the role of Zeus in \"Little Hercules in 3D\". Hogan also made two appearances on \"The A-Team\" (in 1985 and 1986), along with Roddy Piper. He also appeared on \"Suddenly Susan\" in 1999. In 2001, Hogan guest-starred on an episode of \"Walker, Texas Ranger\".\n\nHogan has become a busy voice actor in recent years making guest voice spots on \"Robot Chicken\" and \"American Dad!\" and as a main actor in the Cartoon Network/Adult Swim series \"China, Illinois\".\n\nOn July 10, 2005, VH1 premiered \"Hogan Knows Best\" a reality show which centered around Hogan, his then-wife Linda, and their children Brooke and Nick. In July 2008, a spin-off entitled \"Brooke Knows Best\" premiered, which focused primarily on Hogan's daughter Brooke.\n\nBollea hosted the comeback series of \"American Gladiators\" on NBC in 2008. He also hosted and judged the short-lived reality show, \"Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling\". Hogan had a special titled \"Finding Hulk Hogan\" on A&E on November 17, 2010.\n\nIn 2015, Hogan was a judge on the sixth season of \"Tough Enough\", alongside Paige and Daniel Bryan, but due to the scandal, he was replaced by The Miz after episode 5.\n\nBollea released a music CD, \"Hulk Rules\", as Hulk Hogan and The Wrestling Boot Band. Also, Green Jellÿ released a single, a duet with Hogan, performing Gary Glitter's classic song \"I'm the Leader of the Gang (I Am)\". He has also made cameos in several music videos. From her self-named show, \"Dolly\" the music video for Dolly Parton's wrestling-themed love song \"Headlock on my Heart\" features Hogan as \"Starlight Starbright\". In the music video \"Pressure\" by Belly ft. Ginuwine, Bollea and his daughter Brooke both made brief cameo appearances.\n\nBollea was a regular guest on Bubba the Love Sponge's radio show. He also served as the best man at Bubba's January 2007 wedding. On March 12, 2010, Bollea hosted his own radio show, titled \"Hogan Uncensored\", on Sirius Satellite Radio's Howard 101.\n\nBollea provided his voice for the game \"\" as Angel de la Muerte, a member of the Saints. In October 2011, Bollea released a video game called \"Hulk Hogan's Main Event\".\n\nBollea (as Hulk Hogan and Hollywood Hogan) has also been featured in the following licensed wrestling video games:\n\nFeatured on game cover<br>\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>Hogan was featured in the Sega Genesis version of the game (of which he was also on the cover), but was not in the SNES version<br>\n^Hogan was featured in the Nintendo DS version of the game (of which he was also on the cover), but was not in the PSP version<br>\n<nowiki>#</nowiki>Hogan was downloadable content and removed after his racial scandal\n\nOn March 27, 1985, just days prior to the inaugural WrestleMania, Richard Belzer requested on his cable TV talk show \"Hot Properties\" that Hogan demonstrate one of his signature wrestling moves. After consistently refusing but being egged on by Belzer, Hogan put Belzer in a modified Guillotine choke, which caused Belzer to pass out. When Hogan released him, Belzer hit his head on the floor, sustaining a laceration to the scalp that required a brief hospitalization. Belzer sued Hogan for $5 million and later settled out of court. On October 20, 2006, on the \"Bubba the Love Sponge Show\", it was claimed (with Hogan in the studio) that the settlement totaled $5 million, half from Hogan and half from Vince McMahon. During his June 23, 2008, appearance on Sirius Satellite Radio's \"The Howard Stern Show\", Belzer suggested that the real settlement amount was actually closer to $400,000.\n\nIn 1994, Hogan, having received immunity from prosecution, testified in the trial of Vince McMahon relating to shipments of steroids received by both parties from WWF physician Dr. George T. Zahorian. Under oath, Hogan admitted that he had used anabolic steroids since 1976 to gain size and weight, but that McMahon had neither sold him the drugs, nor ordered him to take them. The evidence given by Hogan proved extremely costly to the government's case against McMahon. Due to this and jurisdictional issues, McMahon was found not guilty.\n\nIn April 2012, a sex tape between Hogan and Heather Clem, the estranged wife of radio personality Bubba the Love Sponge, emerged online. On October 4, 2012, Gawker released a short clip of the video. In the video, Bubba can be heard saying that the couple can \"do their thing\" and he will be in his office. At the end of the video, he can also be heard telling Heather, \"If we ever need to retire, here is our ticket\". Hogan later told Howard Stern on his satellite radio show that, \"it was a bad choice and a very low point\" and \"I was with some friends and made a wrong choice. It has devastated me, I have never been this hurt\". On October 15, 2012, Hogan filed a lawsuit against Bubba and Heather Clem for invading his privacy. A settlement with Bubba was announced on October 29, 2012. Afterwards, Clem publicly apologized to Hogan. In December 2012, a federal court, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, found that Gawker's publication of the video snippet did not violate U.S. copyright law. Hogan then joined Gawker to the ongoing action against Heather Clem in state court in Florida, alleging invasion of privacy, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress and seeking $100 million in damages.\n\nOn October 1, 2015, the \"New York Post\" reported that a Florida Judge granted Hogan access to Gawker's computer system for a forensic expert to search Gawker's computers and office.\n\nHogan sued Gawker for $100 million for defamation, loss of privacy, and emotional pain, and on March 18, 2016, was awarded $115 million. Also, on August 11, 2016, a Florida judge gave Hogan control of the assets of A.J. Daulerio, former Gawker editor-in-chief, who was involved in the posting of Hogan's sex tape.\n\nSilicon Valley billionaire Peter Thiel helped Hogan to finance his lawsuit against Gawker Media.\n\nOn November 2, 2016, Gawker reached a $31 million settlement with Bollea.\n\nOn December 18, 1983, Bollea married Linda Claridge. They have a daughter Brooke (born May 5, 1988) and a son Nick (born July 27, 1990). Bollea made his personal life the centerpiece of the television show \"Hogan Knows Best\", which included his wife and two children.\n\nAccording to an interview in the \"National Enquirer\", Christiane Plante claimed that Bollea had an affair with her in 2007 while the Hogan family was shooting \"Hogan Knows Best\". Plante was 33 years old at the time and had worked with Brooke Hogan on her 2006 album.\n\nOn November 20, 2007, Linda filed for divorce in Pinellas County, Florida. In November 2008, Linda claimed to the public that she made the decision to end her marriage after finding out about Hogan's affair. In his 2009 autobiography, Hogan acknowledged that Linda on numerous occasions suspected he was having infidelities whenever he developed friendships with other women, but denied allegations that he ever cheated on her. Bollea only retained around 30% of the couple's liquid assets totaling around $10 million in the divorce settlement. Hogan considered committing suicide after the divorce and credits Laila Ali, his co-star on \"American Gladiators\", with preventing him from doing so.\n\nBollea has been in a relationship with Jennifer McDaniel since early 2008. The two were engaged in November 2009 and married on December 14, 2010, in Clearwater, Florida.\n\nBollea is a Christian. Bollea has spoken about his faith in his life saying, \"[I've] leaned on my religion. I was saved when I was 14. I accepted Christ as my savior. He died on the cross and paid for my sins... I could have went the wrong way. I could have self-destructed, but I took the high road\".\n\nBollea has suffered numerous health problems, particularly with his back since retiring as a wrestler following the years of heavyweight training and jolting as a wrestler.\n\nOn January 2013, Bollea filed a medical malpractice lawsuit against the Laser Spine Institute for $50 million, citing that the medical firm persuaded him to undergo a half-dozen \"unnecessary and ineffective\" spinal operations that worsened his back problems. He claimed that the six procedures he underwent over a period of 19 months only gave him short-term relief. After the procedures failed to cure his back problems, Bollea underwent a traditional spinal fusion surgery on December 2010, which enabled him to return to his professional activities. In addition, the Laser Spine Institute used his name on their advertisements without his permission.\n\nBollea was honored as the 2008 King of the Krewe of Bacchus, a New Orleans carnival organization. Hogan visited the Children's Hospital of New Orleans and rode in the parade where he threw doubloons with his likeness. Hogan received the honor in part because meeting Hogan is one of the most requested \"wishes\" of the terminally ill children benefited by the Make-A-Wish Foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Sting (wrestler)\n\nSteve Borden (born March 20, 1959), better known by the ring name Sting, is an American retired professional wrestler, actor, author and former bodybuilder. He is currently signed with WWE under a Legends contract.\n\nSting is known for his time spent as the public face of two major professional wrestling promotions: the now-defunct World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which displaced the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) as the leading professional wrestling organization in the United States from 1995 to 1998, and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Borden is regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, having cultivated a legacy over a career spanning more than three decades in which he held 15 world championships.\n\nSting's 14-year tenure with WCW and its predecessor, Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), began in 1987. Dubbed \"The Franchise of WCW\", he held a total of 15 championships in the promotion – including the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on six occasions, the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship on two occasions and the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on one occasion – and made more pay-per-view (PPV) appearances for the company than any other wrestler. Sting has been described as the WCW counterpart to the WWF's Hulk Hogan. Against Hogan, Sting headlined the highest-grossing PPV event in WCW history at Starrcade in December 1997. Upon the acquisition of WCW by the WWF in March 2001, Sting and his long-term rival Ric Flair were chosen to perform in the main event of the final episode of \"Nitro\".\n\nFollowing the expiration of his contract with WCW's parent company, AOL Time Warner, in March 2002, Borden held talks with the WWF, but ultimately did not join the promotion and instead toured internationally with World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) – winning the WWA World Heavyweight Championship – before joining the then-upstart TNA in 2003. Over the following 11 years, he won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on one further occasion and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship four times, as well as being the inaugural inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame in 2012. He is the only man to hold the NWA, WCW (WWA and WCW international additionally) and TNA world championships in a career. Previously described by WWE as the greatest wrestler never to have performed for that promotion, Sting finally joined the company in 2014, making his first appearance at Survivor Series and having his debut match at WrestleMania 31 the following year. His last ever bout at Night of Champions in September 2015, marked his sole WWE pay-per-view main event and WWE World Heavyweight Championship contest for the organization. Sting headlined the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2016 on April 2, where he announced his retirement. His induction renders him the first performer to be inducted into both the WWE and TNA Hall of Fame, as well as the second man to be inducted while an active WWE wrestler after Ric Flair.\n\nSting held 25 total championships throughout his career, including 21 between WCW and TNA. Readers of \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" named him \"Most Popular Wrestler of the Year\" on four occasions, a record he shares with John Cena. In 2016, Sting was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame. Slam! Sports wrote that he holds \"a lofty level of prestige that few will ever touch\".\n\nBorden was born in Omaha, Nebraska and raised in Southern California. He played competitive football and basketball in high school and later embarked on a career in bodybuilding, once co-owning a Gold's Gym health club. Borden had no interest in professional wrestling and no television access to it within his home community, but decided to pursue a career in the industry after being taken to an \"incredible\" World Wrestling Federation (WWF) event in Los Angeles where he saw Hulk Hogan, The Iron Sheik, The British Bulldogs, André the Giant and others perform.\n\nBorden, originally wrestling under the ring name Flash, teamed with Jim \"Justice\" Hellwig as two members of Power Team USA in independent All-California Championship Wrestling. Power Team USA was a four-man unit also featuring Garland \"Glory\" Donahoe and Mark \"Commando\" Miller, plus manager Rick Bassman. Hellwig and Borden later moved to the Continental Wrestling Association, a wrestling company based in Memphis, Tennessee and became known as the Freedom Fighters. Fans were slow to respond to the lumbering hulks, so the team turned heel. The Freedom Fighters left the CWA after an uneventful run, the highlight of which was an angle in which they broke the leg of veteran wrestler Phil Hickerson.\n\nThe duo surfaced in the Universal Wrestling Federation, an organization run by Bill Watts and based in Shreveport, Louisiana where they were known as the Blade Runners. Borden changed his ring name from Flash to Sting, while Hellwig became known as Rock. They soon joined Hotstuff & Hyatt International, a heel stable headed by \"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert and Missy Hyatt. Together with \"Russian\" wrestler Kortsia Korchenko, the Blade Runners became henchmen in Gilbert's on-screen feud with Watts. Hellwig, who would later become The Ultimate Warrior in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), left the promotion in mid-1986, leaving Sting without a partner. Sting won the UWF World Tag Team Championship twice with Gilbert in 1986 and a third time with Rick Steiner in 1987.\n\nFollowing a match against Terry Taylor in mid-1987, Gilbert interfered on Taylor's behalf, costing Sting the match. Taylor and Gilbert ganged up on Sting until Gentleman Chris Adams came to Sting's aid. Adams cleared the ring and then asked Sting if he was with him or against him in his feud with Taylor and Gilbert. Sting turned face by declaring his allegiance to Adams.\n\nBehind the scenes, Gilbert endorsed Borden by telling a dirt sheet that Sting would be a megastar in the future. Later that year, Sting was tabbed to win the UWF Television Championship, then held by Gilbert, until Jim Crockett of the National Wrestling Alliance bought the company from Watts. Crockett's booker, Dusty Rhodes, decided to put the Television title on Taylor to set up a feud between Taylor and NWA Television Champion Nikita Koloff to unify the two titles. Rhodes used then-unknown Shane Douglas as the transitional champion from Gilbert to Taylor because Rhodes did not want to diminish Sting's growing stardom with a brief title run.\n\nSometime after Sting's arrival to the NWA in July 1987, Dusty Rhodes used the opening bout of Crockett's first foray into pay-per-view, Starrcade '87, to showcase the young superstar. Sting partnered with Michael P.S. Hayes and Jimmy Garvin in a six-man tag team match against Gilbert, Steiner, and Larry Zbyszko that ended in a 15-minute time-limit draw.\n\nHaving established himself as a rising star, Sting was one of the few UWF alumni to be pushed in the NWA. At the inaugural Clash of the Champions in March 1988, Sting challenged Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The match ended in a draw after the 45-minute time limit expired and the ringside judges could not declare a winner. Sting lost to Flair in several non-televised rematches following the Clash and, later that year, battled other members of Flair's stable, the Four Horsemen. Sting teamed with Koloff at The Great American Bash in July 1988 to challenge Horsemen Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson for the NWA World Tag Team Championship; Blanchard and Anderson retained the titles when the match ended in a 20-minute time-limit draw.\n\nRhodes continued to book Sting in title matches throughout the year against both NWA United States Champion Barry Windham and NWA Television Champion Mike Rotunda. In the fall of 1988, Sting was attacked by Hawk and Animal of The Road Warriors after a televised match. Rhodes, as booker, identified Sting as the face who was most over with the fans, despite knowing that turning the Road Warriors heel would be no easy task. Rhodes himself teamed with Sting to challenge the Road Warriors for the tag team championship at Starrcade '88 that December. Rhodes and Sting got the win by disqualification, allowing the Road Warriors to retain the titles.\n\nSting returned to singles matches in 1989, starting the year off by wrestling Flair to a one-hour draw in Atlanta's Omni on New Year's Day. He would also have his first experience in Japan with a brief tour in All Japan Pro Wrestling, with his most notable match in AJPW against Dan Spivey on January 25. After a long push, Sting won his first title in the NWA when he defeated Rotundo for the NWA Television Championship at a live event in March. Sting defended the Television title actively but tended to face sub-par challengers such as The Iron Sheik. In mid-1989, The Great Muta challenged Sting at The Great American Bash. The match was booked with a classic, controversial Dusty finish even though Rhodes (the namesake of the technique) had been fired months earlier. Sting got the three-count and was announced as the winner, but a replay showed Muta's shoulder was up at the count of two. The NWA decided to declare the title vacant. Sting and Muta battled in many rematches for the vacant Television title, but they always ended in disqualification, giving neither man the championship. Eventually, Muta won a No Disqualification match against Sting at a live event in September by using a blackjack to get the win and the title.\n\nIn the main event of that year's Great American Bash, Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Terry Funk, who was a member of Gary Hart's J-Tex Corporation. After Flair got the victory, he was attacked by Funk's stablemate, Muta. Sting came to the aid of his old rival Flair, and the two feuded with Muta and Funk for the rest of the summer and fall, culminating in a Thunderdome Cage match between the two teams, which Flair and Sting won, at Halloween Havoc '89. The alliance with Flair resulted in Sting joining the newly reformed and now-face Four Horsemen along with the Andersons, Arn and Ole. Sting finished out the year by winning a four-man round-robin Iron Man tournament at Starrcade '89. In the final match of the night, Sting defeated Flair to accumulate the necessary points to win the tournament. The victory made Sting the number one contender for Flair's NWA World title, leading to tension within the Four Horsemen.\n\nSting was summarily dismissed from The Four Horsemen on February 6, 1990, at after refusing to relinquish his title shot against Flair, thus restarting their rivalry. Later that evening, Borden suffered a legitimate knee injury while interfering in a steel cage match featuring the Horsemen. Borden's injury forced the bookers of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the dominant promotion in the NWA, to find a new opponent for Flair for the forthcoming WrestleWar pay-per-view event.\n\nLex Luger was chosen to challenge Flair at WrestleWar. During the match between Flair and Luger, Sting came down to motivate Luger to come back and beat Flair. Before this Sting and Luger had been at odds. When Luger was close to winning Sting was attacked by Ole Anderson. Luger opted to save the already injured Sting and ended up losing the match by countout while assisting his friend. Behind the scenes, WCW officials had wanted Flair to drop the title to Luger at WrestleWar, but Flair refused, saying he had promised Borden he would hold the title until Borden could return to the ring. Despite the injury, Sting was still utilized on television and pay per views when necessary.\n\nAt the Capital Combat event in May, Sting was accosted by the Four Horsemen and thrown into a metal cage at ringside. In a promotional crossover, Sting was rescued by his buddy RoboCop. After Borden's recovery, Sting finally defeated Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on July 7, 1990, at The Great American Bash. Sting went on to feud with title contenders Flair and Sid Vicious. Vicious appeared to defeat Sting in a title match at the 1990 Halloween Havoc, but the \"Sting\" that Vicious pinned was revealed to be an impostor played by Horseman Barry Windham. The real Sting appeared soon after and pinned Vicious to retain his title after the match was restarted.\n\nDuring Sting's title run, a masked man known as The Black Scorpion would taunt and attack Sting on many occasions. This feud culminated in a final showdown between Sting and The Black Scorpion at Starrcade: Collision Course in December. The cage match ended with Sting pinning and unmasking the Scorpion, who turned out to be Flair in disguise.\n\nSting's first world championship reign ended January 11, 1991, when Flair defeated him in a rematch from Starrcade. In the same month, WCW seceded from the National Wrestling Alliance, in the process recognizing a WCW World Heavyweight Championship and a WCW World Tag Team Championship. Sting then took part in what many consider to be one of the best matches of 1991, teaming with Luger to face The Steiner Brothers at the first SuperBrawl pay-per-view. The Steiners won by pinfall after Koloff, who had been feuding with Luger, interfered in the match by swinging a chain at Luger but hitting Sting instead. Consequently, Sting feuded with Koloff throughout the summer of 1991. In August 1991, Sting defeated Steve Austin to win a tournament for the vacated WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. Sting held the title for 86 days before losing it to Rick Rude at Clash of the Champions XVII.\n\nAt Starrcade '91, Sting won the first-ever Battlebowl battle royal, for which he received a Battlebowl championship ring. Sting then became embroiled in a feud with the Dangerous Alliance, headed by manager Paul E. Dangerously. The stable targeted Sting because he was the so-called \"franchise\" of WCW, and the Alliance vowed to destroy both Sting and the promotion he was the face of. At the same time, Sting was being targeted by Luger, who had once again turned heel and, as WCW Champion, viewed Sting as a threat. Sting engaged in many matches with Dangerous Alliance members, especially Rude, who was the group's biggest star. It was during this feud that Sting won the first of his six WCW World Heavyweight Championships, defeating Luger on February 29, 1992, at SuperBrawl II. The feud ended when Sting formed Sting's Squadron, consisting of allies Ricky Steamboat, Dustin Rhodes, Windham, and Koloff, and defeated the Alliance (Rude, Austin, Arn Anderson, Zbyszko, and Bobby Eaton) in a WarGames match at WrestleWar in May 1992. Dave Meltzer awarded the match his highest rating of five stars.\n\nNear the end of Sting's battles with the Dangerous Alliance, the seeds were sown for what became arguably one of the most famous feuds of Sting's career. Sting defended his WCW World title on April 12, 1992, at The Omni in Atlanta against the 450-pound Big Van Vader. During the match, Vader splashed Sting, cracking three of Sting's ribs and rupturing his spleen. Sting recovered and defended his title on July 12 against Vader at The Great American Bash, dropping the belt to Big Van Vader after missing a Stinger Splash, hitting his head on the ringpost, and receiving a powerbomb. After beating Cactus Jack in a Falls Count Anywhere Match at Beach Blast and WCW newcomer Jake Roberts in a Coal Miner's Glove match at Halloween Havoc, Sting defeated Vader, who had lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in August, in the \"King of Cable\" tournament final at Starrcade.\n\nThe Sting-Vader feud continued into 1993, with Vader, who was again WCW World Heavyweight Champion, defeating Sting in a bloody Strap match at SuperBrawl III. Sting exacted revenge by beating Vader for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on March 11 in London, England, but lost it back to Vader six days later in Dublin, Ireland. Sting then teamed with WCW newcomer Davey Boy Smith to beat the team of Vader and Vicious at Beach Blast in a match that was set up by a mini-movie in which an evil midget blew up Sting's boat. At the end of 1993, Sting was one of the first people to congratulate Flair, who had just returned from the World Wrestling Federation, after his WCW World Heavyweight Title victory over Vader at Starrcade.\n\nSting feuded with Vader and Rude through the first half of 1994. Sting won the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship from Rude in April. Rude recaptured the title on May 1 at Wrestling Dontaku 1994 in Japan, but the decision was reversed because Rude had allegedly hit Sting with the title belt during the match; this was to cover for a real-life back injury Rude sustained in the match that forced Rude into retirement. Sting refused to have the title handed to him and instead defeated Vader for the vacant WCW International World Heavyweight Championship at Slamboree. Soon afterward, Flair turned heel and defeated Sting in a title unification match at \"Clash of the Champions XXVII\". Sting spent the second half of 1994 and most of 1995 teaming with new arrival Hulk Hogan in his battles against Kevin Sullivan's Three Faces of Fear and its successor stable, The Dungeon of Doom.\n\nAt The Great American Bash 1995, Sting defeated Meng to win another tournament for the WCW United States Championship. Sting defeated Meng in a rematch for the title at Bash at the Beach 1995. Sting was on the first ever \"Monday Nitro\" in a match where Flair defeated Sting by disqualification as a result of a run-in by Arn Anderson to attack Flair. At Fall Brawl, Sting teamed with Hogan, Luger, and Randy Savage to defeat the Dungeon of Doom, consisting of Kamala, Zodiac, Shark and Meng, in the event's WarGames match. In October 1995, Flair convinced Sting to team with him in a match against Anderson and Brian Pillman at Halloween Havoc. Anderson and Pillman had attacked Flair earlier in the night, rendering Flair unable to come out for the first part of the match. Sting fended off his opponents until Flair emerged. Later in the match, Flair turned on Sting and reformed the Four Horsemen with Anderson and Pillman, later adding Chris Benoit to fill out the group.\n\nSting defeated Flair on a subsequent \"Nitro\" with the Scorpion Deathlock, refusing to let go until Luger persuaded him to do so. Sting defeated Flair again at the World War 3 pay-per-view. Later in the night, Sting competed in the World War 3 battle royal for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Savage. Sting's alliances with Hogan and Savage led the Horsemen to attack them as well. Sting's second U.S. title reign lasted until November 13, when he was defeated by Kensuke Sasaki in Japan. At Starrcade, Sting defeated Sasaki, representing New Japan Pro Wrestling, in a non-title match to win the World Cup of Wrestling for WCW. In the next match that night, Sting lost a Triangle match involving Flair and Luger; Flair won by countout to become number one contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which Flair won from Savage in the next match.\n\nEarly in 1996, Sting's appearance started to change: he grew longer, darker hair, replacing his blond flattop haircut, and he often wore black tights with a multi-colored scorpion, although he occasionally wore his colorful ones and maintained his colorful face paint. Sting teamed with his old friend Luger, who had returned to WCW from WWF in September 1995, despite Luger's standing as a heel. The duo beat Harlem Heat for the WCW World Tag Team Championship on the January 22 edition of \"Nitro\". The team often retained the championship as a result of Luger's cheating tactics, to which Sting remained oblivious. When Luger was temporarily unavailable for WCW Uncensored in March, Harlem Heat member Booker T teamed up with Sting to successfully prevent the title from changing hands. Sting and Booker T developed a mutual respect that showed itself when Sting and Luger granted Harlem Heat a rematch. During the Tag title run, Sting received a World title shot against The Giant at Slamboree in May, but lost after accidental interference from Luger. Harlem Heat eventually won the titles back on the June 24 edition of \"Nitro\".\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Sting was the first to stand up to The Outsiders: Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, who had recently competed in the WWF and whose alliances and agenda were unclear, had been infiltrating and causing chaos at WCW events. Sting teamed with Luger and Savage to defend WCW against Hall, Nash, and a mysterious third Outsider to be revealed at the Bash at the Beach. Hall and Nash started the bout without their third partner, but the WCW's temporary three-on-two advantage was short-lived: Luger left the match after he was accidentally injured by a mistimed Stinger Splash. The two-on-two match continued while Hogan, who had been a fan favorite for over two decades, emerged at ringside. Hogan appeared ready to back up the WCW wrestlers until he attacked Savage with his leg drop finisher in one of wrestling's most famous swerves. The match was ruled a no-contest, and Hall, Nash, and Hogan declared a new world order in professional wrestling. The name stuck and Sting became one of WCW's stalwarts against the New World Order, or nWo for short.\n\nAs part of this, Sting and Luger went up to rivals and Four Horsemen members Ric Flair and Arn Anderson some time after Bash at the Beach and asked them to team with him, saying that they needed to put aside their differences for the good of WCW. Flair and Anderson agreed and the four wrestlers composed Team WCW for the annual WarGames match at Fall Brawl in September 1996. They would be facing the nWo's team of Hall, Nash, Hogan, and a fourth member yet to be determined. On the \"Nitro\" prior to the event, however, the nWo played a trick on WCW claiming that Sting was joining their side. A vignette was shown where the nWo had a recording of Sting's voice playing in its limousine as Luger was being lured into the parking lot. Once he was there a man dressed as Sting, played by Jeff Farmer, attacked him and the crowd at home was led to believe that Sting had joined up with the nWo and would be their fourth man against what was now a three-man WCW team. Sting, however, was not at that edition of \"Nitro\" and showed up at Fall Brawl just as his teammates declared that they would face the nWo by themselves. Sting told Luger that he did not attack him, but Luger refused to believe him. Later, during the match, Sting entered as the fourth and final man for Team WCW, after the impostor Sting had entered for the nWo. Once in the ring, Sting immediately took out all four members of the nWo. He then stopped, turned to Luger, and angrily said to him, \"Is that good enough for you right there? Is that proof enough?\" Sting then gave Luger an obscene gesture and walked out of the match, leaving Team WCW at a four-on-three disadvantage which they did not overcome. The next night on \"Nitro\", Sting came out unannounced during the middle of the show with no music or entrance pyrotechnics. He entered the ring and, with his back turned to the camera side of the audience, launched into an angry tirade about what had transpired over the last week: \n\nDeclaring he would be \"popping in from time to time\" afterwards, Sting threw the microphone down and left the ring. Days after the infamous promo, he was booked for shows in New Japan Pro Wrestling, to take part in the Japan/U.S. Superstars Tournament, where he defeated Masahiro Chono in the first round, but was eliminated in the second round by Shiro Koshinaka. His last match of 1996 took place on September 23 at the Yokohama Arena, where he and Lex Luger teamed up to defeat Arn Anderson and Steven Regal. It would end up being his last tour of Japan. On the October 21, 1996, edition of \"Nitro\", Sting returned for the first time since the night after Fall Brawl. In a match where the impostor Sting was wrestling Mr. JL, Sting emerged wearing a trench coat and white face paint with black marks around his eyes. He went in the ring and attacked nWo Sting (who was still imitating Sting's old mannerisms at this point) with his new finisher, the Scorpion Death Drop inverted DDT, two jumping elbow drops, a Stinger Splash and a Scorpion Deathlock while the rest of the nWo came to ringside. Rather than intervene, they simply stood by and watched. After Sting was done, Ted DiBiase and Kevin Nash came into the ring and made Sting an offer to join the nWo and get back at WCW for betraying him. Sting, after a pause, first called out the nWo Sting as a \"cheap imitation,\" before telling the nWo, \"the \"real\" Sting may or may not be in your price range,\" and then concluded by saying \"the only thing that's for sure about Sting is that nothing's for sure\". With that, Sting left the ring and would not speak (on mic) on WCW programming again for over a year. After this a silent, almost ghostly Sting, carrying a baseball bat as a weapon, began appearing in the rafters at WCW events and began painting his entire face with black and white corpse paint. Sting's new gimmick was inspired by the 1994 film \"The Crow\". In retaliation, nWo Sting, who was still imitating Borden, began painting his face this way as well. While appearing on a WCW/nWo merchandise special on QVC Sports in late 1999, Borden admitted that Scott Hall had initially suggested the idea of painting his face like the character of Eric Draven from \"The Crow\". Sting maintains aspects of his \"Crow\" persona to date, occasionally with different designs and use of color of the face paint.\n\nIn a series of unusual loyalty tests over the next months, Sting would confront a WCW wrestler in the ring and shove the wrestler several times with his bat until the wrestler was provoked enough to advance on him. Then Sting would draw the weapon back as if he were going to assault him, causing the wrestler to stop. Sting would hand the bat to the offended wrestler and turn his back, offering the wrestler a chance at retaliation. When the wrestler hesitated or declined, Sting would nod, retrieve the bat and leave the ring. In January 1997, a \"blackballed\" Randy Savage returned to WCW for the first time since Halloween Havoc and aligned himself with Sting as a \"free agent\" as he refused to join the nWo although WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff, also one of the leaders of the nWo, declared he would not be allowed back in WCW if he didn't. For the next few weeks the two were seen in the rafters together and coming to the ring together. This story, however, petered out at SuperBrawl in February; Sting and Savage had come to the ring together to watch Roddy Piper face Hogan in a match for the WCW world title. As Sting left, Savage went to the ring and helped Hogan win the match, thus going back on his word and joining the nWo. Over the next couple weeks, Sting would accompany the nWo, indicating that he too joined the group. However, at WCW Uncensored in March 1997, as the nWo celebrated a victory in the main event battle royal which guaranteed them title shots whenever they desired with their newest recruit, Chicago Bulls NBA star Dennis Rodman, Sting rappelled from the roof of the arena on a vertical zip-line. When Hall and Nash went to approach him, Sting attacked them and Randy Savage when he tried to intervene, revealing his allegiance to WCW.\n\nIn subsequent weeks, Sting frequently rappelled from the rafters or came up through the ring to attack unsuspecting nWo members, came to the aid of wrestlers once subjected to his loyalty test as they battled the nWo, and employed decoy \"Stings\" to play mind games with the nWo during the closing segments of \"Nitro\". Sting's appearances to fight the nWo at the end of almost every \"Nitro\" helped WCW keep and widen its television ratings advantage over the WWF's Monday Night Raw throughout the summer. On-screen WCW commissioner James J. Dillon tried many times to get Sting to return to wrestling by making contracts to fight various nWo members. Sting, however, did not accept any of the contracts, often tearing them up in Dillon's face. A confused Dillon then asked Sting who he wanted on one edition of \"Nitro\", and Sting went out to ringside, picked up a fan's sign, and pointed out one name on it: Hogan. Eventually Sting got his wish and he and Hogan finally met in December at Starrcade for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The finish of the match was supposed to echo the Montreal Screwjob finish that the WWF had used to double cross Bret Hart just one month earlier at their annual Survivor Series event. Nick Patrick, the referee for the contest, was supposed to execute a fast count on Sting while Hart, whose signing with WCW was the linchpin for the Montreal Screwjob, would come out to protest the decision and, since he had already served as the guest referee for the match between Larry Zbyszko and Eric Bischoff earlier that evening, order the match to be restarted and Sting would emerge victorious by forcing Hogan to submit to the Scorpion Death Lock. However, Patrick did not do his part properly and instead counted the pin at normal speed, which added an unintentional level of controversy to the finish.\n\nThe next night on \"Nitro\", Hogan protested the decision claiming that Patrick's decision should have been considered final and a rematch was granted. The match ran over \"Nitro's\" allotted time slot and the finish was aired later in the week on the inaugural episode of \"Thunder\". Similar to the Starrcade result, two different referees declared the two different men as the winner. Later that night, Dillon vacated the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, forcing Sting to surrender the belt. Sting responded with his first words (on mic) since October 1996 when he told Dillon, \"You've got no guts!\" Sting turned to Hogan and said, \"And you... You're a dead man!\".\n\nAs 1998 began, the nWo began to splinter. Sting recaptured the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship in February at SuperBrawl VIII with the help of Savage, who was beginning to split from the nWo. Sting went on to successfully defend the title against the likes of Hall, Nash, and Diamond Dallas Page (DDP). Like Savage, Nash began to pull away from the Hogan-dominated nWo, and Nash helped Savage beat Sting for the championship at Spring Stampede in April. Nash and Savage officially split from the original nWo on May 4, forming the face group nWo Wolfpac, while Hogan's heel faction became identified as nWo Hollywood. The two nWo factions vied for Sting's allegiance, with Sting's friends The Giant joining nWo Hollywood and Luger joining nWo Wolfpac. Sting seemed to have joined nWo Hollywood when he appeared wearing a black and white nWo shirt, but he soon tore off the shirt to reveal the red and black of the nWo Wolfpac. Sting began wearing red and black face paint and tights as a member of nWo Wolfpac.\n\nSting and The Giant won the WCW World Tag Team Championship at Slamboree in May when Hall turned on his teammate Nash. Sting and The Giant also split, and the team was forced to vacate the title 18 days later. Sting then defeated The Giant at The Great American Bash in June to take control of the Tag Team titles and chose Nash as his partner. Throughout the summer, Sting and fellow nWo Wolfpac members Nash, Luger, and Konnan feuded with Hogan and nWo Hollywood. Sting also got involved in a feud with Bret Hart over their similar finishing holds, the Sharpshooter and the Scorpion Deathlock. Hart cost Sting and Nash the Tag titles by interfering in their match with Hall and The Giant on the July 20 \"Nitro\". Sting and Hart squared off at Halloween Havoc, where Hart, the United States Champion, attacked Sting with a baseball bat, putting Sting out of action for several months.\n\nSting returned to \"Nitro\" in March 1999, sporting the black and white \"Crow\"-inspired attire he debuted in 1996 and began to participate in more mic work. By this time, the nWo storyline had faded, and Sting was not aligned with any of its factions. Sting competed in the main event of April's Spring Stampede, a Four Corners match for the World Championship, against Hogan, DDP, and champion Flair. Savage served as special guest referee and delivered a diving elbow drop to help DDP win the match and the title.\n\nSting defeated Page on the April 26 edition of \"Nitro\" to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship for the fifth time. Later that night, Sting defended the title in a four-way match featuring DDP, Goldberg, and a returning Nash. DDP pinned Nash, allowing DDP to win the title without directly beating Sting. Sting's 90-minute reign was only the second shortest WCW World Heavyweight Championship reign in WCW history. Sting lost to Rick Steiner in a Falls Count Anywhere match at The Great American Bash after he was attacked by Steiner's three pet dogs backstage and Steiner forced the referee to prematurely declare himself the victor, claiming his dogs had pinned Sting for him.\n\nOver the next several months, Sting feuded with Goldberg, Rick Steiner, Vicious, and Savage. Sting teamed with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Nash at the Bash at the Beach in July to take on Vicious and Savage of Team Madness. Savage pinned Nash and won the World title as a result. Hogan returned from injury on July 12 as a face to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Flair on the July 19 edition of \"Nitro\" to become the on-screen president of WCW. Later that night, Nash turned heel by attacking Hogan during a title defense against Vicious. Sting remained president for just one week and used his power to book a main event pitting Hogan and himself against Nash and Vicious. Sting vacated the presidency the following week because he only wanted Flair out of the position rather than wanting the power for himself. Along with Goldberg, Sting and Hogan feuded with Nash, Vicious and Rick Steiner for the next month.\n\nSting began to question Hogan's trustworthiness and credibility in the weeks leading up to Fall Brawl. At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a baseball bat to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel for the first time in WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent attitude change did not resonate with the WCW fans. They still cheered Sting despite the fact he was supposed to be the villain (reminiscent of The Road Warriors' heel turn in late 1988). At Halloween Havoc, Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in street clothes and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for later tonight. Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee Charles Robinson. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official.\n\nSting entered the 32-man tournament that was set up to award the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Brian Knobs, Meng, and Luger to reach the semi-finals to be held at WCW Mayhem. At the November event, Sting lost to Hart, the eventual winner of the tournament. After the match, Sting shook hands with Hart in a sign of respect, turning face again. Sting sought revenge against Luger the next month at Starrcade. Sting won by disqualification when Luger and Elizabeth assaulted Sting with a steel chair and baseball bat, putting Sting out of action for some time. Sting ended his feud with Luger by defeating him in a Lumberjacks with Casts match at Uncensored 2000 the following March.\n\nWCW officials Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff, in an attempt to save the fading company, rebooted the storylines on April 10, 2000, and declared all titles vacant. At Spring Stampede 2000 the following week, Sting advanced to the finals of the United States Championship tournament by defeating Booker T and Vampiro in the first two rounds. Vampiro cost Sting the championship in the finals against Scott Steiner, leading to an intense feud between Sting and Vampiro. Sting pinned Vampiro at Slamboree 2000 in May, and Vampiro beat Sting in a Human Torch match at The Great American Bash the next month; for the climax of the match, Borden switched with a stuntman, who was set on fire and thrown off the top of the frame of the stage's entrance video screen. At Bash at the Beach 2000, he returned wearing another Sting mask as men wearing cloaks and Sting masks carried him in a casket, and then he attacked Vampiro.\n\nSting went on to feud with Jeff Jarrett and then Scott Steiner. Steiner attacked and injured Sting in November 2000. Sting stayed off WCW programming until the final episode of \"Nitro\" on March 26, 2001. WCW had been purchased by the World Wrestling Federation, and the final match in WCW history pitted Sting against his longtime rival Flair; the two had also competed on the very first edition of \"Nitro\" on September 4, 1995. Sting defeated Flair and the two embraced at the end of the contest.\n\nAfter the WWF did not buy out Sting's contract with AOL Time Warner, he rejected a buyout offer of 50 cents on the dollar from AOL Time Warner, instead waiting until his contract expired in March 2002 (he announced a short-lived retirement in February of that year). Borden then entered into contract negotiations with the WWF, but ultimately did not join the promotion.\n\nIn 2002, after over a year and a half of hiatus, Borden toured Europe with the World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) promotion throughout November and December. His first match in the WWA took place on November 28, 2002, in Dublin, Ireland, where he reunited with Lex Luger to defeat Buff Bagwell and Malice. At The Retribution on December 6, 2002 in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, Sting lost to Luger in a bout for the vacant WWA World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Luger to claim the WWA World Heavyweight Championship in Zurich, Switzerland, on December 13.\n\nSting embarked on a second tour with WWA in May 2003, successfully defending his championship against Rick Steiner, Shane Douglas, and Disco Inferno. The WWA held its final show, The Reckoning, on May 25 in Auckland, New Zealand, where NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett defeated Sting for the WWA World Heavyweight Championship, unifying the two championships.\n\nIn 2003, Sting signed a contract committing him to four appearances with the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion. He debuted in TNA on the June 18 one year anniversary show, teaming with Jeff Jarrett to defeat A.J. Styles and Syxx Pac. Following this, Borden engaged in a comprehensive series of sitdown interviews with Mike Tenay, discussing his career and his faith. Sting returned to TNA on November 5, 2003, defeating Jarrett by disqualification in a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On November 12, Sting teamed with A.J. Styles to defeat Jarrett and Lex Luger. He made his final TNA appearance of 2003 on December 17, defeating Jarrett in a non-title match. On March 24, 2004, Borden was interviewed once again by Mike Tenay as part of the promotion for his direct-to-video biographical film, \"Sting: Moment of Truth\", and on March 31, he returned to the company for one night only as the special guest enforcer for the main-event, a four way match between Abyss, A.J. Styles, Raven, and Ron Killings, which Raven won.\n\nOn December 11, 2005, at Turning Point, as Jeff Jarrett stood in the ring celebrating his victory, the lights in the arena went out as images of a scorpion—Sting's symbol— appeared on the arena screens, along with the date \"January 15, 2006\". Spotlights then illuminated the ring, revealing a chair bearing Sting's signature trench coat, boots, and a black baseball bat in the center of the ring. His return to TNA was officially announced one minute after midnight on the January 1, 2006 episode of \"Impact!\". On January 15 at Final Resolution, Sting and Christian Cage defeated NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett and Monty Brown in a tag team match after Sting pinned Jarrett following the Scorpion Death Drop. His heavily promoted return was greeted with chants of \"welcome back\" and \"you've still got it\" by the Orlando, Florida audience. TNA later revealed that Final Resolution was \"by far the most-purchased TNA pay-per-view event in company history, breaking all previous numbers\". On the January 28, 2006 episode of \"Impact!\", Sting made his Spike TV debut and first appearance on national television in almost five years, coming to the ring at the end of the show to make a \"major announcement\". Sting noted that he had never had a chance to properly say goodbye to his fans. He then announced that Final Resolution had been \"his goodbye\", before thanking the TNA management and the fans. Sting then dropped his bat, with a spotlight appearing over it, and left the ring, shaking hands with various TNA wrestlers on his way up the ramp.\n\nWith Sting gone, the storyline continued with Jeff Jarrett and Eric Young worrying that Sting had not actually retired and sending Alex Shelley to California to videotape Sting at home. Sting discovered Shelley filming, then walked up to Shelley's car and told him that he was going to show up at Destination X and confront Jeff Jarrett as Steve Borden. Clad in \"street clothes\" and without face paint Borden returned on March 12 at Destination X, saving Christian Cage and Rhino as they were attacked by Jarrett's Army. He placed Jarrett in the Scorpion Deathlock, but was attacked by the debuting Scott Steiner shortly thereafter. In his first cable television match in five years, Sting defeated Eric Young on the April 13, 2006 episode of \"Impact!\". After being attacked by Jarrett, Steiner, and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), Sting was saved by A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, and Rhino, who he announced as his teammates in his Lethal Lockdown match against Jarrett's Army. On April 23 at Lockdown, \"Sting's Warriors\" (Sting, A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, and Rhino) defeated Jarrett, Steiner, and America's Most Wanted after Sting made Chris Harris tap out to the \"Scorpion Death Lock\". Following Lockdown, Sting proceeded to seek out partners to help him defeat Jeff Jarrett and Scott Steiner for good. After bringing out Lex Luger, Buff Bagwell, and Rick Steiner as options, he settled on Samoa Joe. On May 14 at Sacrifice, Sting and Joe defeated Jarrett and Steiner after Joe pinned Jarrett with a Muscle Buster. Still having proven unsuccessful at putting Jarrett away, Sting defeated Scott Steiner by disqualification to earn a spot in the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary on June 18. Due to a confrontation with Christian Cage during the match, Sting was distracted, which allowed crooked referee Earl Hebner to knock over the ladder both were on, sending both men to the floor and allow Jarrett to pick up the victory.\n\nOn July 16 at Victory Road, a four-way number one contenders match was held for a shot at Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Jeff Jarrett, disguised as a cameraman, came into the ring with a bottle of gasoline and squirted it into Sting's eyes. Sting was taken by security into the back and as a result, taken out of the running for the number one contender match. As the match continued as a three-way, Sting returned to the ring with his head wrapped in bandages, performed the \"Scorpion Death Drop\" on Scott Steiner, and Sting pinned him to become number one contender. After the match, Sting had a confrontation with Christian Cage in the ring that ended with them shaking hands, and Cage showing respect for Sting. Sting received his title shot on August 13 at Hard Justice, but failed to capture the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Jeff Jarrett after Christian Cage turned heel and hit Sting with Jarrett's guitar. On the following edition of \"Impact!\", Sting stated that he wanted a rematch with Jarrett at Bound for Glory, TNA's biggest pay-per view of the year. Jarrett accepted the match, with the implication that Sting put his career on the line, a stipulation Sting accepted. Sting then retreated to train for what could have been his final match. Meanwhile, \"Impact!\" began showing videos of Sting going through a so-called transformation with many biblical references. On October 22, 2006, in the Title vs. Career match at the Bound for Glory PPV, Sting returned debuting his new look, a hybrid of his \"surfer,\" \"Crow,\" and \"nWo Wolfpac\" styles, looking much leaner physically. He went on to claim his second NWA World Heavyweight title when he made Jarrett submit to the \"Scorpion Deathlock\" marking the first major championship title Sting had won since 1999. With that victory, Sting became the oldest NWA World Heavyweight Champion of the TNA era, as well as the only person to ever win the title both before and after the inception of TNA. This would also go on to make Sting the longest superstar to recapture his second NWA title from 1990 to 2006 (16 years).\n\nSting lost the title to \"The Monster\" Abyss on November 19 at Genesis by disqualification after pushing aside the referee and pushing Abyss into a stack of tables covered in barbed wire. In the weeks following Genesis, Sting's feud with Abyss continued as he tried to get in Abyss' head by telling him he was being used by his satanic manager James Mitchell. Abyss was visibly affected by this, but remained by Mitchell's side. Sting's former friend Christian Cage and his bodyguard Tomko were also thrown in the mix, with Cage claiming he knew a dark secret in Abyss' past. The three finally met in a three-way match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on December 10 at Turning Point, where Abyss retained the title. After Turning Point, Sting continued to try to convince Abyss he was nothing but a machine for Mitchell, and he got so far into Abyss that Abyss grabbed Mitchell by the throat, almost chokeslamming him on an edition of \"Impact!\", but ultimately convinced himself not to.\n\nAs 2007 came along, Sting continued his feud with Abyss while trying to recapture the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On January 14 at Final Resolution, Sting faced Abyss and Christian Cage in three-way elimination match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but failed regain the championship after he was eliminated last by Cage. On the January 24, 2007 edition of \"Impact!\", Sting revealed after going through public records that Abyss shot his own father three times in the back, sending him into a coma. During the ensuing brawl throughout the \"Impact!\" Zone between Sting and Abyss, James Mitchell burned Sting's face with a fireball, sending Sting to the hospital. Sting returned to defeat Abyss in a \"Prison Yard\" match on February 11 at Against All Odds and again in a \"Last Rites\" match on March 11 at Destination X. On the March 22 edition of \"Impact!\", Sting teamed with his enemy Abyss to face Christian Cage and A.J. Styles. During the match, Mitchell returned with a woman who Abyss recognized and Abyss left the match with Mitchell and the woman, leaving Sting alone to fight Cage and Styles. The following week on \"Impact!\", during a meeting between Sting and James Mitchell, it was revealed that the woman was Abyss' mother, and that she was the one who had actually shot Abyss' father, but Abyss took the blame to protect his mother. Later in the night, it was announced Abyss was added to the Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown as part of Team Cage while Sting ended up joining Team Angle. At Lockdown, Sting, with the help of Jeff Jarrett, pinned Abyss to win the match for his team and end their bitter rivalry.\n\nDue to his win, he was supposed to be facing Christian Cage for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Sacrifice, but the next week on \"Impact!\", Kurt Angle challenged Sting for his number one contendership. After Team Cage interfered in the match, it was revealed that at Sacrifice there would be a three way match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between Sting, Kurt Angle, and Christian Cage. The day of the PPV, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), the owners of the NWA World Heavyweight and the NWA World Tag Team Championships, stripped Cage of the title and Team 3D of the tag team title. NWA Executive Director Robert K. Trobich stated the reason was that Cage refused to defend the NWA Title at NWA live events. At the event, Cage, still holding the physical NWA Championship belt, defended what was billed as the \"World Heavyweight Championship\" against Sting and Angle. Angle was the victor of said contest by making Sting submit, who had technically just pinned Cage, and was announced as the new \"TNA World Heavyweight Champion\". The \"Impact!\" following the event, the title was labelled as the \"TNA World Heavyweight Championship\" and was vacated due to the controversial finish of the match. A tournament was then held for the title which culminated in a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary. Sting lost his qualifying match with Samoa Joe after Christopher Daniels interfered. Sting instead faced Daniels on June 17 at Slammiversary, which he ultimately won.\n\nAfter his feud with Daniels, Sting began teaming up with his former enemy, Abyss who had recently turned face. Together, the two went on to defeat A.J. Styles and Tomko on July 15 at Victory Road. While trying to help Abyss to win a match against A.J. Styles, Sting and Abyss were attacked by Christian's Coalition. Abyss was pulled under the ring and Sting was slammed into broken glass by Tomko, before Abyss emerged bleeding badly and was slammed into the broken glass and thumbtacks. The following week, Sting and Abyss got revenge by defeating Christian Cage and A.J. Styles in a ladder match, in the process earning a contract that allowed them to pick the type of match between Abyss and Christian at Hard Justice. It was announced via TNA mobile that Abyss had selected \"Doomsday Chamber of Blood\" match. Sting's team won, with Abyss pinning A.J. Styles to become the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOn the August 30 edition of \"Impact!\", Sting defeated A.J. Styles, Christian Cage, and Samoa Joe in a four-way match to become the co-holder of the TNA World Tag Team Championship with Kurt Angle. Yet after only thirteen days, Sting and Angle lost the titles to Adam \"Pacman\" Jones and Ron \"The Truth\" Killings at No Surrender. During the match, Karen Angle claimed that Sting had slapped her, which led to a falling out between Sting and Kurt Angle and on the first two-hour edition of \"Impact!\", Kurt Angle was shown via satellite (kayfabe) stalking and assaulting Sting's son Garrett. It was announced that Sting would face Kurt Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory. The match was billed as return to his roots for Sting, who enjoyed enormous popularity and success in the Atlanta-based World Championship Wrestling earlier in his career. On October 14 at Bound for Glory, Sting overcame interference by both Karen Angle and Kevin Nash to defeat Angle and win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On October 16, at the tapings of the October 25 episode of \"Impact!\", Sting lost the championship back to Angle after Kevin Nash interfered on Angle's behalf. Sting then challenged Angle to a tag team rematch at Genesis. Angle was forced to Kevin Nash as his partner, while Sting's partner was a mystery until during the event where his partner was revealed to be Booker T. In the match, whoever scored the pinfall would win the TNA World Championship, which Angle won after pinning Sting to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. This would be the final TNA appearance of Sting in 2007 as he would take some time off to be with his family.\n\nOn the March 20 edition of \"Impact!\", after a brawl between members of both Team Cage and Team Tomko, a promo aired at the end of the show indicating that Sting would return the next week on the first-ever live \"Impact!\" episode. Sting then made his official return on March 27, announcing that he would be a part of Team Cage for the Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown. Later on the show, he teamed with members of Team Cage (Christian Cage, Kevin Nash, Rhino, and Matt Morgan) and defeated Team Tomko (Tomko, A.J. Styles, James Storm, and Team 3D) in a 5-man tag team match. Morgan was added when James Storm attacked Sting with a glass bottle after the match. Sting, however, later gained revenge by defeating Storm when Morgan threw him his baseball bat. Morgan then ripped off his referee shirt and revealed a Team Cage shirt, thus becoming the fifth member. At Lockdown, Team Cage defeated Team Tomko when Rhino gored Storm to get the pinfall. After the tag titles were vacated, Jim Cornette held a Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament to determine new champs. Four teams were already in the Sacrifice finals, while Cornette named eight wrestlers as the \"Egotistical 8\". Sting's partner was James Storm and on May 11 at Sacrifice, they came up short due their inability get along, and towards the end, Sting attacked Storm and walked out. Sting was not seen after that except in an interview which talked about his career and his eventual retirement.\nOn July 13 at Victory Road, Booker T faced Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Sting tried to talk sense into Joe, as he was brutally beating Booker T, and was potentially heading towards a disqualification. Joe rebuked him, and Sting struck him with his trademark black baseball bat. Over the coming weeks, the feud between Joe and Booker intensified, with episodes ending with Booker T or Sharmell striking Samoa Joe with Sting's trademark bat as \"Impact!\" went off the air, leading to a question of whether Sting had turned on Samoa Joe and became a heel. Although still receiving a face reaction from the fans, Sting sided with Booker T. On August 10 at Hard Justice, Sting attacked A.J. Styles after he and Kurt Angle wrestled a Last Man Standing match. Sting later announced why he attacked Joe and Styles by saying that the younger generation needed to learn about respecting veterans like Angle, Booker, and himself. He declared that he wouldn't retire until he had accomplished this mission. This led to mixed fan reactions, and sparked a feud between him and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Samoa Joe, as well as Jeff Jarrett who arrived to aid Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles by giving them his guitar as Sting had done with his bat.\n\nOn October 12 at Bound for Glory IV, Sting challenged Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and was successful in claiming the title, after Kevin Nash returned and hit Joe with Sting's baseball bat. On October 23, Sting joined The Main Event Mafia (Kurt Angle, Booker T, Sharmell, Kevin Nash, Scott Steiner, and himself) and by doing so, he fully turned heel for the first time in years, although Sting did not participate in sneak attacks and was cheered by the crowd, making him more a tweener (neutral character). Sting went on to successfully defend the title against AJ Styles on November 9 at Turning Point, The TNA Front Line in an eight-man tag team match with the Main Event Mafia on December 7 at Final Resolution, Rhino on January 11 Genesis, Kurt Angle and both members of Team 3D in a four-way match on February 8 at Against All Odds, and against Angle on March 15 at Destination X. At Lockdown 2009, Sting lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Mick Foley inside the Six Sides of Steel, ending his reign at 189 days (his longest world title reign for any organization). On May 24 at Sacrifice, Sting defeated Kurt Angle to become the new Godfather of the Main Event Mafia. On June 21 at Slammiversary, Sting defeated Matt Morgan in a singles match, thus preventing Morgan from joining the Main Event Mafia. On the following episode of \"Impact!\", Sting's fellow Main Event Mafia members attacked him, removed him from the group, and Kurt Angle reclaimed his role as Godfather. The following week, Sting took his revenge upon the Mafia, when he attacked every member of the group and stole Angle's world heavyweight championship belt, becoming a fully fledged face as a result. On July 19 at Victory Road, Sting was defeated by new Main Event Mafia member Samoa Joe in a singles match after the debuting Taz interfered on Joe's behalf. On August 16 at Hard Justice, Sting unsuccessfully challenged Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a triple threat match, which also included Matt Morgan. On September 20 at No Surrender, Sting lost a five-way match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship that also included A.J. Styles, Hernandez, Kurt Angle, and Matt Morgan. Instead of pinning Angle, he opted to attack Morgan, to allow Styles to pin Angle and become the new World Heavyweight Champion. As a token of gratitude, Styles offered to give him a title shot at the following month's PPV Bound for Glory in a match billed as possibly being Sting's retirement match. At the PPV, Styles defeated Sting to retain his title, ending Sting's undefeated streak at Bound for Glory. After the match he announced that he didn't know whether he would continue his career or not, Saying that \"the way you fans are reacting right now, makes me wanna stay forever!\" At the end of the year the match was voted the match of the year by the fans of TNA.\n\nOn the January 4, 2010, live-three-hour, Monday night edition of \"Impact!\" Sting returned to the Impact! Zone appearing in the rafters of the arena. Sting reappeared two months later on March 8, appearing as he was going to help a bloodied Hulk Hogan and Abyss during a match at the beginning of the show against A.J. Styles and Ric Flair. Instead he swung his baseball bat on Hogan and Abyss, turning heel as a result. He was later defeated by the debuting Rob Van Dam. Sting would continuously attack Van Dam with his bat after the match, completing his heel turn by attacking security guards and Hulk Hogan. On the March 22 edition of \"Impact!\" Sting was announced as the captain of Team Flair in the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would meet Team Hogan, captained by Abyss. At Lockdown Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) were defeated by Team Hogan (Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy). On May 3, Sting explained his actions to Hogan and was later attacked from behind by Jeff Jarrett. At Sacrifice Sting assaulted Jarrett prior to their match and then dragged him in to the ring, where he managed to score a pinfall in seconds over his bloodied opponent, leaving him injured. On the following edition of \"Impact!\" the TNA Championship Committee ranked Sting number one in the rankings and as a result he was granted a shot at Rob Van Dam's World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary VIII. Sting then attacked Eric Bischoff with his baseball bat, biting the hand that fed him. Sting later promised that he would reveal the motives behind his actions after winning the World Heavyweight Championship. At Slammiversary VIII Jeff Jarrett made his return and cost Sting his title match against Rob Van Dam.\n\nAfter assaulting Jarrett from behind on the June 24 edition of \"Impact!\", TNA president Dixie Carter suspended Sting for 30 days without pay the following week. Sting returned from his suspension on the August 5 edition of \"Impact!\", wearing his nWo Wolfpac red face paint, and helping Kevin Nash, who had backed him up during his suspension, beat down Jarrett, Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan. On the September 2 edition of \"Impact!\" Sting defeated Jarrett in a singles match, after an interference from Nash. After the match Samoa Joe aligned himself with Jarrett and Hogan and drove Sting and Nash away. At No Surrender Joe and Jarrett defeated Sting and Nash in a tag team match, after Jarrett hit Sting with his own baseball bat. On the September 16 edition of \"Reaction\", Sting and Nash were joined by D'Angelo Dinero, who claimed to have gotten inside information from Bischoff's secretary Miss Tessmacher, that would suggest that Sting and Nash were right about Hogan and Bischoff being up to something. At Bound for Glory Sting, Nash and Dinero faced Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe in a handicap match, after Hulk Hogan, who was slated to team with Jarrett and Joe, was forced to pull out due to a back surgery. At the end of the match Jarrett abandoned Joe, and Sting, Nash, and Dinero tried to tell Joe this was what they were saying all along. Joe fought them anyway and ended up pinned by Nash. At the end of the event it was revealed that Sting had been right about Hogan and Bischoff all along, as they turned heel with Jarrett and Jeff Hardy as Abyss's \"they\", and in the process turned Sting, Nash and Dinero back to being faces. On the following edition of \"Impact!\", Sting and Nash refused to join Hogan, Bischoff and their new group, Immortal, and walked out on TNA and Dixie Carter, noting that they had tried to warn her that Hogan and Bischoff would try to take over the company for their own gain, but she hadn't listened, meaning Sting was never a true villain his entire heel run. After Impact!, Sting took hiatus from TNA television, as Borden's TNA contract had expired at the end of 2010.\nAfter a four-month hiatus, Sting returned to TNA on February 24, 2011 at the tapings of the March 3 edition of \"Impact!\", where he appeared as a surprise challenger and defeated Jeff Hardy to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the third time. On March 13 at Victory Road, Sting successfully defended the title against Hardy in a No Disqualification rematch that lasted ninety seconds. According to word from backstage, the match was planned to last longer, but Sting, believing that Jeff was in no shape to perform from looking at him, deliberately ended the match early, and was later heard agreeing with a fan's claim that the match was \"bullshit\". The following month at Lockdown, Sting successfully defended the title against Mr. Anderson and Rob Van Dam in a three-way steel cage match. In May, Sting was allowed to pick his number one contender and chose Van Dam, whom he went on to defeat at Sacrifice. The following month at Slammiversary IX, Sting lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Mr. Anderson, following outside interference from Eric Bischoff.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Sting displayed a more maniacal character similar in look and style to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker from the 2008 film \"The Dark Knight\". On the July 14 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting, now dubbed as the \"Insane Icon\", regained the TNA World Heavyweight Championship from Mr. Anderson, after Fortune and Kurt Angle, disguised as his clown minions, attacked each member of Immortal, preventing them from interfering in the match. He would go on to lose the title to Kurt Angle on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, after Angle hit him with a chair brought to the ring by Hulk Hogan. Sting continued tormenting head members of Immortal with his strange new personality, and on the August 18 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", his longtime rival Ric Flair made his return to TNA and challenged him to a match. Sting agreed to put his career on the line in the match in exchange for Flair promising to deliver him his long-awaited match with Hogan, should he be able to defeat him. On the September 1 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting received a rematch against Angle for the World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated following interference from special enforcer Hulk Hogan and the rest of Immortal. On September 11 at No Surrender, Hogan once again cost Sting the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a three-way match, which also included Mr. Anderson. On the September 15 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting defeated longtime rival Ric Flair to earn the right to face Hogan at Bound for Glory. On the October 6 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", after being exposed for his false claim of retiring and his secret ridicule of the fans, a furious Hogan impulsively agreed to hand TNA back to Dixie Carter, should Sting manage to defeat him at the pay-per-view. On October 16 at Bound for Glory, Sting defeated Hogan to bring Dixie Carter back to power. After the match, Hogan turned on Immortal and helped Sting overcome the odds in his battle with the stable. On the following edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Carter placed Sting in charge of the program. Sting returned to the ring on the December 22 and February 9, 2012, editions of \"Impact Wrestling\", where he teamed up with Jeff Hardy to defeat TNA World Heavyweight Champion Bobby Roode and Bully Ray both times.\n\nOn March 18 at Victory Road, Sting was defeated by Roode in a non-title No Holds Barred match. On the following edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting announced his resignation from the general manager position, and handed the position over to Hulk Hogan. He later stated that he believe that Hogan could properly run TNA without the influence of Bischoff. On March 29, Dixie Carter announced that Borden had signed another contract extension with TNA. Sting returned to TNA on the May 24 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", attacking Bobby Roode. The following week, Sting defeated Roode in a non-title lumberjack match to earn a shot at his TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On June 10 at Slammiversary, Sting was announced as the first person inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame the following October. Later, in the main event of the evening, Sting unsuccessfully challenged Roode for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, after being hit with a beer bottle. Afterwards, Sting attacked Roode and dropped him on the entrance ramp with a Scorpion Death Drop.\nOn the June 14 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting's speech about the events of Slammiversary was interrupted, when he was attacked by three masked assailants. Sting returned four weeks later, but this time both he and Hulk Hogan were attacked by the same group of masked men, who had dubbed themselves the \"Aces & Eights\". While Hogan was recovering from his storyline injuries suffered in the attack, and a legitimate back surgery, Sting reclaimed the role of interim general manager. On October 13, Sting was officially inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame. The following day at Bound for Glory, Sting teamed with Bully Ray in a tag team match, where they were defeated by the Aces & Eights, following interference from a man who was afterwards unmasked as Ray's longtime partner, the returning Devon. As a result of their win, the Aces & Eights earned full access to TNA. On the following episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting defeated Devon via disqualification, following interference from the Aces & Eights. On the November 8 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting was sidelined with a storyline injury, after being put through a table and beaten with a ball-peen hammer by DOC, a member of Aces & Eights.\n\nSting returned on the January 3, 2013, episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", saving Kurt Angle and Samoa Joe from Aces & Eights before beating the group down with a baseball bat. Sting wrestled his return match the following week, defeating Aces & Eights member Mike Knox after he injured Kurt Angle. Three days later at Genesis, Sting gained his revenge on DOC by defeating him in a singles match. On the February 7 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting teamed up with Bully Ray to defeat Devon and DOC in a Tables match. On March 10 at Lockdown, Team TNA, consisting of Sting, Eric Young, James Storm, Magnus, and Samoa Joe defeated Aces & Eights, consisting of Devon, DOC, Garett Bischoff, Mike Knox, and Mr. Anderson in a Lethal Lockdown match. After Bully Ray won the World Heavyweight Championship and revealed himself as the leader of Aces & Eights later that night, Hulk Hogan blamed Sting as he had encouraged Hogan to give Ray the title shot while also encouraging Hogan to support Ray's marriage with his daughter Brooke. Sting proceeded to walk out on Hogan. Sting returned on the April 25 \"Impact Wrestling\", saving Hogan from an attack by the Aces & Eights. The following week, Sting reconciled with Hogan and became the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship later that night after defeating Matt Morgan. On June 2 at Slammiversary XI, Sting unsuccessfully challenged Bully Ray for the World Heavyweight Championship in a No Holds Barred Match after an interference by Aces & Eights. Per stipulation, Sting would never get another World title opportunity again.\n\nOn the June 13 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting noted that nobody in the back helped him during his title match, but he would form a New Main Event Mafia to battle the Aces & Eights. In the following weeks, Sting would recruit Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Magnus, and Rampage Jackson as members of the New Main Event Mafia. Before Bound for Glory, MEM member Magnus complained to Sting because his losses. Magnus told to Sting he had Flair to put him in the map, but he had nobody, so Sting challenged him to a match at Bound for Glory. At Bound for Glory, Sting was defeated by Magnus. On the October 31 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Dixie Carter offered to lift the lifetime ban so Sting can get another World title opportunity again by entering him first in a Battle Royal Gauntlet match, which was won by Magnus as Sting attempted to eliminate Kazarian, and Magnus eliminated the both of them. Sting disbanded The Main Event Mafia after Aces & Eights disbanded, and while other members began to chase their World Heavyweight Title dreams, Sting started a feud against Ethan Carter III and Dixie Carter after they began humiliating TNA Legends, like Curry Man and Earl Hebner by Carter. On the December 12 episode of Impact, Carter was confronted by Sting, and was issued an option, either face Sting immediately, or enter the Feast or Fired match. Carter entered the Feast or Fired match, and grabbed one of the briefcases. On the December 19 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", the Feast or Fired briefcase revealed to contain a future World Tag Team Championship match, and also led to the firing of Chavo Guerrero. On the January 16, 2014 edition of Impact Wrestling: Genesis, Sting lost a match to Ethan Carter III due an interference from the World Champion Magnus and subsequently challenged Magnus to a Title vs. Career match for the January 23, 2014 episode of Impact Wrestling-Genesis. Sting lost, and his TNA contract was terminated as a result.\n\nVeteran professional wrestling journalist Bill Apter chronicled Sting's career in a piece for WWE.com on February 19, 2014, wherein he stated that Sting's \"best days may still be yet to come\". Amid speculation about a contract offer from the company, Sting appeared in a WWE Network production on April 15, 2014, sharing a story of his former tag team partner The Ultimate Warrior, who had recently died. This marked Sting's first non-archive appearance on a WWE-branded show. Sting was a prominent contributor to the documentary film \"Warrior: The Ultimate Legend\", which aired on the WWE Network on April 17. The following day, online retailer Zavvi announced the WWE Home Video DVD and Blu-ray \"The Best of Sting\", which was released on September 23, 2014. On July 14, Sting appeared in a vignette on \"Raw\" to promote the video game \"WWE 2K15\", in which he was featured as a pre-order bonus character in both his 'Crow' and 'Surfer' (pre-1996) incarnations. That same day, WWE began selling official Sting merchandise. On July 24, Borden made his first public appearance for WWE, in full Sting garb, as a surprise guest at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International. The event was held to announce WWE's upcoming line of Mattel action figures, in which the company's first ever Sting figure would appear. Prior to that appearance, Sting gave his first interview with WWE.com, which was released later that day. On August 4, WWE announced Sting as a guest on the \"WWE 2K15\" \"Roster Reveal\" panel, which took place on August 16 in Los Angeles.\n\nOn November 23, during the main event of Survivor Series, Sting made his first-ever appearance in a WWE ring by attacking Triple H with a Scorpion Death Drop and also costing Team Authority the match. On January 19, 2015, Sting made his live \"Raw\" debut by appearing backstage during the main event, then walking to the stage, causing a distraction and costing Authority members Big Show, Kane and Seth Rollins their handicap match against John Cena; this win gave the recently fired Dolph Ziggler, Ryback and Erick Rowan their jobs back. Triple H challenged Sting to a face-to-face confrontation on the January 26 episode of \"Raw\". Sting accepted this challenge on the February 16 episode of \"Raw\" by sending a Sting doppelganger into the ring to scare Triple H, after airing a vignette on the big screen accepting Triple H's challenge. Sting and Triple H had a confrontation at Fastlane on February 22. Following physicality between the two, Sting pointed to the WrestleMania 31 sign with his baseball bat, issuing a challenge for the event that was accepted by Triple H. On the March 16 episode of \"Raw\", Sting made a surprise appearance and helped Randy Orton fight off the Authority. Immediately following on the WWE Network, Sting spoke for the first time in-ring. He lost at WrestleMania 31 in a match involving interference from D-Generation X and New World Order members, but shook hands with Triple H afterward.\n\nSting returned on the August 24 episode of \"Raw\", interrupting WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins's statue unveiling ceremony by attacking Rollins before challenging Rollins for the title by raising the belt over his head. Triple H then announced on the WWE Network that Sting would face Rollins for the title at Night of Champions. Sting appeared on the tron throughout the September 7 \"Raw\", defacing and ultimately destroying Rollins's statue by pushing it into a garbage truck. The following week, Sting defeated Big Show by disqualification in his debut \"Raw\" match, as a consequence of Rollins attacking Sting. John Cena then came to Sting's aid, which prompted Triple H to book a tag team contest involving the four wrestlers: Sting and Cena won after Sting made Rollins tap out to the Scorpion Deathlock. Sting suffered a legit neck injury during his championship match against Rollins at Night of Champions, but was able to complete the bout in a losing effort.\n\nSting said on the December 9 edition of Ric Flair's \"WOOOOO! Nation\" podcast that he required surgery to correct cervical spinal stenosis, and is \"lucky that a catastrophe didn't happen\" in his match with Rollins at Night of Champions.\n\nIt was announced on the January 11, 2016 episode of \"Raw\" that Sting would be the first member of the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2016. He was the second active WWE wrestler to be inducted – the first being his inductor, Ric Flair. Sting ultimately reneged on having surgery; on March 22, 2016 he explained that he felt \"completely normal\" and had none of the side effects associated with cervical spinal stenosis. On April 2, during his WWE Hall of Fame induction speech, Sting announced his retirement from professional wrestling. He appeared at WrestleMania 32, alongside his fellow 2016 inductees, the following night.\n\nIn August 2016, Sting appeared on the WWE Network show \"Legends with JBL\" and talked about his career. He also stated that he has not undergone surgery as that would definitively be the end of his career, as he still holds hope for a match with The Undertaker, claiming that to be his \"unfinished business\" in wrestling.\n\nSting is widely regarded as the greatest performer in WCW history. Former rival Hulk Hogan asserted that Sting should be mentioned in any conversation regarding the top 10 greatest pro wrestlers of all time; numerous outlets have placed him in such listings. Sting also garnered one of the largest and most loyal fanbases in the industry; he was voted by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers as \"Most Popular Wrestler of the Year\" four times (a record shared with John Cena), for the years 1991, 1992, 1994 and 1997. Digital Spy writer Mayer Nissim commended Sting's ability to constantly evolve his gimmick while fellow franchise players Hulk Hogan and John Cena largely failed to do so, in order to maintain spectator interest. Borden is known for his charity work, once regarding his involvement with the Make-A-Wish and Starlight Children's Foundations as his \"most fulfilling activity\". His young supporters are known as the \"Little Stingers\".\n\nPrior to his signing with WWE, Sting's legacy was perpetuated by the organization. It hailed him as \"one of sports-entertainment's elite\", and ranked him at number one in listings of the greatest wrestlers to never perform in WWE, and the greatest stars in WCW history. In 2013, the company named Sting's WCW World Heavyweight Championship contest against Diamond Dallas Page, on April 26, 1999, as the greatest match ever aired on WCW's flagship \"Monday Nitro\" program. At Night of Champions 2013, WWE organized a viewer poll to determine the greatest United States Champion of all time: Sting, a two-time champion, beat out the other four contenders – all WWE Hall of Famers – in a landslide victory with 53% of the overall vote. In regard to Sting's creative handling after he signed with WWE, \"PWInsider\" editor Dave Scherer wrote that \"he really represented WCW so he was never going to get that [legend] treatment\".\n\nSting was the inaugural inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame. TNA president Dixie Carter credits Sting with being the major wrestling superstar that TNA needed to establish itself. The company describes him as having had an \"unparalleled career\" and as being a legend who surpasses time.\n\nSting was regarded by colleagues in WCW as a professional and well-respected locker room leader. Prominent adversary Big Van Vader felt that Sting had unsurpassed athletic prowess within the business, and \"ranks right up at the top\" as an in-ring performer. Ric Flair called Sting his greatest opponent. Former rival Diamond Dallas Page, commenting on Sting's entry into WWE in 2014, said: \"Everyone there grew up watching him... No one did it better than Sting, nobody\". John Cena mimicked Sting's hairstyle in his youth and recalled, \"he was my guy\"; Cody Rhodes and Shelton Benjamin have also named him as their favorite childhood wrestler. Tyson Kidd professed to being a \"huge Sting fan\" as a child, and Seth Rollins would dress up as Sting in his youth. He was also a prominent influence on industry veterans Kurt Angle, Bill Goldberg, Jeff Hardy, Kane, A.J. Styles and Goldust. Bray Wyatt has stressed that he \"\"really\" would like to take on\" Sting, adding: \"I have to have [that] before I die; I don't care if it happens outside a Waffle House, somewhere.\"\n\nSting was the only WCW World Heavyweight Champion to wear face paint.\n\nSting's drawing ability has been disputed. Journalist Dave Scherer of \"PWInsider\" wrote: \"Sting is an all timer for sure, but the fact is that when he was the man in WCW, even before the NWO came in, he didn't draw huge\". Pro wrestling historian Dave Meltzer also reported that Sting was not a formidable draw. Fin Martin of \"Power Slam\" felt that while Sting did not make \"essential improvements\" nor \"grow into the champion's role\" during his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship reign from 1990 to 1991, he suffered from a weak line-up of potential opponents and poor creative handling. Martin said that Sting never truly established himself as 'The Man'.\n\nOn the other hand, Steve Austin has taken exception to the notion that Sting was not a profitable wrestler. Reflecting on Sting in the early 1990s, veteran wrestler Kevin Nash said: \"There weren't many draws in WCW at that point, but he was one of them\". Former WCW booker Mike Graham asserted that Sting was a television ratings success during the Monday Night Wars, while fellow booker Kevin Sullivan said of Sting's rivalry with Ric Flair: \"If I needed to draw a rating, Sting and Flair always drew. It was like [Muhammad] Ali and [Joe] Frazier\". The inaugural Clash of the Champions event in 1988, which aired opposite the WWF's WrestleMania IV and was headlined by Sting vs. Flair, generated a record-setting 5.6 rating on TBS. The pair also main-evented The Great American Bash in 1990, which was the NWA's biggest pay-per-view success up to that point.\n\nSting was a major attraction in 1997, being WCW's top merchandise seller (second only to the WWF's Steve Austin overall) and, versus Hollywood Hogan, headlining the biggest-grossing pay-per-view event in the company's history at that year's Starrcade. Sting went on to join the nWo Wolfpac stable, which dominated WCW's merchandise sales at events in mid 1998. Discussing Sting in WWE, Kevin Nash said that he is \"so valuable to the company as a trademark\".\n\nPrior to his signing with WWE, Sting was widely considered the greatest wrestler never to perform for the company. He had \"really good conversations\" with the promotion during his career, but did not appear there until 2014, at the age of 55. His loyalty to WCW, even in its dying days, has been noted. That organization was purchased by the WWF (now WWE) in 2001, and Sting's contract with its parent company AOL Time Warner expired in 2002, but he still refused to make the jump, alternately attributing this to the WWF's creative usage of former WCW talents and negative dealings with attorneys. The company's onerous live schedule and the content of its programming were also factors. Sting has, however, downplayed rumors of a difficult relationship with WWE.\n\nRather than sign with the WWF in 2002, Sting performed for smaller promotions, becoming the centerpiece of TNA by the mid 2000s. His pre-WWE career included \"dream\" matches against former WWF stars Hulk Hogan and Bret Hart in WCW, as well as bouts opposite names such as Ric Flair, Randy Savage, Kurt Angle and Mick Foley. Sting often wrestled Steve Austin in WCW; he had positive negotiations with WWE in 2003, with his proposed debut angle being a confrontation with Austin at the conclusion of WrestleMania XIX. He was also \"very, very close\" to making a deal with the company in 2011, which would potentially have involved a match against The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXVII. Although Sting twice wrestled Mark Calaway in his pre-Undertaker character, Mark Callous, at WCW live events in 1990, WWE viewers clamored for a televised Sting versus Undertaker match.\n\nBorden appeared in the music video for the song \"Fire in the Hole\" by Lȧȧz Rockit in 1989.\n\nBorden appeared in the syndicated TV show Super Force as Hallor / ... (3 episodes, 1991-1992)\n\nHe starred in a pay-per-view only film titled \"The Real Reason (Men Commit Crimes)\" (1998).\n\nBorden was featured in a Sprite commercial in 1999. He also appeared in three episodes of the action-adventure series and Hulk Hogan vehicle \"Thunder in Paradise\" as the character Adam \"Hammerhead\" McCall. Borden made a guest appearance on \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" as biker and drug dealer Grangus in the episode \"Unsafe Speed\". He also appeared in \"Ready to Rumble\" (2000) as Sting.\n\nHe also appeared in the Christian film, \"The Encounter\" (2010) and was featured as the lead actor in the TV movie \"Shutterspeed\". He makes a cameo appearance as Sting on an episode of \"Upright Citizens Brigade\". Borden played an outlaw biker in the film \"Revelation Road\" (2013).\n\nIn October 2015, WWE released a second Sting DVD titled \"Sting: Into the Light\". The three-disc set features a behind-the-scenes documentary with Sting himself as he prepares to step into a WWE ring for the first time ever at WrestleMania 31.\n\nBorden was an anabolic steroid user in the 1980s. He became a born-again Christian in August 1998, after confessing his adultery, and substance and alcohol abuse to his then-wife. Borden has two sons, Garrett Lee and Steve, Jr. and a daughter named Gracie, who was born in 2000. His elder son Garrett attends Azusa Pacific University, where he plays college football as a running back. Steven attended Kilgore College, where he played tight end; on December 19, 2012, he committed to attend the University of Kentucky. After the 2015 NFL Draft, Steven was invited by the Kansas City Chiefs to try out for the team at their rookie mini-camp. Borden married his second wife Sabine in 2015, shortly after WrestleMania 31.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Ric Flair\n\nRichard Morgan Fliehr (possibly born Fred Phillips; February 25, 1949), better known as Ric Flair, is an American professional wrestling manager and retired professional wrestler signed to WWE under its Legends program.\n\nWidely regarded as the greatest professional wrestler of all time and the best American performer of the 1980s, Flair had a career that spanned 40 years. He is noted for his tenures with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, later WWE) and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Since the mid-1970s, he has used the moniker \"The Nature Boy\".\n\nA major pay-per-view attraction throughout his career, Flair headlined at the premier annual NWA/WCW event, Starrcade, on ten occasions, while also co-headlining its WWF counterpart, WrestleMania, in 1992, after winning that year's Royal Rumble. \"PWI\" awarded him their Wrestler of the Year award a record six times, while \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" named him the Wrestler of the Year (an award named after him and Lou Thesz) a record eight times. The only two-time WWE Hall of Fame inductee, first inducted in 2008 for his individual career and again in 2012 as a member of The Four Horsemen, he is also a member of the NWA Hall of Fame, Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, and Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame.\n\nFlair is officially recognized by WWE and \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" (\"PWI\") as a 16-time world champion (eight-time NWA World Heavyweight Champion, six-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion, and two-time WWF Champion), although the actual number of his world championship reigns varies by source, ranging from 16 to 25. He considers himself a 21-time champion. He was the first holder of the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship (which he also held last). As the inaugural WCW World Heavyweight Champion, he became the first person to complete WCW's Triple Crown, having already held the United States Heavyweight and World Tag Team Championships. He then completed WWE's version of the Triple Crown when he won the Intercontinental Championship, after already holding the WWF Championship and the World Tag Team Championship.\n\nFliehr was born on February 25, 1949 in Memphis, Tennessee. His birth name is widely perceived to be Fred Phillips, although on different documents, he is also credited as Fred Demaree or Stewart, while his biological parents were Luther and Olive Phillips (the latter of which was also credited under the Demaree and Stewart surnames). He was adopted, and at the time of his adoption (arranged by the Tennessee Children's Home Society), his father, a physician, was completing a residency in Detroit. Shortly afterward, the family settled in Edina, Minnesota, where the young Fliehr lived throughout his childhood and after ninth grade he attended Wayland Academy, a coeducational boarding school in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, for four years (five years total in high school), during which time he participated in interscholastic wrestling, football and track.\n\nFlair trained as a professional wrestler with Verne Gagne. He attended Gagne's first wrestling camp with Greg Gagne, Jim Brunzell, The Iron Sheik and Ken Patera at Gagne's barn outside Minneapolis in the winter of 1971. On December 10, 1972, he made his debut in Rice Lake, Wisconsin, battling George \"Scrap Iron\" Gadaski to a 10-minute draw while adopting the ring name Ric Flair. During his time in the American Wrestling Association (AWA), Flair had matches with Dusty Rhodes, Chris Taylor, André the Giant, Larry Hennig and Wahoo McDaniel.\n\nFlair first competed in Japan in 1973 for International Wrestling Enterprise (IWE), due to a working agreement between AWA promoter Verne Gagne and the IWE. After Flair left the AWA for Jim Crockett Jr.'s Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW) in 1974, he began working tours for All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). On April 27, 1978, Flair challenged for the NWA United National Championship in a losing effort. Throughout the 1980s, Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in All Japan against the likes of Genichiro Tenryu, Riki Choshu, Jumbo Tsuruta, Harley Race, and Kerry Von Erich. On October 21, 1985, Flair wrestled Rick Martel in a double title match where he defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and challenged for the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, but the match ended in a double countout. As All Japan withdrew from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) in the late 1980s, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) began a working agreement with New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW). In 1989, the working agreement led to a feud between Flair and Keiji Mutoh, who was wrestling under The Great Muta gimmick, in the United States for WCW. On March 21, 1991, Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and challenged Tatsumi Fujinami for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in a double title match on the WCW/New Japan Supershow at the Tokyo Dome. Fujinami beat Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, but later lost the title at WCW's SuperBrawl on May 19, 1991 in the United States.\n\nWhen Flair left WCW for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1991, he continued to tour Japan in the Super World of Sports (SWS) promotion, due to an agreement between WWF and SWS. He defended and retained the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Genichiro Tenryu on September 15, 1992 in a match that resulted in a draw. In August 1995, under a WCW contract, Flair participated in the G1 Climax tournament in New Japan, where he beat Shiro Koshinaka, drew Masahiro Chono, and lost to Keiji Mutoh. On July 17, 1996, Flair challenged Shinya Hashimoto for the IWGP Heavyweight Championship in a losing effort in NJPW.\n\nOnce again under the WWE banner, Flair continued to tour Japan periodically between 2002 and 2008. He successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship with Batista against The Dudley Boyz twice in February 2004. On the February 7, 2005 episode of \"Raw\", broadcast from the Saitama Super Arena in Japan, Flair lost to Shawn Michaels in a singles match. In February 2008, Flair wrestled Mr. Kennedy in the Ariake Coliseum and William Regal in the Budokan Hall, both under the stipulation that he would retire if he lost.\n\nOn January 2, 2013, All Japan announced that Flair would make his return to AJPW for the first time in five years on January 26, 2013, teaming with Keiji Mutoh to take on Tatsumi Fujinami and Seiya Sanada. This would have been his first professional wrestling match since his September 2011 loss to Sting on \"Impact Wrestling\" and his first for All Japan since March 1987. However, on January 26, just moments before the start of the All Japan event, the promotion announced that Flair was forced to pull out of his match because of a \"sudden illness\", later reported as a badly swollen left leg. Flair was replaced in the match by his son Reid, but also ended up getting involved in the match himself, delivering chops to Seiya Sanada.\n\nIn 1974, Flair left the AWA for Jim Crockett's Mid-Atlantic region in the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and he soon captured his first singles title, when on February 9, 1975 he beat Paul Jones for the Mid-Atlantic TV Championship. On October 4, 1975, however, Flair's career nearly ended when he was in a serious plane crash in Wilmington, North Carolina that took the life of the pilot and paralyzed Johnny Valentine (also on board were Mr. Wrestling, Bob Bruggers, and promoter David Crockett). Flair broke his back in three places and, at age 26, was told by doctors that he would never wrestle again. Flair conducted a rigorous physical therapy schedule, however, and he returned to the ring just eight months later, where he resumed his feud with Wahoo McDaniel in February 1976. The crash did force Flair to change his wrestling technique away from the power brawling style he had used early on, which led him to adopt the \"Nature Boy\" style he would use throughout his career. Flair won the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship when he defeated Bobo Brazil on July 29, 1977. During the next three years, he held five reigns as NWA United States Heavyweight Champion while feuding with Ricky Steamboat, Roddy Piper, Mr. Wrestling, Jimmy Snuka and Greg Valentine (with whom he also formed a championship tag team). However, Flair reached elite status when he began referring to himself as \"The Nature Boy\" in order to incite a 1978 feud with the original \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers, who put Flair over in one encounter.\n\nOn September 17, 1981, Flair beat Dusty Rhodes for his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship. In the following years, Flair established himself as the promotion's main franchise in the midst of emerging competition from Vince McMahon's World Wrestling Federation (WWF). An unsanctioned title loss took place on January 6, 1983 to Carlos Colón Sr. in Puerto Rico. Flair recovered the championship belt in a phantom change seventeen days later not officially recognized by the NWA. Harley Race won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Flair in 1983, but Flair regained the title at Starrcade in a steel cage match. Officially, Flair won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship eight more times. Flair lost the title to Race and won it back in the span of three days in New Zealand and Singapore in March 1984. At the first David Von Erich Memorial Parade of Champions at Texas Stadium, Flair was pinned by Kerry Von Erich, but he regained the title eighteen days later in Japan and reigned for two years, two months and two days, losing the title to Dusty Rhodes on July 26, 1986 at The Great American Bash. However, Flair regained the title two weeks later.\n\nIn late 1985, the tag team of Arn Anderson and Ole Anderson began aiding Flair (whom they claimed as a \"cousin\") in attacks against Dusty Rhodes, Magnum T.A. and Sam Houston. A few weeks later, the Andersons interrupted Houston's match against Tully Blanchard and the three villains combined to rough up the youngster. Shortly thereafter, Flair, Blanchard and the Andersons formalized their alliance, calling themselves The Four Horsemen, with Blanchard's manager J.J. Dillon also coming on board. Upon the group's inception, it was clear that The Four Horsemen were unlike any villainous alliance that had ever existed, as the four rule breakers immediately used their strength in numbers to decimate the NWA's top fan favorites while controlling the majority of the championship titles.\n\nBy 1986, wrestling promoter Jim Crockett had consolidated the various NWA member promotions he owned into a single entity, running under the banner of the National Wrestling Alliance. Controlling much of the traditional NWA territories in the southeast and Midwestern United States, Crockett looked to expand nationally and built his promotion around Flair as champion. During this time, Flair's bookings as champion were tightly controlled by Crockett, and a custom championship belt was created for Flair. Flair lost the NWA World Heavyweight Championship in Detroit to Ron Garvin on September 25, 1987. Garvin held the title for two months before losing to Flair on November 26, 1987 at WCW's first pay-per-view event, Starrcade, in Chicago.\n\nIn early 1988, Sting and Flair fought to a 45-minute time-limit draw at the first ever \"Clash of the Champions\". On February 20, 1989, at Chi-Town Rumble in Chicago, Ricky Steamboat pinned Flair to win the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. This prompted a series of rematches, where Steamboat was presented as a \"family man\" (often accompanied by his wife and young son), while Flair opposed him as an immoral, fast-living \"ladies man\". Following a best-of-three falls match with Steamboat that lasted just short of the 60-minute time limit (and ended with a disputed finish where Steamboat retained the title) at \"Clash of the Champions VI: Ragin' Cajun\" on April 2, Flair regained the title from Steamboat on May 7, 1989 at WrestleWar in a match that was voted 1989's \"Match of the Year\" by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\". On July 23, 1989, Flair defeated Terry Funk at The Great American Bash, but the two continued to feud through the summer and eventually Flair reformed The Four Horsemen, with the surprise addition of longtime rival Sting, to combat Funk's J-Tex Corporation. This led to an \"I Quit\" match at \"\" which Flair won. Flair then kicked Sting out of The Four Horsemen upon his challenge for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, resulting in a revived feud between the two. On July 7, 1990, Flair dropped the title to Sting at The Great American Bash. After being unmasked as The Black Scorpion at Starrcade in 1990, Flair regained the title from Sting on January 11, 1991.\n\nSubsequent to this title win, Flair was recognized by WCW as the first WCW World Heavyweight Champion, though he was still also recognized as NWA World Heavyweight Champion. On March 21, 1991, Tatsumi Fujinami defeated Flair in a match in Tokyo at the WCW/New Japan Supershow. While the NWA recognized Fujinami as their new champion, WCW did not because Fujinami had backdropped Flair over the top rope in a violation of WCW rules. On May 19, 1991, Flair defeated Fujinami at SuperBrawl I in St. Petersburg, Florida to reclaim the NWA World Heavyweight Championship and retain the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. In the spring of 1991, Flair had a contract dispute with WCW president Jim Herd, who wanted him to take a substantial pay cut. Herd had removed Flair as head booker in February 1990 and wanted to reduce Flair's role in the promotion even further, despite the fact that Flair was still a top draw. According to Flair, Herd also proposed changes in his appearance and ring name (i.e. by shaving his hair, wearing a diamond earring and going by the name Spartacus) in order to \"change with the times\". Flair disagreed with the proposals and two weeks before The Great American Bash, Herd fired him and vacated the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. While Flair had left for the WWF, he was still recognized as the NWA World Heavyweight Champion until September 8, when the title was officially vacated.\n\nFlair signed with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in September 1991 and began appearing on television with the Big Gold Belt, calling himself \"The Real World Champion\". Led by his \"financial adviser\" Bobby Heenan and his \"executive consultant\" Mr. Perfect, Flair repeatedly issued challenges to WWF wrestlers like \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper and Hulk Hogan, wrestling a team led by Piper at Survivor Series in November 1991 and helping The Undertaker defeat Hogan for the WWF Championship that same night. WCW sued Flair in an attempt to reclaim the championship belt, but Flair claimed that he owned the title belt in lieu of the US$25,000 deposit paid by NWA champions upon winning the title, which had not been returned to him when he was fired from WCW.\n\nAt the 1992 Royal Rumble, Flair won the Rumble match to claim the vacant WWF Championship. Flair entered as number three in the Rumble match and lasted 60 minutes, last eliminating Sid Justice with help from Hulk Hogan, who had been eliminated by Justice seconds earlier. Randy Savage then challenged Flair for the WWF Championship as part of the double main event at WrestleMania VIII. In the storyline, Flair taunted Savage by claiming that he had a prior relationship with Savage's wife, Miss Elizabeth. Savage defeated Flair for the title at WrestleMania. In July 1992, as Savage prepared to defend the title against The Ultimate Warrior at SummerSlam, Flair and Mr. Perfect sowed distrust between the two by suggesting that they would back one or the other during their match. They actually attacked both Savage and Warrior and injured Savage's knee, an injury that Flair exploited to regain the title in a match with Savage on September 1. His second reign was short-lived, however, as he lost the title to Bret Hart on October 12, 1992.\n\nFlair teamed with Razor Ramon to take on Savage and Perfect at the Survivor Series in November 1992. Flair appeared in the Royal Rumble in January 1993, then lost a Loser Leaves the WWF match to Mr. Perfect on the next night's (January 25) \"Monday Night Raw\" in a match taped six days earlier. Flair then fulfilled his remaining house show commitments, making his last appearance on February 10, 1993, before returning to WCW.\n\nFlair triumphantly returned to WCW as a hero in February 1993, as a result of a \"no-compete\" clause he was unable to wrestle, so he hosted a short-lived talk show in WCW called \"A Flair for the Gold\". Arn Anderson usually appeared at the bar on the show's set, and Flair's maid Fifi cleaned or bore gifts. Once he returned to action, Flair briefly held the NWA World Heavyweight Championship for a tenth time after defeating Barry Windham at Beach Blast before WCW finally left the NWA in September 1993. At Fall Brawl, Flair lost the title, now rebranded the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship, to \"Ravishing Rick\" Rude. At Starrcade in 1993, Flair defeated Vader to win the WCW World Heavyweight title for the second time. In the spring of 1994, Flair began a tweener turn and started another feud with longtime rival Ricky Steamboat and challenged Steamboat to a match at Spring Stampede which ended in a no contest from a double pin, causing the title to be held up. Flair then defeated Steamboat in a rematch to reclaim the held-up title on an episode of WCW Saturday Night. The WWE does not count this victory as a new title win. Flair then challenged Col. Robert Parker to wrestle one of his men at Slamboree, which turned out to be Barry Windham, whom Flair defeated, afterwards he quietly turned heel and took Sherri Martel as his manager. He would also wrestle Lord Steven Regal in a five-match series under Marquess of Queensberry Rules, which aired on WCW Worldwide between April 30 and May 28, in which Flair won the series, with 2 wins, 1 loss, and 2 draws.\n\nIn June 1994 at \"Clash of the Champions XXVII\", Flair defeated Sting in a unification match, merging the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship with the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, and solidifying his heel turn. After becoming the unified and undisputed WCW champion, Flair feuded with Hulk Hogan upon Hogan's arrival in WCW in June 1994, losing the WCW World Heavyweight Championship to him in July at Bash at the Beach. Flair continued to feud with Hogan and finally lost to Hogan in a steel cage retirement match at Halloween Havoc. Flair took a few months off afterwards before returning as a wrestler and part-time manager for Vader in 1995 (explained on-air by having Flair nag Hogan for months until Hogan and Savage both petitioned WCW management to let Flair come back).\n\nOn April 29, 1995, Flair wrestled Antonio Inoki in front of 190,000 spectators in Pyongyang, North Korea at the May Day Stadium in a losing effort under a joint show between New Japan Pro Wrestling and World Championship Wrestling. The event was broadcast on August 4, 1995 on pay-per-view under the title of Collision in Korea. In the fall of 1995, Flair began a short feud with Arn Anderson, which culminated in a tag match that saw Flair turning on Sting to reform the new Four Horsemen with Flair as the leader, Arn Anderson, Brian Pillman, and Chris Benoit as the members. With the new Four Horsemen, Flair won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship two more times before the nWo invasion storyline began in WCW, with the first one being in December 1995 at Starcade, where Flair defeated Lex Luger and Sting by countout and then defeated Savage after all three Four Horsemen members ran to the ring and Arn Anderson knocked out Savage with brass knuckles, thus allowing Flair to pin Savage to win the match and the title. Afterwards Savage won the title back on \"Nitro\" after Starcade, but Flair won the next match at SuperBrawl VI to regain the championship. During the feud, Savage's manager Miss Elizabeth turned against him and became Flair's valet. Together with Woman and Debra McMichael they would escort Flair to his matches until Miss Elizabeth was taken by the nWo in the fall and eventually returned as Savage's valet when he joined the nWo in 1997. Flair lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship eventually three months later to The Giant. The feud with Savage continued with The New Four Horseman joining the Dungeon of Doom to create an Alliance to end Hulkamania. Together the factions wrestled Hogan and Savage in a triple steel cage, End of Hulkamania match; losing to the reunited Mega Powers. Afterwards, Flair went on to win the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship and there were also changes in the Four Horseman in 1996, as Brian Pillman left WCW and Steve \"Mongo\" McMichael became the fourth member.\n\nOnce again as a top fan favorite, Flair played a major role in the New World Order (nWo) invasion storyline in late 1996 and throughout 1997. He and the other Horsemen often took the lead in the war against Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, and Hollywood Hulk Hogan, whom Flair immediately challenged for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship at the \"Clash of the Champions XXXIII\", but won only by disqualification. In September 1996, Flair and Anderson teamed with their bitter rivals, Sting and Lex Luger, to lose to the nWo (Hogan, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, and an impostor Sting) in the WarGames match at Fall Brawl when Luger submitted to the impostor Sting's Scorpion Deathlock.\n\nIn October 1996, two developments occurred that affected the Four Horsemen when Jeff Jarrett came over to WCW from the WWF, and expressed his desire to join the Horsemen as he immediately gained a fan in Ric Flair, much to the chagrin of the other Horsemen. Flair finally let Jarrett join the group in February 1997, but the others did not want him, and in July 1997 was ultimately kicked out of the group by Flair himself, who had enough of the instability Jarrett's presence caused the Horsemen. Flair also feuded with Roddy Piper, Syxx, and his old nemesis Curt Hennig in 1997, after Hennig was offered a spot in The Four Horsemen only to turn on Flair and The Four Horsemen at Fall Brawl in September 1997, in which Hennig punctuated the act by slamming the cage door onto Flair's head.\nIn April 1998, Flair disappeared from WCW television, due to a lawsuit filed by Eric Bischoff for no-showing a live episode of \"Thunder\" on April 16, 1998 in Tallahassee, Florida. After the case was settled, Flair made a surprise return on September 14, 1998 to ceremoniously reform the Four Horsemen (along with Steve McMichael, Dean Malenko, and Chris Benoit). Flair feuded with Bischoff for several months afterward. Flair repeatedly raked Eric Bischoff's eyes during this feud. This culminated in a match at Starrcade between Bischoff and Flair in December 1998, which Bischoff won after interference from Curt Hennig, a former member of the Four Horsemen. The following night in Baltimore on \"Nitro\", Flair returned and threatened to leave WCW, demanding a match against Bischoff for the presidency of the company. The match was made, and despite the nWo interfering on Bischoff's behalf Flair won and was granted the position of president of WCW. This resulted in a match at Superbrawl between Flair and Hollywood Hogan for the WCW Championship, which Flair lost after being betrayed by his own son David Flair.\n\nIn spite of his son's betrayal, Flair signed a rematch at Uncensored which was billed as a First Blood barbed wire steel cage Match against Hogan where Flair's presidency and Hogan's WCW World Heavyweight Championship were on the line. Despite being the first to bleed, Flair won the match by pinfall thanks to the bias of the referee Charles Robinson, who counted Hogan out.\n\nAs on-air WCW President, Flair began abusing his power much like Bischoff had, favoring villains over fan favorites and even awarding the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship (which was vacated by Scott Steiner due to injury) to his son David and resorting to whatever means necessary to keep him as United States Heavyweight Champion. Flair eventually formed a stable of followers which included Roddy Piper, Arn Anderson and the Jersey Triad to keep things in order. Flair's reign as president came to an end on the July 19 episode of \"Nitro\", when he faced and lost to Sting for the position. During the course of the match, Sting had Flair in his Scorpion Death Lock, but with the referee knocked unconscious, no decision could be reached. A returning Eric Bischoff came to the ring and began ordering the timekeeper to ring the bell, which he eventually did, awarding the match and the presidency to Sting (who promptly gave it up upon receiving it).\n\nFlair won his last world titles in his career by winning the WCW World Heavyweight Championship twice during 2000, the company's last full year of operation. When WCW was purchased by the WWF in March 2001, Flair was the leader of the villainous group called the Magnificent Seven. Flair lost the final match of \"Nitro\" to Sting, recreating the second match of \"Nitro\" in 1995. Nevertheless, Flair has repeatedly stated in various interviews how happy he was when WCW finally closed down, although at the same time the fact that many people would lose their jobs saddened him.\n\nAfter an eight-month hiatus from wrestling, Flair made a return to the WWF in November 2001. Flair reappeared on \"Raw\" following the end of the \"WCW/ECW Invasion\" that culminated in a \"Winner Take All\" match at Survivor Series won by the WWF. Flair's new on-screen role was that of the co-owner of the WWF, with the explanation that Shane and Stephanie McMahon had sold their stock in the company to a consortium (namely Flair) prior to purchasing World Championship Wrestling and Extreme Championship Wrestling. Flair's feud with Vince McMahon led them to a match at the Royal Rumble in January 2002 in a Street Fight, where Flair defeated McMahon. Flair also wrestled The Undertaker at WrestleMania X8 in March 2002 where Flair lost. The \"co-owner\" angle culminated in early 2002, when Flair controlled \"Raw\" and McMahon controlled \"SmackDown!\" After Stone Cold Steve Austin abruptly left the renamed WWE in June while in a program with Flair, a match was hotshotted between Flair and McMahon for sole ownership of WWE, which Flair lost after interference from Brock Lesnar.\n\nIn September 2002 at Unforgiven, Triple H defended the World Heavyweight Championship against Rob Van Dam. During the match, Flair came down to the ring and grabbed the sledgehammer from Triple H and teased hitting him before hitting Van Dam, allowing Triple H to get the win, turning him heel in the process and accompanied Triple H to the ring as his manager. Shortly after, Batista moved from \"SmackDown!\" to \"Raw\" and Flair also began accompanying him to the ring while continuing to second Triple H. In June 2003 at Bad Blood, Flair was able to defeat Shawn Michaels after Orton struck Michaels with a chair.\n\nAt the height of Evolution's power, the group controlled all of the male-based championships of \"Raw\" after Armageddon. Batista teamed with Flair to win the World Tag Team Championship from the Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and D-Von Dudley) in a tag team turmoil match and Triple H regained the World Heavyweight Championship from Goldberg (in a triple threat match that also involved Kane), with the help of the other members. In January 2004 at the Royal Rumble, Flair and Batista successfully defended the World Tag Team Championship against the Dudley Boyz in a tables match, and World Heavyweight Champion Triple H fought Shawn Michaels to no contest in a Last Man Standing match, thus retaining the championship. Flair and Batista lost the World Tag Team Championship on February 16 edition of Raw to Booker T and Rob Van Dam. At WrestleMania XX, Evolution defeated the Rock 'n' Sock Connection (The Rock and Mick Foley) in a 3-on-2 handicap match. The following week on \"Raw\" during the 2004 WWE draft lottery, Flair and Batista defeated Booker T and Rob Van Dam to win their second and final World Tag Team Championship. While still world champion, Benoit teamed with Edge to take the World Tag Team Championship from Flair and Batista on April 19 \"Raw\".\n\nAt SummerSlam, Orton pinned Benoit to become the new World Heavyweight Champion and the youngest World Champion in WWE history to date. Batista hoisted Orton on to his shoulders in what appeared to be a celebration, but following the thumbs down from Triple H, the group proceeded to attack Orton. At Unforgiven, Triple H beat Orton to regain the World Heavyweight Championship, with help from Flair, Batista, and Jonathan Coachman. Orton's feud with Evolution continued until Survivor Series where Triple H, Batista, Gene Snitsky, and Edge were defeated by Orton, Maven, Chris Jericho, and Chris Benoit in a Survivor Series match for control of \"Raw\" over the following month.\n\nIn the Elimination Chamber match at New Year's Revolution, Batista, Orton and Triple H were the last three remaining in the match. Orton eliminated Batista with a RKO and Triple H pinned Orton with Batista's help to win the title. Triple H suggested that Batista not enter the Royal Rumble match, wanting the group to focus on Triple H retaining the title. Batista declined, entered the Rumble at number 28 and won. Triple H tried to persuade Batista to challenge the WWE Champion John \"Bradshaw\" Layfield of SmackDown! rather than for his World Heavyweight Championship. This involved Triple H plotting a feud between JBL and Batista, showing JBL badmouthing Batista in an interview and staging an attack on Batista with a limousine designed to look like Layfield's. The scheme was unsuccessful and at the brand contract signing ceremony, Batista chose to remain on Raw, infuriating Triple H and thus quitting the faction. Batista defeated Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania 21.\n\nAfter Vengeance, Triple H took time off, Flair turned face for the first time since 2002 before going on to win the Intercontinental Championship, and the group was dissolved. Triple H returned at the \"Homecoming\" episode of \"Raw\" on October 3 where he was to team with Flair in a tag team match against Carlito and Chris Masters. After winning that match, Triple H betrayed Flair and attacked him with a sledgehammer. Flair retained the Intercontinental Championship against Triple H at Taboo Tuesday in a steel cage match, which was voted as such by the fans. Flair later lost to Triple H in a Last Man Standing non-title match at Survivor Series which ended their feud.\n\nAt the end of 2005, Flair had a feud with Edge that culminated in a WWE Championship Tables, Ladder and Chairs match on \"Raw\" in early 2006, which Flair lost. On the February 20 episode of \"Raw\", he lost the Intercontinental Championship to Shelton Benjamin, thus ending his reign at 155 days. Flair took some time off in mid-2006 to rest and marry for the third time and he returned in June to work a program with his real-life rival Mick Foley that played off their legitimate past animosity. Flair defeated Foley at Vengeance in a two out of three falls match, then at SummerSlam in an \"I Quit\" match.\nSubsequently, he was involved in a rivalry with the Spirit Squad on \"Raw\". On November 5, 2006 at Cyber Sunday, he captured the World Tag Team Championship from the Squad with Roddy Piper. On the November 13 episode of \"Raw\", Flair and Piper lost the Tag Titles to Rated-RKO, due to a disc problem with Piper and had to be flown immediately back to the USA as soon as \"Raw\" was off the air. On November 26, 2006 at Survivor Series, Flair was the sole survivor of a match that featured himself, Ron Simmons (replacing an injured Piper), Dusty Rhodes and Sgt. Slaughter versus the Spirit Squad. Flair then left television due to his divorce hearings.\n\nFlair then began teaming with Carlito after Flair said that Carlito had no heart. Flair defeated Carlito in a match after which Carlito realized that Flair was right. Flair and Carlito faced off against Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch in a number one contender's match for the World Tag Team Championship but were defeated. The two teamed up on the WrestleMania 23 pre-show, and defeated the team of Chavo Guerrero and Gregory Helms. After weeks of conflict between Flair and Carlito, the team split up when Carlito attacked Flair during a match. At Judgment Day, Flair defeated Carlito with the figure four leglock.\n\nOn the June 11 episode of \"Raw\", Flair was drafted from Raw to SmackDown! as part of the 2007 WWE draft. He briefly feuded against Montel Vontavious Porter and rejoined forces with Batista to feud with The Great Khali; the alliance was short-lived, however, as Flair was \"injured\" during a match with Khali.\n\nAfter a three-month hiatus, Flair returned to WWE programming on the November 26 episode of \"Raw\" to announce \"I will never retire\". Vince McMahon retaliated by announcing that the next match Flair lost would result in a forced retirement. Later in the night, Flair defeated Orton after a distraction by Chris Jericho. It was revealed on the 15th anniversary of \"Raw\" that the win or retire ultimatum only applied in singles matches. Flair won several \"career threatening\" matches against the opponents such as Triple H, Umaga, William Regal, Mr. Kennedy, and Vince McMahon himself among others. On March 29, 2008, Flair was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as a part of the class of 2008 by Triple H. The day after, Flair wrestled at WrestleMania XXIV in Orlando, Florida, losing to Shawn Michaels. The match was lauded by fans and critics and was voted the 2008 \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" (PWI) Match of the Year. Flair's fight to keep his career going garnered him the 2008 \"PWI\" \"Most Inspirational Wrestler of the Year\" award.\n\nOn the March 31, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", Flair delivered his farewell address. Afterward, Triple H brought out many current and retired superstars to thank Flair for all he has done, including Shawn Michaels, some of the Four Horsemen, Harley Race, and Chris Jericho, followed by The Undertaker and then Vince McMahon. Along with the wrestlers, the fans gave Flair a standing ovation. This event represented a rare moment in WWE as both the heels and the faces broke character and came out to the ring together. Flair made his first post retirement appearance on the June 16, 2008 episode of \"Raw\" to confront Chris Jericho about his actions during a rivalry with Shawn Michaels. He challenged Jericho to a fight in the parking lot, rather than an official match, but was ejected from the building by Vince McMahon.\n\nThe following year on February 9, Flair once again confronted Jericho on \"Raw\". Jericho was attacking Hall of Fame members and Flair demanded he respect them, before punching Jericho. Flair appeared a month later to distract him during a Money in the Bank Qualifying Match. Jericho then challenged Flair to come out of retirement for WrestleMania XXV; instead Flair managed Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka and Ricky Steamboat in a three-on-one handicap match at WrestleMania in a losing effort. On May 17, Flair returned during the Judgment Day pay-per-view, coming to the aid of Batista, who was being attacked by The Legacy (Randy Orton, Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase). On the June 1 episode of \"Raw\", Flair challenged Orton in a parking lot brawl match, after an interference from the rest of The Legacy, the fight ended with Flair was trapped inside a steel cage and was punted by Orton. After \"Raw\", Flair left WWE when his contract expired on June 2, 2009.\n\nFlair signed with Ring of Honor (ROH) and appeared at the \"Stylin' And Profilin\"' event in March 2009, clearing the ring after an ROH World Championship match ended with a run-in. He soon served as the company's ambassador, in an on-screen authority role, and appeared on the television show \"Ring of Honor Wrestling\" in May to cement his role. After a number one contender's match ended in a time-limit draw, and the following week a double count out, Flair announced \"Ring of Honor Wrestling's\" first ROH World Title match as a four-way contest.\n\nOn November 21, 2009, Flair returned to the ring as a villain on the \"\" tour of Australia, losing to Hulk Hogan in the main event of the first show by brass knuckles. Hogan defeated Flair again on November 24 in Perth, Australia after both men bled heavily. Flair also lost to Hogan on the two remaining matches on the tour.\n\nOn the January 4, 2010 episode Total Nonstop Action Wrestling's (TNA) \"Impact!\", Flair made his debut appearance for the company arriving via limo and later observing the main event between A.J. Styles and longtime rival Kurt Angle. It was later reported that Flair had signed a one-year deal with the company. In the past, Flair has openly stated that he was loyal to the McMahons and wanted to end his career in WWE, however he had not had contact from WWE since June 2009 and decided to sign with TNA Wrestling after waiting for the call from WWE for six months. On January 17 at Genesis, Flair helped Styles cheat to pin Angle and retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nIn addition to Styles, Flair began informally managing Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) and Desmond Wolfe as a loose alliance. On the March 8 episode of \"Impact!\", Hulk Hogan and Abyss defeated Flair and Styles when Abyss pinned Styles. Afterwards, the returning Jeff Hardy saved Abyss and Hogan from a beatdown at the hands of Flair, Styles and Beer Money, Inc. At Lockdown, Team Flair (Ric Flair, Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) was defeated by Team Hogan (Hulk Hogan, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Jeff Hardy and Rob Van Dam) in a Lethal Lockdown match. On the April 26 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair was defeated by Abyss in a match where Flair's and Hogan's WWE Hall of Fame rings were at stake, and as a result Flair lost possession of his ring to Hogan. The following week, Hogan gave the ring to Jay Lethal, who returned it to Flair out of respect. This, however, was not enough for Flair, who attacked Lethal along with the members of Team Flair. After Styles dropped the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Rob Van Dam, then failed to regain it in a rematch and later was pinned by Jay Lethal, Flair adopted Kazarian as his newest protégé, seemingly replacing Styles as his number one wrestler.\n\nOn the June 17 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair announced that he would reform the Four Horsemen under the new name , a group consisting of A.J. Styles, Kazarian, Robert Roode, James Storm, and Desmond Wolfe. Flair made a return to the ring on July 11 at Victory Road, losing to Jay Lethal. On the August 5 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair faced Lethal in a rematch, this time contested under Street Fight rules, with the members of banned from ringside; Flair managed to win the match after an interference from Douglas Williams. The following week, Williams and Matt Morgan were added to . In the weeks leading to Bound for Glory, Flair's stable's name was tweaked to Fortune to represent the expansion in the number of members in the group. On the October 7 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair was defeated by Mick Foley in a Last Man Standing match.\nOn the following episode of \"Impact!\", Fortune formed an alliance with Hulk Hogan's and Eric Bischoff's new stable, Immortal. On the November 18 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair returned to the ring, competing in a match where he faced Matt Morgan, who had been kicked out of Fortune the previous month; Morgan won the match after Douglas Williams turned on the rest of Fortune, when they interfered in the match. On January 25, 2011, it was reported that Flair had pulled out of TNA's \"Maximum Wooo!\" tour of Europe mid–tour after monetary disputes. After missing a show in Berlin, Germany, Flair returned to the tour on January 27 in Glasgow, Scotland, reportedly apologizing to the locker room prior to the show. On January 29, Flair wrestled his only match of the tour, defeating Douglas Williams in London, tearing his rotator cuff in the process. During Flair's time away from TNA, Fortune turned on Immortal. Flair returned at the February 14 tapings of the February 17 episode of \"Impact!\", turning on Fortune during a match between A.J. Styles and Matt Hardy and jumping to Immortal. On the March 10 episode of \"Impact!\", Flair defeated Styles and Hardy in a three–way street fight, contested as more of a two–on–one handicap match. On April 17 at Lockdown, Immortal, represented by Flair, Abyss, Bully Ray and Matt Hardy, was defeated by Fortune members James Storm, Kazarian and Robert Roode and Christopher Daniels, who replaced an injured A.J. Styles, in a Lethal Lockdown match, when Flair tapped out to Roode. The match was used to write Flair off television, as the following week he was scheduled to undergo surgery for his torn rotator cuff; however, Flair ultimately chose not to have the surgery as it would have required six months of rehab.\n\nFlair returned to television in a non–wrestling role on the May 12 episode of \"Impact!\" Flair did not appear again for three months, until making his return on August 9 at the tapings of the August 18 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", confronting old rival Sting and challenging him to one more match. In exchange for Sting agreeing to put his career on the line, Flair promised to deliver him his match with Hogan if he was victorious. The match, which Flair lost, took place on the September 15 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\". During the match, Flair tore his left triceps on a superplex spot, sidelining him indefinitely from in-ring action. In May 2012, Flair tried to have his TNA contract terminated, which led to TNA filing a lawsuit against WWE for contract tampering and eventually firing Flair on May 11. Having been inactive since his September 2011 injury, Flair announced in a December 3, 2012 interview that he would never wrestle again, owing chiefly to an on-air heart attack suffered by age peer Jerry Lawler following a \"Raw\" match three months earlier.\n\nOn March 31, 2012, while still contracted to TNA, Flair became the first person to be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame twice, the second time as part of the Four Horsemen. On December 17, 2012, Flair returned to WWE as a non-wrestling personality on the annual Slammy Awards show to present the Superstar of the Year award to John Cena, who in turn gave the award to Flair. Flair's return was interrupted by CM Punk and Paul Heyman, escalating into a confrontation that ended with him locking Heyman in the figure-four leglock. After clearing the ring, Flair was assaulted by The Shield, until Ryback and Team Hell No (Kane and Daniel Bryan) helped Flair fend off the group.\n\nFlair appeared on the main roster sporadically throughout 2013, as The Miz's mentor. He also occasionally appeared on \"NXT\" in 2013 and 2014, accompanying his daughter Charlotte to the ring.\nFlair appeared on the April 28, 2014, episode of \"Raw\", alongside the reunited Evolution (minus Flair) and The Shield; Flair showed his endorsement for The Shield, Evolution's opponents at Extreme Rules, effectively turning his back on his old teammates. On July 14, John Cena symbolically handed over his World Heavyweight Championship belt to Flair, telling him to \"take it\" while promoting his match at Battleground. On the post-SummerSlam \"Raw\" in August 2015, Flair interrupted Jon Stewart, who had saved Flair's 16 world title record by preventing Cena's victory the previous night, telling him that the record would be broken eventually and he would rather it would be by someone who he respects.\n\nFlair began making more frequent appearances with Charlotte after she won the Divas Championship. In January 2016, Flair and Charlotte began displaying villainous traits, with Flair often getting involved in Charlotte's Divas Championship and later WWE Women's Championship defenses. This lasted until the May 23, 2016 episode of \"Raw\", when Charlotte turned on him. On the November 28, 2016 episode of \"Raw\", Flair returned to congratulate the new Raw Women's Champion Sasha Banks, who had defeated Charlotte to win the title. On the November 14, 2017 edition of \"SmackDown\", Flair returned to congratulate his daughter, after she won the SmackDown Women's title from Natalya, incidentally in Charlotte's hometown of Charlotte, North Carolina, this being his first appearance for WWE since nearly dying earlier in the year. \n\nFlair was often popular with the crowd due to his in-ring antics, including rulebreaking (earning him the distinction of being \"the dirtiest player in the game\"), strutting and his shouting of \"Wooooooo!\" (Flair got the inspiration from Jerry Lee Lewis' \"Great Balls of Fire\"). The \"Wooo!\" yell has since become a tribute to Flair, and is often shouted by the crowd whenever a wrestler performs a knife-edge chop, one of Flair's signature moves. It is also often shouted by the crowd whenever a wrestler utilizes Flair's figure-four leg lock finisher. From the late 1970s, Flair wore ornate fur-lined robes of many colors with sequins during in-ring appearances, and since the early 1980s, his approach to the ring was usually heralded by the playing of the \"Dawn\" section of Richard Strauss' \"\"Also sprach Zarathustra\"\" (famous for being used in the 1968 motion picture \"\" and for the introduction to Elvis Presley's concerts of the 1970s). Flair also described himself as a \"limousine-ridin', jet-flyin', kiss stealin', wheelin' dealin', son-of-a-gun (who kissed all the girls worldwide and made em cry)\".\n\nOn October 19, 1998, it was declared \"Ric Flair Day\" in Minneapolis, Minnesota by Mayor Sharon Belton and on November 15, 2008, it was declared \"Ric Flair Day\" in Norfolk, Virginia. On March 24, 2008, Mayor Bob Coble, of Columbia, South Carolina, declared March 24 to be Ric Flair Day in Columbia. Flair also received the key to the city. He received the key to the city of Greensboro, North Carolina on December 5, 2008, to commemorate Flair's victory in a steel cage match against Harley Race at the inaugural Starrcade event. April 18, 2009 was declared \"Ric Flair Day\" in Charleston, West Virginia and he was presented with the key to the city by the mayor. Also, on June 12, 2009, Flair was presented with the key to the city of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina and, in September, he received the key to the city in Marion County, South Carolina. On July 17, 2010, Flair made a special appearance at Scotland Motors in Laurinburg, North Carolina and received the key to that city, as well.\n\nOn the February 18, 2008 episode of \"Raw\", Shawn Michaels announced Flair as the first inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2008. The induction ceremony took place on March 29, 2008, with Triple H inducting him. This made him the first person to be inducted while still an active competitor. Flair was later inducted into the NWA Hall of Fame in Atlanta, Georgia, but he did not participate in the event. On January 9, 2012 it was announced that the Four Horsemen would be inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, thus making Flair the first person to have been inducted into the Hall of Fame twice.\n\nOn April 15, 2008, Flair was honored in Congress by a representative from North Carolina, Republican Sue Myrick, who praised his career and what he means to the state. On September 29, 2008, it was announced that Flair's signature sequin covered robe that he wore at WrestleMania XXIV, in what was to be his last WWE match, would be placed in the pop culture section of the National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn 1999, a large group of professional wrestling experts, analysts and historians named Flair the greatest NWA World Heavyweight Champion of all time. In 2002, Flair was named the greatest professional wrestler of all time in the magazine article\" 100 Wrestlers of All Time\" by John Molinaro, edited by Dave Meltzer and Jeff Marek. in July 2016, Luke Winkie of \"Sports Illustrated\" also named Flair the greatest professional wrestler of all time.\n\nFlair's \"Wooo\" chant has been used throughout pop culture, in hip-hop music in particular. Rapper Pusha T has paid homage to Flair in numerous songs. For example, on the track \"Sweet Serenade\", he says, \"Triple doubles, two hoes and check please (Wooo!), They love me on my Ric Flair shit (Wooo!), In that Phantom like I'm Blair Witch (Wooo!), Who are you to be compared with? (Wooo!)\". Rapper Killer Mike also has a track named \"Ric Flair\". Rapper Offset played tribute to Flair in his hit song \"Ric Flair Drip.\" \n\nSome have looked unfavorably upon Flair's career from the 1990s onward. In 1998, wrestler and former WCW colleague Stone Cold Steve Austin said that Flair had reached the \"time to hang it up\", having not been great for a \"long time\". John Molinaro of Slam! Sports penned a 1999 article titled, \"Ric Flair is tarnishing his legacy\"; Molinaro saw Flair as a wrestler whose prestige was \"in jeopardy\". In 2006, \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" writer Frank Ingiosi said that Flair had a \"personal vendetta against his legend\". He nevertheless continued to wrestle until retiring in 2008, at age 59. Following an elaborate farewell ceremony staged for Flair by WWE, wrestling personality Paul Heyman lamented his cutting promos at \"low rent wrestling shows\", calling it \"painful to watch\".\n\nFlair would ultimately return to the ring in 2009 and signed to wrestle for TNA the following year, breaking a vow to never again lace up his boots. Wrestler Axl Rotten, NFL writer Adam Rank, and many fans felt that he sullied his legend by continuing to wrestle in TNA. Asked in 2011 if Flair was tainting his prestige, former opponent Shane Douglas was harsher, stating that he had \"been tarnishing his legacy since 1990\". Also that year, Kevin Eck of \"The Baltimore Sun\" criticized the aging Flair for being unable to separate himself from his ostentatious gimmick when not wrestling, and said: \"I don't know what's sadder, Ric Flair tarnishing his legacy in the ring or embarrassing himself away from the ring\". Asked about Flair in 2015, wrestler The Honky Tonk Man felt that viewers would \"remember only the last years of his career\", which consist of \"bad memories\".\n\nConversely, professional wrestling announcer Jim Ross in 2012 felt that Flair had not tarnished his legacy, observing only \"passion and need to earn a living\". In 2016, Flair said continuing to wrestle in TNA was the \"number one\" regret of his career.\n\nFlair has made numerous appearances in television shows. In 1996, Flair, along with other WCW wrestlers, appeared in an episode of \"Baywatch\" as themselves. In 2013, Flair made an appearance in, \"Stuff You Should Know\", in the episode, \"Bacteriopolis\", as Dr. Roland Grayson. In 2014, Flair voiced himself in the animated series, \"Uncle Grandpa\", in the episode, \"History of Wrestling\".\n\nFlair released his autobiography, \"To Be the Man\", in July 2004. The title is taken from one of his catchphrases, \"To be the man, you gotta beat the man!\".\n\nIn 2009, Flair voiced the character, Commander Douglas Hill, in the video game, \"\".\n\nIt was announced on July 8, 2012 that Flair was to appear at Insane Clown Posse's 13th Annual Gathering of the Juggalos weekend as a main stage host who was in charge of announcing the performers. However, his appearance at the event was cut short after he was struck with a water bottle thrown from the crowd before announcing Tech N9ne to enter the main stage, at which point he left and did not announce Tech N9ne or go back out on the main stage to announce the remaining performers.\n\nIn 2015, Flair made his feature film debut, appearing in \"Magic Mike XXL\". From May 2015-April 2016, Flair was host of a podcast titled \"WOOOOO! Nation\". The podcast was placed on hiatus after episode 46 which was uploaded on April 1, 2016. Flair returned to podcasting on MLW Radio with a new show called \"The Ric Flair Show\" in July 2016. The final episode of \"The Ric Flair Show\" was uploaded on December 16, 2016.\n\nESPN aired \"Nature Boy\", a \"30 for 30\" documentary directed by Rory Karpf.\n\nOn December 5, 2017, Bad Bunny released a new music video entitled \"Chambea,\" of which Flair made an appearance.\n\nFlair married his first wife, Leslie Goodman, on August 28, 1971. They had two children, daughter Megan and son David, before divorcing in 1983 after twelve years of marriage. On August 27, 1983, he married his second wife, Elizabeth Harrell. Promoter Jim Crockett Jr. served as the best man for the wedding. They had two children, daughter Ashley and son Reid. Beth also made periodic appearances in WCW between 1998 and 2000. Flair and Beth divorced in 2006 after nearly 23 years of marriage. On May 27, 2006, Flair married his third wife Tiffany VanDemark, a fitness competitor. In 2008, Tiffany filed for divorce from Flair, which was finalized in 2009. On November 11, 2009, Flair married his fourth wife, Jacqueline \"Jackie\" Beems, in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 2012, Flair filed for divorce from Beems, which was finalized in 2014. Flair is dating Wendy Barlow (the maid \"Fifi\" from Flair's WCW interview segment \"A Flair for the Gold\") as documented on ABC TV's \"Celebrity Wife Swap\" where he swapped wife/girlfriend with Roddy Piper and his wife Kitty. Flair and Barlow got engaged in July 2016.\n\nFlair's son David is a semi-retired professional wrestler. Flair's younger son Reid, who signed a developmental contract with WWE near the end of 2007, was an accomplished high school wrestler and made several appearances on WCW television along with his sister Ashley and half-sister Megan. In 2004, Flair became a grandfather at the age of 55, when his older daughter, Megan Fliehr Ketzner, gave birth to her first child, a daughter named Morgan Lee Ketzner on May 9. On May 17, 2012, it was reported that Flair's daughter Ashley had signed with WWE adopting the ring name, Charlotte (which was later changed to include the Flair surname). On March 29, 2013, Reid died from an accidental overdose of heroin, Xanax and a muscle relaxer.\n\nIn December 2005, a judge issued arrest warrants for Flair after a road rage incident that took place in Charlotte, North Carolina in which Flair allegedly got out of his car, grabbed a motorist by the neck, and kicked the door off the motorist's sport utility vehicle. Flair was charged with two misdemeanors, injury to personal property and simple assault and battery. This incident was ridiculed on WWE programming, most notably by the wrestler Edge.\n\nIn September 2007, Flair opened a financial business called Ric Flair Finance. In July 2008, Flair Finance filed for bankruptcy. Following Flair's debut in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling his former employer, Ring of Honor, filed a lawsuit in 2010, alleging that Flair owed them over $40,000 and that he had not appeared at several events that he was contractually obligated to appear at. The lawsuit was never resolved.\n\nHighspots Inc. claimed that Flair had given them the NWA World Heavyweight Championship belt as collateral for the loan. A warrant for Flair's arrest was issued in May 2011 for being held in contempt of court for violating the terms of his settlement with Highspots. If Flair had failed to comply he could have potentially faced 90 days in jail. On June 25, Highspots released a statement over their official Facebook page stating that someone had paid Flair's debts.\n\nFlair has long supported Republican political candidates in North Carolina politics. In 2000, Flair explored the possibility of running for governor of North Carolina, but he never filed the papers.\n\nIn the 2008 presidential race, Flair declared his support for the Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee. He said of Huckabee, \"[Huckabee] is a quality person, self-made, a great family man and he has a great vision for our country. And I'm here to excite the crowd\".\n\nFlair endorsed Ted Cruz during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nFlair has a heart condition called alcoholic cardiomyopathy.\n\nOn August 14, 2017, Flair had surgery in Georgia to remove an obstructive piece of his bowel, which led to various complications, most seriously kidney failure, necessitating dialysis treatment and ongoing hospitalization. He was discharged from rehabilitation and allowed to return home on September 21, 2017.\n\nFlair engaged in an off-screen rivalry with Bret Hart. In October 1993, Hart gave a radio interview in which he said Flair \"sucks\" and described his workplace, WCW, as \"minor league\". In Flair's autobiography, Flair criticizes Hart for over-exploiting the death of his brother Owen and the controversy surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. Flair also claimed in his autobiography that—despite Hart's popularity in Canada—he was not a formidable money-making draw in the United States, a claim which Hart dismissed as \"plain ridiculous\" in a column written for the \"Calgary Sun\". Hart claimed that he drew greater revenue than Flair, citing his headlining performances on consistently sold out tours throughout his WWF career, while Flair wrestled to allegedly near-empty arenas. He also criticized Flair on what he perceived as insults to fellow wrestlers Mick Foley and Randy Savage, both personal friends of Hart. Hart acknowledged a decline in the WWF's popularity during the mid-1990s, but he and others felt that this was largely attributed to the WWF's well publicized sex and steroid scandals, as well as WCW's acquisition of former top WWF stars. In contrast to Flair's claims, prominent industry historian Dave Meltzer said there was \"no denying\" Hart's major drawing power in the United States. WWE owner Vince McMahon asserted that whichever company hired Hart could \"have built the entire franchise around Hart\" and described him as an \"extraordinary star\". McMahon added that it was \"fortunate for me, in terms of my company\", that his chief competitor, WCW, did not utilize Hart to his full potential. WCW described Hart as \"an incredible international draw, attracting standing room only crowds in every corner of the globe\". Professional wrestling magazine \"Power Slam\" has spoken to Hart's drawing power, placing him number 7 in \"The 10 Best U.S.-Style All-Rounders\", a list that considered drawing ability along with workrate and promo skills. Hart also criticized Flair in his own autobiography, mainly his in-ring talent and what Hart perceived as Flair's unsubtle blading. However, they have reconciled and are now friends.\n\nFlair also had a long running feud with Shane Douglas, who would refer to him as \"Dick Flair\" and accuse him of sabotaging his push in the NWA/WCW after getting a solid push and a rub from his tag team partner Ricky Steamboat. In turn, Flair responded that Douglas was always the guy that would blame his shortcomings on others. He called Douglas out as well as accused him of steroid abuse during a broadcast of the Internet radio show \"WCW Live!\" in which he said that he would meet him anytime and anywhere if he would \"take the needle out of his ass\".\n\nFlair has also had problems with Mick Foley. In his 1999 autobiography \"\", Foley said that \"Flair was every bit as bad on the booking side of things as he was great on the wrestling side of it\". This was in reference to how poorly Foley thought he was booked during his WCW career when Flair was on the booking committee. Flair responded in his autobiography by writing: \"I do not care how many thumbtacks Mick Foley has fallen on, how many ladders he's fallen off, how many continents he's supposedly bled on, he will always be known as a glorified stuntman\". However, they have reconciled and are now friends.\n\nIn his book, Flair also touched on some real-life tension between himself and Hulk Hogan which largely stemmed from an incident that followed the conclusion of a tag team match between Flair and his son David and the team of Curt Hennig and Barry Windham at WCW's Souled Out pay-per-view on January 17, 1999, in Charleston, South Carolina. However, Flair has stated that he and Hogan remained friends despite their differences.\n\nFlair and wrestler Bruno Sammartino had a real-life disagreement over what reports call \"the infamous backstage snub\" where Flair claims that Sammartino refused to shake his hand at a live event. While Flair claims Sammartino ignored him due to comments made in his book, stating Sammartino was \"a Northeast star who couldn’t draw fans outside New York\", Sammartino referred to Flair as a \"liar\" and stating: \"No, I don't respect Ric Flair. I don't respect him at all\". They have since reconciled and are now friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                "Sting (wrestler)\n\nSteve Borden (born March 20, 1959), better known by the ring name Sting, is an American retired professional wrestler, actor, author and former bodybuilder. He is currently signed with WWE under a Legends contract.\n\nSting is known for his time spent as the public face of two major professional wrestling promotions: the now-defunct World Championship Wrestling (WCW), which displaced the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) as the leading professional wrestling organization in the United States from 1995 to 1998, and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA). Borden is regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time, having cultivated a legacy over a career spanning more than three decades in which he held 15 world championships.\n\nSting's 14-year tenure with WCW and its predecessor, Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), began in 1987. Dubbed \"The Franchise of WCW\", he held a total of 15 championships in the promotion – including the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on six occasions, the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship on two occasions and the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on one occasion – and made more pay-per-view (PPV) appearances for the company than any other wrestler. Sting has been described as the WCW counterpart to the WWF's Hulk Hogan. Against Hogan, Sting headlined the highest-grossing PPV event in WCW history at Starrcade in December 1997. Upon the acquisition of WCW by the WWF in March 2001, Sting and his long-term rival Ric Flair were chosen to perform in the main event of the final episode of \"Nitro\".\n\nFollowing the expiration of his contract with WCW's parent company, AOL Time Warner, in March 2002, Borden held talks with the WWF, but ultimately did not join the promotion and instead toured internationally with World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) – winning the WWA World Heavyweight Championship – before joining the then-upstart TNA in 2003. Over the following 11 years, he won the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on one further occasion and the TNA World Heavyweight Championship four times, as well as being the inaugural inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame in 2012. He is the only man to hold the NWA, WCW (WWA and WCW international additionally) and TNA world championships in a career. Previously described by WWE as the greatest wrestler never to have performed for that promotion, Sting finally joined the company in 2014, making his first appearance at Survivor Series and having his debut match at WrestleMania 31 the following year. His last ever bout at Night of Champions in September 2015, marked his sole WWE pay-per-view main event and WWE World Heavyweight Championship contest for the organization. Sting headlined the WWE Hall of Fame class of 2016 on April 2, where he announced his retirement. His induction renders him the first performer to be inducted into both the WWE and TNA Hall of Fame, as well as the second man to be inducted while an active WWE wrestler after Ric Flair.\n\nSting held 25 total championships throughout his career, including 21 between WCW and TNA. Readers of \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" named him \"Most Popular Wrestler of the Year\" on four occasions, a record he shares with John Cena. In 2016, Sting was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame. Slam! Sports wrote that he holds \"a lofty level of prestige that few will ever touch\".\n\nBorden was born in Omaha, Nebraska and raised in Southern California. He played competitive football and basketball in high school and later embarked on a career in bodybuilding, once co-owning a Gold's Gym health club. Borden had no interest in professional wrestling and no television access to it within his home community, but decided to pursue a career in the industry after being taken to an \"incredible\" World Wrestling Federation (WWF) event in Los Angeles where he saw Hulk Hogan, The Iron Sheik, The British Bulldogs, André the Giant and others perform.\n\nBorden, originally wrestling under the ring name Flash, teamed with Jim \"Justice\" Hellwig as two members of Power Team USA in independent All-California Championship Wrestling. Power Team USA was a four-man unit also featuring Garland \"Glory\" Donahoe and Mark \"Commando\" Miller, plus manager Rick Bassman. Hellwig and Borden later moved to the Continental Wrestling Association, a wrestling company based in Memphis, Tennessee and became known as the Freedom Fighters. Fans were slow to respond to the lumbering hulks, so the team turned heel. The Freedom Fighters left the CWA after an uneventful run, the highlight of which was an angle in which they broke the leg of veteran wrestler Phil Hickerson.\n\nThe duo surfaced in the Universal Wrestling Federation, an organization run by Bill Watts and based in Shreveport, Louisiana where they were known as the Blade Runners. Borden changed his ring name from Flash to Sting, while Hellwig became known as Rock. They soon joined Hotstuff & Hyatt International, a heel stable headed by \"Hot Stuff\" Eddie Gilbert and Missy Hyatt. Together with \"Russian\" wrestler Kortsia Korchenko, the Blade Runners became henchmen in Gilbert's on-screen feud with Watts. Hellwig, who would later become The Ultimate Warrior in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), left the promotion in mid-1986, leaving Sting without a partner. Sting won the UWF World Tag Team Championship twice with Gilbert in 1986 and a third time with Rick Steiner in 1987.\n\nFollowing a match against Terry Taylor in mid-1987, Gilbert interfered on Taylor's behalf, costing Sting the match. Taylor and Gilbert ganged up on Sting until Gentleman Chris Adams came to Sting's aid. Adams cleared the ring and then asked Sting if he was with him or against him in his feud with Taylor and Gilbert. Sting turned face by declaring his allegiance to Adams.\n\nBehind the scenes, Gilbert endorsed Borden by telling a dirt sheet that Sting would be a megastar in the future. Later that year, Sting was tabbed to win the UWF Television Championship, then held by Gilbert, until Jim Crockett of the National Wrestling Alliance bought the company from Watts. Crockett's booker, Dusty Rhodes, decided to put the Television title on Taylor to set up a feud between Taylor and NWA Television Champion Nikita Koloff to unify the two titles. Rhodes used then-unknown Shane Douglas as the transitional champion from Gilbert to Taylor because Rhodes did not want to diminish Sting's growing stardom with a brief title run.\n\nSometime after Sting's arrival to the NWA in July 1987, Dusty Rhodes used the opening bout of Crockett's first foray into pay-per-view, Starrcade '87, to showcase the young superstar. Sting partnered with Michael P.S. Hayes and Jimmy Garvin in a six-man tag team match against Gilbert, Steiner, and Larry Zbyszko that ended in a 15-minute time-limit draw.\n\nHaving established himself as a rising star, Sting was one of the few UWF alumni to be pushed in the NWA. At the inaugural Clash of the Champions in March 1988, Sting challenged Ric Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The match ended in a draw after the 45-minute time limit expired and the ringside judges could not declare a winner. Sting lost to Flair in several non-televised rematches following the Clash and, later that year, battled other members of Flair's stable, the Four Horsemen. Sting teamed with Koloff at The Great American Bash in July 1988 to challenge Horsemen Tully Blanchard and Arn Anderson for the NWA World Tag Team Championship; Blanchard and Anderson retained the titles when the match ended in a 20-minute time-limit draw.\n\nRhodes continued to book Sting in title matches throughout the year against both NWA United States Champion Barry Windham and NWA Television Champion Mike Rotunda. In the fall of 1988, Sting was attacked by Hawk and Animal of The Road Warriors after a televised match. Rhodes, as booker, identified Sting as the face who was most over with the fans, despite knowing that turning the Road Warriors heel would be no easy task. Rhodes himself teamed with Sting to challenge the Road Warriors for the tag team championship at Starrcade '88 that December. Rhodes and Sting got the win by disqualification, allowing the Road Warriors to retain the titles.\n\nSting returned to singles matches in 1989, starting the year off by wrestling Flair to a one-hour draw in Atlanta's Omni on New Year's Day. He would also have his first experience in Japan with a brief tour in All Japan Pro Wrestling, with his most notable match in AJPW against Dan Spivey on January 25. After a long push, Sting won his first title in the NWA when he defeated Rotundo for the NWA Television Championship at a live event in March. Sting defended the Television title actively but tended to face sub-par challengers such as The Iron Sheik. In mid-1989, The Great Muta challenged Sting at The Great American Bash. The match was booked with a classic, controversial Dusty finish even though Rhodes (the namesake of the technique) had been fired months earlier. Sting got the three-count and was announced as the winner, but a replay showed Muta's shoulder was up at the count of two. The NWA decided to declare the title vacant. Sting and Muta battled in many rematches for the vacant Television title, but they always ended in disqualification, giving neither man the championship. Eventually, Muta won a No Disqualification match against Sting at a live event in September by using a blackjack to get the win and the title.\n\nIn the main event of that year's Great American Bash, Flair defended the NWA World Heavyweight Championship against Terry Funk, who was a member of Gary Hart's J-Tex Corporation. After Flair got the victory, he was attacked by Funk's stablemate, Muta. Sting came to the aid of his old rival Flair, and the two feuded with Muta and Funk for the rest of the summer and fall, culminating in a Thunderdome Cage match between the two teams, which Flair and Sting won, at Halloween Havoc '89. The alliance with Flair resulted in Sting joining the newly reformed and now-face Four Horsemen along with the Andersons, Arn and Ole. Sting finished out the year by winning a four-man round-robin Iron Man tournament at Starrcade '89. In the final match of the night, Sting defeated Flair to accumulate the necessary points to win the tournament. The victory made Sting the number one contender for Flair's NWA World title, leading to tension within the Four Horsemen.\n\nSting was summarily dismissed from The Four Horsemen on February 6, 1990, at after refusing to relinquish his title shot against Flair, thus restarting their rivalry. Later that evening, Borden suffered a legitimate knee injury while interfering in a steel cage match featuring the Horsemen. Borden's injury forced the bookers of World Championship Wrestling (WCW), the dominant promotion in the NWA, to find a new opponent for Flair for the forthcoming WrestleWar pay-per-view event.\n\nLex Luger was chosen to challenge Flair at WrestleWar. During the match between Flair and Luger, Sting came down to motivate Luger to come back and beat Flair. Before this Sting and Luger had been at odds. When Luger was close to winning Sting was attacked by Ole Anderson. Luger opted to save the already injured Sting and ended up losing the match by countout while assisting his friend. Behind the scenes, WCW officials had wanted Flair to drop the title to Luger at WrestleWar, but Flair refused, saying he had promised Borden he would hold the title until Borden could return to the ring. Despite the injury, Sting was still utilized on television and pay per views when necessary.\n\nAt the Capital Combat event in May, Sting was accosted by the Four Horsemen and thrown into a metal cage at ringside. In a promotional crossover, Sting was rescued by his buddy RoboCop. After Borden's recovery, Sting finally defeated Flair for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on July 7, 1990, at The Great American Bash. Sting went on to feud with title contenders Flair and Sid Vicious. Vicious appeared to defeat Sting in a title match at the 1990 Halloween Havoc, but the \"Sting\" that Vicious pinned was revealed to be an impostor played by Horseman Barry Windham. The real Sting appeared soon after and pinned Vicious to retain his title after the match was restarted.\n\nDuring Sting's title run, a masked man known as The Black Scorpion would taunt and attack Sting on many occasions. This feud culminated in a final showdown between Sting and The Black Scorpion at Starrcade: Collision Course in December. The cage match ended with Sting pinning and unmasking the Scorpion, who turned out to be Flair in disguise.\n\nSting's first world championship reign ended January 11, 1991, when Flair defeated him in a rematch from Starrcade. In the same month, WCW seceded from the National Wrestling Alliance, in the process recognizing a WCW World Heavyweight Championship and a WCW World Tag Team Championship. Sting then took part in what many consider to be one of the best matches of 1991, teaming with Luger to face The Steiner Brothers at the first SuperBrawl pay-per-view. The Steiners won by pinfall after Koloff, who had been feuding with Luger, interfered in the match by swinging a chain at Luger but hitting Sting instead. Consequently, Sting feuded with Koloff throughout the summer of 1991. In August 1991, Sting defeated Steve Austin to win a tournament for the vacated WCW United States Heavyweight Championship. Sting held the title for 86 days before losing it to Rick Rude at Clash of the Champions XVII.\n\nAt Starrcade '91, Sting won the first-ever Battlebowl battle royal, for which he received a Battlebowl championship ring. Sting then became embroiled in a feud with the Dangerous Alliance, headed by manager Paul E. Dangerously. The stable targeted Sting because he was the so-called \"franchise\" of WCW, and the Alliance vowed to destroy both Sting and the promotion he was the face of. At the same time, Sting was being targeted by Luger, who had once again turned heel and, as WCW Champion, viewed Sting as a threat. Sting engaged in many matches with Dangerous Alliance members, especially Rude, who was the group's biggest star. It was during this feud that Sting won the first of his six WCW World Heavyweight Championships, defeating Luger on February 29, 1992, at SuperBrawl II. The feud ended when Sting formed Sting's Squadron, consisting of allies Ricky Steamboat, Dustin Rhodes, Windham, and Koloff, and defeated the Alliance (Rude, Austin, Arn Anderson, Zbyszko, and Bobby Eaton) in a WarGames match at WrestleWar in May 1992. Dave Meltzer awarded the match his highest rating of five stars.\n\nNear the end of Sting's battles with the Dangerous Alliance, the seeds were sown for what became arguably one of the most famous feuds of Sting's career. Sting defended his WCW World title on April 12, 1992, at The Omni in Atlanta against the 450-pound Big Van Vader. During the match, Vader splashed Sting, cracking three of Sting's ribs and rupturing his spleen. Sting recovered and defended his title on July 12 against Vader at The Great American Bash, dropping the belt to Big Van Vader after missing a Stinger Splash, hitting his head on the ringpost, and receiving a powerbomb. After beating Cactus Jack in a Falls Count Anywhere Match at Beach Blast and WCW newcomer Jake Roberts in a Coal Miner's Glove match at Halloween Havoc, Sting defeated Vader, who had lost the WCW World Heavyweight Championship in August, in the \"King of Cable\" tournament final at Starrcade.\n\nThe Sting-Vader feud continued into 1993, with Vader, who was again WCW World Heavyweight Champion, defeating Sting in a bloody Strap match at SuperBrawl III. Sting exacted revenge by beating Vader for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on March 11 in London, England, but lost it back to Vader six days later in Dublin, Ireland. Sting then teamed with WCW newcomer Davey Boy Smith to beat the team of Vader and Vicious at Beach Blast in a match that was set up by a mini-movie in which an evil midget blew up Sting's boat. At the end of 1993, Sting was one of the first people to congratulate Flair, who had just returned from the World Wrestling Federation, after his WCW World Heavyweight Title victory over Vader at Starrcade.\n\nSting feuded with Vader and Rude through the first half of 1994. Sting won the WCW International World Heavyweight Championship from Rude in April. Rude recaptured the title on May 1 at Wrestling Dontaku 1994 in Japan, but the decision was reversed because Rude had allegedly hit Sting with the title belt during the match; this was to cover for a real-life back injury Rude sustained in the match that forced Rude into retirement. Sting refused to have the title handed to him and instead defeated Vader for the vacant WCW International World Heavyweight Championship at Slamboree. Soon afterward, Flair turned heel and defeated Sting in a title unification match at \"Clash of the Champions XXVII\". Sting spent the second half of 1994 and most of 1995 teaming with new arrival Hulk Hogan in his battles against Kevin Sullivan's Three Faces of Fear and its successor stable, The Dungeon of Doom.\n\nAt The Great American Bash 1995, Sting defeated Meng to win another tournament for the WCW United States Championship. Sting defeated Meng in a rematch for the title at Bash at the Beach 1995. Sting was on the first ever \"Monday Nitro\" in a match where Flair defeated Sting by disqualification as a result of a run-in by Arn Anderson to attack Flair. At Fall Brawl, Sting teamed with Hogan, Luger, and Randy Savage to defeat the Dungeon of Doom, consisting of Kamala, Zodiac, Shark and Meng, in the event's WarGames match. In October 1995, Flair convinced Sting to team with him in a match against Anderson and Brian Pillman at Halloween Havoc. Anderson and Pillman had attacked Flair earlier in the night, rendering Flair unable to come out for the first part of the match. Sting fended off his opponents until Flair emerged. Later in the match, Flair turned on Sting and reformed the Four Horsemen with Anderson and Pillman, later adding Chris Benoit to fill out the group.\n\nSting defeated Flair on a subsequent \"Nitro\" with the Scorpion Deathlock, refusing to let go until Luger persuaded him to do so. Sting defeated Flair again at the World War 3 pay-per-view. Later in the night, Sting competed in the World War 3 battle royal for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which was won by Savage. Sting's alliances with Hogan and Savage led the Horsemen to attack them as well. Sting's second U.S. title reign lasted until November 13, when he was defeated by Kensuke Sasaki in Japan. At Starrcade, Sting defeated Sasaki, representing New Japan Pro Wrestling, in a non-title match to win the World Cup of Wrestling for WCW. In the next match that night, Sting lost a Triangle match involving Flair and Luger; Flair won by countout to become number one contender for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, which Flair won from Savage in the next match.\n\nEarly in 1996, Sting's appearance started to change: he grew longer, darker hair, replacing his blond flattop haircut, and he often wore black tights with a multi-colored scorpion, although he occasionally wore his colorful ones and maintained his colorful face paint. Sting teamed with his old friend Luger, who had returned to WCW from WWF in September 1995, despite Luger's standing as a heel. The duo beat Harlem Heat for the WCW World Tag Team Championship on the January 22 edition of \"Nitro\". The team often retained the championship as a result of Luger's cheating tactics, to which Sting remained oblivious. When Luger was temporarily unavailable for WCW Uncensored in March, Harlem Heat member Booker T teamed up with Sting to successfully prevent the title from changing hands. Sting and Booker T developed a mutual respect that showed itself when Sting and Luger granted Harlem Heat a rematch. During the Tag title run, Sting received a World title shot against The Giant at Slamboree in May, but lost after accidental interference from Luger. Harlem Heat eventually won the titles back on the June 24 edition of \"Nitro\".\n\nIn the summer of 1996, Sting was the first to stand up to The Outsiders: Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, who had recently competed in the WWF and whose alliances and agenda were unclear, had been infiltrating and causing chaos at WCW events. Sting teamed with Luger and Savage to defend WCW against Hall, Nash, and a mysterious third Outsider to be revealed at the Bash at the Beach. Hall and Nash started the bout without their third partner, but the WCW's temporary three-on-two advantage was short-lived: Luger left the match after he was accidentally injured by a mistimed Stinger Splash. The two-on-two match continued while Hogan, who had been a fan favorite for over two decades, emerged at ringside. Hogan appeared ready to back up the WCW wrestlers until he attacked Savage with his leg drop finisher in one of wrestling's most famous swerves. The match was ruled a no-contest, and Hall, Nash, and Hogan declared a new world order in professional wrestling. The name stuck and Sting became one of WCW's stalwarts against the New World Order, or nWo for short.\n\nAs part of this, Sting and Luger went up to rivals and Four Horsemen members Ric Flair and Arn Anderson some time after Bash at the Beach and asked them to team with him, saying that they needed to put aside their differences for the good of WCW. Flair and Anderson agreed and the four wrestlers composed Team WCW for the annual WarGames match at Fall Brawl in September 1996. They would be facing the nWo's team of Hall, Nash, Hogan, and a fourth member yet to be determined. On the \"Nitro\" prior to the event, however, the nWo played a trick on WCW claiming that Sting was joining their side. A vignette was shown where the nWo had a recording of Sting's voice playing in its limousine as Luger was being lured into the parking lot. Once he was there a man dressed as Sting, played by Jeff Farmer, attacked him and the crowd at home was led to believe that Sting had joined up with the nWo and would be their fourth man against what was now a three-man WCW team. Sting, however, was not at that edition of \"Nitro\" and showed up at Fall Brawl just as his teammates declared that they would face the nWo by themselves. Sting told Luger that he did not attack him, but Luger refused to believe him. Later, during the match, Sting entered as the fourth and final man for Team WCW, after the impostor Sting had entered for the nWo. Once in the ring, Sting immediately took out all four members of the nWo. He then stopped, turned to Luger, and angrily said to him, \"Is that good enough for you right there? Is that proof enough?\" Sting then gave Luger an obscene gesture and walked out of the match, leaving Team WCW at a four-on-three disadvantage which they did not overcome. The next night on \"Nitro\", Sting came out unannounced during the middle of the show with no music or entrance pyrotechnics. He entered the ring and, with his back turned to the camera side of the audience, launched into an angry tirade about what had transpired over the last week: \n\nDeclaring he would be \"popping in from time to time\" afterwards, Sting threw the microphone down and left the ring. Days after the infamous promo, he was booked for shows in New Japan Pro Wrestling, to take part in the Japan/U.S. Superstars Tournament, where he defeated Masahiro Chono in the first round, but was eliminated in the second round by Shiro Koshinaka. His last match of 1996 took place on September 23 at the Yokohama Arena, where he and Lex Luger teamed up to defeat Arn Anderson and Steven Regal. It would end up being his last tour of Japan. On the October 21, 1996, edition of \"Nitro\", Sting returned for the first time since the night after Fall Brawl. In a match where the impostor Sting was wrestling Mr. JL, Sting emerged wearing a trench coat and white face paint with black marks around his eyes. He went in the ring and attacked nWo Sting (who was still imitating Sting's old mannerisms at this point) with his new finisher, the Scorpion Death Drop inverted DDT, two jumping elbow drops, a Stinger Splash and a Scorpion Deathlock while the rest of the nWo came to ringside. Rather than intervene, they simply stood by and watched. After Sting was done, Ted DiBiase and Kevin Nash came into the ring and made Sting an offer to join the nWo and get back at WCW for betraying him. Sting, after a pause, first called out the nWo Sting as a \"cheap imitation,\" before telling the nWo, \"the \"real\" Sting may or may not be in your price range,\" and then concluded by saying \"the only thing that's for sure about Sting is that nothing's for sure\". With that, Sting left the ring and would not speak (on mic) on WCW programming again for over a year. After this a silent, almost ghostly Sting, carrying a baseball bat as a weapon, began appearing in the rafters at WCW events and began painting his entire face with black and white corpse paint. Sting's new gimmick was inspired by the 1994 film \"The Crow\". In retaliation, nWo Sting, who was still imitating Borden, began painting his face this way as well. While appearing on a WCW/nWo merchandise special on QVC Sports in late 1999, Borden admitted that Scott Hall had initially suggested the idea of painting his face like the character of Eric Draven from \"The Crow\". Sting maintains aspects of his \"Crow\" persona to date, occasionally with different designs and use of color of the face paint.\n\nIn a series of unusual loyalty tests over the next months, Sting would confront a WCW wrestler in the ring and shove the wrestler several times with his bat until the wrestler was provoked enough to advance on him. Then Sting would draw the weapon back as if he were going to assault him, causing the wrestler to stop. Sting would hand the bat to the offended wrestler and turn his back, offering the wrestler a chance at retaliation. When the wrestler hesitated or declined, Sting would nod, retrieve the bat and leave the ring. In January 1997, a \"blackballed\" Randy Savage returned to WCW for the first time since Halloween Havoc and aligned himself with Sting as a \"free agent\" as he refused to join the nWo although WCW Vice President Eric Bischoff, also one of the leaders of the nWo, declared he would not be allowed back in WCW if he didn't. For the next few weeks the two were seen in the rafters together and coming to the ring together. This story, however, petered out at SuperBrawl in February; Sting and Savage had come to the ring together to watch Roddy Piper face Hogan in a match for the WCW world title. As Sting left, Savage went to the ring and helped Hogan win the match, thus going back on his word and joining the nWo. Over the next couple weeks, Sting would accompany the nWo, indicating that he too joined the group. However, at WCW Uncensored in March 1997, as the nWo celebrated a victory in the main event battle royal which guaranteed them title shots whenever they desired with their newest recruit, Chicago Bulls NBA star Dennis Rodman, Sting rappelled from the roof of the arena on a vertical zip-line. When Hall and Nash went to approach him, Sting attacked them and Randy Savage when he tried to intervene, revealing his allegiance to WCW.\n\nIn subsequent weeks, Sting frequently rappelled from the rafters or came up through the ring to attack unsuspecting nWo members, came to the aid of wrestlers once subjected to his loyalty test as they battled the nWo, and employed decoy \"Stings\" to play mind games with the nWo during the closing segments of \"Nitro\". Sting's appearances to fight the nWo at the end of almost every \"Nitro\" helped WCW keep and widen its television ratings advantage over the WWF's Monday Night Raw throughout the summer. On-screen WCW commissioner James J. Dillon tried many times to get Sting to return to wrestling by making contracts to fight various nWo members. Sting, however, did not accept any of the contracts, often tearing them up in Dillon's face. A confused Dillon then asked Sting who he wanted on one edition of \"Nitro\", and Sting went out to ringside, picked up a fan's sign, and pointed out one name on it: Hogan. Eventually Sting got his wish and he and Hogan finally met in December at Starrcade for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. The finish of the match was supposed to echo the Montreal Screwjob finish that the WWF had used to double cross Bret Hart just one month earlier at their annual Survivor Series event. Nick Patrick, the referee for the contest, was supposed to execute a fast count on Sting while Hart, whose signing with WCW was the linchpin for the Montreal Screwjob, would come out to protest the decision and, since he had already served as the guest referee for the match between Larry Zbyszko and Eric Bischoff earlier that evening, order the match to be restarted and Sting would emerge victorious by forcing Hogan to submit to the Scorpion Death Lock. However, Patrick did not do his part properly and instead counted the pin at normal speed, which added an unintentional level of controversy to the finish.\n\nThe next night on \"Nitro\", Hogan protested the decision claiming that Patrick's decision should have been considered final and a rematch was granted. The match ran over \"Nitro's\" allotted time slot and the finish was aired later in the week on the inaugural episode of \"Thunder\". Similar to the Starrcade result, two different referees declared the two different men as the winner. Later that night, Dillon vacated the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, forcing Sting to surrender the belt. Sting responded with his first words (on mic) since October 1996 when he told Dillon, \"You've got no guts!\" Sting turned to Hogan and said, \"And you... You're a dead man!\".\n\nAs 1998 began, the nWo began to splinter. Sting recaptured the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship in February at SuperBrawl VIII with the help of Savage, who was beginning to split from the nWo. Sting went on to successfully defend the title against the likes of Hall, Nash, and Diamond Dallas Page (DDP). Like Savage, Nash began to pull away from the Hogan-dominated nWo, and Nash helped Savage beat Sting for the championship at Spring Stampede in April. Nash and Savage officially split from the original nWo on May 4, forming the face group nWo Wolfpac, while Hogan's heel faction became identified as nWo Hollywood. The two nWo factions vied for Sting's allegiance, with Sting's friends The Giant joining nWo Hollywood and Luger joining nWo Wolfpac. Sting seemed to have joined nWo Hollywood when he appeared wearing a black and white nWo shirt, but he soon tore off the shirt to reveal the red and black of the nWo Wolfpac. Sting began wearing red and black face paint and tights as a member of nWo Wolfpac.\n\nSting and The Giant won the WCW World Tag Team Championship at Slamboree in May when Hall turned on his teammate Nash. Sting and The Giant also split, and the team was forced to vacate the title 18 days later. Sting then defeated The Giant at The Great American Bash in June to take control of the Tag Team titles and chose Nash as his partner. Throughout the summer, Sting and fellow nWo Wolfpac members Nash, Luger, and Konnan feuded with Hogan and nWo Hollywood. Sting also got involved in a feud with Bret Hart over their similar finishing holds, the Sharpshooter and the Scorpion Deathlock. Hart cost Sting and Nash the Tag titles by interfering in their match with Hall and The Giant on the July 20 \"Nitro\". Sting and Hart squared off at Halloween Havoc, where Hart, the United States Champion, attacked Sting with a baseball bat, putting Sting out of action for several months.\n\nSting returned to \"Nitro\" in March 1999, sporting the black and white \"Crow\"-inspired attire he debuted in 1996 and began to participate in more mic work. By this time, the nWo storyline had faded, and Sting was not aligned with any of its factions. Sting competed in the main event of April's Spring Stampede, a Four Corners match for the World Championship, against Hogan, DDP, and champion Flair. Savage served as special guest referee and delivered a diving elbow drop to help DDP win the match and the title.\n\nSting defeated Page on the April 26 edition of \"Nitro\" to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship for the fifth time. Later that night, Sting defended the title in a four-way match featuring DDP, Goldberg, and a returning Nash. DDP pinned Nash, allowing DDP to win the title without directly beating Sting. Sting's 90-minute reign was only the second shortest WCW World Heavyweight Championship reign in WCW history. Sting lost to Rick Steiner in a Falls Count Anywhere match at The Great American Bash after he was attacked by Steiner's three pet dogs backstage and Steiner forced the referee to prematurely declare himself the victor, claiming his dogs had pinned Sting for him.\n\nOver the next several months, Sting feuded with Goldberg, Rick Steiner, Vicious, and Savage. Sting teamed with WCW World Heavyweight Champion Nash at the Bash at the Beach in July to take on Vicious and Savage of Team Madness. Savage pinned Nash and won the World title as a result. Hogan returned from injury on July 12 as a face to win the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Flair on the July 19 edition of \"Nitro\" to become the on-screen president of WCW. Later that night, Nash turned heel by attacking Hogan during a title defense against Vicious. Sting remained president for just one week and used his power to book a main event pitting Hogan and himself against Nash and Vicious. Sting vacated the presidency the following week because he only wanted Flair out of the position rather than wanting the power for himself. Along with Goldberg, Sting and Hogan feuded with Nash, Vicious and Rick Steiner for the next month.\n\nSting began to question Hogan's trustworthiness and credibility in the weeks leading up to Fall Brawl. At the September pay-per-view, Luger brought a baseball bat to the ring and Sting used it to beat Hogan for his sixth and final WCW World Heavyweight Championship, turning heel for the first time in WCW. Sting's heel turn and subsequent attitude change did not resonate with the WCW fans. They still cheered Sting despite the fact he was supposed to be the villain (reminiscent of The Road Warriors' heel turn in late 1988). At Halloween Havoc, Sting retained the title against Hogan after Hogan entered the ring in street clothes and laid down for Sting to pin him. After the match, Sting sounded his disdain of the result and issued an open challenge for later tonight. Later that night, Sting lost an unsanctioned match to Goldberg, who accepted his open challenge and then attacked referee Charles Robinson. Sting was stripped of the title the next night for attacking the official.\n\nSting entered the 32-man tournament that was set up to award the vacant WCW World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Brian Knobs, Meng, and Luger to reach the semi-finals to be held at WCW Mayhem. At the November event, Sting lost to Hart, the eventual winner of the tournament. After the match, Sting shook hands with Hart in a sign of respect, turning face again. Sting sought revenge against Luger the next month at Starrcade. Sting won by disqualification when Luger and Elizabeth assaulted Sting with a steel chair and baseball bat, putting Sting out of action for some time. Sting ended his feud with Luger by defeating him in a Lumberjacks with Casts match at Uncensored 2000 the following March.\n\nWCW officials Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff, in an attempt to save the fading company, rebooted the storylines on April 10, 2000, and declared all titles vacant. At Spring Stampede 2000 the following week, Sting advanced to the finals of the United States Championship tournament by defeating Booker T and Vampiro in the first two rounds. Vampiro cost Sting the championship in the finals against Scott Steiner, leading to an intense feud between Sting and Vampiro. Sting pinned Vampiro at Slamboree 2000 in May, and Vampiro beat Sting in a Human Torch match at The Great American Bash the next month; for the climax of the match, Borden switched with a stuntman, who was set on fire and thrown off the top of the frame of the stage's entrance video screen. At Bash at the Beach 2000, he returned wearing another Sting mask as men wearing cloaks and Sting masks carried him in a casket, and then he attacked Vampiro.\n\nSting went on to feud with Jeff Jarrett and then Scott Steiner. Steiner attacked and injured Sting in November 2000. Sting stayed off WCW programming until the final episode of \"Nitro\" on March 26, 2001. WCW had been purchased by the World Wrestling Federation, and the final match in WCW history pitted Sting against his longtime rival Flair; the two had also competed on the very first edition of \"Nitro\" on September 4, 1995. Sting defeated Flair and the two embraced at the end of the contest.\n\nAfter the WWF did not buy out Sting's contract with AOL Time Warner, he rejected a buyout offer of 50 cents on the dollar from AOL Time Warner, instead waiting until his contract expired in March 2002 (he announced a short-lived retirement in February of that year). Borden then entered into contract negotiations with the WWF, but ultimately did not join the promotion.\n\nIn 2002, after over a year and a half of hiatus, Borden toured Europe with the World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA) promotion throughout November and December. His first match in the WWA took place on November 28, 2002, in Dublin, Ireland, where he reunited with Lex Luger to defeat Buff Bagwell and Malice. At The Retribution on December 6, 2002 in Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, Sting lost to Luger in a bout for the vacant WWA World Heavyweight Championship. Sting defeated Luger to claim the WWA World Heavyweight Championship in Zurich, Switzerland, on December 13.\n\nSting embarked on a second tour with WWA in May 2003, successfully defending his championship against Rick Steiner, Shane Douglas, and Disco Inferno. The WWA held its final show, The Reckoning, on May 25 in Auckland, New Zealand, where NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett defeated Sting for the WWA World Heavyweight Championship, unifying the two championships.\n\nIn 2003, Sting signed a contract committing him to four appearances with the Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) promotion. He debuted in TNA on the June 18 one year anniversary show, teaming with Jeff Jarrett to defeat A.J. Styles and Syxx Pac. Following this, Borden engaged in a comprehensive series of sitdown interviews with Mike Tenay, discussing his career and his faith. Sting returned to TNA on November 5, 2003, defeating Jarrett by disqualification in a match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On November 12, Sting teamed with A.J. Styles to defeat Jarrett and Lex Luger. He made his final TNA appearance of 2003 on December 17, defeating Jarrett in a non-title match. On March 24, 2004, Borden was interviewed once again by Mike Tenay as part of the promotion for his direct-to-video biographical film, \"Sting: Moment of Truth\", and on March 31, he returned to the company for one night only as the special guest enforcer for the main-event, a four way match between Abyss, A.J. Styles, Raven, and Ron Killings, which Raven won.\n\nOn December 11, 2005, at Turning Point, as Jeff Jarrett stood in the ring celebrating his victory, the lights in the arena went out as images of a scorpion—Sting's symbol— appeared on the arena screens, along with the date \"January 15, 2006\". Spotlights then illuminated the ring, revealing a chair bearing Sting's signature trench coat, boots, and a black baseball bat in the center of the ring. His return to TNA was officially announced one minute after midnight on the January 1, 2006 episode of \"Impact!\". On January 15 at Final Resolution, Sting and Christian Cage defeated NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett and Monty Brown in a tag team match after Sting pinned Jarrett following the Scorpion Death Drop. His heavily promoted return was greeted with chants of \"welcome back\" and \"you've still got it\" by the Orlando, Florida audience. TNA later revealed that Final Resolution was \"by far the most-purchased TNA pay-per-view event in company history, breaking all previous numbers\". On the January 28, 2006 episode of \"Impact!\", Sting made his Spike TV debut and first appearance on national television in almost five years, coming to the ring at the end of the show to make a \"major announcement\". Sting noted that he had never had a chance to properly say goodbye to his fans. He then announced that Final Resolution had been \"his goodbye\", before thanking the TNA management and the fans. Sting then dropped his bat, with a spotlight appearing over it, and left the ring, shaking hands with various TNA wrestlers on his way up the ramp.\n\nWith Sting gone, the storyline continued with Jeff Jarrett and Eric Young worrying that Sting had not actually retired and sending Alex Shelley to California to videotape Sting at home. Sting discovered Shelley filming, then walked up to Shelley's car and told him that he was going to show up at Destination X and confront Jeff Jarrett as Steve Borden. Clad in \"street clothes\" and without face paint Borden returned on March 12 at Destination X, saving Christian Cage and Rhino as they were attacked by Jarrett's Army. He placed Jarrett in the Scorpion Deathlock, but was attacked by the debuting Scott Steiner shortly thereafter. In his first cable television match in five years, Sting defeated Eric Young on the April 13, 2006 episode of \"Impact!\". After being attacked by Jarrett, Steiner, and America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm), Sting was saved by A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, and Rhino, who he announced as his teammates in his Lethal Lockdown match against Jarrett's Army. On April 23 at Lockdown, \"Sting's Warriors\" (Sting, A.J. Styles, Ron Killings, and Rhino) defeated Jarrett, Steiner, and America's Most Wanted after Sting made Chris Harris tap out to the \"Scorpion Death Lock\". Following Lockdown, Sting proceeded to seek out partners to help him defeat Jeff Jarrett and Scott Steiner for good. After bringing out Lex Luger, Buff Bagwell, and Rick Steiner as options, he settled on Samoa Joe. On May 14 at Sacrifice, Sting and Joe defeated Jarrett and Steiner after Joe pinned Jarrett with a Muscle Buster. Still having proven unsuccessful at putting Jarrett away, Sting defeated Scott Steiner by disqualification to earn a spot in the King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary on June 18. Due to a confrontation with Christian Cage during the match, Sting was distracted, which allowed crooked referee Earl Hebner to knock over the ladder both were on, sending both men to the floor and allow Jarrett to pick up the victory.\n\nOn July 16 at Victory Road, a four-way number one contenders match was held for a shot at Jeff Jarrett for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Jeff Jarrett, disguised as a cameraman, came into the ring with a bottle of gasoline and squirted it into Sting's eyes. Sting was taken by security into the back and as a result, taken out of the running for the number one contender match. As the match continued as a three-way, Sting returned to the ring with his head wrapped in bandages, performed the \"Scorpion Death Drop\" on Scott Steiner, and Sting pinned him to become number one contender. After the match, Sting had a confrontation with Christian Cage in the ring that ended with them shaking hands, and Cage showing respect for Sting. Sting received his title shot on August 13 at Hard Justice, but failed to capture the NWA World Heavyweight Championship from Jeff Jarrett after Christian Cage turned heel and hit Sting with Jarrett's guitar. On the following edition of \"Impact!\", Sting stated that he wanted a rematch with Jarrett at Bound for Glory, TNA's biggest pay-per view of the year. Jarrett accepted the match, with the implication that Sting put his career on the line, a stipulation Sting accepted. Sting then retreated to train for what could have been his final match. Meanwhile, \"Impact!\" began showing videos of Sting going through a so-called transformation with many biblical references. On October 22, 2006, in the Title vs. Career match at the Bound for Glory PPV, Sting returned debuting his new look, a hybrid of his \"surfer,\" \"Crow,\" and \"nWo Wolfpac\" styles, looking much leaner physically. He went on to claim his second NWA World Heavyweight title when he made Jarrett submit to the \"Scorpion Deathlock\" marking the first major championship title Sting had won since 1999. With that victory, Sting became the oldest NWA World Heavyweight Champion of the TNA era, as well as the only person to ever win the title both before and after the inception of TNA. This would also go on to make Sting the longest superstar to recapture his second NWA title from 1990 to 2006 (16 years).\n\nSting lost the title to \"The Monster\" Abyss on November 19 at Genesis by disqualification after pushing aside the referee and pushing Abyss into a stack of tables covered in barbed wire. In the weeks following Genesis, Sting's feud with Abyss continued as he tried to get in Abyss' head by telling him he was being used by his satanic manager James Mitchell. Abyss was visibly affected by this, but remained by Mitchell's side. Sting's former friend Christian Cage and his bodyguard Tomko were also thrown in the mix, with Cage claiming he knew a dark secret in Abyss' past. The three finally met in a three-way match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on December 10 at Turning Point, where Abyss retained the title. After Turning Point, Sting continued to try to convince Abyss he was nothing but a machine for Mitchell, and he got so far into Abyss that Abyss grabbed Mitchell by the throat, almost chokeslamming him on an edition of \"Impact!\", but ultimately convinced himself not to.\n\nAs 2007 came along, Sting continued his feud with Abyss while trying to recapture the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. On January 14 at Final Resolution, Sting faced Abyss and Christian Cage in three-way elimination match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship but failed regain the championship after he was eliminated last by Cage. On the January 24, 2007 edition of \"Impact!\", Sting revealed after going through public records that Abyss shot his own father three times in the back, sending him into a coma. During the ensuing brawl throughout the \"Impact!\" Zone between Sting and Abyss, James Mitchell burned Sting's face with a fireball, sending Sting to the hospital. Sting returned to defeat Abyss in a \"Prison Yard\" match on February 11 at Against All Odds and again in a \"Last Rites\" match on March 11 at Destination X. On the March 22 edition of \"Impact!\", Sting teamed with his enemy Abyss to face Christian Cage and A.J. Styles. During the match, Mitchell returned with a woman who Abyss recognized and Abyss left the match with Mitchell and the woman, leaving Sting alone to fight Cage and Styles. The following week on \"Impact!\", during a meeting between Sting and James Mitchell, it was revealed that the woman was Abyss' mother, and that she was the one who had actually shot Abyss' father, but Abyss took the blame to protect his mother. Later in the night, it was announced Abyss was added to the Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown as part of Team Cage while Sting ended up joining Team Angle. At Lockdown, Sting, with the help of Jeff Jarrett, pinned Abyss to win the match for his team and end their bitter rivalry.\n\nDue to his win, he was supposed to be facing Christian Cage for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Sacrifice, but the next week on \"Impact!\", Kurt Angle challenged Sting for his number one contendership. After Team Cage interfered in the match, it was revealed that at Sacrifice there would be a three way match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between Sting, Kurt Angle, and Christian Cage. The day of the PPV, the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), the owners of the NWA World Heavyweight and the NWA World Tag Team Championships, stripped Cage of the title and Team 3D of the tag team title. NWA Executive Director Robert K. Trobich stated the reason was that Cage refused to defend the NWA Title at NWA live events. At the event, Cage, still holding the physical NWA Championship belt, defended what was billed as the \"World Heavyweight Championship\" against Sting and Angle. Angle was the victor of said contest by making Sting submit, who had technically just pinned Cage, and was announced as the new \"TNA World Heavyweight Champion\". The \"Impact!\" following the event, the title was labelled as the \"TNA World Heavyweight Championship\" and was vacated due to the controversial finish of the match. A tournament was then held for the title which culminated in a King of the Mountain match at Slammiversary. Sting lost his qualifying match with Samoa Joe after Christopher Daniels interfered. Sting instead faced Daniels on June 17 at Slammiversary, which he ultimately won.\n\nAfter his feud with Daniels, Sting began teaming up with his former enemy, Abyss who had recently turned face. Together, the two went on to defeat A.J. Styles and Tomko on July 15 at Victory Road. While trying to help Abyss to win a match against A.J. Styles, Sting and Abyss were attacked by Christian's Coalition. Abyss was pulled under the ring and Sting was slammed into broken glass by Tomko, before Abyss emerged bleeding badly and was slammed into the broken glass and thumbtacks. The following week, Sting and Abyss got revenge by defeating Christian Cage and A.J. Styles in a ladder match, in the process earning a contract that allowed them to pick the type of match between Abyss and Christian at Hard Justice. It was announced via TNA mobile that Abyss had selected \"Doomsday Chamber of Blood\" match. Sting's team won, with Abyss pinning A.J. Styles to become the number one contender for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nOn the August 30 edition of \"Impact!\", Sting defeated A.J. Styles, Christian Cage, and Samoa Joe in a four-way match to become the co-holder of the TNA World Tag Team Championship with Kurt Angle. Yet after only thirteen days, Sting and Angle lost the titles to Adam \"Pacman\" Jones and Ron \"The Truth\" Killings at No Surrender. During the match, Karen Angle claimed that Sting had slapped her, which led to a falling out between Sting and Kurt Angle and on the first two-hour edition of \"Impact!\", Kurt Angle was shown via satellite (kayfabe) stalking and assaulting Sting's son Garrett. It was announced that Sting would face Kurt Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship at Bound for Glory. The match was billed as return to his roots for Sting, who enjoyed enormous popularity and success in the Atlanta-based World Championship Wrestling earlier in his career. On October 14 at Bound for Glory, Sting overcame interference by both Karen Angle and Kevin Nash to defeat Angle and win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. On October 16, at the tapings of the October 25 episode of \"Impact!\", Sting lost the championship back to Angle after Kevin Nash interfered on Angle's behalf. Sting then challenged Angle to a tag team rematch at Genesis. Angle was forced to Kevin Nash as his partner, while Sting's partner was a mystery until during the event where his partner was revealed to be Booker T. In the match, whoever scored the pinfall would win the TNA World Championship, which Angle won after pinning Sting to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. This would be the final TNA appearance of Sting in 2007 as he would take some time off to be with his family.\n\nOn the March 20 edition of \"Impact!\", after a brawl between members of both Team Cage and Team Tomko, a promo aired at the end of the show indicating that Sting would return the next week on the first-ever live \"Impact!\" episode. Sting then made his official return on March 27, announcing that he would be a part of Team Cage for the Lethal Lockdown match at Lockdown. Later on the show, he teamed with members of Team Cage (Christian Cage, Kevin Nash, Rhino, and Matt Morgan) and defeated Team Tomko (Tomko, A.J. Styles, James Storm, and Team 3D) in a 5-man tag team match. Morgan was added when James Storm attacked Sting with a glass bottle after the match. Sting, however, later gained revenge by defeating Storm when Morgan threw him his baseball bat. Morgan then ripped off his referee shirt and revealed a Team Cage shirt, thus becoming the fifth member. At Lockdown, Team Cage defeated Team Tomko when Rhino gored Storm to get the pinfall. After the tag titles were vacated, Jim Cornette held a Deuces Wild Tag Team Tournament to determine new champs. Four teams were already in the Sacrifice finals, while Cornette named eight wrestlers as the \"Egotistical 8\". Sting's partner was James Storm and on May 11 at Sacrifice, they came up short due their inability get along, and towards the end, Sting attacked Storm and walked out. Sting was not seen after that except in an interview which talked about his career and his eventual retirement.\nOn July 13 at Victory Road, Booker T faced Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Sting tried to talk sense into Joe, as he was brutally beating Booker T, and was potentially heading towards a disqualification. Joe rebuked him, and Sting struck him with his trademark black baseball bat. Over the coming weeks, the feud between Joe and Booker intensified, with episodes ending with Booker T or Sharmell striking Samoa Joe with Sting's trademark bat as \"Impact!\" went off the air, leading to a question of whether Sting had turned on Samoa Joe and became a heel. Although still receiving a face reaction from the fans, Sting sided with Booker T. On August 10 at Hard Justice, Sting attacked A.J. Styles after he and Kurt Angle wrestled a Last Man Standing match. Sting later announced why he attacked Joe and Styles by saying that the younger generation needed to learn about respecting veterans like Angle, Booker, and himself. He declared that he wouldn't retire until he had accomplished this mission. This led to mixed fan reactions, and sparked a feud between him and TNA World Heavyweight Champion Samoa Joe, as well as Jeff Jarrett who arrived to aid Samoa Joe and A.J. Styles by giving them his guitar as Sting had done with his bat.\n\nOn October 12 at Bound for Glory IV, Sting challenged Samoa Joe for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship and was successful in claiming the title, after Kevin Nash returned and hit Joe with Sting's baseball bat. On October 23, Sting joined The Main Event Mafia (Kurt Angle, Booker T, Sharmell, Kevin Nash, Scott Steiner, and himself) and by doing so, he fully turned heel for the first time in years, although Sting did not participate in sneak attacks and was cheered by the crowd, making him more a tweener (neutral character). Sting went on to successfully defend the title against AJ Styles on November 9 at Turning Point, The TNA Front Line in an eight-man tag team match with the Main Event Mafia on December 7 at Final Resolution, Rhino on January 11 Genesis, Kurt Angle and both members of Team 3D in a four-way match on February 8 at Against All Odds, and against Angle on March 15 at Destination X. At Lockdown 2009, Sting lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Mick Foley inside the Six Sides of Steel, ending his reign at 189 days (his longest world title reign for any organization). On May 24 at Sacrifice, Sting defeated Kurt Angle to become the new Godfather of the Main Event Mafia. On June 21 at Slammiversary, Sting defeated Matt Morgan in a singles match, thus preventing Morgan from joining the Main Event Mafia. On the following episode of \"Impact!\", Sting's fellow Main Event Mafia members attacked him, removed him from the group, and Kurt Angle reclaimed his role as Godfather. The following week, Sting took his revenge upon the Mafia, when he attacked every member of the group and stole Angle's world heavyweight championship belt, becoming a fully fledged face as a result. On July 19 at Victory Road, Sting was defeated by new Main Event Mafia member Samoa Joe in a singles match after the debuting Taz interfered on Joe's behalf. On August 16 at Hard Justice, Sting unsuccessfully challenged Angle for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship in a triple threat match, which also included Matt Morgan. On September 20 at No Surrender, Sting lost a five-way match for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship that also included A.J. Styles, Hernandez, Kurt Angle, and Matt Morgan. Instead of pinning Angle, he opted to attack Morgan, to allow Styles to pin Angle and become the new World Heavyweight Champion. As a token of gratitude, Styles offered to give him a title shot at the following month's PPV Bound for Glory in a match billed as possibly being Sting's retirement match. At the PPV, Styles defeated Sting to retain his title, ending Sting's undefeated streak at Bound for Glory. After the match he announced that he didn't know whether he would continue his career or not, Saying that \"the way you fans are reacting right now, makes me wanna stay forever!\" At the end of the year the match was voted the match of the year by the fans of TNA.\n\nOn the January 4, 2010, live-three-hour, Monday night edition of \"Impact!\" Sting returned to the Impact! Zone appearing in the rafters of the arena. Sting reappeared two months later on March 8, appearing as he was going to help a bloodied Hulk Hogan and Abyss during a match at the beginning of the show against A.J. Styles and Ric Flair. Instead he swung his baseball bat on Hogan and Abyss, turning heel as a result. He was later defeated by the debuting Rob Van Dam. Sting would continuously attack Van Dam with his bat after the match, completing his heel turn by attacking security guards and Hulk Hogan. On the March 22 edition of \"Impact!\" Sting was announced as the captain of Team Flair in the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would meet Team Hogan, captained by Abyss. At Lockdown Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm) were defeated by Team Hogan (Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Rob Van Dam and Jeff Hardy). On May 3, Sting explained his actions to Hogan and was later attacked from behind by Jeff Jarrett. At Sacrifice Sting assaulted Jarrett prior to their match and then dragged him in to the ring, where he managed to score a pinfall in seconds over his bloodied opponent, leaving him injured. On the following edition of \"Impact!\" the TNA Championship Committee ranked Sting number one in the rankings and as a result he was granted a shot at Rob Van Dam's World Heavyweight Championship at Slammiversary VIII. Sting then attacked Eric Bischoff with his baseball bat, biting the hand that fed him. Sting later promised that he would reveal the motives behind his actions after winning the World Heavyweight Championship. At Slammiversary VIII Jeff Jarrett made his return and cost Sting his title match against Rob Van Dam.\n\nAfter assaulting Jarrett from behind on the June 24 edition of \"Impact!\", TNA president Dixie Carter suspended Sting for 30 days without pay the following week. Sting returned from his suspension on the August 5 edition of \"Impact!\", wearing his nWo Wolfpac red face paint, and helping Kevin Nash, who had backed him up during his suspension, beat down Jarrett, Eric Bischoff and Hulk Hogan. On the September 2 edition of \"Impact!\" Sting defeated Jarrett in a singles match, after an interference from Nash. After the match Samoa Joe aligned himself with Jarrett and Hogan and drove Sting and Nash away. At No Surrender Joe and Jarrett defeated Sting and Nash in a tag team match, after Jarrett hit Sting with his own baseball bat. On the September 16 edition of \"Reaction\", Sting and Nash were joined by D'Angelo Dinero, who claimed to have gotten inside information from Bischoff's secretary Miss Tessmacher, that would suggest that Sting and Nash were right about Hogan and Bischoff being up to something. At Bound for Glory Sting, Nash and Dinero faced Jeff Jarrett and Samoa Joe in a handicap match, after Hulk Hogan, who was slated to team with Jarrett and Joe, was forced to pull out due to a back surgery. At the end of the match Jarrett abandoned Joe, and Sting, Nash, and Dinero tried to tell Joe this was what they were saying all along. Joe fought them anyway and ended up pinned by Nash. At the end of the event it was revealed that Sting had been right about Hogan and Bischoff all along, as they turned heel with Jarrett and Jeff Hardy as Abyss's \"they\", and in the process turned Sting, Nash and Dinero back to being faces. On the following edition of \"Impact!\", Sting and Nash refused to join Hogan, Bischoff and their new group, Immortal, and walked out on TNA and Dixie Carter, noting that they had tried to warn her that Hogan and Bischoff would try to take over the company for their own gain, but she hadn't listened, meaning Sting was never a true villain his entire heel run. After Impact!, Sting took hiatus from TNA television, as Borden's TNA contract had expired at the end of 2010.\nAfter a four-month hiatus, Sting returned to TNA on February 24, 2011 at the tapings of the March 3 edition of \"Impact!\", where he appeared as a surprise challenger and defeated Jeff Hardy to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the third time. On March 13 at Victory Road, Sting successfully defended the title against Hardy in a No Disqualification rematch that lasted ninety seconds. According to word from backstage, the match was planned to last longer, but Sting, believing that Jeff was in no shape to perform from looking at him, deliberately ended the match early, and was later heard agreeing with a fan's claim that the match was \"bullshit\". The following month at Lockdown, Sting successfully defended the title against Mr. Anderson and Rob Van Dam in a three-way steel cage match. In May, Sting was allowed to pick his number one contender and chose Van Dam, whom he went on to defeat at Sacrifice. The following month at Slammiversary IX, Sting lost the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Mr. Anderson, following outside interference from Eric Bischoff.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Sting displayed a more maniacal character similar in look and style to Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker from the 2008 film \"The Dark Knight\". On the July 14 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting, now dubbed as the \"Insane Icon\", regained the TNA World Heavyweight Championship from Mr. Anderson, after Fortune and Kurt Angle, disguised as his clown minions, attacked each member of Immortal, preventing them from interfering in the match. He would go on to lose the title to Kurt Angle on August 7 at Hardcore Justice, after Angle hit him with a chair brought to the ring by Hulk Hogan. Sting continued tormenting head members of Immortal with his strange new personality, and on the August 18 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", his longtime rival Ric Flair made his return to TNA and challenged him to a match. Sting agreed to put his career on the line in the match in exchange for Flair promising to deliver him his long-awaited match with Hogan, should he be able to defeat him. On the September 1 edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting received a rematch against Angle for the World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated following interference from special enforcer Hulk Hogan and the rest of Immortal.

On October 16 at Bound for Glory, Sting defeated Hogan to bring Dixie Carter back to power. After the match, Hogan turned on Immortal and helped Sting overcome the odds in his battle with the stable. On the following edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Carter placed Sting in charge of the program. Sting returned to the ring on the December 22 and February 9, 2012, editions of \"Impact Wrestling\", where he teamed up with Jeff Hardy to defeat TNA World Heavyweight Champion Bobby Roode and Bully Ray both times.\n\nOn March 18 at Victory Road, Sting was defeated by Roode in a non-title No Holds Barred match. On the following edition of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting announced his resignation from the general manager position, and handed the position over to Hulk Hogan. He later stated that he believe that Hogan could properly run TNA without the influence of Bischoff. On March 29, Dixie Carter announced that Borden had signed another contract extension with TNA. Sting returned to TNA on the May 24 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", attacking Bobby Roode. The following week, Sting defeated Roode in a non-title lumberjack match to earn a shot at his TNA World Heavyweight Championship.

Afterwards, Sting attacked Roode and dropped him on the entrance ramp with a Scorpion Death Drop.\nOn the June 14 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting's speech about the events of Slammiversary was interrupted, when he was attacked by three masked assailants. Sting returned four weeks later, but this time both he and Hulk Hogan were attacked by the same group of masked men, who had dubbed themselves the \"Aces & Eights\". While Hogan was recovering from his storyline injuries suffered in the attack, and a legitimate back surgery, Sting reclaimed the role of interim general manager. On October 13, Sting was officially inducted into the TNA Hall of Fame. The following day at Bound for Glory, Sting teamed with Bully Ray in a tag team match, where they were defeated by the Aces & Eights, following interference from a man who was afterwards unmasked as Ray's longtime partner, the returning Devon.

Sting proceeded to walk out on Hogan. Sting returned on the April 25 \"Impact Wrestling\", saving Hogan from an attack by the Aces & Eights. The following week, Sting reconciled with Hogan and became the number one contender to the TNA World Heavyweight Championship later that night after defeating Matt Morgan.

Per stipulation, Sting would never get another World title opportunity again.\n\nOn the June 13 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Sting noted that nobody in the back helped him during his title match, but he would form a New Main Event Mafia to battle the Aces & Eights. In the following weeks, Sting would recruit Kurt Angle, Samoa Joe, Magnus, and Rampage Jackson as members of the New Main Event Mafia. Before Bound for Glory, MEM member Magnus complained to Sting because his losses. Magnus told to Sting he had Flair to put him in the map, but he had nobody, so Sting challenged him to a match at Bound for Glory. At Bound for Glory, Sting was defeated by Magnus. On the October 31 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", Dixie Carter offered to lift the lifetime ban so Sting can get another World title opportunity again by entering him first in a Battle Royal Gauntlet match, which was won by Magnus as Sting attempted to eliminate Kazarian, and Magnus eliminated the both of them. Sting disbanded The Main Event Mafia after Aces & Eights disbanded, and while other members began to chase their World Heavyweight Title dreams, Sting started a feud against Ethan Carter III and Dixie Carter after they began humiliating TNA Legends, like Curry Man and Earl Hebner by Carter. On the December 12 episode of Impact, Carter was confronted by Sting, and was issued an option, either face Sting immediately, or enter the Feast or Fired match. Carter entered the Feast or Fired match, and grabbed one of the briefcases. On the December 19 episode of \"Impact Wrestling\", the Feast or Fired briefcase revealed to contain a future World Tag Team Championship match, and also led to the firing of Chavo Guerrero. On the January 16, 2014 edition of Impact Wrestling: Genesis, Sting lost a match to Ethan Carter III due an interference from the World Champion Magnus and subsequently challenged Magnus to a Title vs. Career match for the January 23, 2014 episode of Impact Wrestling-Genesis. Sting lost, and his TNA contract was terminated as a result.\n\nVeteran professional wrestling journalist Bill Apter chronicled Sting's career in a piece for WWE.com on February 19, 2014, wherein he stated that Sting's \"best days may still be yet to come\". Amid speculation about a contract offer from the company, Sting appeared in a WWE Network production on April 15, 2014, sharing a story of his former tag team partner The Ultimate Warrior, who had recently died. This marked Sting's first non-archive appearance on a WWE-branded show. Sting was a prominent contributor to the documentary film \"Warrior: The Ultimate Legend\", which aired on the WWE Network on April 17.

That same day, WWE began selling official Sting merchandise. On July 24, Borden made his first public appearance for WWE, in full Sting garb, as a surprise guest at the 2014 San Diego Comic-Con International.

On January 19, 2015, Sting made his live \"Raw\" debut by appearing backstage during the main event, then walking to the stage, causing a distraction and costing Authority members Big Show, Kane and Seth Rollins their handicap match against John Cena; this win gave the recently fired Dolph Ziggler, Ryback and Erick Rowan their jobs back. Triple H challenged Sting to a face-to-face confrontation on the January 26 episode of \"Raw\". Sting accepted this challenge on the February 16 episode of \"Raw\" by sending a Sting doppelganger into the ring to scare Triple H, after airing a vignette on the big screen accepting Triple H's challenge. Sting and Triple H had a confrontation at Fastlane on February 22. Following physicality between the two, Sting pointed to the WrestleMania 31 sign with his baseball bat, issuing a challenge for the event that was accepted by Triple H. On the March 16 episode of \"Raw\", Sting made a surprise appearance and helped Randy Orton fight off the Authority. Immediately following on the WWE Network, Sting spoke for the first time in-ring. He lost at WrestleMania 31 in a match involving interference from D-Generation X and New World Order members, but shook hands with Triple H afterward.\n\nSting returned on the August 24 episode of \"Raw\", interrupting WWE World Heavyweight Champion Seth Rollins's statue unveiling ceremony by attacking Rollins before challenging Rollins for the title by raising the belt over his head. Triple H then announced on the WWE Network that Sting would face Rollins for the title at Night of Champions. Sting appeared on the tron throughout the September 7 \"Raw\", defacing and ultimately destroying Rollins's statue by pushing it into a garbage truck. The following week, Sting defeated Big Show by disqualification in his debut \"Raw\" match, as a consequence of Rollins attacking Sting. John Cena then came to Sting's aid, which prompted Triple H to book a tag team contest involving the four wrestlers: Sting and Cena won after Sting made Rollins tap out to the Scorpion Deathlock. Sting suffered a legit neck injury during his championship match against Rollins at Night of Champions, but was able to complete the bout in a losing effort.\n\nSting said on the December 9 edition of Ric Flair's \"WOOOOO! Nation\" podcast that he required surgery to correct cervical spinal stenosis, and is \"lucky that a catastrophe didn't happen\" in his match with Rollins at Night of Champions.\n\nIt was announced on the January 11, 2016 episode of \"Raw\" that Sting would be the first member of the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2016. He was the second active WWE wrestler to be inducted – the first being his inductor, Ric Flair. Sting ultimately reneged on having surgery; on March 22, 2016 he explained that he felt \"completely normal\" and had none of the side effects associated with cervical spinal stenosis. On April 2, during his WWE Hall of Fame induction speech, Sting announced his retirement from professional wrestling. He appeared at WrestleMania 32, alongside his fellow 2016 inductees, the following night.\n\nIn August 2016, Sting appeared on the WWE Network show \"Legends with JBL\" and talked about his career. He also stated that he has not undergone surgery as that would definitively be the end of his career, as he still holds hope for a match with The Undertaker, claiming that to be his \"unfinished business\" in wrestling.\n\nSting is widely regarded as the greatest performer in WCW history. Former rival Hulk Hogan asserted that Sting should be mentioned in any conversation regarding the top 10 greatest pro wrestlers of all time; numerous outlets have placed him in such listings. Sting also garnered one of the largest and most loyal fanbases in the industry; he was voted by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers as \"Most Popular Wrestler of the Year\" four times (a record shared with John Cena), for the years 1991, 1992, 1994 and 1997. Digital Spy writer Mayer Nissim commended Sting's ability to constantly evolve his gimmick while fellow franchise players Hulk Hogan and John Cena largely failed to do so, in order to maintain spectator interest. Borden is known for his charity work, once regarding his involvement with the Make-A-Wish and Starlight Children's Foundations as his \"most fulfilling activity\". His young supporters are known as the \"Little Stingers\".\n\nPrior to his signing with WWE, Sting's legacy was perpetuated by the organization. It hailed him as \"one of sports-entertainment's elite\", and ranked him at number one in listings of the greatest wrestlers to never perform in WWE, and the greatest stars in WCW history. In 2013, the company named Sting's WCW World Heavyweight Championship contest against Diamond Dallas Page, on April 26, 1999, as the greatest match ever aired on WCW's flagship \"Monday Nitro\" program. At Night of Champions 2013, WWE organized a viewer poll to determine the greatest United States Champion of all time: Sting, a two-time champion, beat out the other four contenders – all WWE Hall of Famers – in a landslide victory with 53% of the overall vote. In regard to Sting's creative handling after he signed with WWE, \"PWInsider\" editor Dave Scherer wrote that \"he really represented WCW so he was never going to get that [legend] treatment\".\n\nSting was the inaugural inductee into the TNA Hall of Fame. TNA president Dixie Carter credits Sting with being the major wrestling superstar that TNA needed to establish itself. The company describes him as having had an \"unparalleled career\" and as being a legend who surpasses time.\n\nSting was regarded by colleagues in WCW as a professional and well-respected locker room leader. Prominent adversary Big Van Vader felt that Sting had unsurpassed athletic prowess within the business, and \"ranks right up at the top\" as an in-ring performer. Ric Flair called Sting his greatest opponent. Former rival Diamond Dallas Page, commenting on Sting's entry into WWE in 2014, said: \"Everyone there grew up watching him... No one did it better than Sting, nobody\". John Cena mimicked Sting's hairstyle in his youth and recalled, \"he was my guy\"; Cody Rhodes and Shelton Benjamin have also named him as their favorite childhood wrestler. Tyson Kidd professed to being a \"huge Sting fan\" as a child, and Seth Rollins would dress up as Sting in his youth. He was also a prominent influence on industry veterans Kurt Angle, Bill Goldberg, Jeff Hardy, Kane, A.J. Styles and Goldust. Bray Wyatt has stressed that he \"\"really\" would like to take on\" Sting, adding: \"I have to have [that] before I die; I don't care if it happens outside a Waffle House, somewhere.\"\n\nSting was the only WCW World Heavyweight Champion to wear face paint.\n\nSting's drawing ability has been disputed. Journalist Dave Scherer of \"PWInsider\" wrote: \"Sting is an all timer for sure, but the fact is that when he was the man in WCW, even before the NWO came in, he didn't draw huge\". Pro wrestling historian Dave Meltzer also reported that Sting was not a formidable draw. Fin Martin of \"Power Slam\" felt that while Sting did not make \"essential improvements\" nor \"grow into the champion's role\" during his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship reign from 1990 to 1991, he suffered from a weak line-up of potential opponents and poor creative handling. Martin said that Sting never truly established himself as 'The Man'.\n\nOn the other hand, Steve Austin has taken exception to the notion that Sting was not a profitable wrestler. Reflecting on Sting in the early 1990s, veteran wrestler Kevin Nash said: \"There weren't many draws in WCW at that point, but he was one of them\". Former WCW booker Mike Graham asserted that Sting was a television ratings success during the Monday Night Wars, while fellow booker Kevin Sullivan said of Sting's rivalry with Ric Flair: \"If I needed to draw a rating, Sting and Flair always drew. It was like [Muhammad] Ali and [Joe] Frazier\". The inaugural Clash of the Champions event in 1988, which aired opposite the WWF's WrestleMania IV and was headlined by Sting vs. Flair, generated a record-setting 5.6 rating on TBS. The pair also main-evented The Great American Bash in 1990, which was the NWA's biggest pay-per-view success up to that point.\n\nSting was a major attraction in 1997, being WCW's top merchandise seller (second only to the WWF's Steve Austin overall) and, versus Hollywood Hogan, headlining the biggest-grossing pay-per-view event in the company's history at that year's Starrcade. Sting went on to join the nWo Wolfpac stable, which dominated WCW's merchandise sales at events in mid 1998. Discussing Sting in WWE, Kevin Nash said that he is \"so valuable to the company as a trademark\".\n\nPrior to his signing with WWE, Sting was widely considered the greatest wrestler never to perform for the company. He had \"really good conversations\" with the promotion during his career, but did not appear there until 2014, at the age of 55. His loyalty to WCW, even in its dying days, has been noted. That organization was purchased by the WWF (now WWE) in 2001, and Sting's contract with its parent company AOL Time Warner expired in 2002, but he still refused to make the jump, alternately attributing this to the WWF's creative usage of former WCW talents and negative dealings with attorneys. The company's onerous live schedule and the content of its programming were also factors. Sting has, however, downplayed rumors of a difficult relationship with WWE.\n\nRather than sign with the WWF in 2002, Sting performed for smaller promotions, becoming the centerpiece of TNA by the mid 2000s. His pre-WWE career included \"dream\" matches against former WWF stars Hulk Hogan and Bret Hart in WCW, as well as bouts opposite names such as Ric Flair, Randy Savage, Kurt Angle and Mick Foley. Sting often wrestled Steve Austin in WCW; he had positive negotiations with WWE in 2003, with his proposed debut angle being a confrontation with Austin at the conclusion of WrestleMania XIX. He was also \"very, very close\" to making a deal with the company in 2011, which would potentially have involved a match against The Undertaker at WrestleMania XXVII. Although Sting twice wrestled Mark Calaway in his pre-Undertaker character, Mark Callous, at WCW live events in 1990, WWE viewers clamored for a televised Sting versus Undertaker match.\n\nBorden appeared in the music video for the song \"Fire in the Hole\" by Lȧȧz Rockit in 1989.\n\nBorden appeared in the syndicated TV show Super Force as Hallor / ... (3 episodes, 1991-1992)\n\nHe starred in a pay-per-view only film titled \"The Real Reason (Men Commit Crimes)\" (1998).\n\nBorden was featured in a Sprite commercial in 1999. He also appeared in three episodes of the action-adventure series and Hulk Hogan vehicle \"Thunder in Paradise\" as the character Adam \"Hammerhead\" McCall. Borden made a guest appearance on \"Walker, Texas Ranger\" as biker and drug dealer Grangus in the episode \"Unsafe Speed\". He also appeared in \"Ready to Rumble\" (2000) as Sting.\n\nHe also appeared in the Christian film, \"The Encounter\" (2010) and was featured as the lead actor in the TV movie \"Shutterspeed\". He makes a cameo appearance as Sting on an episode of \"Upright Citizens Brigade\". Borden played an outlaw biker in the film \"Revelation Road\" (2013).\n\nIn October 2015, WWE released a second Sting DVD titled \"Sting: Into the Light\". The three-disc set features a behind-the-scenes documentary with Sting himself as he prepares to step into a WWE ring for the first time ever at WrestleMania 31.\n\nBorden was an anabolic steroid user in the 1980s. He became a born-again Christian in August 1998, after confessing his adultery, and substance and alcohol abuse to his then-wife. Borden has two sons, Garrett Lee and Steve, Jr. and a daughter named Gracie, who was born in 2000. His elder son Garrett attends Azusa Pacific University, where he plays college football as a running back. Steven attended Kilgore College, where he played tight end; on December 19, 2012, he committed to attend the University of Kentucky. After the 2015 NFL Draft, Steven was invited by the Kansas City Chiefs to try out for the team at their rookie mini-camp. Borden married his second wife Sabine in 2015, shortly after WrestleMania 31.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "The Ultimate Warrior\n\nWarrior (born James Brian Hellwig; June 16, 1959 – April 8, 2014) was an American professional wrestler, who most famously wrestled under the ring name The Ultimate Warrior for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) from 1987 to 1991 and again in 1992 and 1996. During his 1998 stint in World Championship Wrestling (WCW), he was known as The Warrior. Before WWF, he was known in World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) as Dingo Warrior.\n\nWhile in the WWF, Warrior became a two-time WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion and won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship once when he pinned Hulk Hogan in the main event at WrestleMania VI in Toronto, making him the first wrestler to hold both titles concurrently. He retired from professional wrestling in 1998 and embarked on a public speaking career, but wrestled one final match in Spain in 2008.\n\nWarrior died on April 8, 2014, at the age of 54 in Scottsdale, Arizona. Over the preceding three days, he had been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame, appeared at WrestleMania XXX and made his final public appearance on \"Raw\", returning to the promotion after an acrimonious separation since 1996. \n\nWarrior was born in 1959 as James Brian Hellwig, in Crawfordsville, Indiana. He was the oldest of five children and was raised by his mother (along with, later, his stepfather) after his father left his family when he was 12. His father died at 57 and a grandfather died at 52. The family moved to Indiana, where he graduated from Veedersburg's Fountain Central High School and attended Indiana State University for a year.\n\nPrior to his career in professional wrestling Hellwig was an amateur bodybuilder, competing in a number of NPC contests and winning the 1984 NPC Mr. Georgia crown. Hellwig started training with weights when he was 11 years old and described himself as \"the small, insecure kid who wasn't into any sports\". He moved to California where, after seeing bodybuilder Robby Robinson, he decided to take up the sport. His first contest took place in Florida, where he placed 5th. Later, while he was attending Life University in Marietta, Georgia, he won the Junior Atlanta contest and placed 5th at the 1981 AAU Collegiate Mr. America. In 1983, he won the AAU Coastal USA, before taking the Mr. Georgia title the following year. His last bodybuilding contest was 1985's Junior USAs, which was won by future IFBB Pro, Ron Love. Hellwig finished 5th.\n\nIn 1985, after spending six weeks in California training for a bodybuilding contest, he was invited to join a group of bodybuilders – Garland Donoho, Mark Miller, and Steve Borden – to form a professional wrestling team. Warrior accepted the invitation and abandoned his bodybuilding career as well as his plans to become a chiropractor.\n\nHellwig began his professional wrestling career as Jim \"Justice\" Hellwig of Powerteam USA, the group of bodybuilders trained by Red Bastien and Rick Bassman.\n\nLater, they wrestled as The Freedom Fighters (Hellwig was known as Justice and Borden was called Flash) in Memphis' Continental Wrestling Association under manager Dutch Mantel. Hellwig and Steve Borden (who later had success as \"Sting\"), formed a tag team called The Blade Runners; Hellwig was \"Blade Runner Rock\" and Borden was \"Blade Runner Flash\". Debuting in the Memphis, Tennessee-based Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) promotion, run by Jerry Jarrett, the team played baby faces at first, but fans were actually slow to take to the hulking duo in a territory that had featured sympathetic \"good guy tag teams\" like the Rock 'n' Roll Express and The Fabulous Ones. \n\nThey were quickly turned heel as The Blade Runners. The Blade Runners went on to wrestle for the Mid-South Wrestling promotion, which became the Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) in 1986. According to Joseph Laurinaitis (aka Road Warrior Animal), UWF owner Bill Watts created the Blade Runners and the intent was to make them a parody of The Road Warriors. They were part of Eddie Gilbert's Hotstuff International group, before disbanding in 1986 when Hellwig left the UWF.\n\nIn 1986, Warrior debuted in the Dallas, Texas-based World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW) promotion, where he wrestled for $50 a night. He has stated that he adopted the ring name \"Dingo Warrior\" after a member of the WCCW locker room remarked that he looked like \"a warrior\". This stood in contrast with a claim made by Road Warrior Animal, who stated that the Dingo Warrior was a recreation of Warrior's Blade Runner gimmick and was an attempt to present himself as an offspring of The Road Warriors.\n\nInitially Warrior was still a heel in the territory, managed by Gary Hart, although he was cheered during a heel versus heel feud with WCWA World Heavyweight Champion Rick Rude after the two fell out during a tag match. After switching managers to Percival Pringle III, Warrior turned babyface permanently after a falling out with fellow Pringle proteges Buzz Sawyer and Matt Borne after a six-man tag match. Warrior formed a tag team with Lance Von Erich, and the duo began competing for the WCWA World Tag Team Championship. On November 17, 1986, Warrior and Von Erich defeated Master Gee (substituting for champion Buzz Sawyer) and Matt Borne to win the title. They held the Championship until December 1 of that year, when they lost to Al Madril and Brian Adias.\n\nIn 1987, Warrior began competing for the WCWA Texas Heavyweight Championship, losing to Bob Bradley in a tournament final on January 12. He won the title from Bradley on February 2 of that year. The title was held up in April 1987 after Warrior left the WCCW. He was reinstated as champion upon returning, but vacated it once more upon resigning from WCCW to join the World Wrestling Federation, where he adopted the ring name The Ultimate Warrior. Warrior began appearing on house shows in June and was initially billed as The Dingo Warrior in house card promos by Gene Okerlund, but soon had his name modified. There is dispute over who created the Ultimate Warrior name. Bruce Prichard stated that Vince McMahon did not know what a \"Dingo\" Warrior was, but because there was the \"Modern Day Warrior\" Kerry von Erich and The Road Warriors there should not be one more simple warrior, but the ultimate warrior. Warrior claims after one of his first matches, McMahon had him do a pretaped promo. It was there Vince said we want you to do Warrior, but we don't want Dingo. The Warrior then proceeded to cut the promo and stated that he was not this warrior or that warrior, he was The Ultimate Warrior.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1989, he appeared in several TV ads for Westway Ford, a car dealership in Irving, Texas. Warrior interacted in full wrestling costume with Westway's wacky character, \"Mean Joe Greed.\"\n\nHellwig joined the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in June 1987. First competing on house shows under his Dingo Warrior moniker, he defeated a series of jobbers, including Steve Lombardi, Barry Horowitz and Mike Sharpe. He made his television debut as The Ultimate Warrior on the October 25 episode of \"Wrestling Challenge\", where he defeated another jobber, Terry Gibbs. The Ultimate Warrior became known for his high-energy ring entrances, which featured him racing into the arena at full speed, bursting into the ring, and violently shaking the ropes up and down. He was also known for his distinctive pattern of face paint. After several months of defeating jobbers, he was pinned for the first time in the WWF by fellow WWF rookie/future rival Rick Rude on December 28, 1987. In early 1988, Warrior entered into his first real WWF feud with fellow strongman Hercules Hernandez. The two faced off on the February 7, 1988 airing of \"Wrestling Challenge\", where Hercules was disqualified for using his steel chain. Warrior then grabbed a hold of the chain and in the midst of a tug of war over it, the chain snapped. This led to a match at WrestleMania IV, where Warrior was victorious in his pay-per-view debut. Warrior lost twice by pinfall shortly thereafter: cleanly to André the Giant in April in Italy, and to Dino Bravo, who put his feet on the ropes for leverage, in Montreal in June. In the summer of 1988, he wrestled Bobby Heenan in a series of weasel suit matches, in which Warrior won by sleeper hold.\n\nLess than a year after his WWF television debut, Warrior, a surprise substitute for the injured Brutus Beefcake, won the Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship, defeating The Honky Tonk Man in a 27-second squash match at the inaugural SummerSlam on August 29, 1988. As champion, he captained a team at Survivor Series '88, where he was the sole survivor, pinning Outlaw Ron Bass and Greg Valentine in succession to win the match for his team.\n\nAs 1989 began, Warrior entered a feud with Rick Rude over the Intercontinental title. The feud was sparked at the 1989 Royal Rumble, where the two met in a \"super posedown\". After Warrior drew the support of the live crowd in their judging of the contest, Rude attacked Warrior and choked him with a steel bar. This led to a championship match at WrestleMania V, where Rude pinned Warrior to win the title with the help of his manager Bobby Heenan, who held down Warrior's foot from outside the ring as he was being pinned. At SummerSlam, Warrior defeated Rude to regain the title and become a two-time Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion. Warrior then began a feud with André the Giant, leading to a number of house shows in which Warrior defeated Andre in short squash matches, establishing Warrior as a main event level talent. The feud culminated at Survivor Series where the two captained opposing teams. Warrior eliminated André by knocking him out of the ring, where he was counted out. Warrior was again the sole survivor, pinning Arn Anderson and Bobby Heenan to win the match.\n\nThe Warrior received a push as WWF's main event successor to Hulk Hogan, who had remained wrestling's biggest star throughout the 1980s. Following a few confrontations with Hogan, most notably at the 1990 Royal Rumble, the Warrior was written in as Hogan's opponent in the main event for WrestleMania VI at the SkyDome in Toronto. The match was billed as \"The Ultimate Challenge\", as both Hogan's WWF World Heavyweight Championship and Warrior's Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship were on the line. Warrior pinned Hogan after a Warrior Splash to become the only wrestler to hold both championships simultaneously. Warrior vacated the Intercontinental Championship (which Mr. Perfect then won in a tournament), as WWF rules prohibited a wrestler from holding both titles.\n\nAfter WrestleMania, Warrior successfully defended the championship against Haku, Mr. Perfect and Ted DiBiase. At SummerSlam, he retained the title over Rick Rude in a steel cage match. \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage was also introduced as a potential rival after interfering in a \"The Main Event\" title match at the behest of DiBiase.\n\nWarrior was inserted into the feud between The Legion of Doom and Demolition, leading to victories for the Warrior and LOD in six-man tag team matches in house shows as well as the October 13, 1990 airing of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\". The feud culminated at Survivor Series, where The Warriors (Ultimate Warrior, LOD and Kerry Von Erich) defeated The Perfect Team (Mr. Perfect and Demolition). For the third consecutive year, Warrior was the sole survivor for his team. He later survived the \"Grand Finale Match of Survival\" with Hulk Hogan.\nIn January 1991, Warrior faced Sgt. Slaughter at the Royal Rumble. Slaughter's gimmick at the time was a traitor who had betrayed America by aligning himself with an Iraqi (kayfabe) military general, General Adnan. In the context of the Gulf War, this made Slaughter one of the most hated heels at the time. After rejecting an earlier request to grant a title shot to Savage, Sensational Sherri interjected herself in the Warrior's championship match to distract him. Her interference eventually led to a Savage sneak attack, where he struck Warrior over the head with a metal scepter and allowed Slaughter to pin Warrior to win the title. Warrior went on to feud with Savage, and the rivalry culminated in a \"Career Ending\" match at WrestleMania VII which Warrior won, forcing Savage to retire.\n\nThe next chapter of Warrior's career was an encounter with The Undertaker, after Undertaker and his manager, Paul Bearer, locked Warrior in a coffin on the set of Bearer's \"Funeral Parlor\". WWF officials worked feverishly to break the casket open, finally revealing Warrior's seemingly lifeless body, and the torn fabric inside of the coffin indicating Warrior's desperate struggle to get out. Warrior was finally revived by the officials performing CPR. This led to Jake \"The Snake\" Roberts offering to give Warrior \"the knowledge of the dark side\" in order to prepare Warrior to take his revenge on the Undertaker. This involved Roberts giving Warrior three \"tests\" shown on WWF TV in consecutive weeks. For the first test, Roberts locked Warrior inside of a coffin for a second time.\n\nFor the second test, Warrior was \"buried alive\" by Roberts. For the third test, the Warrior entered a room full of snakes, to find \"the answer\" in a chest in the middle of the room. Waiting inside the chest was a Spitting Cobra, which bit Warrior in the face. As Warrior weakened from the effects of the cobra's strike, Roberts made a heel turn and was joined by the Undertaker and Paul Bearer, revealing the three were working together all along. Roberts then uttered, \"Never trust a snake.\" The stage was now set for a feud between the Warrior and Roberts. The feud never took place, as Warrior was involved in an alleged pay dispute with WWF owner Vince McMahon over the SummerSlam main event, where Warrior was teamed with Hulk Hogan in a handicap match against Sgt. Slaughter, Colonel Mustafa, and General Adnan.\n\nOn July 10, 1991, Warrior sent a letter to Vince McMahon requesting inclusions in his new WWF contract. He wanted $550,000 for performing at WrestleMania VII, a guaranteed number of working days, travel accommodations and a higher percentage of merchandise sales. He remarked that $550,000 \"was fair\", and that \"[Warrior] meant as much or more to the show than Hulk [Hogan]\". He ended his letter with \"Whatever your decision, I can and will live with it. Till then I remain home with one who cares\".\n\nThe WWF responded on July 13, agreeing to $550,000 for WrestleMania VII, a higher royalty rate and promising no other WWF performer would be paid more than him on WWF pay per views. Vince McMahon personally ended the letter by saying, \"I would like to express my deepest appreciation and admiration for you as a performer, as a member of the WWF family, as a man, and as my friend\".\n\nFollowing WWF's annual SummerSlam event, Warrior was handed a letter dated August 26, 1991, from Vince McMahon, saying Warrior was suspended effective immediately. Among other things, McMahon said, \"You threatened to stay at home thereby not even appearing at Titan's major summer pay-per-view event SummerSlam. I had no choice but to accede to your exorbitant demands. This was a serious mistake on your part\". McMahon later testified that the only reason the company agreed to the contract was to \"acquiesce to his demands temporarily\" to ensure Warrior would perform at the SummerSlam event.\n\nUpon receiving the letter, Warrior refused the suspension and left the WWF. Warrior formally sent a letter of resignation to the WWF in October 1991. The WWF refused to accept the letter since Warrior was under contract until September 1992.\n\nWith Hulk Hogan about to leave WWF between mid-1992 and early-1993, McMahon contacted Warrior about returning. He made his comeback at WrestleMania VIII (to rescue Hulk Hogan from a beat down at the hands of Sid Justice and Papa Shango). Upon his return, he received a degree of creative control over his bookings. One storyline involved Papa Shango, a \"witch doctor\", casting a spell over Warrior, causing him to convulse and vomit in very odd colors, though Warrior says he hated that story and had no control over it. The Warrior was booked for a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match against then-champion, \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage at SummerSlam in August 1992. The Warrior won the match by countout, but not the title. In November 1992, Warrior was scheduled to team with Savage (as The Ultimate Maniacs) to face Ric Flair and Razor Ramon at Survivor Series. Weeks before the event, Warrior was released for disputed reasons and replaced by Mr. Perfect.\n\nThe initial plan for Warrior's 1992 return was to eventually give him another run with the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. However, his return coincided with the government's crackdown on steroids in wrestling. Warrior was admittedly a heavy user of steroids during his professional wrestling career. In his book \"Sex, Lies and Headlocks\", ESPN writer Shaun Assael stated that Canadian chemist Mauro Di Pasquale, who had been hired in June to monitor the WWF's new drug testing program and was known for being tough towards anyone who failed a drug test, nailed Warrior for steroid use in September and was able to successfully persuade McMahon, who was under federal scrutiny at the time for allegations of illegally supplying steroids to some of his wrestlers, to release Warrior from the company. However, in the \"Warrior: The Ultimate Legend\" documentary Vince McMahon claims that it was Warrior's experimenting with growth hormone which led to his departure; Warrior was suspended and, in return, skipped dates as he took offense to McMahon's actions. Warrior left the company on November 21, 1992.\n\nBetween November 1992 and July 1995, Warrior was semi-retired. During his time away from the WWF, Warrior opened the short-lived \"Warrior University\", a professional wrestling school based in Scottsdale, Arizona.\n\nIn December 1992, he wrestled as the Dingo Warrior against Hercules Hernandez in Billerica, Massachusetts, for Killer Kowalski's International Wrestling Federation.\n\nIn April 1993, he toured Europe for World Wrestlings Superstars and that same year he also played the role of \"the swordsman\" in the action movie \"Firepower\".\n\nIn July 1995, he returned to the ring for the National Wrestling Conference (NWC) promotion in Las Vegas, defeating The Honky Tonk Man. He had also wrestled a tour of Europe for Otto Wanz's Catch Wrestling Association (CWA) promotion.\n\nOn February 10, 1996, he defeated Jimmy Garvin in an independent show in Princeton, West Virginia.\n\nWarrior returned to the WWF on March 31, 1996, defeating Hunter Hearst Helmsley at WrestleMania XII. He made his first appearance on \"Monday Night Raw\" on April 8, where he gave an in-ring interview and credited the \"voices\" of the \"warriors\" (his name for members of the WWF audience) for his return; he was then interrupted by Goldust. Warrior challenged for Goldust's Intercontinental Championship at ; Warrior won the match by countout, but did not win the title. The following night on \"Monday Night Raw\", Warrior defeated Isaac Yankem, DDS. A rematch with Intercontinental Champion Goldust, on the May 27 episode of the show, ended in a double countout, thus eliminating both men from the tournament and eventually giving Vader a bye into the semi-finals. Warrior defeated Jerry Lawler at King of the Ring, and defeated Owen Hart by disqualification on the July 8 episode of \"Monday Night Raw\".\n\nWarrior was scheduled to team with Shawn Michaels and Ahmed Johnson to face Owen Hart, Davey Boy Smith, and Vader at later that month, but the WWF terminated Warrior's contract when he missed several house shows and taking time off allegedly to grieve the death of his father. WWF owner Vince McMahon claimed that Warrior had not seen his father in ten years and did not care much for him; therefore, he did not take Warrior's excuse for missing house shows at face value. Warrior disputes McMahon's explanation, claiming that the real reason why he no showed those events was a breach of contract by McMahon, in which WWF sold Warrior's merchandise without giving him a percentage. He was replaced by Sycho Sid at in Your House 9.\n\nWCW signed Warrior in 1998. He formed a stable opposing Hollywood Hulk Hogan's New World Order (nWo): the \"One Warrior Nation\". The acronym oWn (One Warrior Nation) was a play on the name nWo. Highlights of the storyline included Warrior kidnapping and \"converting\" The Disciple and frequent instances of \"magic smoke\" knocking out all of the nWo members except for Hollywood Hogan and covering Warrior's movement through a trapdoor in the ring. The trapdoor was responsible for nearly paralyzing Davey Boy Smith, when he awkwardly fell on it during a match at Fall Brawl 98.\n\nWarrior only participated in three matches in WCW. The first was the WarGames match at Fall Brawl, where he competed as a member of Team WCW, competing against 8 other wrestlers for a shot at Goldberg's WCW World Heavyweight Championship at Halloween Havoc. Diamond Dallas Page won the match by pinning Stevie Ray. On \"Monday Nitro\", he teamed with Sting to defeat Hogan and Bret Hart by disqualification, a match in which he had little participation; he was tagged in for a short exchange with Hart, then singlehandedly chased several nWo members down the entry way, whipping them with Hogan's belt. The third was his loss to Hogan at Halloween Havoc, in what is considered by Eric Bischoff to be one of the worst main event pay-per-view wrestling matches ever. In the Halloween Havoc match, the timing of the maneuvers and hits was poor; an arm injury that Warrior received at WarGames further slowed the action. An attempt to \"blind\" Warrior with a fireball backfired when Hogan faced complications igniting a piece of flash paper, causing the fire to go up in Hogan's face instead. The match came to an end when Horace Hogan hit Warrior in the back with a chair while Eric Bischoff had referee Nick Patrick distracted. Hogan then scored the pinfall.\n\nWCW claimed that attempts were made to save the storyline though Warrior has claimed in interviews and convention appearances that the only reason he was brought back was so Hogan could get a win over Warrior in return for Hogan's WrestleMania job. Warrior's last appearance in WCW was on the November 9, 1998 episode of \"Monday Nitro\", when he came to the rescue of The Disciple who was being attacked by members of The nWo. Warrior retired from wrestling that year.\n\nAfter retiring in 1999, Warrior only wrestled one match after that in 2008, against Orlando Jordan in Barcelona, Spain. Warrior won the match and thus the Nu-Wrestling Evolution World Heavyweight Championship, but then immediately vacated the title.\n\nOn February 20, 2013, Warrior confirmed on his official YouTube channel that he would appear at WrestleMania 29 on April 7, 2013. In the same clip he spoke positively about Vince McMahon for the first time on his channel. His appearance was so popular that a second print run of tickets had to be ordered.\n\nOn July 15, 2013, Warrior was featured in a \"WWE 2K14\" game trailer and revealed he was in the roster as a pre-order bonus.\n\nOn April 5, 2014, The Ultimate Warrior was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame Class of 2014. The next day, Warrior appeared at WrestleMania XXX, and the following night delivered a promo on \"Raw\", his first appearance on the show since his final WWF TV match in 1996. During what turned out to be his final public appearance, Warrior gave a speech to the fans and wrestlers past and present as his Ultimate Warrior character.\n\nWarrior married Shari Lynn Tyree on October 2, 1982. They remained together for the majority of Warrior's WWF career before divorcing on March 22, 1991, two days before WrestleMania VII. Warrior married for the second time to Dana Viale on January 31, 1999. They had two daughters, Indiana (2000) and Mattigan (December 16, 2002).\n\nWarrior returned to the WWF at WrestleMania VIII after nearly eight months on hiatus since SummerSlam 1991. Due to the drastic change in his appearance (shorter, blonder hair and a smaller physique), rumors began circulating that a new wrestler was playing the role. At the time it was rumored to be Kerry Von Erich, who was under contract at the time. Some said Warrior died from liver failure due to years of steroid abuse or that his signature arm tassels cut off his blood circulation. WWE claims that the theory that a different man returned to play The Ultimate Warrior at WrestleMania VIII remains \"perhaps the longest standing urban legend in WWE history\". WWE announcer Tom Phillips claims that the rumors likely originated from Gene Okerlund's WCW Hotline as well as the WCW debut of Warrior doppelgänger The Renegade.\n\nIn 1993, Hellwig legally changed his name to the mononym Warrior. This one-word name appears on all legal documents pertaining to Warrior, and his children carry the Warrior name as their legal surname.\n\nWarrior and the WWF engaged in a series of lawsuits and legal actions in 1996 and 1998, where both parties sought a declaration that they owned the characters, Warrior and Ultimate Warrior, under both contract and copyright law. The court ruled that Warrior was legally entitled to use the gimmick, costuming, face paint designs, and mannerisms of the \"Warrior\" character.\n\nOn September 27, 2005, WWE released a DVD documentary focusing on Warrior's retrospective wrestling career, titled \"The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior\". The DVD featured clips of his more notable feuds and matches along with commentary from WWE stars past and present (most of which are unflattering), with Triple H (by this point one of WWE's top main eventers and the husband of Vince McMahon's daughter Stephanie McMahon) adding that his WrestleMania debut loss against Warrior at WrestleMania XII left him with mixed emotions, saying that Warrior \"ruined the experience\" for him and was \"one of the most unprofessional guys\" he's ever performed with. The DVD has provoked some controversy due to Warrior's own allegations of libel by WWE against him. Originally, Warrior was asked to help with the production of the DVD, but as he refused to work with WWE (citing he did not want to be associated with their promotion), there had been some resulting animosity between Warrior and WWE over the Warrior claiming bias on the part of WWE. In January 2006, Warrior filed another lawsuit against WWE in an Arizona court over the depiction of his wrestling career in \"The Self-Destruction of the Ultimate Warrior\" DVD. On September 18, 2009, Warrior's lawsuit in Arizona was dismissed.\n\nWarrior formally retired from wrestling in 1999 and had a short-lived career as a conservative speaker and commentator, partnering with conservative spokesman Daniel Pinheiro, denouncing left-wing politics. In one instance, he mentioned that \"queering doesn't make the world work\" during a speech at the University of Connecticut. Warrior explained those comments on his website as meaning that the human race would die out if everyone were a homosexual.\n\nIn 1996, Warrior published a comic book titled \"Warrior\", featuring himself as the main character. The series was co-written with Jim Callahan and illustrated by the Sharp Brothers.\n\nWarrior maintained a blog on his personal website titled \"Warrior's Machete\", where he discussed his personal life, his personal views on politics, sexuality, patriotism, and his legacy as a wrestler, amongst other topics. There were numerous instances where Warrior used his blog to address his viewpoint on members of his wrestling past (Vince McMahon, Road Warrior Animal, The British Bulldog, Owen Hart, Hulk Hogan, Lex Luger); historical (Martin Luther King, George Washington) or religious figures (Jesus). Warrior depicted celebrities who were newsworthy at the time of his blog (Heath Ledger and Paris Hilton).\nWarrior occasionally referenced his respect for the Founding Fathers of the United States, and also enjoyed books like Homer's \"Odyssey\" and James Allen's \"As a Man Thinketh\". In 2012, he started selling \"Weapons of Wisdom\", inspirational 6×9 pieces of watercolor paper with drawings, quotes, and doodles on them by the Warrior himself. He also used the blog to post replies to letters from fans.\n\nWarrior died on April 8, 2014 in Scottsdale, Arizona. He had been inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 5, appeared at WrestleMania XXX on April 6, and made his first \"Raw\" appearance in almost 18 years on April 7, the day before his death. According to reports, Warrior clutched his chest and collapsed at 5:50 p.m. while walking to his car with his wife outside of their hotel in Arizona. He was rushed to the hospital where he was pronounced dead at age 54. Warrior's colleagues said Warrior appeared frail during WrestleMania weekend, and said that he was sweating profusely and breathing heavily backstage.\n\nAn autopsy revealed Warrior died of a heart attack caused by atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\n\nAlthough Warrior's relationship with WWE was strained at times, more recently WWE has recognized him as one of the legends of the company. WWE described him as being \"As devastating and intense as any Superstar who stepped through the ropes...\", further saying that \"The Ultimate Warrior may be the most enigmatic man to ever hold the WWE Championship.\" In 2011, WWE called him \"one of the most recognizable\" wrestlers in WWE history, praising his ability to draw power from \"the WWE Universe\", and further spoke of his impact as having \"brought Hulkamania to its knees\" at WrestleMania VI, \"retired the Madness at WrestleMania VII and press slammed a slew of the greatest legends of his era\". In WWE All Stars, in which Ultimate Warrior appears as one of the Legends, WWE stated that he was the \"ultimate archetype of strength and intensity\", and further stated that \"without question, the Ultimate Warrior has etched his name in the pantheon of WWE greats\".\n\nWarrior appeared in the Mattel Legends figures line in both Series 4 and Series 6. He was also chosen as one of six legends to be included in the Defining Moments series of action figures. Most recently he was one of a number of figures in the WWE Superstars line of Mattel action figures in an assortment called \"World Champions\". Warrior further appears as a playable legend in \"WWE All Stars\" and \"WWE Legends of WrestleMania\". The Ultimate Warrior was featured in \"WWE 2K14\", \"WWE 2K15\", \"WWE 2K16\", and it was announced June 14, 2016 he will appear in \"WWE 2K17\". In 2005, WWE released \"The Self-Destruction of The Ultimate Warrior\" DVD, which portrayed Warrior in a negative light. Warrior claimed that if WWE wanted to induct him into the WWE Hall of Fame they would have \"to tell the right story\" opposite of the one depicted in the 2005 DVD. WWE released \"Ultimate Warrior: The Ultimate Collection\", a 3-DVD, 540 minute-compilation of matches and stories, which portrayed Warrior far more positively, on April 1, 2014. Warrior was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame on April 5, 2014, the night before WrestleMania XXX.'\n\nWarrior had been largely alienated from his peers in professional wrestling in the decade before his death, and was sometimes described as a bitter man on bad terms with various wrestling figures such as Vince McMahon, Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts. With Warrior's reconciling with the professional wrestling industry just before his death, some of his former adversaries offered their condolences. McMahon stated that \"We are all so sad that the Ultimate Warrior has passed away. Our heart is with his wife Dana and his two daughters.\" Hogan said, \"RIP WARRIOR. only love ... We talked, both forgave each other, we hugged, we shook hands as we told each other I love you, I am so sad, God bless his beautiful family\". Roberts said that he was \"Deeply saddened. We just had a great talk & buried a senseless hatchet. Talked working together. RIP Warrior. Taking solace we made peace.\" News of his death spread the next day on sites such as Bing, Facebook, and Twitter. It was also mentioned on ABC News, HLN and CNN. Reportedly almost immediately after Warrior's death, WWE sent two senior officials to Arizona to assist his widow in handling personal things such as grocery shopping so that she can focus on being with her and Warrior's daughters.\n\nWWE paid tribute to Warrior on the April 14 episode of \"Raw\" with a ten bell salute and a video. The WWE Network aired a lineup dubbed \"Warrior Week\" in Warrior's memory. The lineup included a four-part special. A wrestling themed episode of \"The Goldbergs\", which aired on May 6, was dedicated in Warrior's memory. The 2015 film \"\", which stars \"The Flintstones\" and WWE Superstars and Divas, was dedicated to Warrior's memory.\n\nAt the \"UFC Fight Night 40\" weigh-ins, fighter Lorenz Larkin wore an Ultimate Warrior mask, tassels and wristbands as a tribute.\n\nWarrior was awarded a posthumous Slammy Award for Return of the Year in December 2014. A WWE-sponsored biography, entitled \"Ultimate Warrior: A Life Lived Forever: The Legend of a WWE Hero\", was released in 2015.\n\nDuring his April 2014 Hall of Fame speech shortly before his death, Warrior proposed that the \"Jimmy Miranda Award\" should be created to honour WWE's behind-the-scenes employees. Miranda, who died in 2002, was part of the WWE merchandise department for more than 20 years. \n\nIn 2015, WWE introduced the Warrior Award for those who have \"exhibited unwavering strength and perseverance, and who lives life with the courage and compassion that embodies the indomitable spirit of the Ultimate Warrior.\" Former WWE ring announcer Justin Roberts expressed disappointment at how WWE used portions of Warrior's Hall of Fame speech to promote the award, but left out Warrior's intentions of honoring WWE's off-screen employees. WWE responded, \"It is offensive to suggest that WWE and its executives had anything but altruistic intentions in honoring Connor and his legacy with the Warrior Award\", adding that \"moving forward the award will be given annually to acknowledge other unsung heroes among WWE's employees and fans.\" As of 2017, none of the Warrior Award recipients have been WWE employees.\n\nIn 2017, WWE started promoting the \"Unleash Your Warrior\" breast cancer awareness campaign in partnership with the Susan G. Komen Foundation, where Warrior's likeness was promoted on television by WWE wrestlers and breast cancer survivors. WWE has been criticized for using Warrior as the inspirational \"emblem\" of the campaign. \"Pro Wrestling Torch\" described Warrior in real-life having made public \"vile, bigoted, hateful, judgmental comments about a cancer victim, Hurricane Katrina victims, homosexual people, a woman defending a gay man, and even Martin Luther King Jr.\" For example, when Bobby Heenan contracted cancer, Warrior said, \"Karma is just a beautiful thing to behold.\" \"Vice\" wrote that \"completely whitewashing his past and elevating his likeness to a bland symbol of corporate altruism is shockingly tone-deaf, especially for a company that's at least outwardly trying to appear progressive, inclusive and diverse\". In response, WWE said that the Unleash Your Warrior campaign and the Warrior Award and \"recognize individuals that exhibit the strength and courage of WWE's legendary character The Ultimate Warrior. Any attempt to distract from the mission of these initiatives and take the spotlight away from the honorees is unfortunately misguided.\"\n\n\n\n",
                "Bret Hart\n\nBret Sergeant Hart (born July 2, 1957), better known by the ring name Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart, is a Canadian-American retired professional wrestler, retired amateur wrestler, writer and actor. A member of the Hart wrestling family and a second-generation wrestler, he has an amateur wrestling background, wrestling at Ernest Manning High School and Mount Royal College. A major international draw within professional wrestling, he has been credited with changing the perception of mainstream North-American professional wrestling in the early 1990s by bringing technical in-ring performance to the fore. Hart is widely regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time; Sky Sports noted that his legacy is that of \"one of, if not the greatest, to have ever graced the squared circle\".\n\nHart joined his father Stu Hart's promotion Stampede Wrestling in 1976, and made his in-ring debut in 1978. He gained championship success throughout the 1980s and 1990s in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE), where he helmed The Hart Foundation faction. He left for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) following the controversial \"Montreal Screwjob\" in November 1997, where he remained until October 2000. Having been inactive from in-ring competition since January 2000, owing to a December 1999 concussion, he officially retired in October 2000, shortly after his departure from the company. He returned to sporadic in-ring competition from 2010–2011 with WWE, where he won his final championship, headlined the 2010 SummerSlam event, and served as the general manager of Raw. Throughout his career, Hart headlined WrestleManias IX, X, and XII, and participated in the main event of the 1997 and 1999 editions of WCW Starrcade – as a special enforcer and referee in the former.\n\nHart has held championships in five decades from the 1970s to the 2010s, with a total of 32 held throughout his career, and 17 held between the WWF/WWE and WCW. Among other accolades, he is a five-time WWF World Heavyweight Champion and a two-time WCW World Heavyweight Champion. Hart has most combined days as WWF World Heavyweight Champion during the 1990s (654), and was the first WCW World Heavyweight Champion born outside the United States. He is the second WWF Triple Crown Champion and fifth (with Goldberg) WCW Triple Crown Champion, and the first man to win both the WWF and WCW Triple Crown Championships. Hart is also the 1994 Royal Rumble match winner (with Lex Luger), and the only two-time King of the Ring, winning the 1991 tournament and the first King of the Ring pay-per-view in 1993. Stone Cold Steve Austin, with whom Hart headlined multiple pay-per-view events as part of an acclaimed rivalry from 1996 to 1997, inducted him into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\nOutside of wrestling Hart has appeared in numerous films and television shows such as \"The Simpsons\" as well as featuring in several documentaries, both about himself specifically and others about the wrestling industry in general. Hart also helped found and lend his name to the major junior ice hockey team the Calgary Hitmen and has written two biographies as well has having a weekly column for the \"Calgary Sun\" for over a decade.\n\nThe eighth child of wrestling patriarch Stu Hart, Bret Hart was born in Calgary, Alberta into the Hart wrestling family. He is of Greek descent through his maternal grandmother and Irish through his maternal grandfather. His father was mainly of Scots-Irish descent but also had Scottish and English ancestry. Hart is a dual citizen of Canada and the United States since his mother Helen was born in New York. Hart has stated that he considers himself to be North American and that he is equally proud of his U.S. and Canadian nationality.\n\nHart grew up in a household with eleven siblings, seven brothers Smith, Bruce, Keith, Wayne, Dean, Ross and Owen, as well as four sisters, Ellie, Georgia, Alison and Diana. As a child he was the closest with his older brother Dean who was the nearest to him in age of all his older brothers, being three years his senior. Together they would often fight with Bret's two older sisters, Ellie, who was two years older, and Georgia, who was one year older. Hart's family were non-denominational Christians, but he and all of his siblings were baptized by a local catholic priest.\n\nHart spent the vast majority of his childhood in the Hart family mansion which was owned by his father. During one period his father was housing a bear known as Terrible Ted chained under the building, the bear had had all of its teeth removed and Hart would sometimes as a very young child let the bear lick ice cream off his toes since he thought it was a good way to keep them clean.\n\nHis introduction to professional wrestling came at an early age. As a child, he witnessed his father training future wrestlers like Billy Graham in the Dungeon, his household basement which served as a training room. Before school, Hart's father, also a wrestling promoter, had him hand out fliers to local wrestling shows. In the 1998 documentary \"\", Hart reflected on his father's discipline, describing how Stu uttered morbid words while inflicting excruciating submission holds that left broken blood vessels in Bret's eyes. Hart claimed his father had an otherwise pleasant demeanor.\n\nHart's first work in wrestling involved pulling out lucky number out of a metal box during intermission at the Stampede Wrestling shows when he was four years old. When he got slightly older he would sell programs to the shows, something all Hart's seven brothers would do. He would often compete for customers with his little brother Ross since the fans would often want to buy from the youngest Hart child.\n\nLike his father, Hart was an excellent amateur wrestler since an early age, having began training as a nine year old. At Ernest Manning High School, Hart became a standout student in the amateur wrestling division. Hart has stated that he joined the wrestling team \"for the sole reason that my dad expected me to... no-one asked me to.\" He won significant championships in tournaments throughout Alberta, including the 1974 city championships in Calgary. He scored a victory over competitor Bob Eklund – who would go on to become a Canadian Interuniversity Sport national champion, winning \"Outstanding Wrestler of the Year 1980–1981\" – en route to the championship. Hart describes the moment where he displayed the medal to his father, Stu, as a \"powerful moment\", and that the relationship with his father \"took a different direction from that point on.\" Hart considered the medals to be one of his most prized possessions.\n\nBy 1977, Hart was collegiate champion at Mount Royal College, where he was studying filmmaking; his coaches and other people around him felt that he had shown sufficient promise to compete at the following year's Commonwealth Games and encouraged him to begin training for the event. Hart, however, was beginning to find amateur wrestling unrewarding amid injuries and fluctuating weight. Stu still believed his son capable of making it to the Olympic or Commonwealth Games if he put forth the effort. Hart has expressed that he believed that even if he became an exceptionally successful sports wrestler it would not have led to a career afterwards which he was interested in, stating that he thought that he would end up as a wrestling coach or phys-ed teacher at a high-school if he pursued the olympic rout. Hart felt that the only way to give up amateur wrestling without disappointing his father was to become a professional wrestler. His college grades became poorer as his interest in filmmaking waned; he dedicated himself to professional wrestling and began training with his father's Stampede Wrestling promotion. Hart has spoken of how helpful his amateur background was in his professional wrestling career, and also of what a positive effect amateur wrestling has on junior high school and high school-aged boys in terms of building self-confidence.\n\nIn 1976, Hart began working for his father's Stampede Wrestling promotion in Calgary. Hart first began helping the promotion by refereeing matches. At a 1978 event in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, a wrestler was unable to perform his match, forcing Stu to ask his son to stand in as a replacement. Before long, he became a regular contender, eventually partnering with brother Keith to win the Stampede International Tag Team Championship four times.\n\nHart gained some of his most prominent experience with Japanese combatants and real-life trainers Mr. Hito and Mr. Sakurada. Hart also had high-impact matches against Tom Billington, the Dynamite Kid. In the midst of wrestling alongside his family, Hart made a point not to ride on the shoulders of his elders. Hart faithfully jobbed as requested of him, taking pride in the believability of his performances. As he said himself, \"No one could take a shit kicking like Bret Hart\". Although he dreaded partaking in interviews and speaking in front of a crowd, Hart went on to win the promotion's top titles, including two British Commonwealth Mid-Heavyweight Championships, five International Tag Team Championships, and six North American Heavyweight Championships. Hart also wrestled Tiger Mask in New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW), a promotion for whom he often wrestled during the early to mid-1980s. He remained one of Stampede's most successful performers until the promotion, along with several wrestlers, was acquired by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in August 1984.\n\nHart was asked to start out in the WWF as a singles wrestler with a cowboy gimmick but refused, citing that where he comes from \"if you called yourself a cowboy, you'd better be one.\" He instead requested to join Jimmy Hart's heel stable, The Hart Foundation, which included brother-in-law Jim Neidhart. He made his televised WWF debut on August 29, 1984, in a tag team match where he teamed with the Dynamite Kid. On September 11, in Poughkeepsie, New York, Hart defeated Aldo Marino in his televised debut singles match, which aired on the September 29 edition of \"Superstars of Wrestling\". By 1985, after he was billed as Bret \"Hit Man\" Hart Hart had turned heel as he began to increasingly team with Neidhart in order to build the promotion's tag team division. The \"Hart Foundation\" name then became exclusive to Hart, Neidhart and manager Jimmy Hart, due to the similar family names of both team members and their manager. Hart's agile, technical style – which earned him the moniker \"The Excellence of Execution\" (coined by Gorilla Monsoon) – created an intriguing contrast with his partner Neidhart's strength and brawling skills. During this time, Hart began wearing his signature mirrored sunglasses, initially to conceal his nervousness during promos. Hart considers his microphone work throughout his career to have been a weakness in his repertoire: he instead relied on his in-ring performances to win over the fans.\n\nIn 1986, Hart began his first singles program with Ricky Steamboat, and in a singles match originally planned for WrestleMania 2, he lost to Steamboat at the Boston Garden on March 8, 1986, which would be included on Hart's 2005 DVD as one of his all-time favorite matches. At WrestleMania 2, Hart instead participated in a 20-man battle royal which was eventually won by André the Giant. He lost to Steamboat again on the July 28, 1986 edition of \"Prime Time Wrestling\". Hart headlined his first televised WWF card when he beat Ray Rougeau, of The Fabulous Rougeaus, in the main event of the November 3, 1986 edition of \"Prime Time Wrestling\".\n\nThe Hart Foundation won their first of two WWF Tag Team Championship on the February 7, 1987 edition of \"Superstars of Wrestling\" when they defeated The British Bulldogs. They then teamed with Danny Davis to face The British Bulldogs and Tito Santana at WrestleMania III. They won the match when Davis pinned Davey Boy Smith after hitting him with Jimmy Hart's megaphone.\n\nThe Hart Foundation adopted the nickname, \"The Pink and Black Attack\", which Hart continued to use after the tag team's disbandment. This was in reference to the team's ring attire, as well as Hart's signature mirrored sunglasses, which he would routinely give away to a young audience member before matches, following his face turn in 1988. As Hart's WWF career progressed, he increasingly described himself as \"The best there is, the best there was, and the best there ever will be\" (derived from the 1984 film \"The Natural\"), which he would later justify through three claims: he never injured an opponent through any fault of his own; through the entire course of his career, he missed only one show (as a result of flight difficulties); and that he only once refused to lose a match – his final WWF match with long-time adversary Shawn Michaels at the Survivor Series event in 1997, which culminated in the Montreal Screwjob.\nThe Hart Foundation lost the WWF Tag Team Championship to Strike Force on the October 27 edition of \"Superstars of Wrestling\". Hart subsequently competed in his most high-profile singles contest to date on the November 28, 1987 edition of \"Saturday Night's Main Event\", when he faced \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage in a losing effort. He began 1988 with a decisive victory over Paul Roma of The Young Stallions (who had scored an upset victory over The Hart Foundation the previous year) on the January 11 edition of \"Prime Time Wrestling\", and, at the Royal Rumble in January 1988, was the first man to enter the Royal Rumble match. He lasted 25 minutes and 42 seconds before being eliminated by Don Muraco. In his first singles championship opportunity, he challenged The Honky Tonk Man for the WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship in the main event of the July 18 edition of \"Prime Time Wrestling\", with the match ending in a double countout.\n\nAt the Royal Rumble in January 1989, The Hart Foundation teamed with Jim Duggan to defeat The Fabulous Rougeau Brothers and Dino Bravo. They also defeated Greg Valentine and The Honky Tonk Man, who were also managed by Jimmy Hart, at WrestleMania V. At an event in Milan on April 8, 1989, broadcast live on Tele+2, André the Giant requested to work a singles match with Hart, who lost the match, which was later released on his 2013 DVD set, \"The Dungeon Collection\", but considered André's praise and encouragement after the match to be of key importance in his singles career. He wrestled his first pay-per-view singles match on October 10, losing to Dino Bravo in the first British WWF pay-per-view, which was held at the London Arena and broadcast on Sky Television (Hart was in fact booked to win the match, but incurred a broken sternum, causing an unplanned countout loss).\n\nAt SummerSlam in August 1989, The Hart Foundation lost a non-title match against then WWF Tag Team Champions The Brain Busters. In the first televised contest of a rivalry that would span Hart's WWF and WCW careers, he lost to Mr. Perfect on the November 6, 1989 edition of \"Prime Time Wrestling\", when Perfect pulled Hart's tights during a roll-up. In their first ever singles meeting, Shawn Michaels and Hart wrestled to a double countout on the February 11, 1990 edition of the \"Wrestling Challenge\".\n\nAfter participating at the Royal Rumble in January 1990, The Hart Foundation defeated The Bolsheviks in 19 seconds at WrestleMania VI and began feuding with Demolition, who had just won the WWF Tag Team Championship against The Colossal Connection at WrestleMania VI. At SummerSlam in 1990, The Hart Foundation began their second, and final, WWF Tag Team Championship reign by defeating Demolition members Crush and Smash in a two out of three falls match with some help from Legion of Doom. On October 30, the Hart Foundation lost the title to The Rockers (Marty Jannetty and Shawn Michaels), but a few days later, President Jack Tunney reversed the decision and the win was never acknowledged on television. The Hart Foundation's reign lasted until WrestleMania VII, where they lost to The Nasty Boys, after which the team split.\n\nHart won his first WWF Intercontinental Championship by defeating Mr. Perfect with the Sharpshooter at SummerSlam in 1991, and subsequently won the 1991 King of the Ring tournament on September 7, 1991 at the Providence Civic Center in Providence, Rhode Island. Hart's first pay-per-view title defense occurred at This Tuesday in Texas, where he beat the undefeated Skinner.\n\nIn January 1992, Hart was placed in a feud with The Mountie. This feud came about when the Mountie's manager, Jimmy Hart, threw water on Hart, and The Mountie proceeded to shock Hart with a cattle prod. On January 17, 1992, Hart dropped the Intercontinental Championship to The Mountie. Following the loss, Roddy Piper defeated Mountie with a sleeper hold two days later at the 1992 Royal Rumble, and Bret later pinned Piper for his second Intercontinental Championship (renamed simply WWF Intercontinental Championship) at WrestleMania VIII later that year, making him the first, and one of few wrestlers to ever pin Piper's shoulders to the mat. At a \"Wrestling Challenge\" taping on July 21, 1992, Hart defeated Shawn Michaels, with the Intercontinental Championship belt suspended above the ring, in the WWF's first ever ladder match. Hart dropped the Intercontinental Championship to his brother-in-law, Davey Boy Smith, in Hart's first WWF pay-per-view main event at SummerSlam in August 1992, held before over 80,000 fans at Wembley Stadium. \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers voted it the \"Match of the Year\", and WWE named the match as the greatest in the history of SummerSlam. Upon induction into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2006, Hart cited the contest as his favorite match of his career.\n\nHart won the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Ric Flair at a \"Superstars\" taping at Saskatchewan Place in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on October 12 of that year, in a match not originally broadcast on WWF television – the match was instead made available on a series of Coliseum/WWE Home Video releases. Hart dislocated one of the fingers on his left hand during the match and popped it back in himself so it would not affect the rest of the match. He made his first successful title defense against Papa Shango on \"Saturday Night's Main Event\". He would headline his first pay-per-view as champion with a successful title defense against Shawn Michaels at the 1992 Survivor Series, and defeated Razor Ramon at the 1993 Royal Rumble. He would also defend the title against contenders such as Papa Shango and former champion Ric Flair before losing the title to Yokozuna in his first WrestleMania main event at WrestleMania IX, after interference from Mr. Fuji. Fuji then challenged Hulk Hogan, who had come out to help Hart, to compete for the title; Hogan then won his fifth WWF World Heavyweight Title from Yokozuna. In June, Hart won the first pay-per-view King of the Ring tournament, defeating Razor Ramon, Mr. Perfect, and Bam Bam Bigelow, thus becoming the only two-time King of the Ring. According to Hart, he was scheduled to regain the WWF World Heavyweight Championship from Hulk Hogan at SummerSlam, but Hogan chose to drop the title to Yokozuna instead at King of the Ring. Hart instead entered a feud with Jerry \"The King\" Lawler, who interrupted Hart's coronation, claimed he was the only king, attacked Hart and began a barrage against Hart and his family. The two met at SummerSlam in 1993, to determine the \"Undisputed King of the World Wrestling Federation\". Hart originally won the match by submission, via the Sharpshooter, but as he would not let go of the hold, the decision was reversed to a Lawler victory by disqualification. Hart and his younger brother, Owen Hart, would also feud with Lawler during 1993 in the United States Wrestling Association (USWA), with Lawler notably defeating Owen for Owen's USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship. Hart's feud with Lawler was named \"Feud of the Year\" by \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\", and voted \"Feud of the Year\" by readers of \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\".\n\nAfter months of dealing with Lawler, Hart received a WrestleMania IX rematch with WWF World Heavyweight Champion Yokozuna on the November 20 edition of \"WWF Superstars\". When Bret appeared to have the match won, with Yokozuna locked in the sharpshooter, Owen came to ringside to congratulate his brother. The referee began questioning Owen's motives, which allowed Fuji to assault Bret. Owen then involved himself in the match, resulting in a victory for Yokozuna via disqualification. On the non-televised but now-canon November 22 edition of \"Monday Night Raw\", Hart again challenged Yokozuna for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, and again failed to regain the championship due to similar involvement from Owen. The brothers' disagreements set the wheels in motion for a family feud that would span the entirety of 1994. At Survivor Series, the Harts (Bret, Owen, Bruce, and Keith) took on Shawn Michaels (a substitution for Lawler, who was facing legal troubles) and his knights. The Harts won the match, with all of the brothers surviving except for Owen, the only Hart family member eliminated when he was rolled up by Michaels after inadvertently knocking Bret off the apron. Bitter about his elimination, Owen blamed Bret for this and in the weeks ahead, blamed Bret for holding him back. Owen demanded a one-on-one match with Bret, which Bret refused to accept. In the storyline, Bret, along with his parents, worked over the Christmas holidays to reunite the family and to settle their rivalry. Bret was voted \"WWF Superstar of the Year\" 1993 by fans, as well as the greatest wrestler of the year by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers.\nAt the Royal Rumble in January, Bret and Owen took on The Quebecers for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Referee Tim White stopped the match after he considered Bret unable to continue after he sustained a kayfabe knee injury during the match. After the match, Owen berated his brother for costing him a title opportunity and attacked the injured knee, setting the feud between the two. Later on, Hart managed to participate and win the 1994 Royal Rumble match amid controversy. Hart and Lex Luger were the final two participants and the two were eliminated over the top rope at the same time. Therefore, both men were named co-winners of the 1994 Royal Rumble match and received title shots at WrestleMania X. Luger won the chance to face Yokozuna first, with Hart having to wrestle his brother Owen, before receiving his title shot. Hart lost his match against Owen but went on to defeat Yokozuna for his second WWF World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nHart continued to feud with his brother Owen while he also started feuding with Diesel. Hart's friend and former tag team partner Jim Neidhart returned to the WWF and reunited with Hart. At King of the Ring, Hart defended the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Diesel. When Hart was winning the match, Shawn Michaels interfered on Diesel's behalf; Diesel appeared close to victory after he delivered a Jackknife Powerbomb yet before he could pin Hart, Neidhart interfered, therefore Diesel won by disqualification, but Hart retained his title. Neidhart left when Diesel and Michaels attacked Hart following the match. Neidhart's motivation was made clear when he helped Owen win the tournament that night, so that he could receive a title shot against his brother. At SummerSlam, Hart successfully retained the WWF World Heavyweight Championship against Owen in a steel cage match. This match received a five-star rating from Dave Meltzer of \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\", and the brothers' feud was voted \"Feud of the Year\" by readers of \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\".\n\nHart eventually lost his WWF World Heavyweight Championship at Survivor Series in a submission match against Bob Backlund where the manager of either competitor (Davey Boy Smith for Hart, Owen for Backlund) would have to \"throw in the towel\" for the wrestler they were representing. When Hart was in Backlund's crossface chickenwing and Davey Boy was kayfabe knocked out, Owen persuaded his mother Helen to throw in the towel for Hart, giving Backlund the championship victory. Bret's feud with Backlund would continue into the following year. He was voted the greatest wrestler of 1994 by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers, winning the vote for the second straight year.\nThree days after Hart's title loss, Diesel defeated Backland in eight seconds with a jackknife powerbomb to become the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion. By 1995, Hart was focusing on projects outwith the business, such as acting, and shifted to the number two face in the company, behind Diesel. Hart challenged for Diesel's WWF World Heavyweight Championship at the 1995 Royal Rumble, in a match that was continually marred by outside interference and ruled a draw. Both men embraced in a display of sportsmanship after the match. In a rematch from Survivor Series, Hart defeated Bob Backlund in an \"I Quit\" match at WrestleMania XI. Hart would be the focal point of the first event in the In Your House pay-per-view series, competing in two matches at In Your House 1. He defeated Hakushi in the very first match of the in Your House series. Hart's acclaimed feud with Jerry Lawler was reignited at the event when Lawler defeated Hart due to Hakushi's (now Lawler's protégé) interference. Hart beat Lawler in a \"Kiss My Foot\" match at King of the Ring, and defeated Lawler's kayfabe dentist, Isaac Yankem, by disqualification at SummerSlam 1995. Their King of the Ring match ended with Hart shoving his foot into Lawler's mouth, then forcing Lawler to kiss his own foot. Although Hart was victorious in their in-ring feud, Lawler remained strongly opposed to Hart as a commentator, and would routinely encourage Hart's opponents during matches; it would not be until Over the Limit, sixteen years later, that both men would finally bury the hatchet. After disposing of Lawler, Hart shifted his focus back to the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, defeating Diesel in a no disqualification match at Survivor Series to commence his third reign.\n\nIn a rematch from their SummerSlam 1992 encounter, Hart successfully defended his title against the now heel Davey Boy Smith at . He lost to The Undertaker by disqualification at the 1996 Royal Rumble when Diesel interfered, ultimately retaining the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, and defeated The Undertaker by disqualification in a rematch on the February 5 edition of \"Raw\", again due to Diesel's interference. Hart retained his title once again against Diesel in a steel cage match at In Your House 6, and defeated Hunter Hearst Helmsley, who was undefeated on \"Raw\", on the March 4 edition of the show. WWF Commissioner Rowdy Roddy Piper ruled that Hart would face Shawn Michaels, who had earned a WWF World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania XII by winning the Royal Rumble, in a 60-minute Iron Man match at the event. The wrestler with the most decisions during the 60 minutes would win the match and the WWF World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nAt WrestleMania, with less than a minute left on the clock and the score still 0–0, Michaels jumped from the middle rope; his legs were caught by Hart, and Hart locked in his Sharpshooter. However, Michaels did not submit in the last 30 seconds so the match ended in a tie. WWF President Gorilla Monsoon ruled that the match would continue in sudden death overtime. Michaels hit a superkick to win the championship. \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers voted it the \"Match of the Year\"; in 2004, WWE fans voted the match as the greatest in the history of WrestleMania. After WrestleMania, Hart went on a European tour over the next two weeks, coming out victorious against Stone Cold Steve Austin and Hunter Hearst Helmsley. The tour ended on April 22, and after this took his hiatus from television. His final televised appearance was an interview taped while on the European tour where he described his passion for wrestling was diminished, and although there were offers from competing companies he might be finished with wrestling.\n\nThat fall, Hart would indeed receive competing offers of employment from both WWF and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). WCW presented a $9M contract offer to Hart, while the World Wrestling Federation responded with an unprecedented 20-year contract. Finishing up his original WWF deal, Hart returned to action on a tour of South Africa on September 8, 1996, defeating Davey Boy Smith in Durban. On October 21, Hart elected to re-sign with the World Wrestling Federation He was inducted into the \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" Hall of Fame Class of 1996.\n\nOver the summer, Stone Cold Steve Austin, who was fresh from winning the 1996 King of the Ring, continually taunted Hart and challenged him to come back and have a match. After an eight-month hiatus from television, Hart returned and defeated Austin at Survivor Series in a match for the number one contender spot to the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Hart challenged champion Sycho Sid at the following month's ; Shawn Michaels, who was serving as a guest commentator at ringside, accidentally cost Hart the victory when he attempted to become involved in the match after being assaulted by Sid. The building tension between Hart and Michaels climaxed after the match, when Hart assaulted Michaels. Hart's feud with Austin escalated at the Royal Rumble, when Hart tossed Austin out of the ring, only for Austin (unbeknownst to the referees) to climb back into the ring and win the Rumble. Hart quit the WWF the next night on \"Raw\" in protest. In order to deal with this controversy, a Fatal Four-Way between Austin and the participants he eliminated after re-entering the ring (Vader, The Undertaker, and Hart) was set up for , with the winner becoming the number one contender. After then-champion Shawn Michaels relinquished the belt, though, the match officially became for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Hart defeated Austin, Vader, and The Undertaker in the Fatal Four-Way. However, Austin made sure Hart's fourth reign was short-lived, costing him a title match against Sid the next night on \"Raw\". Hart challenged for Sid's WWF World Heavyweight Championship in a steel cage match shortly before WrestleMania 13, which saw Austin actually attempt to help Hart win, in order to make their scheduled match at WrestleMania 13 a title match. Concurrently, The Undertaker, who had a scheduled title match with Sid at WrestleMania, attempted to help Sid win. Sid ultimately retained, leading to a pure grudge match for Hart and Austin. Following his loss to Sid, Hart shoved \"announcer\" Vince McMahon to the ground when he attempted to conduct a post-match interview, and engaged in a worked shoot, expletive-laden rant against McMahon and WWF management. This incident has been cited as one which helped lay the foundations of the WWF's Attitude Era, as well as the starting point of McMahon's on-air character, the tyrannical WWF owner \"Mr. McMahon\".\n\nAt WrestleMania 13, Hart and Austin had their rematch in a submission match that would later get a 5-star rating from Dave Meltzer. In the end, Hart locked the Sharpshooter on a bloody Austin, who refused to give up. In fact, Austin never quit, but passed out from the blood loss and pain. Ken Shamrock, the special guest referee, awarded Hart the match, after which he continued to assault Austin, thus turning heel for the first time since 1988. It was named \"Match of the Year\" by \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" and voted \"Match of the Year\" by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers. Later that night, Hart confronted Sycho Sid and The Undertaker prior to their match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship; Hart insulted Undertaker and told Shawn Michaels (who was a guest commentator for the match) not to interfere. Undertaker won the match, which ended with Hart hotshotting Sid on the ropes, therefore costing him the title.\n\nHart challenged Rocky Maivia for the Intercontinental Championship in the main event of the March 31 edition of \"Raw\". Rocky Maivia won by disqualification when Hart refused to release a figure-four leglock applied around the ringpost. He faced Austin again in the main event of , to determine who would challenge the WWF World Heavyweight Champion in a title match at the following month's . Austin had Hart locked in his own finishing move, the Sharpshooter, in the middle of the ring when The British Bulldog interfered on Hart's behalf, resulting in disqualification and giving Austin the victory and title match. They met once again in a street fight on the April 21 edition of \"Raw Is War\", in which Austin injured Hart's ankle with a steel chair. The match was ruled a no contest and Austin afterward continued to beat Hart while on a stretcher in the back of an ambulance.\nIn the ensuing weeks, Hart denounced American fans, because of their negative reaction to him in the recent weeks in contrast to his continued popularity through the rest of the world, and reunited with brother Owen and brothers-in-law Davey Boy Smith and Jim Neidhart. The family members formed a new Hart Foundation with Brian Pillman; this incarnation was an anti-American stable which was popular within Canada and Europe. As the leader of this stable, Hart routinely carried a Canadian flag to the ring and engaged in promos where he declared the superiority of his home nation; he became so despised by U.S. audiences that they would often throw debris during his ring entrances, interviews, and matches. He was voted by \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" readers as the \"Most Hated Wrestler of the Year\" 1997. At , in Hart's home town of Calgary, the Hart Foundation defeated the team of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Ken Shamrock, Goldust, and The Legion of Doom, representing the United States, in a ten-man tag team match main event. The Canada vs. U.S. rivalry escalated on the July 21 edition of \"Raw Is War\" in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where Bret, Owen, and Davey Boy Smith, representing Canada and the Hart Foundation, defeated the team of Dude Love, Austin, and The Undertaker, representing the U.S., in a Flag match. The Hart Foundation's feud with Austin was named \"Feud of the Year\" by \"Wrestling Observer Newsletter\" and voted \"Feud of the Year\" by readers of \"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\". Hart vowed that if he could not defeat The Undertaker for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at SummerSlam, he would never wrestle in the United States again. The Undertaker agreed to the match, and Hart won his fifth and last WWF World Heavyweight Championship after spitting in guest referee Shawn Michaels' face; Michaels swung a steel chair in retaliation, which accidentally struck the Undertaker. Michaels, who, as part of another pre-match stipulation, would be banned from wrestling in the United States if he did not remain impartial as referee, had no option but to count the pinfall, giving his rival Hart the victory.\n\nAfter SummerSlam, Michaels was pushed as the top heel in the company and negative fan reactions towards Hart in the United States softened somewhat, as he declared, \"I'm not so much anti-American as I am just very, very pro-Canadian\". In real life, Hart did not like the new Attitude Era, instead preferring traditional values. This was used as part of his character, as Hart would insult the U.S. fans because of the success of the Attitude Era. Hart successfully defended his title against The Patriot, with whom Hart had become involved in a feud as part of the Canada vs. U.S. storyline, at , avenging a loss to him weeks earlier on \"Raw\", and the Canada vs. U.S. feud would conclude at , where Hart and Davey Boy Smith, representing Canada and The Hart Foundation, defeated The Patriot and Vader, representing the U.S., in a Flag match. Erstwhile, in a rematch from SummerSlam, The Undertaker challenged Hart for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship at One Night Only; after reversing a Tombstone Piledriver attempt from Hart, The Undertaker dumped Hart on the apron when he would not let go of the ropes. As a result, Hart's neck was caught in the ropes, and The Undertaker was disqualified. Hart later cited this as his favorite of all his matches with The Undertaker, and his last great match in the WWF.\n\nDuring the Hart Foundation's feud with the Shawn Michaels-led D-Generation X (DX), DX framed the Hart Foundation in vandalizing the locker room of the African American stable, Nation of Domination with racist motifs. In retaliation, during a promo with D-Generation X, Hart called members Triple H (previously billed as \"Hunter Hearst Helmsley\") and Shawn Michaels \"homos\". Hart later apologized for his participation in the storyline and said that he had been pressured into it, saying, \"I am not in any shape or form a racist. And I don't believe it is anything to kid around about. I also want to apologize for any remarks I made about gay people. It was a stupid mistake on my part\". Hart successfully defended his title against Nation of Domination leader, Faarooq, on the October 20 edition of \"Raw\". In his penultimate title defense, Hart wrestled Ken Shamrock to a no-contest on the October 27 edition of \"Raw Is War\"; while the referee was knocked out, Shamrock put Hart in an ankle lock; members of the Hart Foundation then attacked Shamrock until Shawn Michaels made the save for Shamrock and attacked Hart.\n\nAround this time, Hart's on-air rivalry with Vince McMahon also escalated. A heated ringside altercation between the two led many fans to dislike McMahon, who at the time was being exposed as owner of the WWF more and more frequently on-air. Although Hart had signed a 20-year contract back in 1996, the WWF was in a rough financial position by late 1997 and could no longer afford to honor the contract. Although Hart was arguably the biggest wrestler in the world during the mid-1990s, McMahon also felt that the value of his character was beginning to wane, and he encouraged Hart to approach the World Championship Wrestling (WCW) about a contract, hopefully one similar to their original offer. This was despite Hart's reluctance to leave the WWF and willingness to re-negotiate. Hart subsequently signed a three-year contract with WCW. His final match with the WWF would be a title match against his real life rival Shawn Michaels at Survivor Series in Montreal. Hart did not want to end his WWF career with a loss to Michaels in his home country particularly with the context of their nationality-fueled feud; and offered to lose, forfeit or otherwise give over the belt to Michaels in any other way that McMahon wanted. McMahon agreed to Hart's idea of forfeiting the championship the next night on \"Raw Is War\" or losing it a few weeks later.\n\nAlthough Hart stated to McMahon he would not take the WWF World Heavyweight Championship with him to WCW TV and despite insistence from then-WCW President Eric Bischoff, that Hart would join WCW with a \"clean slate\", McMahon was still concerned and paranoid; this led to him breaking his word in what eventually came to be known as the Montreal Screwjob. Even though Hart did not submit to the Sharpshooter, referee Earl Hebner called for the bell as if he had, on McMahon's orders. This resulted in Hart \"losing\" the title to Michaels. The night ended with an irate Hart spitting in McMahon's face, destroying television equipment, and punching McMahon backstage in front of Gerald Brisco, Pat Patterson, and McMahon's son Shane. Hart also confronted Michaels backstage about the match finish. Many behind-the-scenes events leading up to the Montreal Screwjob were filmed for the documentary \"\", released in 1998. WWE has described the Montreal Screwjob as \"arguably the most controversial, most jarring moment in the annals of sports entertainment\".\n\nHart's three-year contract with World Championship Wrestling included a salary of $2.5 million per year (a $1 million annual increase from his WWF contract), as well as a light schedule and a measure of creative control over his television character. A day after the WWF's Survivor Series pay-per-view, Eric Bischoff, while with the New World Order (nWo), announced that Hart was going to be coming to WCW and joining the nWo. Hart made his debut on \"Nitro\" on December 15, 1997. He was also heavily involved in that month's Starrcade pay-per-view. Due to a 60-day no-compete clause from the WWF, he served as the special guest referee for the match between Bischoff and Larry Zbyszko; during the Sting versus Hollywood Hogan main event for the WCW World Heavyweight Championship, he stepped in toward the conclusion of the match as impromptu referee, declaring Sting the winner and new champion by submission. In January, his no-compete clause expired, and his first feud in WCW was against Ric Flair, as both wrestlers considered themselves the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. Hart defeated Flair at Souled Out in his first WCW match. After this, Hart elected to defend the honor of WCW against the nWo, defeating members Brian Adams in his debut \"Nitro\" match on March 2, and Curt Hennig at Uncensored. In April 1998, Hart interfered in a \"Nitro\" main event between Hollywood Hogan and Randy Savage, helping Hogan recapture the WCW World Heavyweight Championship. He became an associate of the nWo, but did not officially join the group.\nHart competed in his second \"Nitro\" match on June 22, defeating Chris Benoit with assistance from nWo members: Hart had attempted to recruit his long-time friend into the nWo, but the offer was rejected. At Bash at the Beach, Hart competed in his first championship match in WCW when he faced Booker T for Booker's WCW World Television Championship. He was disqualified after hitting Booker with a steel chair. He headlined his first \"Nitro\" card on July 20, defeating Diamond Dallas Page for the vacant United States Heavyweight Championship, with assistance from nWo member, The Giant. On the August 10 edition of \"Nitro\", Hart lost his title to Lex Luger. He regained it from Luger the next night on \"Thunder\". In the main event of Fall Brawl, Hart was defeated in a WarGames match for the No. 1 contender spot to the WCW World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nHart subsequently asked the fans for forgiveness, turning his back on Hogan and the nWo. A match between Hart and Hogan was booked for the September 28 edition of \"Nitro\". During the match, Hart sustained a knee injury, with the bout ending in a no-contest; Sting came to Hart's aid and initiated a match with Hogan. Hart turned on Sting, delivering a DDT, and this bout was also ruled a no-contest. Sting, a member of the rival nWo Wolfpac, was assaulted after the match; this betrayal began an intense feud between Hart and Sting. On the October 12 edition of \"Nitro\", Sting and The Warrior beat Hart and Hogan by disqualification. Hart's feud with Sting ended at Halloween Havoc with Hart controversially defending the United States Heavyweight Championship and (kayfabe) injuring Sting. On the October 26 edition of \"Nitro\", Hart lost the title to Diamond Dallas Page. The two headlined the following month's World War 3 pay-per-view in a title match which Hart lost. Hart regained the title from Page on the November 30 edition of \"Nitro\" in a No Disqualification match with help from The Giant.\n\nOn the February 8, 1999 episode of \"Nitro\", Hart lost the United States Heavyweight Championship to family friend Roddy Piper. On the March 29 edition of \"Nitro\" held at Toronto's Air Canada Centre, Hart appeared in street clothes and derided WCW World Heavyweight Champion Ric Flair, as well as Hogan, for avoiding a match with him. Finally, he called out \"franchise player\" Bill Goldberg, claiming he could beat him in five minutes and verbally coercing Goldberg into giving him the spear. Hart was wearing a metal breastplate under his Toronto Maple Leafs jersey, which resulted in Goldberg being knocked out. Hart then counted his own pinfall over Goldberg's unconscious body and announced over the mic: \"Hey Bischoff, and the WCW, I quit!\" In reality, he had suffered a groin injury at the hands of Dean Malenko in November and needed time off for surgery.\n\nOn May 23, 1999, the night before Hart was scheduled to make an appearance on \"The Tonight Show with Jay Leno\" to hype his imminent WCW return, his brother Owen Hart died in an accident during a WWF pay-per-view. Hart took a further four months off from WCW to be with his family.\n\nHart returned to wrestling on the September 13, 1999 edition of \"Nitro\" in a tag team match with Hulk Hogan against Sting and Lex Luger. Hart challenged for Sting's WCW World Heavyweight Championship on the October 18 edition of \"Nitro\", but lost the match when he was attacked by Luger. Due to controversy over a series of WCW World Heavyweight Championship matches between Sting, Hogan, and Goldberg at Halloween Havoc, the title was declared vacant. A tournament then took place over several episodes of \"Nitro\". Hart's first round match came against Goldberg the night after Halloween Havoc, with the bout being a tournament match for a berth in the next round, as well as being a match for the United States Heavyweight Championship that Goldberg had won the night before. Thanks to outside interference, Hart defeated Goldberg and won the title for the fourth time. On the November 8 episode of \"Nitro\", Hart lost the title to Scott Hall in a ladder match which also involved Sid Vicious and Goldberg.\n\nHart won the WCW World Heavyweight Championship tournament by defeating Perry Saturn, Billy Kidman, Sting, and Chris Benoit at Mayhem. On December 7, Hart and Goldberg won the WCW World Tag Team Championship from Creative Control, making Hart a double champion. Hart and Goldberg lost the tag team titles to The Outsiders on the December 13 episode of \"Nitro\". At Starrcade, Hart defended his WCW World Heavyweight Championship against Goldberg. During the match, Hart was struck with a thrust kick to the head, resulting in a severe concussion. Hart later speculated that he may have suffered up to three additional concussions within matches over the course of that day along with the days immediately following Starrcade, having been unaware of the severity of his injuries. For example, Hart placed Goldberg on the post in a figure four leglock which ended with Hart hitting his head on the concrete floor when Goldberg failed to receive the move correctly. The sum total of those injuries left Hart with post-concussion syndrome and ultimately forced his retirement from professional wrestling. Hart later claimed that Goldberg \"had a tendency to injure everyone he worked with.\" As part of his DVD documentary, Hart expressed regret that \"someone as good-hearted as Bill Goldberg\" was responsible for hurting him. Referee Roddy Piper rung the bell when Hart held Goldberg in the Sharpshooter, although Goldberg did not submit. Piper simply walked away, leaving both Goldberg and Hart bewildered.\n\nOut of respect for Goldberg, Hart vacated the WCW World Heavyweight Championship on the December 20 episode of \"Nitro\" and suggested that he, without the championship advantage, face Goldberg that night to determine the true champion. During the match, Scott Hall and Kevin Nash came to the ring looking to attack Goldberg with baseball bats. Hart convinced them to stop, then hit Goldberg with one of the bats. The three continued to beat down Goldberg and were eventually joined by Jeff Jarrett. Hart regained the championship, even though it was Roddy Piper who was covering Goldberg (to try and protect him) when the three count was made. The nWo was reformed (now billed as \"nWo 2000\"). Hart wrestled Terry Funk to a no contest in a non-title, hardcore rules match on the January 6 edition of \"Thunder\". In his final match in WCW, he defended the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against Nash on the January 10 edition of \"Nitro\", which also ended in a no contest. Hart vacated the title in late January 2000 when he was forced to withdraw from the main event of WCW's Souled Out due to his injuries. Hart continued to make appearances on WCW television, generally cutting promos. on the May 3 edition of Thunder, Hart mad a run in during an over the top rope battle royal where he hit Hogan with a chair. His final WCW appearance occurred on the September 6, 2000 edition of \"Thunder\", in a promo where he confronted Bill Goldberg on the injury he sustained nine months prior. WCW terminated Hart's contract via FedEx letter on October 20, 2000, due to his ongoing incapacity, and he announced his retirement from professional wrestling soon afterward.\n\nHart and several critics considered his storylines during his tenure to be lacklustre. Former WCW wrestler Chris Jericho attributed this to backstage politics and creative mayhem. Hart cited his \"steel plate\" segment with Goldberg and his tribute match to Owen, against Chris Benoit, as his two worthwhile moments with the company. He said he was \"proud\" to have been WCW World Heavyweight Champion for a short time prior to his injury.\n\nIn 2001, Hart became the on-screen commissioner of World Wrestling All-Stars (WWA), a role that ended prematurely due to a 2002 stroke, which temporarily required him to use a wheelchair. In his first major appearance since recovering, Hart traveled to Australia to appear at another WWA event in May 2003.\n\nIn 2007, Hart signed autographs at \"The Legends of Wrestling\" show at the Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida. During the months of October and November 2008, Hart went on tour with American Wrestling Rampage promotions, touring many places throughout the UK and Ireland, posing for photographs and signing autographs before the show. On the weekend of July 11, 2009, he made an appearance at One Pro Wrestling in Doncaster, England, where he held a Q&A, and then entered the ring to address the fans at the show. On September 27, 2009, Hart appeared in New York City's Manhattan Center to sign autographs during a Ring of Honor event. He spoke to the crowd, reminiscing about some of his more memorable matches in New York.\n\nIn mid-2005, Hart worked with the renamed World Wrestling Entertainment for the first time since 1997, contributing hours of interview footage and selecting matches for his WWE Home Video release, \"\".\n\nOn April 1, 2006, Hart was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by Stone Cold Steve Austin. He did not appear alongside his fellow inductees at WrestleMania 22 the following night. On June 11, 2007, Hart made his first appearance on \"Raw\" since October 27, 1997 when he appeared in a pre-taped interview voicing his opinions on Vince McMahon as part of \"Mr. McMahon Appreciation Night.\"\n\nHart re-signed with WWE in late 2009. On December 28, after weeks of speculation surrounding Hart and his presence in World Wrestling Entertainment, Chairman Vince McMahon announced that Hart would be special guest host on the January 4 \"Raw\". Hart thanked the fans for their continued support, jokingly teased announcer Jerry Lawler about their long-running 1990s feud, and confronted Shawn Michaels and McMahon regarding the Montreal Screwjob at Survivor Series in 1997. Hart and Michaels were able to agree on a truce, shaking hands and hugging. While many cast doubts on the sincerity of their reconciliation, both men have confirmed that it was indeed genuine and not part of storyline. It also appeared that he had buried the hatchet with McMahon later in the night, until McMahon subsequently kicked Bret in the crotch (this was in fact part of a storyline, as Hart and McMahon had been on speaking terms since 2005).\n\nDuring different encounters the following month, Hart and McMahon reproduced events similar to those that occurred in the Montreal Screwjob: McMahon spitting in Hart's face (as Hart did to McMahon), and Hart destroying parts of the technical equipment that goes into producing \"Raw\" (as he did to the Survivor Series equipment). On the February 15 \"Raw\", Hart made a farewell from WWE, but as he left to go inside his limousine, another vehicle reversed into the door of his limo and injured his left leg. On the March 1 \"Raw\", McMahon challenged Hart to a match at WrestleMania XXVI; Hart accepted. The match was later changed to a No Holds Barred match as Hart revealed (with help from \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin, the special guest host that night) the staging of his injury. Hart, along with his family, inducted his father Stu Hart into the WWE Hall of Fame, a controversial decision that aggravated Hart and McMahon's rivalry in 2010. At WrestleMania, McMahon attempted to buy Hart's family into turning against him; however, they turned against McMahon instead and helped Hart defeat McMahon.\nHart stood with The Hart Dynasty (David Hart Smith and Tyson Kidd), a stable stemmed from the Hart family, throughout their feud with ShoMiz (Big Show and The Miz); they ultimately won the WWE Tag Team Championship on April 26. When The Miz lost a match that guaranteed a WWE United States Championship match to a Hart family member, he chose Bret; with the help of the Dynasty, Hart defeated The Miz to win his fifth United States Championship on May 17 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On the May 24 edition of \"Raw\", Hart was named the new general manager of Raw. His first orders included vacating his United States Championship, which R-Truth won, and setting up qualifying matches for Fatal 4-Way, which the injured Batista took exception to and quit. The next week, Hart declared a Viewer's Choice episode of \"Raw\". He was attacked by NXT rookies after firing Wade Barrett and declining to offer them contracts on the June 14 episode of \"Raw\". A week later, McMahon fired Hart as general manager for failing to control the rookies.\n\nHart returned five weeks later, where it was announced by John Cena that he, The Great Khali, R-Truth, Edge, Chris Jericho, John Morrison and Hart would face the NXT rookies, now known as The Nexus, at SummerSlam. The following week, Hart teamed with Cena to wrestle SummerSlam teammates Edge and Chris Jericho to a no contest. In the SummerSlam main event, he was disqualified for using a steel chair on Skip Sheffield, however, his team still ultimately won the match. On the August 16, episode of \"Raw\", Hart introduced the new tag team title belts to the champions, The Hart Dynasty. Later on in the night during The Nexus vs. \"Raw\" challenge, Hart was scheduled to face Justin Gabriel, but was unable to compete after the Anonymous Raw General Manager, citing his disdain for Hart, removed him from the match and replaced him with Randy Orton. On September 25, WWE hosted a tribute event to Hart in Madison Square Garden, where he and the Hart Dynasty defeated Nexus members Heath Slater, Justin Gabriel and Michael Tarver in a six-man tag team match, when Gabriel submitted to Hart's Sharpshooter. In November 2010, Hart's WWE contract had expired.\n\nAt Over the Limit, Hart came to the support of his long-running 1990s rival, Jerry Lawler, forcing Michael Cole to kiss Lawler's foot. The following night on \"Raw\", Hart refereed the main event, which saw John Cena and Rey Mysterio defeat R-Truth and CM Punk with Hart's assistance. On the August 23, 2011 tapings of \"SmackDown\" (aired August 26), Hart served as guest general manager. On September 12, Hart teamed with John Cena in a match against Alberto Del Rio and Ricardo Rodriguez, which he won after putting Rodriguez into a sharpshooter. This was Hart's final match.\n\nHart has made infrequent appearances in minor roles, appearing on the April 25, 2011 edition of \"Tough Enough\". At \"Raw 1000\" and on the May 4, 2012 episode of \"Raw\" he served as guest ring announcer; he interviewed John Cena on September 10, 2012, during which CM Punk interrupted and got into a confrontation with Hart. He participated in backstage segments at the 2013 Royal Rumble and WrestleMania 31. On the post-show of \"Raw\" on May 27, 2013, Hart was honored by the city of Calgary and the WWE with a \"Bret Hart Appreciation Night\", a celebration of the work he had done in his career. Also present in the ring for this celebration were Pat Patterson, Chris Jericho, Shawn Michaels and Vince McMahon, who each paid their own tributes to Hart. He has also served as an expert on panels, including the March 25, 2013 episode of \"Raw\" and at the NXT Arrival pre-show. Hart was in the corner of his niece Natalya on the March 27, 2014 episode of \"NXT\", at the second NXT TakeOver event and at the 2016 edition of Payback. The match ended when the referee, Charles Robinson, called for the bell as Charlotte had Natalya locked in the Sharpshooter. After the match both Natalya and Hart placed Charlotte and her father, Ric Flair in the Sharpshooter.\n\nAccording to Jordan Peterson so was Hart at one point the most famous Canadian in the world. The BBC and \"Entertainment Tonight\" writers noted that Hart is \"widely regarded\" as one of the greatest professional wrestlers of all time. Sky Sports described his legacy as \"one of, if not the greatest, to have ever graced the squared circle\". Veteran wrestling expert and journalist Dave Meltzer has said that Hart is \"one of the best ever,\" and has further praised him for having the best in-ring psychology of all time in the history of the WWE (alongside Ricky Steamboat and Jake Roberts). Jon Robinson of IGN called him \"one of the greatest (if not the single best) pure wrestler to ever walk that aisle\". Veteran wrestlers including CM Punk, Booker T and Michael Hayes have named Hart \"the greatest of all time\", with Hayes noting that he is considered by many as the best Canadian performer ever, if not the single greatest overall. Veteran announcer Gene Okerlund dubbed Hart \"the greatest ever\", and stressed that he should appear in anyone's list of the all-time top 10 wrestlers. Olympic wrestling gold medalist and six-time WWE world champion Kurt Angle studied tapes of Hart in order to learn the art of pro wrestling; he and Stone Cold Steve Austin have ranked Hart as the best in-ring performer ever (Austin tying Hart with Shawn Michaels). Similarly, former opponent Harley Race described Hart as being \"as good as they got\". WWE chairman Vince McMahon described Hart as having \"unparalleled\" technical wrestling and storytelling skills, and retrospectively characterized the late 1990s Hart as an \"extraordinary star who you know is going to give you the best match of the night every time he goes out there\".\n\nThe Undertaker named Hart as his toughest opponent, adding: \"Some of my favorite matches are with him... I think my matches with Bret were some of the best\". Shawn Michaels conceded that Hart was an \"unbelievable\" performer (an opinion shared by WWE executive and former opponent Triple H), calling him a \"sheer joy\" to work with and saying that the pair's match at WrestleMania XII was one of, if not his favorite WrestleMania bout. Curt Hennig stated: \"Out of all the matches I had, probably the best match I ever had would be with Bret [at SummerSlam 1991]... I have a good thing with Bret forever\". Roddy Piper described Hart as \"one great man\", and \"one of the few guys who has a 'total package'\". Asked about his favorite opponent, Ted DiBiase said: \"In my own era, without a doubt, Bret Hart.\" Lance Storm remarked: \"[Hart's] matches always seemed more important than the individuals involved in them, and that's what made him great. Bret managed to dominate this sport... by wrestling, which is no easy task, and is to his credit\". On Hart's influence, Storm said: \"I've always tried to pattern my ring style or work ethic, at least, after that of 'The Hitman'\".\n\nAlong with Storm, Roman Reigns and Sami Zayn point to Hart as their top wrestling inspiration; Seth Rollins called him an idol, and Dean Ambrose cited him as an influence. Edge listed his three idols within the business as \"Bret, Shawn and Hulk\". Chris Jericho named Bret as his hero (along with Owen Hart), and said he aspired to be \"half of\" what Bret was. Chris Benoit remarked: \"I always emulated him... I spent so many years looking up to, idolizing [Hart]; he was somewhat of a role model to me\". Benoit added that his matches against Hart were \"up on a pedestal\". Koji Nakagawa modelled his character and entire career on Bret Hart by adopting Hart's pink and black attire, an entrance theme identical to Hart's theme song, while also adopting his moveset. Ryback recalled a WWF event from his childhood, saying: \"I remember it was Bret Hart against Diesel inside a steel cage in the main event, and I just knew I wanted to be a WWE wrestler... Bret [Hart], I love\". Asked about his favorite wrestlers/idols, Wade Barrett named Hart along with The British Bulldog, The Ultimate Warrior and The Undertaker; he has called Hart vs. the Bulldog, at SummerSlam 1992, his all-time favorite match.\n\n\"Pro Wrestling Illustrated\" (PWI) readers voted Hart the greatest wrestler of 1993 and 1994 in the \"PWI 500\", as well as the \"Most Inspirational Wrestler of the Year\" 1994. He was voted \"WWF Superstar of the Year\" 1993 by fans. PWI ranked him No. 4 of the top 500 singles wrestlers of the \"PWI Years\" in 2003, after Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair, and André the Giant. WWE has also credited Hart as the top \"Submission Specialist\" in professional wrestling history, and for popularizing the Sharpshooter, named by the organization as the most devastating submission hold in professional wrestling history. Hart's rise to singles success was seen to revolutionize the business; IGN wrote: \"After Bret beat Ric Flair for the WWE Championship in 1992, it changed the entire industry, re-setting the WWF back to the days of technical wizardry and reshaping all our notions of what a great wrestling match should actually look and feel like\". According to prominent industry historian Dave Meltzer, Hart was \"a major draw in the United States and probably more so in Europe\". WWE owner Vince McMahon asserted that whichever company hired Hart could \"have built the entire franchise around [him]\", and described him as an \"extraordinary star.\" McMahon added that it was \"fortunate for me, in terms of my company\", that his chief competitor, WCW, did not utilize Hart to his full potential. WCW described Hart as \"an incredible international draw, attracting standing room only crowds in every corner of the globe.\" Professional wrestling magazine \"Power Slam\" has spoken to Hart's drawing power, placing him number 7 in \"The 10 Best U.S.-Style All-Rounders\", a list that considered drawing ability, along with workrate and promo skills.\n\nOn the February 16, 2006 episode of \"Raw\", it was announced that Hart would be a 2006 inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame. Hart had also been approached by Vince McMahon for a potential match between the two at WrestleMania 22 but declined the offer. On April 1, 2006, Hart was inducted by \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin. He thanked every wrestler he worked with (even thanking Vince McMahon) and said he's \"in a good place in life.\" Veteran industry personality and former WWE executive Paul Heyman referred to Hart's oeuvre as \"a body of work so spectacular that it is beyond comprehension how brilliant a career he enjoyed\".\n\nOn July 15, 2006, Hart was inducted into the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame, at the International Wrestling Institute and Museum in Newton, Iowa. The induction took place in an immensely crowded and humid display room showcasing one of Hart's ring entrance jackets. The honor is only awarded to those with both a professional and amateur wrestling background, making Hart one of the youngest inductees. During his acceptance, Hart compared this induction to his place in the WWE Hall of Fame, saying \"This is a much bigger honor for me.\" In June 2008, Hart returned to the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame ceremony, this time to induct his father Stu Hart.\n\nHart wrote a weekly column for the \"Calgary Sun\" from June 1991 until October 2004.\n\nOn October 16, 2007, Hart's autobiography titled \"Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling\", was released in Canada by Random House Canada, and released in fall 2008 in the United States by Grand Central Publishing, with a U.S. book signing tour. Hart began writing the book in July 1999 with Marcy Engelstein, his longtime close friend and business associate. They did not complete the book until eight years later in September 2007 due to Hart suffering his stroke in 2002, among numerous other tragedies that occurred during the writing. Hart's chronicle is based on an audio diary that he kept for all of his years on the road in professional wrestling.\n\nHart also provided the forewords to Roddy Piper's autobiography, \"In the Pit with Piper\", Harley Race's autobiography \"King of the Ring\" and Dave Meltzer's book \"\".\n\nIn 1994, Hart played a prison inmate in Oliver Stone's \"Natural Born Killers\"; however, the scene he appeared in was deleted. From 1994 to 1995 Hart appeared in \"Lonesome Dove: The Series\" television show playing \"Luther Root\". He has made numerous televised appearances since, including a guest spot on \"The Simpsons\" in 1997 (as himself, in \"The Old Man and the Lisa\") and episodes of the \"\" (along with his brother Owen), \"The Adventures of Sinbad\", \"Big Sound\", and \"The Immortal\". Hart provides the voice of pro wrestler character \"The Hooded Fang\" in \"Jacob Two-Two\".\n\nHart also guest starred on the sketch comedy series \"MADtv\" in 1997 where he acted as enforcer at a fan's house, appearing with his WWF Championship belt. Hart later appeared again on \"MADtv\" in 1999 and 2000 in an angle with actor Will Sasso in which the two feuded on the set of \"MADtv\" and in World Championship Wrestling; this culminated in a grudge match on \"WCW Monday Nitro\", where Hart decisively defeated Sasso.\n\nHart donned his \"Hit Man\" singlet, along with additional costume, and executed wrestling maneuvers on villain characters, as part of his performance as the Genie in a 2004 stage production of \"Aladdin\". He reprised the role in 2006.\n\nHart was the subject of the 1998 documentary, \"\", which chronicles many of the events in Hart's personal and professional life from September 1996 to November 1997, including the Montreal Screwjob and its immediate aftermath.\n\nA clip of Hart applying the sharpshooter to Benoit at WCW Mayhem in 1999 is featured in the opening credits of \"Malcolm in the Middle\".\n\nIn mid-2005, WWE announced the release of a three-disc DVD originally named \"Screwed: The Bret Hart Story\", with the title a reference to the Montreal Screwjob. Hart filmed over seven hours of interview footage for the DVD, which was renamed \"\". The collection was released on November 15, 2005.\n\nHart appeared on many talk shows (including \"Larry King Live\", \"Nancy Grace\", \"Hannity & Colmes\", \"On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren\") discussing the Chris Benoit double murder and suicide. Hart was a long time friend of Benoit.\n\nOn April 6, 2010, WWE released \"\", which is a 3 DVD set featuring a documentary on the Hart wrestling family as well as 12 matches. It is unique in that it also features previously unseen home movies from the Harts as well as interviews from family members.\n\nIn 2010, The Fight Network produced a documentary titled \"\" produced by John Pollock, Jorge Barbosa and Wai Ting chronicling the rise of Hart, his split with WWE in 1997 and his road back to the company in January 2010. The documentary features interviews with Hart, members of the family, Carl DeMarco, former sports agent Gord Kirke, and producer of 'Wrestling with Shadows' Paul Jay.\n\nA DVD entitled \"Shawn Michaels vs Bret Hart: WWE's Greatest Rivalries\" was released in November 2011. The subject of the DVD was their on-screen rivalry and real-life conflicts, with a particular focus on the Montreal Screwjob.\n\nIn 2016, Hart starred in the documentary film \"Nine Legends\". Early that year, Hart launched a podcast named \"The Sharpshooter Show\".\n\nHart had appeared in numerous video games. They include WWE All Stars, WWE '13, WWE 2K14, WWE 2K16, WWE 2K17 and WWE 2K18.\n\nHart lent his nickname to the Calgary Hitmen of the Western Hockey League; he was a founder and part-owner. He is the commissioner of Sharpshooter Funding, a business loan company.\n\nHart married Julie Smadu (born March 25, 1960) on July 8, 1982. They have four children: Jade Michelle Hart (born March 31, 1983); Dallas Jeffery Hart (born August 11, 1984); Alexandra Sabina Hart (born May 17, 1988), nicknamed \"Beans\"; and Blade Colton Hart (born June 5, 1990). The four hearts located on the right thigh of his tights symbolize his children, as do the four dots following his signature. Julie's sister Michelle was married to Tom Billington. Bret and Julie separated in May 1998, and after several brief reunions over the next 4 years, Bret and Julie finally divorced on June 24, 2002, just hours before Hart suffered his stroke. Hart married an Italian woman named Cinzia Rota on September 15, 2004, but they divorced in 2007 after failing to agree on where they should live. He married Stephanie Washington on July 24, 2010. Through his daughters Jade and Alexandra, Hart has a granddaughter, Kyra Beans (born June 2010) and a grandson, Grayson Knight Cassidy (born June 20, 2015).\n\nHis seven brothers were either wrestlers or involved backstage with the wrestling business; his four sisters all married professional wrestlers. Two of his brothers-in-law, Davey Boy Smith, and Jim Neidhart had successful careers in the business. His youngest brother Owen Hart had become a decorated wrestler in his own right before his death in 1999, caused in an accident at the WWF pay-per-view Over the Edge. Hart's niece Natalya is a professional wrestler.\n\nFellow pro wrestler Roddy Piper claimed in his autobiography to be a cousin of Hart. Hart has also stated that Piper was the only wrestler to visit him in the hospital after his stroke.\n\nOn June 24, 2002, Bret Hart suffered a stroke after hitting his head in a bicycle accident. \"The Calgary Herald\" reported that Hart hit a pothole, flew over the handlebars of the bike, and landed on the back of his head. Hart suffered total paralysis on his left side, which required months of physical therapy. Hart has since recovered much of his mobility and is in good health, although he suffers from an emotional imbalance and other lasting effects common to stroke survivors. Hart wrote in detail about his stroke in his autobiography, \"Hitman: My Real Life In The Cartoon World of Wrestling\". Hart later became a spokesperson for March of Dimes Canada's Stroke Recovery Canada program. While recovering from his stroke Hart would train three days a week at B.J's Gym in Calgary, which was owned by his brother-in-law B.J. Annis.\n\nOn February 1, 2016, Hart announced through a Facebook post that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. Jim Ross claimed on March 2, 2016 that Hart had beaten the disease following successful surgery and that it appeared not to have spread to other areas of his body. Hart responded to Jim Ross' comments through Facebook saying that although the surgery was a success and that he and his doctors were optimistic, he would continue to be monitored every three months by doctors until he can actually be cancer free.\n\nIn October 1993, Bret Hart gave a radio interview in which he said Ric Flair \"sucks\", and described his workplace, WCW, as \"minor league\". In his autobiography, Flair criticized Hart for exploiting the death of his brother, Owen Hart, and the controversy surrounding the Montreal Screwjob. Flair also claimed in his autobiography that, despite Hart's popularity in Canada, he was not a formidable money-making draw in the United States, a claim which Hart dismissed as \"plain ridiculous\" in a column written for the \"Calgary Sun\". Hart claimed that he drew greater revenue than Flair, citing his headlining performances on consistently sold-out tours throughout his WWF career, while Flair wrestled to allegedly near-empty arenas. He also criticized Flair on what he perceived as insults to fellow wrestlers Mick Foley and Randy Savage. Hart did acknowledge a decline in the WWF's popularity during the mid-1990s, but he, and others, felt that this was largely attributed to the WWF's well-publicised sex and steroid scandals, as well as WCW's acquisition of former top WWE stars. Hart also took aim at Flair in his autobiography, criticizing his in-ring talents and what Hart perceived as Flair's unsubtle blading.\n\nFlair and Hart have since reconciled and are now friends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrint\n\nFilm\n\nBiographies\n\nDocumentaries\n\nRadio\n\nVideos\n\nInterviews\n\nArticles\n\n"

                "Richard and Maurice McDonald\n\nRichard and Maurice McDonald were the founders of the original McDonald’s restaurant in San Bernardino, California and inventors of the ‘Speedee Service System’.\n\nIn 1937, the McDonald brothers opened a hot dog stand in Monrovia, California, inspired by a local hot dog stand that seemed to be the only profitable business in town, and which primarily served patrons at a local racetrack. However, the stand had few customers after racing season ended.\n\nMaurice decided to open a bigger hot dog stand in San Bernardino, a large working-class town approximately 50 miles eastward, with a population of approximately 100,000 people. After several banks declined to lend them the money needed for this venture, Bank of America finally approved, and in 1940, with $5,000 in capital, they opened a drive-in restaurant on the corner of 1398 North E Street and West 14th Street().\n\nThe new restaurant proved a surprise success and the brothers were soon making $40,000 a year. Most customers were teenage or young adult males in their 20s who came there primarily to flirt with the carhop young women, or young working families looking for a cheap meal. The McDonald brothers decided that the latter were the ideal customer they wanted to attract.\n\nAfter a couple years in business, the brothers began making plans to renovate their business model based on the lessons they had learned. One of these involved finding a more efficient way to service customers than the carhop young women, who were very slow, unreliable workers who spent too much time flirting with customers to increase their tips. Another was that hamburgers accounted for a large proportion of total sales. The griddles were much easier to clean than grills and burgers were faster to assemble than sandwiches.\n\nIn 1948, the brothers fully redesigned and rebuilt their restaurant in San Bernardino to focus on hamburgers, milk shakes, and french fries. While this new \"McDonald's\", situated at the same address, was still premised on most customers arriving by car, its design was unique due to a combination of factors:\n\nThe new restaurant was a success, and with the goal of making $1 million before they turned 50, the McDonald brothers began franchising their system in 1953, beginning with a restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona operated by Neil Fox. At first they only franchised the system, rather than the name of their restaurant. Later, the brothers started franchising the entire concept, with restaurants built to a standard design, created by Fontana, California architect Stanley Clark Meston, and featuring Richard's suggestion of the paired Golden Arches, which formed an \"M\" when viewed from an angle.\n\nIn 1954, the McDonald brothers partnered with Ray Kroc. The franchiser took 1.9 percent of the gross sales, of which the McDonald brothers got 0.5 percent. The brothers wished to maintain only a small number of restaurants, which conflicted with Kroc's goals. Ray Kroc eventually bought them out.\n\nOn November 30, 1984, Richard McDonald – the first cook behind the grill of a McDonald's – was served the ceremonial 50,000,000,000th (50 billionth) McDonald's hamburger by Ed Rensi, then president of McDonald's USA, at the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York City.\n\nMaurice McDonald died from heart failure in Riverside, California, on December 11, 1971, at the age of 69. He was buried at the Desert Memorial Park, in Cathedral City, California.\n\nRichard McDonald died in Manchester, New Hampshire, on July 14, 1998, at the age of 89 and was buried at the Mount Calvary Cemetery in Manchester. His wife Dorothy died soon after. They were survived by Dorothy's son, Gale French.\n\nIn the 2016 film \"The Founder\", Richard McDonald is played by Nick Offerman, and John Carroll Lynch portrays Maurice McDonald.\n",
                "McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's is a fast food company that was founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand. The first time a McDonald's franchise used the Golden Arches logo was in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers. McDonald's had its original headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but has approved plans to move its global headquarters to Chicago by 2018.\n\nMcDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue, serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries across approximately 36,900 outlets as of 2016. Although McDonald's is known for its hamburgers, they also sell cheeseburgers, chicken products, french fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food, the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit. The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. According to a BBC report published in 2012, McDonald's is the world's second largest private employer (behind Walmart with 1.9 million employees), 1.5 million of whom work for franchises.\n\nThe siblings Richard and Maurice McDonald opened in 1940 the first McDonald's at 1398 North E Street at West 14th Street in San Bernardino, California (at ) but it was not the McDonald's recognizable today; Ray Kroc made changes to the brothers business that modernized it. The brothers introduced the \"Speedee Service System\" in 1948, putting into expanded use the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant that their predecessor White Castle had put into practice more than two decades earlier.. The original mascot of McDonald's was a chef hat on top of a hamburger who was referred to as \"Speedee\". In 1962, the Golden Arches replaced Speedee as the universal mascot. The symbol, Ronald McDonald, was introduced in 1965. The clown, Ronald McDonald, appeared in advertising to target their audience of children.\nOn May 4, 1961, McDonald's first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name \"McDonald's\" with the description \"Drive-In Restaurant Services\", which continues to be renewed. By September 13, 1961, McDonald's under the guidance of Ray Kroc, filed for a trademark on a new logo—an overlapping, double-arched \"M\" symbol. But before the double arches, McDonald's used the a single arch for the architecture of their buildings. Although the \"Golden Arches\" logo appeared in various forms, the present version was not used until November 18, 1968, when the company was favored a U.S. trademark.\n\nThe present corporation credits its founding to franchised businessman Ray Kroc in on April 15, 1955, this was in fact the ninth opened McDonald's restaurant overall; although this location was destroyed and rebuilt in 1984. Kroc later purchased the McDonald brothers' equity in the company and begun the companies worldwide reach. Kroc was recorded as being an aggressive business partner, driving the McDonald brothers out of the industry.\n\nKroc and the McDonald brothers fought for control of the business, as documented in Kroc's autobiography. The San Bernardino restaurant was eventually torn down (1971, according to Juan Pollo) and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo chain in 1976. This area now serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, and a McDonald's and Route 66 museum. With the expansion of McDonald's into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life. Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics, and consumer responsibility.\n\nMcDonald's restaurants are found in 120 countries and territories around the world and serve 68 million customers each day. McDonald's operates 36,899 restaurants worldwide, employing more than 375,000 people as of the end of 2016. There are currently a total of 5,669 company-owned locations and 31,230 franchised locations, which includes 21,559 locations franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,300 locations licensed to developmental licensees, and 3,371 locations licensed to foreign affiliates, primarily Japan.\n\nFocusing on its core brand, McDonald's began divesting itself of other chains it had acquired during the 1990s. The company owned a majority stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill until October 2006, when McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle through a stock exchange. Until December 2003, it also owned Donatos Pizza, and it owned a small share of Aroma Cafe from 1999 to 2001. On August 27, 2007, McDonald's sold Boston Market to Sun Capital Partners.\n\nNotably, McDonald's has increased shareholder dividends for 25 consecutive years, making it one of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. In October 2012, its monthly sales fell for the first time in nine years. In 2014, its quarterly sales fell for the first time in seventeen years, when its sales dropped for the entirety of 1997.\n\nIn the United States, it is reported that drive-throughs account for 70 percent of sales. McDonald's closed down 184 restaurants in the United States in 2015, which was 59 more than what they planned to open. This move was also the first time McDonald's had a net decrease in the number of locations in the United States since 1970.\n\nThe company currently owns all the land, valued at an estimated $16 to $18 billion, on which its restaurants are situated. The company earns a significant portion of its revenue from rental payments from franchisees. These rent payments rose 26 percent between 2010 and 2015, accounting for one-fifth of the company's total revenue at the end of the period. In recent times, there have been calls to spin off the company's US holdings into a potential real estate investment trust, but the company announced at its investor conference on November 10, 2015, that this would not happen. The CEO, Steve Easterbrook discussed that pursuing the REIT option would pose too large a risk to the company's business model.\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland business model is different from the U.S, in that fewer than 30 percent of restaurants are franchised, with the majority under the ownership of the company. McDonald's trains its franchisees and management at Hamburger University in Oak Brook, Illinois. In other countries, McDonald's restaurants are operated by joint ventures of McDonald's Corporation and other, local entities or governments.\n\nAccording to \"Fast Food Nation\" by Eric Schlosser (2001), nearly one in eight workers in the U.S. have at some time been employed by McDonald's. Employees are encouraged by McDonald's Corp. to maintain their health by singing along to their favorite songs in order to relieve stress, attending church services in order to have a lower blood pressure, and taking two vacations annually in order to reduce risk for myocardial infarction. \"Fast Food Nation\" also states that McDonald's is the largest private operator of playgrounds in the U.S., as well as the single largest purchaser of beef, pork, potatoes, and apples. The selection of meats McDonald's uses varies to some extent based on the culture of the host country.\n\nThe McDonald's headquarters complex, McDonald's Plaza, is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. It sits on the site of the former headquarters and stabling area of Paul Butler, the founder of Oak Brook. McDonald's moved into the Oak Brook facility from an office within the Chicago Loop in 1971.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, McDonald's confirmed plans to move its global headquarters to Chicago's West Loop neighborhood in the Near West Side. The 608,000-square-foot structure will be built on the former site of Harpo Productions (where the \"Oprah Winfrey Show\" and several other Harpo productions taped) and open in early 2018.\n\nAs of November 2014, the board of directors had the following members:\n\nOn March 1, 2015, after being chief brand officer of McDonald's and its former head in the UK and northern Europe, Steve Easterbrook became CEO, succeeding Don Thompson, who stepped down on January 28, 2015.\n\nMcDonald's has become emblematic of globalization, sometimes referred to as the \"McDonaldization\" of society. \"The Economist\" newspaper uses the \"Big Mac Index\": the comparison of a Big Mac's cost in various world currencies can be used to informally judge these currencies' purchasing power parity. Switzerland has the most expensive Big Mac in the world as of July 2015, while the country with the least expensive Big Mac is India (albeit for a Maharaja Mac—the next cheapest Big Mac is Hong Kong).\n\nThomas Friedman once said that no country with a McDonald's had gone to war with another. However, the \"Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention\" is not strictly true. Exceptions are the 1989 United States invasion of Panama, NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999, the 2006 Lebanon War, and the 2008 South Ossetia war. McDonald's suspended operations in its corporate-owned stores in Crimea after Russia annexed the region in 2014. On August 20, 2014, as tensions between the United States and Russia strained over events in Ukraine, and the resultant U.S. sanctions, the Russian government temporarily shut down four McDonald's outlets in Moscow, citing sanitary concerns. The company has operated in Russia since 1990 and at August 2014 had 438 stores across the country. On August 23, 2014, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich ruled out any government move to ban McDonald's and dismissed the notion that the temporary closures had anything to do with the sanctions.\n\nSome observers have suggested that the company should be given credit for increasing the standard of service in markets that it enters. A group of anthropologists in a study entitled \"Golden Arches East\" looked at the impact McDonald's had on East Asia and Hong Kong, in particular. When it opened in Hong Kong in 1975, McDonald's was the first restaurant to consistently offer clean restrooms, driving customers to demand the same of other restaurants and institutions. McDonald's has taken to partnering up with Sinopec, the second largest oil company in the People's Republic of China, as it takes advantage of the country's growing use of personal vehicles by opening numerous drive-thru restaurants. McDonald's has opened a McDonald's restaurant and McCafé on the underground premises of the French fine arts museum, The Louvre.\n\nThe company stated it would open vegetarian-only restaurants in India by mid-2013. Foreign restaurants are banned in Bermuda, with the exception of KFC, which was present before the current law was passed. Therefore, there are no McDonald's in Bermuda.\n\nOn January 9, 2017, 80% of the franchise rights in the mainland China and in Hong Kong were sold for US$2.080 billion to a consortium of CITIC Limited (for 32%) and private equity funds managed by CITIC Capital (for 20%) and Carlyle (for 20%), which CITIC Limited and CITIC Capital would also formed a joint venture to own the stake.\n\nMcDonald's predominantly sells hamburgers, various types of chicken, chicken sandwiches, French fries, soft drinks, breakfast items, and desserts. In most markets, McDonald's offers salads and vegetarian items, wraps and other localized fare. On a seasonal basis, McDonald's offers the McRib sandwich. Some speculate the seasonality of the McRib adds to its appeal.\n\nProducts are offered as either \"eat-in\" (where the customer opts to eat in the restaurant) or \"take-out\" (where the customer opts to take the food for consumption off the premises). \"Eat-in\" meals are provided on a plastic tray with a paper insert on the floor of the tray. \"Take-out\" meals are usually delivered with the contents enclosed in a distinctive McDonald's-branded brown paper bag. In both cases, the individual items are wrapped or boxed as appropriate.\n\nSince Steve Easterbrook became CEO of the company, McDonald's has streamlined the menu which in the United States contained nearly 200 items. The company has also looked to introduce healthier options, and removed high-fructose corn syrup from hamburger buns. The company has also removed artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets, replacing chicken skin, safflower oil and citric acid found in Chicken McNuggets with pea starch, rice starch and powdered lemon juice.\n\nRestaurants in several countries, particularly in Asia, serve soup. This local deviation from the standard menu is a characteristic for which the chain is particularly known, and one which is employed either to abide by regional food taboos (such as the religious prohibition of beef consumption in India) or to make available foods with which the regional market is more familiar (such as the sale of McRice in Indonesia, or Ebi (prawn) Burger in Singapore and Japan).\n\nIn Germany and some other Western European countries, McDonald's sells beer. In New Zealand, McDonald's sells meat pies, after the local affiliate partially relaunched the Georgie Pie fast food chain it bought out in 1996.\n\nIn the United States, after limited trials on a regional basis, McDonald's plans to offer an all-day breakfast menu whenever its restaurants are open, although eggs cannot be cooked at the same time on the same equipment as hamburgers due to different temperature requirements.\n\nMost standalone McDonald's restaurants offer both counter service and drive-through service, with indoor and sometimes outdoor seating. Drive-Thru, Auto-Mac, Pay and Drive, or \"McDrive\" as it is known in many countries, often has separate stations for placing, paying for, and picking up orders, though the latter two steps are frequently combined; it was first introduced in Arizona in 1975, following the lead of other fast-food chains. The first such restaurant in Britain opened at Fallowfield, Manchester in 1986.\n\nIn some countries, \"McDrive\" locations near highways offer no counter service or seating. In contrast, locations in high-density city neighborhoods often omit drive-through service. There are also a few locations, located mostly in downtown districts, that offer a \"Walk-Thru\" service in place of Drive-Thru.\n\nMcCafé is a café-style accompaniment to McDonald's restaurants and is a concept created by McDonald's Australia (also known, and marketed, as \"Macca's\" in Australia), starting with Melbourne in 1993. As of 2016, most McDonald's in Australia have McCafés located within the existing McDonald's restaurant. In Tasmania, there are McCafés in every restaurant, with the rest of the states quickly following suit. After upgrading to the new McCafé look and feel, some Australian restaurants have noticed up to a 60 percent increase in sales. At the end of 2003, there were over 600 McCafés worldwide.\n\nFrom 2015–2016, McDonald's tried a new gourmet burger service/restaurant concept based on other gourmet restaurants such as \"Shake Shack\" and \"Grill'd\". It was rolled out for the first time in Australia during the early months of 2015 and expanded to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Arabia and New Zealand, with ongoing trials in the US market. In dedicated \"Create Your Taste\" (CYT) kiosks, customers could choose all ingredients including type of bun and meat along with optional extras. In late 2015 the Australian CYT service introduced CYT salads.\n\nAfter a person had ordered, McDonald's advised that wait times were between 10–15 minutes. When the food was ready, trained crew ('hosts') brought the food to the customer's table. Instead of McDonald's usual cardboard and plastic packaging, CYT food was presented on wooden boards, fries in wire baskets and salads in china bowls with metal cutlery. A higher price applied.\n\nIn November 2016, Create Your Taste was replaced by a \"Signature Crafted Recipes\" program designed to be more efficient and less expensive.\n\nSome locations are connected to gas stations/convenience stores, while others called McExpress have limited seating and/or menu or may be located in a shopping mall. Other McDonald's are located in Walmart stores. McStop is a location targeted at truckers and travelers which may have services found at truck stops.\n\nIn Sweden, customers who order a happy meal can use the meal's container for a pair of happy goggles. The company created a game for the goggles known as \"Slope Stars.\" McDonald's predicts happy goggles will continue in other countries. In the Netherlands, McDonald's has introduced McTrax that doubles as a recording studio; it reacts to touch. They can create their own beats with a synth and tweak sounds with special effects.\n\nThe first kosher McDonald's was established in 1997 at the Abasto de Buenos Aires mall in Buenos Aires, Argentina. There are also many kosher branches in Israel.\n\nMcDonald's playgrounds are called McDonald's PlayPlace. Some McDonald's in suburban areas and certain cities feature large indoor or outdoor playgrounds. The first PlayPlace with the familiar crawl-tube design with ball pits and slides was introduced in 1987 in the US, with many more being constructed soon after.\n\nMcDonald's Next use open-concept design and offer \"Create Your Taste\" digital ordering. The concept store also offering free mobile device charging and table service after 6:00 pm. The first store open in Hong Kong in December 2015.\n\nIn 2006, McDonald's introduced its \"Forever Young\" brand by redesigning all of its restaurants, the first major redesign since the 1970s.\n\nThe goal of the redesign is to be more like a coffee shop, similar to Starbucks. The design includes wooden tables, faux-leather chairs, and muted colors; the red was muted to terracotta, the yellow was shifted to golden for a more \"sunny\" look, and olive and sage green were also added.\n\nTo create a warmer look, the restaurants have less plastic and more brick and wood, with modern hanging lights to produce a softer glow. Many restaurants now feature free Wi-Fi and flat-screen TVs. Other upgrades include double drive-thrus, flat roofs instead of the angled red roofs, and replacing fiber glass with wood. Also, instead of the familiar golden arches, the restaurants now feature \"semi-swooshes\" (half of a golden arch), similar to the Nike swoosh.\n\nMcDonald's began banning smoking in 1994 when it banned smoking within its 1,400 wholly owned restaurants.\n\nSince the late 1990s, McDonald's has attempted to replace employees with electronic kiosks which would perform actions such taking orders and accepting money. In 1999, McDonald's first tested \"E-Clerks\" in suburban Chicago, Illinois, and Wyoming, Michigan, with the devices being able to \"save money on live staffers\" and attracting larger purchase amounts than average employees.\n\nIn 2013, the University of Oxford estimated that in the succeeding decades, there was a 92% probability of food preparation and serving to become automated in fast food establishments. By 2016, McDonald's \"Create Your Taste\" electronic kiosks were seen in some restaurants internationally where customers could custom order meals. As employees pushed for higher wages in the late-2010s, some believed that fast food companies such as McDonald's would use the devices to cut costs for employing individuals.\n\nOn August 5, 2013, \"The Guardian\" revealed that 90 percent of McDonald's UK workforce are on zero hour contracts, making it possibly the largest such private sector employer in the country. A study released by Fast Food Forward conducted by Anzalone Liszt Grove Research showed that approximately 84 percent of all fast food employees working in New York City in April 2013 had been paid less than their legal wages by their employers.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, fast food workers in the US drew an average of $7 billion of public assistance annually resulting from receiving low wages. The McResource website advised employees to break their food into smaller pieces to feel fuller, seek refunds for unopened holiday purchases, sell possessions online for quick cash, and to \"quit complaining\" as \"stress hormone levels rise by 15 percent after ten minutes of complaining.\" In December 2013, McDonald's shut down the McResource website amidst negative publicity and criticism. McDonald's plans to continue an internal telephone help line through which its employees can obtain advice on work and life problems.\n\nLiberal thinktank the Roosevelt Institute accuses some McDonald's restaurants of actually paying less than the minimum wage to entry positions due to 'rampant' wage theft. In South Korea, McDonald's pays part-time employees $5.50 an hour and is accused of paying less with arbitrary schedules adjustments and pay delays. In late 2015, Anonymous aggregated data collected by Glassdoor suggests that McDonald's in the United States pays entry-level employees between $7.25 an hour and $11 an hour, with an average of $8.69 an hour. Shift managers get paid an average of $10.34 an hour. Assistant managers get paid an average of $11.57 an hour. McDonald's CEO, Steve Easterbrook, currently earns an annual salary of $1,100,000.\n\nMcDonald's workers have on occasions decided to strike over pay, with most of the employees on strike seeking to be paid $15.00. When interviewed about the strikes occurring, former McDonald's CEO Ed Rensi stated: \"It's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who's inefficient making $15 an hour bagging french fries\" with Rensi explaining that increasing employee wages could possibly take away from entry-level jobs. However, according to Easterbrook, increasing wages and benefits for workers saw a 6% increase in customer satisfaction when comparing 2015's first quarter data to the first quarter of 2016, with greater returns seen as a result.\n\nIn September 2017, two British McDonald's stores agreed to a strike over zero hours contracts for staff. Picket lines were formed around the two stores in Crayford and Cambridge. The strike was supported by the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nIn March 2015, McDonald's workers in 19 US cities filed 28 health and safety complaints with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration which allege that low staffing, lack of protective gear, poor training and pressure to work fast has resulted in injuries. The complaints also allege that, because of a lack of first aid supplies, workers were told by management to treat burn injuries with condiments such as mayonnaise and mustard. The Fight for $15 labor organization aided the workers in filing the complaints.\n\nIn 2015, McDonald's pledged to stop using eggs from battery cage facilities by 2025. Since McDonald's purchases over 2 billion eggs per year or 4 percent of eggs produced in the United States, the switch is expected to have a major impact on the egg industry and is part of a general trend toward cage-free eggs driven by consumer concern over the harsh living conditions of hens. The aviary systems from which the new eggs will be sourced are troubled by much higher mortality rates, as well as introducing environmental and worker safety problems. The high hen mortality rate, which is more than double that of battery cage systems, will require new research to mitigate. The facilities also have higher ammonia levels due to faeces being kicked up into the air. Producers raised concerns about the production cost, which is expected to increase by 36 percent.\n\nMcDonald's continues to source pork from facilities that use gestation crates, and in 2012 pledged to phase them out.\n\nMcDonald's has for decades maintained an extensive advertising campaign. In addition to the usual media (television, radio, and newspaper), the company makes significant use of billboards and signage, sponsors sporting events ranging from Little League to the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games. Television has played a central role in the company's advertising strategy. To date, McDonald's has used 23 different slogans in United States advertising, as well as a few other slogans for select countries and regions.\n\nMcDonald's and NASA explored an advertising agreement for a planned mission to the asteroid 449 Hamburga; however, the spacecraft was eventually cancelled.\n\nMcDonald's is the title sponsor of the McDonald's All-American Game, all-star basketball games played each year for American and Canadian boys' and girls' high school basketball graduates.\n\nMcHappy Day is an annual event at McDonald's, where a percentage of the day's sales go to charity. It is the signature fundraising event for Ronald McDonald House Charities.\n\nIn 2007, it was celebrated in 17 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, the United States, Finland, France, Guatemala, Hungary, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Uruguay.\n\nAccording to the Australian McHappy Day website, McHappy Day raised $20.4 million in 2009. The goal for 2010 was $20.8 million.\n\nIn 1995, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital received an anonymous letter postmarked in Dallas, Texas, containing a $1 million winning McDonald's Monopoly game piece. McDonald's officials came to the hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, who examined the card under a jeweler's eyepiece, handled it with plastic gloves, and verified it as a winner. Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, McDonald's waived the rule and has made the annual $50,000 annuity payments, even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald's (see McDonald's Monopoly).\n\nMcRefugees are poor people in Hong Kong, Japan, and China who use McDonald's 24-hour restaurants as a temporary hostel. One in five of Hong Kong's population lives below the poverty line. The rise of McRefugees was first documented by photographer Suraj Katra in 2013.\n\nIn 1990, activists from a small group known as London Greenpeace (no connection to the international group Greenpeace) distributed leaflets entitled \"What's wrong with McDonald's?\", criticizing its environmental, health, and labor record. The corporation wrote to the group demanding they desist and apologize, and, when two of the activists refused to back down, sued them for libel in one of the longest cases in British civil law. A documentary film of the McLibel Trial has been shown in several countries.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Phil Sokolof, a millionaire businessman who had suffered a heart attack at the age of 43, took out full-page newspaper ads in New York, Chicago, and other large cities accusing McDonald's menu of being a threat to American health, and asking them to stop using beef tallow to cook their french fries.\n\nDespite the objections of McDonald's, the term \"McJob\" was added to \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\" in 2003. The term was defined as \"a low-paying job that requires little skill and provides little opportunity for advancement\".\n\nIn 2001, Eric Schlosser's book \"Fast Food Nation\" included criticism of the business practices of McDonald's. Among the critiques were allegations that McDonald's (along with other companies within the fast food industry) uses its political influence to increase its profits at the expense of people's health and the social conditions of its workers. The book also brought into question McDonald's advertisement techniques in which it targets children. While the book did mention other fast-food chains, it focused primarily on McDonald's.\n\nIn 2002, vegetarian groups, largely Hindu and Buddhist, successfully sued McDonald's for misrepresenting its French fries as vegetarian, when they contained beef broth.\n\nMorgan Spurlock's 2004 documentary film \"Super Size Me\" claimed that McDonald's food was contributing to the increase of obesity in society and that the company was failing to provide nutritional information about its food for its customers. Six weeks after the film premiered, McDonald's announced that it was eliminating the super size option, and was creating the adult Happy Meal.\nIn 2006, an unsanctioned McDonald's Videogame was released online. It is parody of the business practices of the corporate giant, taking the guise of a tycoon style business simulation game. In the game, the player plays the role of a McDonald's CEO, choosing whether or not to use controversial practices like genetically altered cow feed, plowing over rainforests, and corrupting public officials. McDonald's issued a statement distancing itself from the game.\n\nIn January 2014, it was reported that McDonald's was accused of having used a series of tax maneuvers to avoid taxes in France. The company confirmed that tax authorities had visited McDonald's French headquarters in Paris but insisted that it had not done anything wrong, saying, \"McDonald's firmly denies the accusation made by L'Express according to which McDonald's supposedly hid part of its revenue from taxes in France.\"\n\nIn response to public pressure, McDonald's has sought to include more healthy choices in its menu and has introduced a new slogan to its recruitment posters: \"Not bad for a McJob\". The word McJob, first attested in the mid-1980s and later popularized by Canadian novelist Douglas Coupland in his book \"\", has become a buzz word for low-paid, unskilled work with few prospects or benefits and little security. McDonald's disputes this definition of McJob. In 2007, the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan \"Would you like a career with that?\" on Irish television, asserting that its jobs have good prospects.\n\nIn an effort to respond to growing consumer awareness of food provenance, the fast-food chain changed its supplier of both coffee beans and milk. UK chief executive Steve Easterbrook said: \"British consumers are increasingly interested in the quality, sourcing, and ethics of the food and drink they buy\". In a bid to tap into the ethical consumer market, McDonald's switched to using coffee beans taken from stocks that are certified by the Rainforest Alliance, a conservation group. Additionally, in response to pressure, McDonald's UK started using organic milk supplies for its bottled milk and hot drinks, although it still uses conventional milk in its milkshakes, and in all of its dairy products in the United States. According to a report published by \"Farmers Weekly\" in 2007, the quantity of milk used by McDonald's could have accounted for as much as 5 percent of the UK's organic milk output.\n\nMcDonald's announced on May 22, 2008, that, in the United States and Canada, it would switch to using cooking oil that contains no trans fats for its french fries, and canola-based oil with corn and soy oils, for its baked items, pies and cookies, by year's end.\n\nWith regard to acquiring chickens from suppliers who use CAK/CAS methods of slaughter, McDonald's says that it needs to see more research \"to help determine whether any CAS system in current use is optimal from an animal welfare perspective.\"\n\nIn April 2008, McDonald's announced that 11 of its Sheffield, England restaurants have been engaged in a biomass trial that had cut its waste and carbon footprint by half in the area. In this trial, wastes from the restaurants were collected by Veolia Environmental Services and were used to produce energy at a power plant. McDonald's plans to expand this project, although the lack of biomass power plants in the United States will prevent this plan from becoming a national standard anytime soon. In addition, in Europe, McDonald's has been recycling vegetable grease by converting it to fuel for its diesel trucks.\n\nMcDonald's has been using a corn-based bioplastic to produce containers for some of its products. The environmental benefits of this technology are controversial, with critics noting that biodegradation is slow, produces greenhouse gases and that contamination of traditional plastic waste streams with bioplastics can complicate recycling efforts.\n\nIn 1990, McDonald's worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to stop using \"clam shell\" shaped styrofoam food containers to house its food products. 20 years later, McDonald's announced they would try replacing styrofoam coffee cups with an alternative material.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized McDonald's continuous effort to reduce solid waste by designing more efficient packaging and by promoting the use of recycled-content materials. McDonald's reports that it is committed towards environmental leadership by effectively managing electric energy, by conserving natural resources through recycling and reusing materials, and by addressing water management issues within the restaurant.\n\nIn an effort to reduce energy usage by 25 percent in its restaurants, McDonald's opened a prototype restaurant in Chicago in 2009 with the intention of using the model in its other restaurants throughout the world. Building on past efforts, specifically a restaurant it opened in Sweden in 2000 that was the first to intentionally incorporate green ideas, McDonald's designed the Chicago site to save energy by incorporating old and new ideas such as managing storm water, using skylights for more natural lighting and installing some partitions and tabletops made from recycled goods.\n\nWhen McDonald's received criticism for its environmental policies in the 1970s, it began to make substantial progress in reducing its use of materials. For instance, an \"average meal\" in the 1970s—a Big Mac, fries, and a drink—required 46 grams of packaging; today, it requires only 25 grams, allowing a 46 percent reduction. In addition, McDonald's eliminated the need for intermediate containers for cola by having a delivery system that pumps syrup directly from the delivery truck into storage containers, saving of packaging annually. Overall, weight reductions in packaging and products, as well as the increased usage of bulk packaging ultimately decreased packaging by annually.\n\nMcDonald's has been involved in a number of lawsuits and other legal cases, most of which involved trademark disputes. The company has threatened many food businesses with legal action unless it drops the Mc or Mac from trading names.\n\nOn September 8, 2009, McDonald's Malaysian operations lost a lawsuit to prevent another restaurant calling itself McCurry. McDonald's lost in an appeal to Malaysia's highest court, the Federal Court.\n\nIn April 2007, in Perth, Western Australia, McDonald's pleaded guilty to five charges relating to the employment of children under 15 in one of its outlets and was fined A$8,000.\n\nIn 2016, the Australian Taxation Office revealed that McDonald's Asia-Pacific Consortium had generated $478 million in revenue in 2013–14, but had paid no tax on those earnings whatsoever.\n\nMcDonald's has defended itself in several cases involving workers' rights.\n\nThe longest running legal action of all time in the UK was the McLibel case against 2 defendants who criticized a number of aspects of the company. The trial lasted 10 years and called 130 witnesses. The European Court of Human Rights deemed that the unequal resources of the litigants breached the defendants rights to freedom of speech and biased the trial. The result was widely seen as a \"PR disaster.\"\n\nA famous legal case in the US involving McDonald's was the 1994 decision in \"Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants\" where Stella Liebeck was awarded several million dollars after she suffered third-degree burns after spilling a scalding cup of McDonald's coffee on herself.\n\nIn April 2014, it was reported that McDonald's in Europe will use chicken meat that was produced by using genetically modified animal feed. Greenpeace argues that McDonald's saves less than one Eurocent for each chicken burger and goes down a path not desired by its customers.\n\n\n\n",
                "History of McDonald's\n\nThis history of McDonald's is an overview of the original restaurant and of the chain.\n\nThe McDonald family moved from Manchester, New Hampshire to Hollywood, California in the late 1930s, where brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald began working as set movers and handymen at Motion-Picture studios. In 1937, their father Patrick McDonald opened \"The Airdrome\", a food stand, on Huntington Drive (Route 66) near the Monrovia Airport in the Los Angeles County city of Monrovia, California with hot dogs being one of the first items sold. Hamburgers were later added to the menu at a cost of ten cents with all-you-can-drink orange juice at five cents. In 1940, Maurice and Richard (\"Mac\" and \"Dick\") moved the entire building east, to West 14th and 1398 North E Streets in San Bernardino, California. The restaurant was renamed \"McDonald's Bar-B-Que\" and had 25 menu items, mostly barbecue.\n\nIn October 1948, after the McDonald brothers realized that most of their profits came from selling hamburgers, they closed down their successful carhop drive-in to establish a streamlined system with a simple menu which consisted of only hamburgers, cheeseburgers, potato chips, coffee, soft drinks, and apple pie. After the first year, potato chips and pie were swapped out for french fries and milkshakes. The carhops were eliminated, making the new restaurant a self-service operation. Richard and Maurice took great care in setting up their kitchen like an assembly line to ensure maximum efficiency. The restaurant's name was changed again, this time to simply \"McDonald's,\" and reopened on December 12, 1948.\n\nIn April 1952, the brothers decided they needed an entirely new building in order to achieve two goals: further efficiency improvements, and a more eye-catching appearance. They collected recommendations for an architect and interviewed at least four, finally choosing Stanley Clark Meston, an architect practicing in nearby Fontana. The brothers and Meston worked together closely in the design of their new building. They achieved the extra efficiencies they needed by, among other things, drawing the actual measurements of every piece of equipment in chalk on a tennis court behind the McDonald house (with Meston's assistant Charles Fish). The new restaurant's design achieved a high level of noticeability thanks to gleaming surfaces of red and white ceramic tile, stainless steel, brightly colored sheet metal, and glass; pulsing red, white, yellow, and green neon; and two 25-foot yellow sheet-metal arches trimmed in neon, called \"golden arches\" even at the design stage. A third, smaller arch sign at the roadside hosted a pudgy character in a chef's hat, known as Speedee, striding across the top, trimmed in animated neon. Further marketing techniques were implemented to change McDonald's from a sit down restaurant to a fast food chain. They used such things as turning off the heating to prevent people wanting to stay so long, fixed and angled seating so the customer would sit over their food promoting them to eat faster, spreading the seats further apart so being less of a sociable place to dine in, and giving their customers branded cone shaped cups forcing them to hold their drink whilst eating which would speed up the eating process. Many other companies followed McDonald's strategies to turn their own restaurants into fast food establishments including Burger King, White Castle and Subway.\n\nIn late 1953, with only a rendering of Meston's design in hand, the brothers began seeking franchisees. Their first franchisee was Neil Fox, a distributor for General Petroleum Corporation. Fox's stand, the first with Meston's golden arches design, opened in May 1953 at Central Avenue and Indian School Road in Phoenix, Arizona. Their second franchisee was the team of Fox's brother-in-law Roger Williams and Burdette \"Bud\" Landon, both of whom also worked for General Petroleum. Williams and Landon opened their stand on August 18, 1953 at 10207 Lakewood Boulevard in Downey, California. The Downey stand has the distinction of being the oldest surviving McDonald's restaurant. The Downey stand was never required to comply with the McDonald's Corporation's remodeling and updating requests over the years because it was franchised not by the McDonald's Corporation, but by the McDonald brothers themselves to Williams and Landon.\nIn 1954, Ray Kroc, a seller of Prince Castle brand Multimixer milkshake machines, learned that the McDonald brothers were using eight of his machines in their San Bernardino restaurant. His curiosity was piqued, and he went to take a look at the restaurant. He was joined by good friend Charles Lewis who had suggested to Kroc several improvements to the McDonald's burger recipe.\n\nBelieving the McDonald's formula was a ticket to success, Kroc suggested they franchise their restaurants throughout the country. The brothers were skeptical, however, that the self-service approach could succeed in colder, rainier climates; furthermore, their thriving business in San Bernardino, and franchises already operating or planned, made them reluctant to risk a national venture. Kroc offered to take the major responsibility for setting up the new franchises elsewhere. He returned to his home outside of Chicago with rights to set up McDonald's restaurants throughout the country, except in a handful of territories in California and Arizona already licensed by the McDonald brothers. The brothers were to receive one-half of one percent of gross sales. Kroc's first McDonald's restaurant opened on April 15, 1955, at 400 North Lee Street in Des Plaines, Illinois, near Chicago. The Des Plaines interior and exterior was painted by master painter Eugene Wright, who owned Wright's Decorating Service. Eugene was asked to come up with a color scheme and he chose yellow and white, with dark brown and red being secondary trim colors. Those colors would go on to become the colors of all McDonald's franchises. (Recognizing its historic and nostalgic value, in 1990 the McDonald's Corporation acquired the stand and rehabilitated it to a modern but nearly original condition, and then built an adjacent museum and gift shop to commemorate the site.)\nOnce the Des Plaines restaurant had become operational, Kroc sought franchisees for his McDonald's chain. The first snag came quickly. In 1956 he discovered that the McDonald brothers had licensed the franchise rights for Cook County, Illinois to the Frejlach Ice Cream Company. Kroc was incensed that the McDonald's had not informed him of this arrangement. He purchased the rights back for $25,000 ($ today), five times what the Frejlacks had originally paid, and pressed forward. McDonald's grew slowly for its first three years. By 1958, there were 34 restaurants. In 1959, however, Kroc opened 68 new restaurants, bringing the total to 102 locations.\n\nIn 1960, the McDonald's advertising campaign \"Look for the Golden Arches\" gave sales a big boost. Kroc believed that advertising was an investment that would in the end come back many times over, and advertising has always played a key role in the development of the McDonald's Corporation. In 1962, McDonald's introduced its now world-famous Golden Arches logo. A year later, the company sold its millionth hamburger and introduced Ronald McDonald, a red-haired clown designed to appeal to children.\n\nIn the early 1960s, McDonald's really began to take off. The growth in U.S. automobile use that came with suburbanization and the interstate highway system contributed heavily to McDonald's success. In 1961 Kroc bought out the McDonald brothers for $2.7 million, aiming at making McDonald's the number one fast-food chain in the country.\n\nOn May 3, 1960 Kroc assisted Christopher Boulos in opening a McDonald's franchise in DeKalb, Illinois. By 1965, the McDonald's at 805 W. Lincoln Highway sold over 4 million burgers and of fries. Boulos was the first Greek-American McDonald's franchise operator.\n\nIn 1965, McDonald's Corporation went public. Common shares were offered at $22.50 per share. By the end of the first day's trading, the price had risen to $30. A block of 100 shares purchased for $2,250 in 1965 was worth, after 12 stock splits (increasing the number of shares to 74,360), over $5.7 million as of year-end market close on December 31, 2010. In 1980, McDonald's Corporation became one of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nMcDonald's success in the 1960s was in large part due to the company's skillful marketing and flexible response to customer demand. In 1962, the Filet-O-Fish sandwich, billed as \"the fish that catches people\", was introduced in McDonald's restaurants. The new item had originally met with disapproval from Kroc, but after its successful test marketing, he eventually agreed to add it. Another item that Kroc had backed a year previously, a burger with a slice of pineapple and a slice of cheese, known as a \"hulaburger\", had flopped (both it and the Filet-O-Fish were developed in Catholic neighborhoods where burger sales dropped off markedly on Fridays and during Lent). The market was not quite ready for Kroc's taste; the hulaburger's tenure on the McDonald's menu board was short. In 1968 the now legendary Big Mac made its debut, and in 1969 McDonald's sold its five billionth hamburger. Two years later, as it launched the \"You Deserve a Break Today\" advertising campaign, McDonald's restaurants had reached all 50 states.\n\nIn 1968, McDonald's opened its 1,000th restaurant, and Fred L. Turner became the company's president and chief administrative officer. Kroc became chairman and remained CEO until 1973. Turner had originally intended to open a McDonald's franchise, but when he had problems with his backers over a location, he went to work as a grillman for Kroc in 1956. As operations vice president, Turner helped new franchisees get their stores up and running. He was constantly looking for new ways to perfect the McDonald's system, experimenting, for example, to determine the maximum number of hamburger patties one could stack in a box without squashing them and pointing out that seconds could be saved if McDonald's used buns that were presliced all the way through and were not stuck together in the package. Such attention to detail was one reason for the company's extraordinary success.\n\nBy the late 1960s, many of the candy-striped Golden Arches stores had been modified with enclosed walk-up order areas and limited indoor seating. In June 1969, McDonald's introduced a new \"mansard roof\" building design featuring indoor seating. The natural brick and cedar shake look mansards were a response to critics who berated McDonald's architecture as too garish. It became the standard for McDonald's restaurants, and franchise holders were ultimately required to demolish older restaurants and replace them with the new design. The first McDonald's restaurant using the \"mansard roof\" design opened that same year in the Chicago suburb of Matteson.\n\nMcDonald's spectacular growth continued in the 1970s. Americans were more on-the-go than ever, and fast service was a priority. In 1972, the company passed $1 billion in annual sales. By 1976, McDonald's had served 20 billion hamburgers, and system wide sales exceeded $3 billion.\n\nThe company pioneered breakfast fast food with the introduction of the Egg McMuffin in 1972 when market research indicated that a quick breakfast would be welcomed by consumers. Five years later McDonald's added a full breakfast line to the menu, and by 1987 one-fourth of all breakfasts eaten out in the United States came from McDonald's restaurants. In test market locations, such as New York City, McDonald's added a full breakfast line to its menus in 1975.\n\nKroc was a firm believer in giving \"something back into the community where you do business\". In 1974 McDonald's acted upon that philosophy in an original way by opening the first Ronald McDonald House, in Philadelphia, to provide a \"home away from home\" for the families of children in nearby hospitals. Twelve years after this first house opened, 100 similar Ronald McDonald Houses were in operation across the United States.\n\nThere was some skepticism in the company's phenomenal growth internationally. When Wally and Hugh Morris approached the corporation in 1974 to bring McDonald's into New Zealand, they were firmly shunned by Kroc, citing a visit to the country and saying \"There aren't any people... I never met a more dead-than-alive hole in my life.\" Persistence by the brothers eventually led to their request being granted in May 1975. They managed to negotiate a deal with the corporation by selling New Zealand cheese to the US to offset the high costs of importing plant equipment. The first New Zealand restaurant opened in June 1976 at Porirua, near Wellington, to much more success than the corporation predicted.\n\nIn 1975, McDonald's opened its first drive-thru window in Sierra Vista, Arizona, following Wendy's lead. This service gave Americans a fast, convenient way to procure a quick meal. The company's goal was to provide service in 50 seconds or less. Drive-thru sales eventually accounted for more than half of McDonald's systemwide sales. Meantime, the Happy Meal, a combo meal for children featuring a toy, was added to the menu in 1979. A period of aggressive advertising campaigns and price slashing in the early 1980s became known as the \"burger wars\". Burger King suggested to customers: \"have it your way\"; Wendy's offered itself as the \"fresh alternative\" and launched their \"Where's the beef?\" campaign. McDonald's sales and market still predominated, however.\n\nDuring the 1980s, a period of substantial expansion, McDonald's further diversified its menu to suit changing consumer tastes. The company introduced the McChicken in 1980; it proved to be a sales disappointment, and was replaced with Chicken McNuggets a year later (having originally been invented by Rene Arend in 1979). In 1985, ready-to-eat salads were introduced. Efficiency, combined with an expanded menu, continued to draw customers. McDonald's began to focus on urban centers and introduced new architectural styles.\n\nThe first McDonald's Express locations opened in 1991. These are smaller-scale prototypes, usually constructed in prefabricated buildings or urban storefronts, that do not feature certain menu items such as milkshakes and Quarter Pounders.\n\nIn 1992 Michael R. Quinlan became president of McDonald's Corporation, and Fred L. Turner became chairman. Quinlan, who took over as CEO in 1987, had started at McDonald's in the mail room in 1963, and gradually worked his way up. In his first year as CEO, the company opened 600 new restaurants.\n\nBy 1991, 37 percent of system-wide sales came from restaurants outside the United States. McDonald's opened its first foreign restaurant in British Columbia, Canada, in 1967. By the early 1990s the company had established itself in 58 foreign countries, and operated more than 3,600 restaurants outside the United States, through wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, and franchise agreements. Its strongest foreign markets were Japan, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Australia, and France.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, McDonald's, like other traditional employers of teenagers, was faced with a shortage of labor in the United States. The company met this challenge by being the first to entice retirees back into the workforce. Focusing on off-site training, it opened its Hamburger University in 1961 to train franchisees and corporate decision-makers. By 1990, more than 40,000 people had received \"Bachelor of Hamburgerology\" degrees from the Oak Brook, Illinois, facility. The corporation opened a Hamburger University in Tokyo in 1971, in Munich in 1975, and in London in 1982.\n\nBraille menus were first introduced in 1979, and picture menus in 1988. In March 1992, combination Braille and picture menus were reintroduced to accommodate those with vision, speech, or hearing impairments.\n\nClamshell grills, which cooked both sides of a hamburger simultaneously, were tested. New locations such as hospitals and military bases were tapped as sites for new restaurants. In response to the increase in microwave oven usage, McDonald's, whose name is the single most advertised brand name in the world, stepped up advertising and promotional expenditures stressing that its taste was superior to quick-packaged foods.\n\nThe first McDonald's in Mainland China opened in Dongmen, Shenzhen in October 1990.\n\nMcRecycle USA began in 1990 and included a commitment to purchase at least $100 million worth of recycled products annually for use in construction, remodeling, and equipping restaurants. Chairs, table bases, table tops, eating counters, table columns, waste receptacles, corrugated cartons, packaging, and washroom tissue were all made from recycled products. McDonald's worked with the U.S. Environmental Defense Fund to develop a comprehensive solid waste reduction program. Wrapping burgers in paper rather than plastic led to a 90 percent reduction in the wrapping material waste stream.\n\nIt took McDonald's 33 years to open its first 10,000 restaurants. The 10,000th unit opened in April 1988. Incredibly, the company reached the 20,000-restaurant mark in only eight more years, in mid-1996. By the end of 1997 the total had surpassed 23,000, and by that time McDonald's was opening 2,000 new restaurants each year, an average of five every day.\n\nMuch of the growth of the 1990s came outside the US, with international units increasing from about 3,600 in 1991 to more than 11,000 by 1998. The number of countries with McDonald's outlets nearly doubled from 59 in 1991 to 114 in late 1998. In 1993, a new region was added to the empire when the first McDonald's in the Middle East opened in Tel Aviv, Israel. As the company entered new markets, it showed increasing flexibility with respect to local food preferences and customs. In Israel, for example, the first kosher McDonald's opened in a Jerusalem suburb in 1995. In Arab countries the restaurant chain used \"Halal\" menus, which complied with Islamic laws for food preparation. In 1996 McDonald's entered India for the first time, where it offered a Big Mac made with lamb called the Maharaja Mac. That same year the first McSki-Thru opened in Lindvallen, Sweden.\n\nOverall, the company derived increasing percentages of its revenue and income from outside the US. In 1992 about two-thirds of systemwide sales came from U.S. McDonald's, but by 1997 that figure was down to about 51 percent. Similarly, the operating income numbers showed a reduction from about 60 percent of sales derived from the US in 1992 to 42.5 percent in 1997.\n\nIn the US, the number of units grew from 9,000 in 1991 to 12,500 in 1997, an increase of about 40 percent. Although the additional units increased market share in some markets, a number of franchisees complained that new units were cannibalizing sales from existing ones. Same-store sales for outlets open for more than one year were flat in the mid-1990s, a reflection of both the greater number of units and the mature nature of the U.S. market.\n\nThe company made several notable blunders in the US in the 1990s which hurt stateside profits. The McLean Deluxe sandwich, which featured a 91 percent fat-free beef patty, was introduced in 1991, never really caught on, and was dropped from the menu in February 1996 to make room for the Arch Deluxe, itself an underperforming product. The \"grown-up\" (and pricey) Arch Deluxe sandwich was launched in May 1996 and the Deluxe Line was launched in September 1996 in a $200 million campaign to gain the business of more adults, but were bombs. The following spring brought a 55-cent Big Mac promotion, which many customers either rejected outright or were confused by because the burgers had to be purchased with full-priced fries and a drink. The promotion embittered still more franchisees, whose complaints led to its withdrawal. In July 1997 McDonald's fired its main ad agency, Leo Burnett, a 15-year McDonald's partner after the nostalgic \"My McDonald's\" campaign proved a failure. Several other 1990s-debuted menu items, including fried chicken, pasta, fajitas, and pizza failed as well. A seemingly weakened McDonald's was the object of a Burger King offensive when the rival fast-food maker launched the Big King sandwich, a Big Mac clone. Meanwhile, internal taste tests revealed that customers preferred the fare at Wendy's and Burger King.\n\nIn response to these difficulties, McDonald's drastically cut back on its U.S. expansion. In contrast to the 1,130 units opened in 1995, only about 400 new McDonald's were built in 1997. Plans to open hundreds of smaller restaurants in Wal-Marts and gasoline stations were abandoned because test sites did not meet targeted goals. Reacting to complaints from franchisees about poor communication with the corporation and excess bureaucracy, the head of McDonald's U.S.A. (Jack M. Greenberg, who had assumed the position in October 1996) reorganized the unit into five autonomous geographic divisions. The aim was to bring management and decision-making closer to franchisees and customers.\n\nOn the marketing side, McDonald's scored big in 1996 and 1997 with a Teenie Beanie Baby promotion in which about 80 million of the toys/collectibles were gobbled up virtually overnight. The chain received some bad publicity, however, when it was discovered that a number of customers purchased Happy Meals just to get the toys and threw the food away. For a similar spring 1998 Teenie Beanie giveaway, the company altered the promotion to allow patrons to buy menu items other than kids' meals. McDonald's also began to benefit from a seven years global marketing alliance signed with Disney/Pixar in 1998. Initial Disney/Pixar movies promoted by McDonald's included \"A Bug's Life\", \"Monsters, Inc.\", \"Finding Nemo\" and \"The Incredibles\". Perhaps the most important marketing move came in the later months of 1997 when McDonald's named DDB Needham as its new lead ad agency. Needham had been the company's agency in the 1970s and was responsible for the hugely successful \"You Deserve a Break Today\" campaign. Late in 1997, McDonald's launched the Needham-designed \"Did Somebody Say McDonald's?\" campaign, which appeared to be an improvement over its predecessors.\n\nFollowing the difficulties of the early and mid-1990s, several moves in 1998 seemed to indicate a reinvigorated McDonald's. In February the company for the first time took a stake in another fast-food chain when it purchased a minority interest in the 16-unit, Colorado-based Chipotle Mexican Grill chain. The following month came the announcement that McDonald's would improve the taste of several sandwiches and introduce several new menu items. McFlurry desserts, developed by a Canadian franchisee in 1997, proved popular when launched in the United States in the summer of 1998. That same month, McDonald's said that it would overhaul its food preparation system in every U.S. restaurant. The new just-in-time system, dubbed \"Made for You\", was in development for a number of years and aimed to deliver to customers \"fresher, hotter food\"; enable patrons to receive special-order sandwiches (a perk long offered by rivals Burger King and Wendy's); and allow new menu items to be more easily introduced thanks to the system's enhanced flexibility. The expensive changeover was expected to cost about $25,000 per restaurant, with McDonald's offering to pay for about half of the cost; the company planned to provide about $190 million in financial assistance to its franchisees before implementation was completed by year-end 1999.\n\nIn May 1998, Greenberg was named president and CEO of McDonald's Corporation, with Quinlan remaining chairman; at the same time Alan D. Feldman, who had joined the company only four years earlier from Pizza Hut, replaced Greenberg as president of McDonald's U.S.A., an unusual move for a company whose executives typically were long-timers. The following month brought another first, McDonald's first job cuts. The company said it would eliminate 525 employees from its headquarters staff, a cut of about 23 percent. In the second quarter of 1998 McDonald's took a $160 million charge in relation to the cuts. As a result, the company, for the first time since it went public in 1965, recorded a decrease in net income, from $1.64 billion in 1997 to $1.55 billion in 1998.\n\nMcDonald's followed up its investment in Chipotle with several more moves beyond the burger business. In March 1999 the company bought Aroma Café, a UK chain of 23 upscale coffee and sandwich shops. In July of that year McDonald's added Donatos Pizza, a midwestern chain of 143 pizzerias based in Columbus, Ohio. Donatos had revenues of $120 million in 1997. In 1999, McDonald's 25,000th unit opened, Greenberg took on the additional post of chairman, and Jim Cantalupo was named company president. Cantalupo, who had joined the company as controller in 1974 and later became head of McDonald's International, had been vice-chairman, a position he retained. In May 2000 McDonald's completed its largest acquisition yet, buying the bankrupt Boston Market chain for $173.5 million in cash and debt. At the time, there were more than 850 Boston Market outlets, which specialized in home-style meals, with rotisserie chicken the lead menu item. Revenue at Boston Market during 1999 totaled $670 million. McDonald's rounded out its acquisition spree in early 2001 by buying a 33 percent stake in Pret A Manger, an upscale urban-based chain specializing in ready-to-eat sandwiches made on the premises. There were more than 110 Pret shops in the United Kingdom and several more in New York City. Also during 2001, McDonald's sold off Aroma Café and took its McDonald's Japan affiliate public, selling a minority stake through an initial public offering.\n\nAs it was exploring new avenues of growth, even though, McDonald's core burger chain had become plagued by problems. Most prominently, the Made for You system backfired. Although many franchisees believed that it succeeded in improving the quality of the food, it also increased service times and proved labor-intensive. Some franchisees also complained that the actual cost of implementing the system ran much higher than the corporation had estimated, a charge that McDonald's contested. In any case, there was no question that Made for You failed to reverse the chain's sluggish sales. Growth in sales at stores open more than a year (known as same-store sales) fell in both 2000 and 2001. Late in 2001 the company launched a restructuring involving the elimination of about 850 positions, 700 of which were in the US, and several restaurant closings.\n\nIn 2000, a McDonald's in Dearborn, Michigan in Greater Detroit was the first one in Michigan and the only one east of the Mississippi River to offer halal food for Muslim customers.\n\nThere were further black eyes as well. McDonald's was sued in 2001 after it was revealed that for flavoring purposes a small amount of beef extract was being added to the vegetable oil used to cook the french fries. The company had cooked its fries in beef tallow until 1990, when it began claiming in ads that it used 100 percent vegetable oil. McDonald's soon apologized for any \"confusion\" that had been caused by its use of the beef flavoring, and in mid-2002 it reached a settlement in the litigation, agreeing to donate $10 million to Hindu, vegetarian, and other affected groups. Also in 2001, further embarrassment came when 51 people were charged with conspiring to rig McDonald's game promotions over the course of several years. It was revealed that $24 million of winning McDonald's game tickets had been stolen as part of the scam. McDonald's was not implicated in the scheme, which centered on a worker at an outside company that had administered the promotions.\n\nMcDonald's also had to increasingly battle its public image as a purveyor of fatty, unhealthy food. Consumers began filing lawsuits contending that years of eating at McDonald's had made them overweight. McDonald's responded by introducing low-calorie menu items and switching to a more healthful cooking oil for its french fries. McDonald's franchises overseas became a favorite target of people and groups expressing anti-American and/or anti-globalization sentiments. In August 1999 a group of protesters led by farmer José Bové destroyed a half-built McDonald's restaurant in Millau, France. In 2002 Bové, who gained fame from the incident, served a three-month jail sentence for the act, which he said was in protest against U.S. trade protectionism. McDonald's was also one of three multinational corporations (along with Starbucks Corporation and Nike, Inc.) whose outlets in Seattle were attacked in late 1999 by some of the more aggressive protesters against a World Trade Organization meeting taking place there. In the early 2000s McDonald's pulled out of several countries, including Bolivia and two Middle Eastern nations, at least in part because of the negative regard with which the brand was held in some areas.\n\nEarly in 2002, Cantalupo retired after 28 years of service. Sales remained lackluster that year, and in October the company attempted to revive U.S. sales through the introduction of a low-cost Dollar Menu. In December 2002, after this latest initiative to reignite sales growth failed and also after profits fell in seven of the previous eight quarters, Greenberg announced that he would resign at the end of the year. Cantalupo came out of retirement to become chairman and CEO at the beginning of 2003.\n\nCantalupo started his tenure by announcing a major restructuring that involved the 2002 quarterly loss, which included the closure of more than 700 restaurants (mostly in the United States and Japan), the elimination of 600 jobs, and charges of $853 million. The charges resulted in a fourth-quarter 2002 loss of $343.8 million, the first quarterly loss in McDonald's 38 years as a public company. The new CEO also shifted away from the company's traditional reliance on growth through the opening of new units to a focus on gaining more sales from existing units. By 2003, with Ray Kroc's McDonald's Corporation nearly 50 and the McDonald's fast food restaurant concept itself old enough to qualify for AARP membership, the brand had perhaps become too familiar and sales figures stalled. Analysts, management, owners, and customers alike recognized that the aged chain required revivification. The question in need of solution was: How should McDonald's reinvent itself without losing its core values and maintain relevance in the marketplace? To that end, several new menu items were successfully launched, including entree salads, McGriddles breakfast sandwiches (which used pancakes in place of bread), and white-meat Chicken McNuggets. Some outlets began test-marketing fruits and vegetables as Happy Meal options. It was quickly determined that focus on customer experience was key in reversing the slippage. Then, a new global marketing campaign was adopted which was designed around the notion of the \"Rolling Energy\" phase. Launched on September 29, 2003, the campaign began featuring youthful images, hip music, and pop culture celebrities touting the tagline, \"I'm lovin' it\". Next, James R. Cantalupo was called back from retirement to head the corporation and its efforts to recapture golden luster. His plan was to keep things simple with a focus on the basics like customer service, clean restrooms, and reliable appealing food (not unlike Ray Kroc's mantra of QSC and V: Quality, Service, Cleanliness, and Value). In addition to the basics he determined to position the company with a more modern coherent image in order to foster a McDonald's \"experience\" for customers. More than an advertising campaign he and his team approved sweeping new architecture for McDonald's restaurants, the first major overhaul since 1969 when the now universally recognized signature double mansard roof became standard. In fact, Mr. Cantalupo personally approved abandonment of the ubiquitous and familiar mansard in favor of what became the \"Forever Young\" prototype topped with its swish eyebrow. This was the first global campaign in McDonald's history, as the new slogan was to be used in advertising in more than 100 countries. It also proved to be the first truly successful ad campaign in years; sales began rebounding, helped also by improvements in service. Cantalupo did not live to see the fruits of his labor and he died in 2004 just as his modern vision for McDonald's was getting underway. Nonetheless he had set things into motion causing a paradigm shift for the company resulting in a refreshed image without a dilution of brand identity.\n\nIn December 2003, for instance, same-store sales increased 7.3 percent. Same-store sales rose 2.4 percent for the entire year, after falling 2.1 percent in 2002. Also, in that month, McDonald's announced that it would further its focus on its core hamburger business by downsizing its other ventures. The company said that it would sell Donatos back to that chain's founder. In addition, it would discontinue development of non-McDonald's brands outside of the United States. This included Boston Market outlets in Canada and Australia and Donatos units in Germany. McDonald's kept its minority investment in Pret A Manger, but McDonald's Japan was slated to close its Pret units there. These moves would enable the company to concentrate its international efforts on the McDonald's chain, while reducing the non-hamburger brands in the United States to Chipotle and Boston Market, both of which were operating in the black.\n\nMcDonald's continued to curtail store openings in 2004 and to concentrate on building business at existing restaurants. Much of the more than $1.5 billion budgeted for capital expenditures in 2004 was slated to be used to remodel existing restaurants. McDonald's also aimed to pay down debt by $400 million to $700 million and to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Cantalupo also set several long-term goals, such as sustaining annual systemwide sales and revenue growth rates of 3 to 5 percent. In a move to both simplify the menu and make its offerings less fattening, McDonald's announced in March 2004 that it would phase out Super Size french fries and soft drinks by the end of the year.\n\nIn the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s, \"no loitering\" had been McDonald's motto. Ray Kroc had decreed upon the origins of his version of the chain that pay telephones, jukeboxes, and vending machines of any kind were forbidden at McDonald's restaurants. The goal had been to quickly serve customers and not force them to stay in the restaurants any longer than it took them to eat a hamburger. Along that line of thinking, dining areas were designed with minimalist hard plastic tables and chairs which were more often than not bolted in place. Thus customers consumed their fast food in scant comfort without dillydally allowing room for the next hurrying customers.\n\nWith the new \"Forever Young\" design (adopted in 2006), the first major redesign since 1969, McDonald's turned a new page for itself. New and remodeled restaurants feature dining zones with \"distinct personalities\". Most of them offer three sections or zones. A linger zone was designed to accommodate people who were inclined to dawdle and socialize while sitting comfortably on armchairs or sofas using free wifi access. Another zone offers counters and stools for patrons in a hurry who might just grab and go. The third and perhaps most important zone is the one for families or groups where seating arrangements can be reconfigured to meet a variety of needs. Harsh colors and hard plastics have been replaced with custom earth tones and flexible, padded, fabric-covered booth-seating, all in hopes of engaging diners to loiter and perhaps spend more money. In addition to architecture and furnishings, the McDonald's menu has been tweaked to offer a larger variety of what the corporation refers to as more healthy food.\n\nMcDonald's franchises are required to follow the directions of the parent company and perhaps more than a few have complained about the Forever Young changes. First, customers needed to recognize the mansard buildings and identify McDonald's with them—a new look may initially generate some degree of confusion. The next objection is cost: as of 2008, a newly built swish-brow store was said to cost upwards of $1 million and renovation of an existing unit to meet the new standards as much as $400,000. With a large percentage of sales from drive-in business, franchises could argue that the expensive interior redesign is unwarranted for their bottom lines.\n\nIn May 2010, McDonald's redesigned its US website to a sleeker, HTML 5 friendly interface. Along with those changes, McDonald's also introduced new advertising material to its website, including the unveiling of new pictures used exclusively for in-restaurant ads, television commercials, print advertising, and online advertising, which consist of more realistic pictures of its products, which are now up close and face the camera instead of facing left or right.\n\nIn July 2011, McDonald's announced that their largest restaurant in the world would be built on the 2012 London Olympics site. The restaurant contains over 1,500 seats and is half the length of an American football field. Over 470 staff were employed serving on average (during the 2012 Olympics) 100,000 portions of fries, 50,000 Big Macs and 30,000 Milkshakes. This restaurant will overshadow the current largest McDonald's in the world in Moscow, Russia.\n\nIn January 2012, the company announced revenue for 2011 reached an all-time high of $27 billion, and that 2,400 restaurants would be updated and 1,300 new ones opened worldwide.\n\nIn the middle of the decade, the restaurant began to suffer from declining profits. In response, McDonald's began to offer its breakfast menu all day starting in 2015. At first, the launch was unpopular with franchisees who claimed that the changes caused service to slow down. However, the plan paid off with CNBC reporting that the company's fourth quarter earning \"easily topped analysts' forecasts\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                "Richard and Maurice McDonald\n\nRichard and Maurice McDonald were the founders of the original McDonald’s restaurant in San Bernardino, California and inventors of the ‘Speedee Service System’.\n\nIn 1937, the McDonald brothers opened a hot dog stand in Monrovia, California, inspired by a local hot dog stand that seemed to be the only profitable business in town, and which primarily served patrons at a local racetrack. However, the stand had few customers after racing season ended.\n\nMaurice decided to open a bigger hot dog stand in San Bernardino, a large working-class town approximately 50 miles eastward, with a population of approximately 100,000 people. After several banks declined to lend them the money needed for this venture, Bank of America finally approved, and in 1940, with $5,000 in capital, they opened a drive-in restaurant on the corner of 1398 North E Street and West 14th Street().\n\nThe new restaurant proved a surprise success and the brothers were soon making $40,000 a year. Most customers were teenage or young adult males in their 20s who came there primarily to flirt with the carhop young women, or young working families looking for a cheap meal. The McDonald brothers decided that the latter were the ideal customer they wanted to attract.\n\nAfter a couple years in business, the brothers began making plans to renovate their business model based on the lessons they had learned. One of these involved finding a more efficient way to service customers than the carhop young women, who were very slow, unreliable workers who spent too much time flirting with customers to increase their tips. Another was that hamburgers accounted for a large proportion of total sales. The griddles were much easier to clean than grills and burgers were faster to assemble than sandwiches.\n\nIn 1948, the brothers fully redesigned and rebuilt their restaurant in San Bernardino to focus on hamburgers, milk shakes, and french fries. While this new \"McDonald's\", situated at the same address, was still premised on most customers arriving by car, its design was unique due to a combination of factors:\n\nThe new restaurant was a success, and with the goal of making $1 million before they turned 50, the McDonald brothers began franchising their system in 1953, beginning with a restaurant in Phoenix, Arizona operated by Neil Fox. At first they only franchised the system, rather than the name of their restaurant. Later, the brothers started franchising the entire concept, with restaurants built to a standard design, created by Fontana, California architect Stanley Clark Meston, and featuring Richard's suggestion of the paired Golden Arches, which formed an \"M\" when viewed from an angle.\n\nIn 1954, the McDonald brothers partnered with Ray Kroc. The franchiser took 1.9 percent of the gross sales, of which the McDonald brothers got 0.5 percent. The brothers wished to maintain only a small number of restaurants, which conflicted with Kroc's goals. Ray Kroc eventually bought them out.\n\nOn November 30, 1984, Richard McDonald – the first cook behind the grill of a McDonald's – was served the ceremonial 50,000,000,000th (50 billionth) McDonald's hamburger by Ed Rensi, then president of McDonald's USA, at the Grand Hyatt hotel in New York City.\n\nMaurice McDonald died from heart failure in Riverside, California, on December 11, 1971, at the age of 69. He was buried at the Desert Memorial Park, in Cathedral City, California.\n\nRichard McDonald died in Manchester, New Hampshire, on July 14, 1998, at the age of 89 and was buried at the Mount Calvary Cemetery in Manchester. His wife Dorothy died soon after. They were survived by Dorothy's son, Gale French.\n\nIn the 2016 film \"The Founder\", Richard McDonald is played by Nick Offerman, and John Carroll Lynch portrays Maurice McDonald.\n",
                "McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's is a fast food company that was founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand. The first time a McDonald's franchise used the Golden Arches logo was in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers. McDonald's had its original headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but has approved plans to move its global headquarters to Chicago by 2018.\n\nMcDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue, serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries across approximately 36,900 outlets as of 2016. Although McDonald's is known for its hamburgers, they also sell cheeseburgers, chicken products, french fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food, the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit. The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. According to a BBC report published in 2012, McDonald's is the world's second largest private employer (behind Walmart with 1.9 million employees), 1.5 million of whom work for franchises.\n\nThe siblings Richard and Maurice McDonald opened in 1940 the first McDonald's at 1398 North E Street at West 14th Street in San Bernardino, California (at ) but it was not the McDonald's recognizable today; Ray Kroc made changes to the brothers business that modernized it. The brothers introduced the \"Speedee Service System\" in 1948, putting into expanded use the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant that their predecessor White Castle had put into practice more than two decades earlier.. The original mascot of McDonald's was a chef hat on top of a hamburger who was referred to as \"Speedee\". In 1962, the Golden Arches replaced Speedee as the universal mascot. The symbol, Ronald McDonald, was introduced in 1965. The clown, Ronald McDonald, appeared in advertising to target their audience of children.\nOn May 4, 1961, McDonald's first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name \"McDonald's\" with the description \"Drive-In Restaurant Services\", which continues to be renewed. By September 13, 1961, McDonald's under the guidance of Ray Kroc, filed for a trademark on a new logo—an overlapping, double-arched \"M\" symbol. But before the double arches, McDonald's used the a single arch for the architecture of their buildings. Although the \"Golden Arches\" logo appeared in various forms, the present version was not used until November 18, 1968, when the company was favored a U.S. trademark.\n\nThe present corporation credits its founding to franchised businessman Ray Kroc in on April 15, 1955, this was in fact the ninth opened McDonald's restaurant overall; although this location was destroyed and rebuilt in 1984. Kroc later purchased the McDonald brothers' equity in the company and begun the companies worldwide reach. Kroc was recorded as being an aggressive business partner, driving the McDonald brothers out of the industry.\n\nKroc and the McDonald brothers fought for control of the business, as documented in Kroc's autobiography. The San Bernardino restaurant was eventually torn down (1971, according to Juan Pollo) and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo chain in 1976. This area now serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, and a McDonald's and Route 66 museum. With the expansion of McDonald's into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life. Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics, and consumer responsibility.\n\nMcDonald's restaurants are found in 120 countries and territories around the world and serve 68 million customers each day. McDonald's operates 36,899 restaurants worldwide, employing more than 375,000 people as of the end of 2016. There are currently a total of 5,669 company-owned locations and 31,230 franchised locations, which includes 21,559 locations franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,300 locations licensed to developmental licensees, and 3,371 locations licensed to foreign affiliates, primarily Japan.\n\nFocusing on its core brand, McDonald's began divesting itself of other chains it had acquired during the 1990s. The company owned a majority stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill until October 2006, when McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle through a stock exchange. Until December 2003, it also owned Donatos Pizza, and it owned a small share of Aroma Cafe from 1999 to 2001. On August 27, 2007, McDonald's sold Boston Market to Sun Capital Partners.\n\nNotably, McDonald's has increased shareholder dividends for 25 consecutive years, making it one of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. In October 2012, its monthly sales fell for the first time in nine years. In 2014, its quarterly sales fell for the first time in seventeen years, when its sales dropped for the entirety of 1997.\n\nIn the United States, it is reported that drive-throughs account for 70 percent of sales. McDonald's closed down 184 restaurants in the United States in 2015, which was 59 more than what they planned to open. This move was also the first time McDonald's had a net decrease in the number of locations in the United States since 1970.\n\nThe company currently owns all the land, valued at an estimated $16 to $18 billion, on which its restaurants are situated. The company earns a significant portion of its revenue from rental payments from franchisees. These rent payments rose 26 percent between 2010 and 2015, accounting for one-fifth of the company's total revenue at the end of the period. In recent times, there have been calls to spin off the company's US holdings into a potential real estate investment trust, but the company announced at its investor conference on November 10, 2015, that this would not happen. The CEO, Steve Easterbrook discussed that pursuing the REIT option would pose too large a risk to the company's business model.\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland business model is different from the U.S, in that fewer than 30 percent of restaurants are franchised, with the majority under the ownership of the company. McDonald's trains its franchisees and management at Hamburger University in Oak Brook, Illinois. In other countries, McDonald's restaurants are operated by joint ventures of McDonald's Corporation and other, local entities or governments.\n\nAccording to \"Fast Food Nation\" by Eric Schlosser (2001), nearly one in eight workers in the U.S. have at some time been employed by McDonald's. Employees are encouraged by McDonald's Corp. to maintain their health by singing along to their favorite songs in order to relieve stress, attending church services in order to have a lower blood pressure, and taking two vacations annually in order to reduce risk for myocardial infarction. \"Fast Food Nation\" also states that McDonald's is the largest private operator of playgrounds in the U.S., as well as the single largest purchaser of beef, pork, potatoes, and apples. The selection of meats McDonald's uses varies to some extent based on the culture of the host country.\n\nThe McDonald's headquarters complex, McDonald's Plaza, is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. It sits on the site of the former headquarters and stabling area of Paul Butler, the founder of Oak Brook. McDonald's moved into the Oak Brook facility from an office within the Chicago Loop in 1971.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, McDonald's confirmed plans to move its global headquarters to Chicago's West Loop neighborhood in the Near West Side. The 608,000-square-foot structure will be built on the former site of Harpo Productions (where the \"Oprah Winfrey Show\" and several other Harpo productions taped) and open in early 2018.\n\nAs of November 2014, the board of directors had the following members:\n\nOn March 1, 2015, after being chief brand officer of McDonald's and its former head in the UK and northern Europe, Steve Easterbrook became CEO, succeeding Don Thompson, who stepped down on January 28, 2015.\n\nMcDonald's has become emblematic of globalization, sometimes referred to as the \"McDonaldization\" of society. \"The Economist\" newspaper uses the \"Big Mac Index\": the comparison of a Big Mac's cost in various world currencies can be used to informally judge these currencies' purchasing power parity. Switzerland has the most expensive Big Mac in the world as of July 2015, while the country with the least expensive Big Mac is India (albeit for a Maharaja Mac—the next cheapest Big Mac is Hong Kong).\n\nThomas Friedman once said that no country with a McDonald's had gone to war with another. However, the \"Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention\" is not strictly true. Exceptions are the 1989 United States invasion of Panama, NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999, the 2006 Lebanon War, and the 2008 South Ossetia war. McDonald's suspended operations in its corporate-owned stores in Crimea after Russia annexed the region in 2014. On August 20, 2014, as tensions between the United States and Russia strained over events in Ukraine, and the resultant U.S. sanctions, the Russian government temporarily shut down four McDonald's outlets in Moscow, citing sanitary concerns. The company has operated in Russia since 1990 and at August 2014 had 438 stores across the country. On August 23, 2014, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich ruled out any government move to ban McDonald's and dismissed the notion that the temporary closures had anything to do with the sanctions.\n\nSome observers have suggested that the company should be given credit for increasing the standard of service in markets that it enters. A group of anthropologists in a study entitled \"Golden Arches East\" looked at the impact McDonald's had on East Asia and Hong Kong, in particular. When it opened in Hong Kong in 1975, McDonald's was the first restaurant to consistently offer clean restrooms, driving customers to demand the same of other restaurants and institutions. McDonald's has taken to partnering up with Sinopec, the second largest oil company in the People's Republic of China, as it takes advantage of the country's growing use of personal vehicles by opening numerous drive-thru restaurants. McDonald's has opened a McDonald's restaurant and McCafé on the underground premises of the French fine arts museum, The Louvre.\n\nThe company stated it would open vegetarian-only restaurants in India by mid-2013. Foreign restaurants are banned in Bermuda, with the exception of KFC, which was present before the current law was passed. Therefore, there are no McDonald's in Bermuda.\n\nOn January 9, 2017, 80% of the franchise rights in the mainland China and in Hong Kong were sold for US$2.080 billion to a consortium of CITIC Limited (for 32%) and private equity funds managed by CITIC Capital (for 20%) and Carlyle (for 20%), which CITIC Limited and CITIC Capital would also formed a joint venture to own the stake.\n\nMcDonald's predominantly sells hamburgers, various types of chicken, chicken sandwiches, French fries, soft drinks, breakfast items, and desserts. In most markets, McDonald's offers salads and vegetarian items, wraps and other localized fare. On a seasonal basis, McDonald's offers the McRib sandwich. Some speculate the seasonality of the McRib adds to its appeal.\n\nProducts are offered as either \"eat-in\" (where the customer opts to eat in the restaurant) or \"take-out\" (where the customer opts to take the food for consumption off the premises). \"Eat-in\" meals are provided on a plastic tray with a paper insert on the floor of the tray. \"Take-out\" meals are usually delivered with the contents enclosed in a distinctive McDonald's-branded brown paper bag. In both cases, the individual items are wrapped or boxed as appropriate.\n\nSince Steve Easterbrook became CEO of the company, McDonald's has streamlined the menu which in the United States contained nearly 200 items. The company has also looked to introduce healthier options, and removed high-fructose corn syrup from hamburger buns. The company has also removed artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets, replacing chicken skin, safflower oil and citric acid found in Chicken McNuggets with pea starch, rice starch and powdered lemon juice.\n\nRestaurants in several countries, particularly in Asia, serve soup. This local deviation from the standard menu is a characteristic for which the chain is particularly known, and one which is employed either to abide by regional food taboos (such as the religious prohibition of beef consumption in India) or to make available foods with which the regional market is more familiar (such as the sale of McRice in Indonesia, or Ebi (prawn) Burger in Singapore and Japan).\n\nIn Germany and some other Western European countries, McDonald's sells beer. In New Zealand, McDonald's sells meat pies, after the local affiliate partially relaunched the Georgie Pie fast food chain it bought out in 1996.\n\nIn the United States, after limited trials on a regional basis, McDonald's plans to offer an all-day breakfast menu whenever its restaurants are open, although eggs cannot be cooked at the same time on the same equipment as hamburgers due to different temperature requirements.\n\nMost standalone McDonald's restaurants offer both counter service and drive-through service, with indoor and sometimes outdoor seating. Drive-Thru, Auto-Mac, Pay and Drive, or \"McDrive\" as it is known in many countries, often has separate stations for placing, paying for, and picking up orders, though the latter two steps are frequently combined; it was first introduced in Arizona in 1975, following the lead of other fast-food chains. The first such restaurant in Britain opened at Fallowfield, Manchester in 1986.\n\nIn some countries, \"McDrive\" locations near highways offer no counter service or seating. In contrast, locations in high-density city neighborhoods often omit drive-through service. There are also a few locations, located mostly in downtown districts, that offer a \"Walk-Thru\" service in place of Drive-Thru.\n\nMcCafé is a café-style accompaniment to McDonald's restaurants and is a concept created by McDonald's Australia (also known, and marketed, as \"Macca's\" in Australia), starting with Melbourne in 1993. As of 2016, most McDonald's in Australia have McCafés located within the existing McDonald's restaurant. In Tasmania, there are McCafés in every restaurant, with the rest of the states quickly following suit. After upgrading to the new McCafé look and feel, some Australian restaurants have noticed up to a 60 percent increase in sales. At the end of 2003, there were over 600 McCafés worldwide.\n\nFrom 2015–2016, McDonald's tried a new gourmet burger service/restaurant concept based on other gourmet restaurants such as \"Shake Shack\" and \"Grill'd\". It was rolled out for the first time in Australia during the early months of 2015 and expanded to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Arabia and New Zealand, with ongoing trials in the US market. In dedicated \"Create Your Taste\" (CYT) kiosks, customers could choose all ingredients including type of bun and meat along with optional extras. In late 2015 the Australian CYT service introduced CYT salads.\n\nAfter a person had ordered, McDonald's advised that wait times were between 10–15 minutes. When the food was ready, trained crew ('hosts') brought the food to the customer's table. Instead of McDonald's usual cardboard and plastic packaging, CYT food was presented on wooden boards, fries in wire baskets and salads in china bowls with metal cutlery. A higher price applied.\n\nIn November 2016, Create Your Taste was replaced by a \"Signature Crafted Recipes\" program designed to be more efficient and less expensive.\n\nSome locations are connected to gas stations/convenience stores, while others called McExpress have limited seating and/or menu or may be located in a shopping mall. Other McDonald's are located in Walmart stores. McStop is a location targeted at truckers and travelers which may have services found at truck stops.\n\nIn Sweden, customers who order a happy meal can use the meal's container for a pair of happy goggles. The company created a game for the goggles known as \"Slope Stars.\" McDonald's predicts happy goggles will continue in other countries. In the Netherlands, McDonald's has introduced McTrax that doubles as a recording studio; it reacts to touch. They can create their own beats with a synth and tweak sounds with special effects.\n\nThe first kosher McDonald's was established in 1997 at the Abasto de Buenos Aires mall in Buenos Aires, Argentina. There are also many kosher branches in Israel.\n\nMcDonald's playgrounds are called McDonald's PlayPlace. Some McDonald's in suburban areas and certain cities feature large indoor or outdoor playgrounds. The first PlayPlace with the familiar crawl-tube design with ball pits and slides was introduced in 1987 in the US, with many more being constructed soon after.\n\nMcDonald's Next use open-concept design and offer \"Create Your Taste\" digital ordering. The concept store also offering free mobile device charging and table service after 6:00 pm. The first store open in Hong Kong in December 2015.\n\nIn 2006, McDonald's introduced its \"Forever Young\" brand by redesigning all of its restaurants, the first major redesign since the 1970s.\n\nThe goal of the redesign is to be more like a coffee shop, similar to Starbucks. The design includes wooden tables, faux-leather chairs, and muted colors; the red was muted to terracotta, the yellow was shifted to golden for a more \"sunny\" look, and olive and sage green were also added.\n\nTo create a warmer look, the restaurants have less plastic and more brick and wood, with modern hanging lights to produce a softer glow. Many restaurants now feature free Wi-Fi and flat-screen TVs. Other upgrades include double drive-thrus, flat roofs instead of the angled red roofs, and replacing fiber glass with wood. Also, instead of the familiar golden arches, the restaurants now feature \"semi-swooshes\" (half of a golden arch), similar to the Nike swoosh.\n\nMcDonald's began banning smoking in 1994 when it banned smoking within its 1,400 wholly owned restaurants.\n\nSince the late 1990s, McDonald's has attempted to replace employees with electronic kiosks which would perform actions such taking orders and accepting money. In 1999, McDonald's first tested \"E-Clerks\" in suburban Chicago, Illinois, and Wyoming, Michigan, with the devices being able to \"save money on live staffers\" and attracting larger purchase amounts than average employees.\n\nIn 2013, the University of Oxford estimated that in the succeeding decades, there was a 92% probability of food preparation and serving to become automated in fast food establishments. By 2016, McDonald's \"Create Your Taste\" electronic kiosks were seen in some restaurants internationally where customers could custom order meals. As employees pushed for higher wages in the late-2010s, some believed that fast food companies such as McDonald's would use the devices to cut costs for employing individuals.\n\nOn August 5, 2013, \"The Guardian\" revealed that 90 percent of McDonald's UK workforce are on zero hour contracts, making it possibly the largest such private sector employer in the country. A study released by Fast Food Forward conducted by Anzalone Liszt Grove Research showed that approximately 84 percent of all fast food employees working in New York City in April 2013 had been paid less than their legal wages by their employers.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, fast food workers in the US drew an average of $7 billion of public assistance annually resulting from receiving low wages. The McResource website advised employees to break their food into smaller pieces to feel fuller, seek refunds for unopened holiday purchases, sell possessions online for quick cash, and to \"quit complaining\" as \"stress hormone levels rise by 15 percent after ten minutes of complaining.\" In December 2013, McDonald's shut down the McResource website amidst negative publicity and criticism. McDonald's plans to continue an internal telephone help line through which its employees can obtain advice on work and life problems.\n\nLiberal thinktank the Roosevelt Institute accuses some McDonald's restaurants of actually paying less than the minimum wage to entry positions due to 'rampant' wage theft. In South Korea, McDonald's pays part-time employees $5.50 an hour and is accused of paying less with arbitrary schedules adjustments and pay delays. In late 2015, Anonymous aggregated data collected by Glassdoor suggests that McDonald's in the United States pays entry-level employees between $7.25 an hour and $11 an hour, with an average of $8.69 an hour. Shift managers get paid an average of $10.34 an hour. Assistant managers get paid an average of $11.57 an hour. McDonald's CEO, Steve Easterbrook, currently earns an annual salary of $1,100,000.\n\nMcDonald's workers have on occasions decided to strike over pay, with most of the employees on strike seeking to be paid $15.00. When interviewed about the strikes occurring, former McDonald's CEO Ed Rensi stated: \"It's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who's inefficient making $15 an hour bagging french fries\" with Rensi explaining that increasing employee wages could possibly take away from entry-level jobs. However, according to Easterbrook, increasing wages and benefits for workers saw a 6% increase in customer satisfaction when comparing 2015's first quarter data to the first quarter of 2016, with greater returns seen as a result.\n\nIn September 2017, two British McDonald's stores agreed to a strike over zero hours contracts for staff. Picket lines were formed around the two stores in Crayford and Cambridge. The strike was supported by the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nIn March 2015, McDonald's workers in 19 US cities filed 28 health and safety complaints with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration which allege that low staffing, lack of protective gear, poor training and pressure to work fast has resulted in injuries. The complaints also allege that, because of a lack of first aid supplies, workers were told by management to treat burn injuries with condiments such as mayonnaise and mustard. The Fight for $15 labor organization aided the workers in filing the complaints.\n\nIn 2015, McDonald's pledged to stop using eggs from battery cage facilities by 2025. Since McDonald's purchases over 2 billion eggs per year or 4 percent of eggs produced in the United States, the switch is expected to have a major impact on the egg industry and is part of a general trend toward cage-free eggs driven by consumer concern over the harsh living conditions of hens. The aviary systems from which the new eggs will be sourced are troubled by much higher mortality rates, as well as introducing environmental and worker safety problems. The high hen mortality rate, which is more than double that of battery cage systems, will require new research to mitigate. The facilities also have higher ammonia levels due to faeces being kicked up into the air. Producers raised concerns about the production cost, which is expected to increase by 36 percent.\n\nMcDonald's continues to source pork from facilities that use gestation crates, and in 2012 pledged to phase them out.\n\nMcDonald's has for decades maintained an extensive advertising campaign. In addition to the usual media (television, radio, and newspaper), the company makes significant use of billboards and signage, sponsors sporting events ranging from Little League to the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games. Television has played a central role in the company's advertising strategy. To date, McDonald's has used 23 different slogans in United States advertising, as well as a few other slogans for select countries and regions.\n\nMcDonald's and NASA explored an advertising agreement for a planned mission to the asteroid 449 Hamburga; however, the spacecraft was eventually cancelled.\n\nMcDonald's is the title sponsor of the McDonald's All-American Game, all-star basketball games played each year for American and Canadian boys' and girls' high school basketball graduates.\n\nMcHappy Day is an annual event at McDonald's, where a percentage of the day's sales go to charity. It is the signature fundraising event for Ronald McDonald House Charities.\n\nIn 2007, it was celebrated in 17 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, the United States, Finland, France, Guatemala, Hungary, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Uruguay.\n\nAccording to the Australian McHappy Day website, McHappy Day raised $20.4 million in 2009. The goal for 2010 was $20.8 million.\n\nIn 1995, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital received an anonymous letter postmarked in Dallas, Texas, containing a $1 million winning McDonald's Monopoly game piece. McDonald's officials came to the hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, who examined the card under a jeweler's eyepiece, handled it with plastic gloves, and verified it as a winner. Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, McDonald's waived the rule and has made the annual $50,000 annuity payments, even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald's (see McDonald's Monopoly).\n\nMcRefugees are poor people in Hong Kong, Japan, and China who use McDonald's 24-hour restaurants as a temporary hostel. One in five of Hong Kong's population lives below the poverty line. The rise of McRefugees was first documented by photographer Suraj Katra in 2013.\n\nIn 1990, activists from a small group known as London Greenpeace (no connection to the international group Greenpeace) distributed leaflets entitled \"What's wrong with McDonald's?\", criticizing its environmental, health, and labor record. The corporation wrote to the group demanding they desist and apologize, and, when two of the activists refused to back down, sued them for libel in one of the longest cases in British civil law. A documentary film of the McLibel Trial has been shown in several countries.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Phil Sokolof, a millionaire businessman who had suffered a heart attack at the age of 43, took out full-page newspaper ads in New York, Chicago, and other large cities accusing McDonald's menu of being a threat to American health, and asking them to stop using beef tallow to cook their french fries.\n\nDespite the objections of McDonald's, the term \"McJob\" was added to \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\" in 2003. The term was defined as \"a low-paying job that requires little skill and provides little opportunity for advancement\".\n\nIn 2001, Eric Schlosser's book \"Fast Food Nation\" included criticism of the business practices of McDonald's. Among the critiques were allegations that McDonald's (along with other companies within the fast food industry) uses its political influence to increase its profits at the expense of people's health and the social conditions of its workers. The book also brought into question McDonald's advertisement techniques in which it targets children. While the book did mention other fast-food chains, it focused primarily on McDonald's.\n\nIn 2002, vegetarian groups, largely Hindu and Buddhist, successfully sued McDonald's for misrepresenting its French fries as vegetarian, when they contained beef broth.\n\nMorgan Spurlock's 2004 documentary film \"Super Size Me\" claimed that McDonald's food was contributing to the increase of obesity in society and that the company was failing to provide nutritional information about its food for its customers. Six weeks after the film premiered, McDonald's announced that it was eliminating the super size option, and was creating the adult Happy Meal.\nIn 2006, an unsanctioned McDonald's Videogame was released online. It is parody of the business practices of the corporate giant, taking the guise of a tycoon style business simulation game. In the game, the player plays the role of a McDonald's CEO, choosing whether or not to use controversial practices like genetically altered cow feed, plowing over rainforests, and corrupting public officials. McDonald's issued a statement distancing itself from the game.\n\nIn January 2014, it was reported that McDonald's was accused of having used a series of tax maneuvers to avoid taxes in France. The company confirmed that tax authorities had visited McDonald's French headquarters in Paris but insisted that it had not done anything wrong, saying, \"McDonald's firmly denies the accusation made by L'Express according to which McDonald's supposedly hid part of its revenue from taxes in France.\"\n\nIn response to public pressure, McDonald's has sought to include more healthy choices in its menu and has introduced a new slogan to its recruitment posters: \"Not bad for a McJob\". The word McJob, first attested in the mid-1980s and later popularized by Canadian novelist Douglas Coupland in his book \"\", has become a buzz word for low-paid, unskilled work with few prospects or benefits and little security. McDonald's disputes this definition of McJob. In 2007, the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan \"Would you like a career with that?\" on Irish television, asserting that its jobs have good prospects.\n\nIn an effort to respond to growing consumer awareness of food provenance, the fast-food chain changed its supplier of both coffee beans and milk. UK chief executive Steve Easterbrook said: \"British consumers are increasingly interested in the quality, sourcing, and ethics of the food and drink they buy\". In a bid to tap into the ethical consumer market, McDonald's switched to using coffee beans taken from stocks that are certified by the Rainforest Alliance, a conservation group. Additionally, in response to pressure, McDonald's UK started using organic milk supplies for its bottled milk and hot drinks, although it still uses conventional milk in its milkshakes, and in all of its dairy products in the United States. According to a report published by \"Farmers Weekly\" in 2007, the quantity of milk used by McDonald's could have accounted for as much as 5 percent of the UK's organic milk output.\n\nMcDonald's announced on May 22, 2008, that, in the United States and Canada, it would switch to using cooking oil that contains no trans fats for its french fries, and canola-based oil with corn and soy oils, for its baked items, pies and cookies, by year's end.\n\nWith regard to acquiring chickens from suppliers who use CAK/CAS methods of slaughter, McDonald's says that it needs to see more research \"to help determine whether any CAS system in current use is optimal from an animal welfare perspective.\"\n\nIn April 2008, McDonald's announced that 11 of its Sheffield, England restaurants have been engaged in a biomass trial that had cut its waste and carbon footprint by half in the area. In this trial, wastes from the restaurants were collected by Veolia Environmental Services and were used to produce energy at a power plant. McDonald's plans to expand this project, although the lack of biomass power plants in the United States will prevent this plan from becoming a national standard anytime soon. In addition, in Europe, McDonald's has been recycling vegetable grease by converting it to fuel for its diesel trucks.\n\nMcDonald's has been using a corn-based bioplastic to produce containers for some of its products. The environmental benefits of this technology are controversial, with critics noting that biodegradation is slow, produces greenhouse gases and that contamination of traditional plastic waste streams with bioplastics can complicate recycling efforts.\n\nIn 1990, McDonald's worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to stop using \"clam shell\" shaped styrofoam food containers to house its food products. 20 years later, McDonald's announced they would try replacing styrofoam coffee cups with an alternative material.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized McDonald's continuous effort to reduce solid waste by designing more efficient packaging and by promoting the use of recycled-content materials. McDonald's reports that it is committed towards environmental leadership by effectively managing electric energy, by conserving natural resources through recycling and reusing materials, and by addressing water management issues within the restaurant.\n\nIn an effort to reduce energy usage by 25 percent in its restaurants, McDonald's opened a prototype restaurant in Chicago in 2009 with the intention of using the model in its other restaurants throughout the world. Building on past efforts, specifically a restaurant it opened in Sweden in 2000 that was the first to intentionally incorporate green ideas, McDonald's designed the Chicago site to save energy by incorporating old and new ideas such as managing storm water, using skylights for more natural lighting and installing some partitions and tabletops made from recycled goods.\n\nWhen McDonald's received criticism for its environmental policies in the 1970s, it began to make substantial progress in reducing its use of materials. For instance, an \"average meal\" in the 1970s—a Big Mac, fries, and a drink—required 46 grams of packaging; today, it requires only 25 grams, allowing a 46 percent reduction. In addition, McDonald's eliminated the need for intermediate containers for cola by having a delivery system that pumps syrup directly from the delivery truck into storage containers, saving of packaging annually. Overall, weight reductions in packaging and products, as well as the increased usage of bulk packaging ultimately decreased packaging by annually.\n\nMcDonald's has been involved in a number of lawsuits and other legal cases, most of which involved trademark disputes. The company has threatened many food businesses with legal action unless it drops the Mc or Mac from trading names.\n\nOn September 8, 2009, McDonald's Malaysian operations lost a lawsuit to prevent another restaurant calling itself McCurry. McDonald's lost in an appeal to Malaysia's highest court, the Federal Court.\n\nIn April 2007, in Perth, Western Australia, McDonald's pleaded guilty to five charges relating to the employment of children under 15 in one of its outlets and was fined A$8,000.\n\nIn 2016, the Australian Taxation Office revealed that McDonald's Asia-Pacific Consortium had generated $478 million in revenue in 2013–14, but had paid no tax on those earnings whatsoever.\n\nMcDonald's has defended itself in several cases involving workers' rights.\n\nThe longest running legal action of all time in the UK was the McLibel case against 2 defendants who criticized a number of aspects of the company. The trial lasted 10 years and called 130 witnesses. The European Court of Human Rights deemed that the unequal resources of the litigants breached the defendants rights to freedom of speech and biased the trial. The result was widely seen as a \"PR disaster.\"\n\nA famous legal case in the US involving McDonald's was the 1994 decision in \"Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants\" where Stella Liebeck was awarded several million dollars after she suffered third-degree burns after spilling a scalding cup of McDonald's coffee on herself.\n\nIn April 2014, it was reported that McDonald's in Europe will use chicken meat that was produced by using genetically modified animal feed. Greenpeace argues that McDonald's saves less than one Eurocent for each chicken burger and goes down a path not desired by its customers.\n\n\n\n",
                "Fast food restaurant\n\nA fast food restaurant, also known as a quick service restaurant (QSR) within the industry, is a specific type of restaurant that serves fast food cuisine and has minimal table service. The food served in fast food restaurants is typically part of a \"meat-sweet diet\", offered from a limited menu, cooked in bulk in advance and kept hot, finished and packaged to order, and usually available for take away, though seating may be provided. Fast food restaurants are typically part of a restaurant chain or franchise operation that provisions standardized ingredients and/or partially prepared foods and supplies to each restaurant through controlled supply channels. The term \"fast food\" was recognized in a dictionary by Merriam–Webster in 1951.\n\nArguably, the first fast food restaurants originated in the United States with White Castle in 1921 and A&W in 1923. Today, American-founded fast food chains such as McDonald's (est. 1940) and KFC (est. 1952) are multinational corporations with outlets across the globe.\n\nVariations on the fast food restaurant concept include fast casual restaurants and catering trucks. Fast casual restaurants have higher sit-in ratios, offering a hybrid between counter-service typical at fast food restaurants and a traditional table service restaurant. Catering trucks (also called food trucks) often park just outside worksites and are popular with factory workers.\n\nSome trace the modern history of fast food in the United States to 7 July 1912, with the opening of a fast food restaurant called the Automat in New York. The Automat was a cafeteria with its pre-prepared foods behind small glass windows and coin-operated slots. Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart had already opened the first Horn & Hardart Automat in Philadelphia in 1902, but their \"Automat\" at Broadway and 13th Street, in New York City, created a sensation. Numerous Automat restaurants were built around the country to deal with the demand. Automats remained extremely popular throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The company also popularized the notion of \"take-out\" food, with their slogan \"Less work for Mother\".\n\nSome historians concur that A&W, which opened in 1921 and began franchising in 1923, was the first fast food restaurant (E. Tavares). Thus, the American company White Castle is sometimes considered the second fast-food outlet in Wichita, Kansas in 1921, selling hamburgers for five cents apiece from its inception and spawning numerous competitors and emulators. What is certain, however, is that White Castle made the first significant effort to standardize the food production in, look of, and operation of fast-food hamburger restaurants. William Ingram's and Walter Anderson's White Castle System created the first fast food supply chain to provide meat, buns, paper goods, and other supplies to their restaurants, pioneered the concept of the multi-state hamburger restaurant chain, standardized the look and construction of the restaurants themselves, and even developed a construction division that manufactured and built the chain's prefabricated restaurant buildings. The McDonald's Speedee Service System and, much later, Ray Kroc's McDonald's outlets and Hamburger University all built on principles, systems and practices that White Castle had already established between 1923 and 1932.\n\nThe hamburger restaurant most associated by the public with the term \"fast food\" was created by two brothers originally from Nashua, New Hampshire. Richard and Maurice McDonald opened a barbecue drive-in in 1940 in the city of San Bernardino, California. After discovering that most of their profits came from hamburgers, the brothers closed their restaurant for three months and reopened it in 1948 as a walk-up stand offering a simple menu of hamburgers, french fries, shakes, coffee, and Coca-Cola, served in disposable paper wrapping. As a result, they could produce hamburgers and fries constantly, without waiting for customer orders, and could serve them immediately; hamburgers cost 15 cents, about half the price at a typical diner. Their streamlined production method, which they named the \"Speedee Service System\" was influenced by the production line innovations of Henry Ford.\n\nBy 1954, The McDonald brothers' stand was restaurant equipment manufacturer Prince Castle's biggest purchaser of milkshake blending machines. Prince Castle salesman Ray Kroc traveled to California to discover why the company had purchased almost a dozen of the units as opposed to the normal one or two found in most restaurants of the time. Enticed by the success of the McDonald's concept, Kroc signed a franchise agreement with the brothers and began opening McDonald's restaurants in Illinois. By 1961, Kroc had bought out the brothers and created what is now the modern McDonald's Corporation. One of the major parts of his business plan was to promote cleanliness of his restaurants to growing groups of Americans that had become aware of food safety issues. As part of his commitment to cleanliness, Kroc often took part in cleaning his own Des Plaines, Illinois outlet by hosing down the garbage cans and scraping gum off the cement. Another concept Kroc added was great swaths of glass which enabled the customer to view the food preparation, a practice still found in chains such as Krispy Kreme. A clean atmosphere was only part of Kroc's grander plan which separated McDonald's from the rest of the competition and attributes to their great success. Kroc envisioned making his restaurants appeal to suburban families.\n\nAt roughly the same time as Kroc was conceiving what eventually became McDonald's Corporation, two Miami, Florida businessmen, James McLamore and David Edgerton, opened a franchise of the predecessor to what is now the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King. McLamore had visited the original McDonald's hamburger stand belonging to the McDonald brothers; sensing potential in their innovative assembly line-based production system, he decided he wanted to open a similar operation of his own. The two partners eventually decided to invest their money in Jacksonville, Florida-based Insta-Burger King. Originally opened in 1953, the founders and owners of the chain, Kieth J. Kramer and his wife's uncle Matthew Burns, opened their first stores around a piece of equipment known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so successful at cooking burgers, they required all of their franchises to carry the device. By 1959 McLamore and Edgarton were operating several locations within the Miami-Dade area and were growing at a fast clip. Despite the success of their operation, the partners discovered that the design of the insta-broiler made the unit's heating elements prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by changing the way the meat patties were cooked in the unit. After the original company began to falter in 1959, it was purchased by McLamore and Edgerton who renamed the company Burger King.\n\nWhile fast food restaurants usually have a seating area in which customers can eat the food on the premises, orders are designed to be taken away, and traditional table service is rare. Orders are generally taken and paid for at a wide counter, with the customer waiting by the counter for a tray or container for their food. A \"drive-through\" service can allow customers to order and pick up food from their cars.\n\nNearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten \"on the go\" and often does not require traditional cutlery and is eaten as a finger food. Common menu items at fast food outlets include fish and chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, and ice cream, although many fast food restaurants offer \"slower\" foods like chili, mashed potatoes, and salads.\n\nModern commercial fast food is highly processed and prepared on a large scale from bulk ingredients using standardized cooking and production methods and equipment. It is usually rapidly served in cartons or bags or in a plastic wrapping, in a fashion which reduces operating costs by allowing rapid product identification and counting, promoting longer holding time, avoiding transfer of bacteria, and facilitating order fulfillment. In most fast food operations, menu items are generally made from processed ingredients prepared at central supply facilities and then shipped to individual outlets where they are cooked (usually by grill, microwave, or deep-frying) or assembled in a short amount of time either in anticipation of upcoming orders (i.e., \"to stock\") or in response to actual orders (i.e., \"to order\"). Following standard operating procedures, pre-cooked products are monitored for freshness and disposed of if holding times become excessive. This process ensures a consistent level of product quality, and is key to delivering the order quickly to the customer and avoiding labor and equipment costs in the individual stores.\n\nBecause of commercial emphasis on taste, speed, product safety, uniformity, and low cost, fast food products are made with ingredients formulated to achieve an identifiable flavor, aroma, texture, and \"mouth feel\" and to preserve freshness and control handling costs during preparation and order fulfillment. This requires a high degree of food engineering. The use of additives, including salt, sugar, flavorings and preservatives, and processing techniques may limit the nutritional value of the final product.\n\nA \"value meal\" is a group of menu items offered together at a lower price than they would cost individually. A hamburger, side of fries, and drink commonly constitute a value meal—or \"combo\" depending on the chain. Value meals at fast food restaurants are common as a merchandising tactic to facilitate bundling, up-selling, and price discrimination. Most of the time they can be upgraded to a larger side and drink for a small fee. The perceived creation of a \"discount\" on individual menu items in exchange for the purchase of a \"meal\" is also consistent with the loyalty marketing school of thought.\n\nTo make quick service possible and to ensure accuracy and security, many fast food restaurants have incorporated hospitality point of sale systems. This makes it possible for kitchen crew people to view orders placed at the front counter or drive through in real time. Wireless systems allow orders placed at drive through speakers to be taken by cashiers and cooks. Drive through and walk through configurations will allow orders to be taken at one register and paid at another. Modern point of sale systems can operate on computer networks using a variety of software programs. Sales records can be generated and remote access to computer reports can be given to corporate offices, managers, troubleshooters, and other authorized personnel.\n\nFood service chains partner with food equipment manufacturers to design highly specialized restaurant equipment, often incorporating heat sensors, timers, and other electronic controls into the design. Collaborative design techniques, such as rapid visualization and computer-aided design of restaurant kitchens are now being used to establish equipment specifications that are consistent with restaurant operating and merchandising requirements.\n\nIn the United States, consumers spent about US$110 billion on fast food in 2000 (which increased from $6 billion in 1970). The National Restaurant Association forecasts that fast food restaurants in the US will reach $142 billion in sales in 2006, a 5% increase over 2005. In comparison, the full-service restaurant segment of the food industry is expected to generate $173 billion in sales. Fast food has been losing market share to so-called fast casual restaurants, which offer more robust and expensive cuisines.\n\nMcDonald's, a fast food supplier, opened its first franchised restaurant in the US in 1955 (1974 in the UK). It has become a phenomenally successful enterprise in terms of financial growth, brand-name recognition, and worldwide expansion. Ray Kroc, who bought the franchising license from the McDonald brothers, pioneered concepts which emphasized standardization. He introduced uniform products, identical in all respects at each outlet, to increase sales. Kroc also insisted on cutting food costs as much as possible, eventually using the McDonald's Corporation's size to force suppliers to conform to this ethos.\n\nOther prominent international fast food companies include Burger King, the number two hamburger chain in the world, known for promoting its customized menu offerings (\"Have it Your Way\"). Another international fast food chain is KFC, which sells Chicken-related products and is the number 1 Fast Food company in the People's Republic of China.\n\nMultinational corporations typically modify their menus to cater to local tastes, and most overseas outlets are owned by native franchisees. McDonald's in India, for example, uses chicken and paneer rather than beef and pork in their burgers because Hinduism traditionally forbids eating beef. In Israel some McDonald's restaurants are kosher and respect the Jewish Shabbat; there is also a kosher McDonald's in Argentina. In Egypt, Indonesia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Singapore, all menu items are halal.\n\nMany fast food operations have more local and regional roots, such as White Castle in the Midwest United States, along with Hardee's (owned by CKE Restaurants, which also owns Carl's Jr., whose locations are primarily on the United States West Coast); Krystal, Bojangles' Famous Chicken 'n Biscuits, Cook Out, and Zaxby's restaurants in the American Southeast; Raising Cane's in Louisiana and other mostly Southern states; Hot 'n Now in Michigan and Wisconsin; In-N-Out Burger (in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Texas) and Original Tommy's chains in Southern California; Dick's Drive-In in Seattle, Washington and Arctic Circle in Utah and other western states; Halo Burger around Flint, Michigan and Burgerville in the Portland, Oregon area. Also, Whataburger is a popular burger chain in the American South, and Jack in the Box is located in the West and South. Canada pizza chains Topper's Pizza and Pizza Pizza are primarily located in Ontario. Coffee chain Country Style operates only in Ontario, and competes with the famous coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons. Maid-Rite restaurant is one of the oldest chain fast food restaurants in the United States. Founded in 1926, their specialty is a loose meat hamburger. Maid-Rites can be found in the midwest - mainly Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, and Missouri.\n\nInternational brands dominant in North America include McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's, the number three burger chain in the USA; Dunkin' Donuts, a New England-based chain; automobile oriented Sonic Drive-In's from Oklahoma City; Starbucks, Seattle-born coffee-based fast food beverage corporation; KFC and Taco Bell, which are both part of the largest restaurant conglomerate in the world, Yum! Brands; and Domino's Pizza, a pizza chain known for popularizing home delivery of fast food.\n\nSubway is known for their sub sandwiches and are the largest restaurant chain to serve such food items. Quiznos a Denver-based sub shop is another fast-growing sub chain, yet with over 6,000 locations it is still far behind Subway's 34,000 locations. Other smaller sub shops include Blimpie, Jersey Mike's Subs, Mr. Goodcents, Jimmy John's, and Firehouse.\n\nA&W Restaurants was originally a United States and Canada fast food brand, but it is currently an International fast food corporation in several countries.\n\nIn Canada the majority of fast food chains are American owned or were originally American owned but have since set up a Canadian management/headquarters locations such as Panera Bread, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Five Guys, and Carl's Jr.. Although the case is usually American fast food chains expanding into Canada, Canadian chains such as Tim Hortons have expanded into 22 states in the United States, but are more prominent in border states such as New York and Michigan. Tim Hortons has started to expand to other countries outside of North America. The Pita Pit franchise originated in Canada and has expanded to the United States and other Countries. The Canadian Extreme Pita franchise sells low fat and salt pita sandwiches with stores in the larger Canadian cities. Other Canadian fast food chains such as Manchu Wok serve North American style Asian foods; this company is located mainly in Canada and the USA, with other outlets on US military bases on other continents. Harvey's is a Canadian-only burger restaurant chain, present in every province.\n\nAustralia's fast food market began in the early 1970s, with the opening of several American franchises including McDonald's and KFC. Pizza Hut was introduced in the 1980s, and Burger King followed. However, the Burger King market found that this name was already a registered trademark to a takeaway food shop in Adelaide. Thus, the Burger King Australian market was forced to pick another name, selecting the Hungry Jack's brand name. Prior to this, the Australian fast food market consisted primarily of imports from the UK, fish and chips takeaway.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, many home based fast food operations were closed in the 1970s and 1980s after McDonald's became the number one outlet in the market. However, brands like Wimpy still remain, although the majority of branches became Burger King in 1989.\n\nIn addition to home-grown chains such as Supermac's, numerous American chains such as McDonald's and Burger King have also established a presence in Ireland. In 2015, a study developed by Treated.com was published in the Irish Times, which named Swords in County Dublin as Ireland's 'fast food capital'.\n\nAmerican chains such as Domino's Pizza, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and KFC have a big presence in Japan, but local gyudon chains such as Sukiya, Matsuya and Yoshinoya also blanket the country. Japan has its own burger chains including MOS Burger, Lotteria and Freshness Burger.\n\nThe major fast food chains in India which serve European/American food are KFC, McDonald's, Starbucks, Burger King, Subway, Pizza Hut, and Dominos. Most of these have had to make a lot of changes to their standard menus to cater to Indian food habits and taste preferences. Some emerging Indian food chains include Haldiram's, Faaso's, Chick King, Pitstop and Café Coffee Day.\n\nFood habits vary widely across states within India. While typical Idli/Dosa is fast food in Southern India, in Maharashtra it is misal-pav / pav-bhaji / pohe etc. Further north in Punjab/Haryana, Chole-bhature are very popular and in Bihar/Jharkhand litti-chokha is their staple fast food. Maintaining consistency in taste and texture of Indian fast food is a challenge and hence local chains are emerging armed with new food-technology.\n\nIn Nigeria, Mr. Bigg's, Chicken Republic, Tantalizers, and Tastee Fried Chicken are the predominant fast food chains. KFC and Domino's Pizza have recently entered the country.\n\nFast food In Pakistan varies. There are many international chains serving fast food, including Nandos, Burger King, KFC, McDonald's, Domino's Pizza, Fatburger, Dunkin' Donuts, Subway, Pizza Hut, Hardees, Telepizza, Steak Escape and Gloria Jean's Coffees. In addition to the international chains, in local cuisine people in Pakistan like to have biryani, bun kebabs, Nihari, kebab rolls etc. as fast food.\n\nMost international fast food chains like Subway, McDonald's, Burger King etc. are represented in major Russian cities. There are also local chains like Teremok specializing in Russian cuisine or having elements of it added into their menu.\n\nKFC is the most popular fast food chain in South Africa according to a 2010 \"Sunday Times\" survey. Chicken Licken, Wimpy and Ocean Basket along with Nando's and Steers are examples of homegrown franchises that are highly popular within the country. McDonald's, Subway and Pizza Hut have a significant presence within South Africa.\n\nIn Hong Kong, although McDonald's and KFC are quite popular, three major local fast food chains provide Hong Kong style fast food, namely Café de Coral, Fairwood, and Maxim MX. Café de Coral alone serves more than 300,000 customers daily. Unlike western fast food chains, these restaurants offer four different menus at different times of the day, namely breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner. \"Siu mei\" is offered throughout the day.\n\n\"Dai pai dong\" and traditional Hong Kong street food may be considered close relatives of the conventional fast food outlet.\n\nIn Israel, local burger chain Burger Ranch is popular as are McDonald's and Burger King. Domino's Pizza is also a popular fast food restaurant. Chains like McDonald's offer kosher branches. Non-kosher foods such as cheeseburgers are rare in Israeli fast food chains, even in non-kosher branches. There are many small local fast food chains that serve pizza, hamburgers, sushi and local foods such as hummus, falafel and shawarma.\n\nIn New Zealand, the fast food market began in the 1970s with KFC (opened 1971), Pizza Hut (1974), and McDonald's (1976), and all three remain popular today. Burger King and Domino's entered the market later in the 1990s. Australian pizza chains Eagle Boys and Pizza Haven also entered the market in the 1990s, but their New Zealand operations were later sold to Pizza Hut and Domino's.\n\nA few fast food chains have been founded in New Zealand, including Burger Fuel (founded 1995), Georgie Pie (founded 1977, but closed 1998 after falling into financial trouble and being bought out by McDonald's) and Hell Pizza (founded 1996).\n\nIn the Philippines, fast-food is the same as in the US. However, the only difference is that they serve Filipino dishes and a few American products being served Filipino-style. Jollibee is the leading fast food chain in the country with 1,000 stores nationwide.\n\nA fast food chain restaurant is generally owned either by the parent company of the fast food chain or a franchisee – an independent party given the right to use the company's trademark and trade name. In the latter case, a contract is made between the franchisee and the parent company, typically requiring the franchisee to pay an initial, fixed fee in addition to a continual percentage of monthly sales. Upon opening for business, the franchisee oversees the day-to-day operations of the restaurant and acts as a manager of the store. Once the contract expires, the parent company may choose to \"renew the contract, sell the franchise to another franchisee, or operate the restaurant itself.\" In most fast food chains, the number of franchised locations exceeds the number of company owned locations.\n\nFast food chains rely on consistency and uniformity, in internal operations and brand image, across all of their restaurant locations in order to convey a sense of reliability to their customers. This sense of reliability coupled with a positive customer experience brings customers to place trust in the company. This sense of trust leads to increased customer loyalty which gives the company a source of recurring business. When a person is presented with a choice of different restaurants to eat at, it is much easier for them to stick with what they know, rather than to take a gamble and dive into the unknown.\n\nDue to the importance of consistency, most companies set standards unifying their various restaurant locations with a set of common rules and regulations. Parent companies often rely on field representatives to ensure that the practices of franchised locations are consistent with the company's standards. However, the more locations a fast food chain has, the harder it is for the parent company to guarantee that these standards are being followed. Moreover, it is much more expensive to discharge a franchisee for noncompliance with company standards, than it is to discharge an employee for that same reason. As a consequence, parent companies tend to deal with franchisee violations in a more relaxed manner.\n\nFor the most part, someone visiting a McDonald's in the United States will have the same experience as someone visiting a McDonald's in Japan. The interior design, the menu, the speed of service, and the taste of the food will all be very similar. However, some differences do exist to tailor to particular cultural differences. For example, in October 2005 during a midst of plummeting sales in Japan, McDonald's added a shrimp burger to the Japanese menu. The choice to introduce a shrimp burger was no coincidence, as a 1989 study stated that world consumption of shrimp was \"led by Japan.\" \n\nIn March 2010, Taco Bell opened their first restaurant in India. Because non-consumption of beef is a cultural norm in light of India's Dharmic beliefs, Taco Bell had to tailor its menu to the dietary distinctions of Indian culture by replacing all of the beef with chicken. By the same token, completely meatless options were introduced to the menu due to the prevalence of vegetarianism throughout the country.\n\nSome of the large fast food chains are beginning to incorporate healthier alternatives in their menu, e.g., white meat, snack wraps, salads, and fresh fruit. However, some people see these moves as a tokenistic and commercial measure, rather than an appropriate reaction to ethical concerns about the world ecology and people's health. McDonald's announced that in March 2006, the chain would include nutritional information on the packaging of all of its products.\n\nIn September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption. It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\n\nFast food outlets have become popular with consumers for several reasons. One is that through economies of scale in purchasing and producing food, these companies can deliver food to consumers at a very low cost. In addition, although some people dislike fast food for its predictability, it can be reassuring to a hungry person in a hurry or far from home.\n\nIn the post-World War II period in the United States, fast food chains like McDonald's rapidly gained a reputation for their cleanliness, fast service, and a child-friendly atmosphere where families on the road could grab a quick meal, or seek a break from the routine of home cooking. Prior to the rise of the fast food chain restaurant, people generally had a choice between greasy spoon diners where the quality of the food was often questionable and service lacking, or high-end restaurants that were expensive and impractical for families with children. The modern, stream-lined convenience of the fast food restaurant provided a new alternative and appealed to Americans' instinct for ideas and products associated with progress, technology, and innovation. Fast food restaurants rapidly became the eatery \"everyone could agree on\", with many featuring child-size menu combos, play areas, and whimsical branding campaigns, like the iconic Ronald McDonald, designed to appeal to younger customers. Parents could have a few minutes of peace while children played or amused themselves with the toys included in their Happy Meal. There is a long history of fast food advertising campaigns, many of which are directed at children.\n\nFast food marketing largely focuses on children and teenagers. Popular methods of advertising include television, product placement in toys, games, educational materials, songs, and movies, character licensing and celebrity endorsements, and websites. Advertisements targeting children mainly focus on free toys, movie tie-ins and other giveaways. Fast food restaurants use kid's meals with toys, kid friendly mascots, vibrant colors, and play areas to draw children toward their products. . Children's power over their parents' purchases is estimated to total $300 to $500 billion every year. Fast food has become a part of American culture as a reward for children. To deny a child \"desirable things\" such as the advertised fast food restaurant can cause stigmatization of parents as the \"mean parent\" when it is common among other parents to comply with their child's desires.\n\nThe major focus on children by the fast food industry has created controversy due to the rising issue of children obesity in America. As a result of this focus, in 2008 a coalition was created and run by the Council of Better Business Bureaus called Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative(CFBAI), to stop ads aimed at children or to promote only what the council dubs \"better-for- you\" products in ads directed towards children. However, it was not until 2011 that Congress requested guidelines be put in place by the CFBAI, FDA, Agriculture Department, and Centers for Disease Control. There are two basic requirements identified in the guidelines for foods that are advertised for children: (1) The food has to include healthful ingredients; (2) The food can't contain unhealthful amounts of sugar, Saturated fat, Trans fat, and salt. The guidelines are voluntary but companies experience heavy pressure to comply. Once a company complies they have 5–10 years to comply with the guidelines. Many fast food industries have started to comply with the guidelines. Although many companies have ways to go. In 2012 the fast food industry spent $4.6 billion to advertise unhealthy products to children and teens according to a report by the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity. There are points of progress that include healthier sides and beverages in most fast food restaurant kids' meals. The guidelines are interested in a healthier lifestyle for children and the growing problem of American obesity.\n\nIn other parts of the world, American and American-style fast food outlets have been popular for their quality, customer service, and novelty, even though they are often the targets of popular anger towards American foreign policy or globalization more generally. Many consumers nonetheless see them as symbols of the wealth, progress, and well-ordered openness of Western society and they therefore become trendy attractions in many cities around the world, particularly among younger people with more varied tastes. \n\nOver time, fast food restaurants have been growing rapidly, especially in urban neighborhoods. According to US research, low-income and predominantly African-American neighborhoods have greater exposure to fast food outlets than higher income and predominantly white areas. This has put into question whether urbanized neighborhoods were targeted, which causes a more unhealthy group of people compared to people from a higher socioeconomic status. It has also been shown that there is a lower chance of finding a fast food restaurant in a suburban neighborhood. In a study of selected US locations, Morland et al. (2002) found the number of fast food restaurants and bars was inversely proportional to the wealth of the neighborhood, and that predominantly African-American residential areas were four times less likely to have a supermarket near them than predominantly white areas.\n\n\nThe introduction of the halal option by some fast food companies saw the expansion of fast food chains into Muslim majority countries has resulted in a rise of restaurant options in non-western nations and has also increased revenue for some western restaurant chains. Some outlets offering Halal options include KFC, Nando's, Pizza Express, and Subway. McDonald's carried out a trial but decided that the cost of operations would be too high. There have also been court cases involving start-up businesses during attempts to alter the halal-certified method by machine killing, which is against the beliefs of some Muslims. However, the trend towards halal has been unpopular in some communities which have at times resulted in internet petitions.\n\nThe fast food industry is a popular target for critics, from anti-globalization activists like José Bové to vegetarian activist groups such as PETA as well as the workers themselves. A number of fast food worker strikes occurred in the United States in the 2010s.\n\nIn his best-selling 2001 book \"Fast Food Nation\", investigative journalist Eric Schlosser leveled a broad, socioeconomic critique against the fast food industry, documenting how fast food rose from small, family-run businesses (like the McDonald brothers' burger joint) into large, multinational corporate juggernauts whose economies of scale radically transformed agriculture, meat processing, and labor markets in the late twentieth century. Schlosser argues that while the innovations of the fast food industry gave Americans more and cheaper dining options, it has come at the price of destroying the environment, economy, and small-town communities of rural America while shielding consumers from the real costs of their convenient meal, both in terms of health and the broader impact of large-scale food production and processing on workers, animals, and land.\n\nThe fast food industry is popular in the United States, the source of most of its innovation, and many major international chains are based there. Seen as symbols of US dominance and perceived cultural imperialism, American fast food franchises have often been the target of Anti-globalization protests and demonstrations against the US government. In 2005, for example, rioters in Karachi, Pakistan, who were initially angered because of the bombing of a Shiite mosque, destroyed a KFC restaurant.\n\nIn 2003, McDonald's was sued in a New York court by a family who claimed that the restaurant chain was responsible for their teenage daughter's obesity and attendant health problems. By manipulating food's taste, sugar and fat content, and directing their advertising to children, the suit argued that the company purposely misleads the public about the nutritional value of its product. A judge dismissed the case, but the fast food industry disliked the publicity of its practices, particularly the way it targets children in its advertising. Although further lawsuits have not materialized, the issue is kept alive in the media and political circles by those promoting the need for tort reform.\n\nIn response to this, the \"Cheeseburger Bill\" was passed by the US House of Representatives in 2004; it later stalled in the US Senate. The law was reintroduced in 2005, only to meet the same fate. This law was claimed to \"[ban] frivolous lawsuits against producers and sellers of food and non-alcoholic drinks arising from obesity claims.\"\nThe bill arose because of an increase in lawsuits against fast food chains by people who claimed that eating their products \"made\" them obese, disassociating themselves from any of the blame.\n\n\n"

                "Visual communication\n\nVisual communication is communication through a visual aid and is described as the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. Visual communication in part or whole relies on vision, and is primarily presented or expressed with two-dimensional images, it includes signs, typography, drawing, graphic design, illustration, industrial design, advertising, animation colour and electronic resources. It also explores the idea that a visual message accompanying text has a greater power to inform, educate, or persuade a person or audience to make an impact.\n\nVisual communication is carried out through visual aids.\nThe evaluation of a good visual communication design is mainly based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on personal aesthetic and/or artistic preference as there are no universally agreed-upon principles of beauty and ugliness. Excluding two dimensional images, there are other ways to express information visually - gestures and body language, animation (digital or analogue), and film. Visual communication by e-mail, a textual medium, is commonly expressed with ASCII art, emoticons, and embedded digital images.\n\nThe term 'visual presentation' is used to refer to the actual presentation of information through a visible medium such as text or images. Recent research in the field has focused on web design and graphically-oriented usability. Graphic designers also use methods of visual communication in their professional practice. Visual communication on the World Wide Web is perhaps the most important form of communication that takes place while users are surfing the Internet. When experiencing the web, one uses THE eyes as the primary sense, and therefore the visual presentation of a website is very important for users to understand the message or of the communication taking place.The Eye of Horus is often referred to as the symbol of visual communication. It is said to be a representation of an eclipse, as the corona around the pupil is like the corona around the sun during a solar eclipse.\n\nAldous Huxley is highly regarded as one of the most prominent explorers of visual communication and sight-related theories. Becoming near-blind in his teen years as the result of an illness set the stage for what would make him one of the most intellectual people to have ever explored visual communication. His work includes important novels on the dehumanizing aspects of scientific progress, most famously \"Brave New World\" and \"The Art of Seeing\". He described \"seeing\" as being the sum of sensing, selecting, and perceiving. One of his most famous quotes is \"The more you see, the more you know.\"\n\nMax Wertheimer is said to be the father of Gestalt psychology. Gestalt means \"form\" or \"shape\" in German, and the study of Gestalt psychology show emphasis in simplicity, as its properties group visuals by similarity in shape or color and proximity. Looking for continuation, closure, and figure-ground principles in studied images is also intensively taught.\n\nStudents studying visual communication are taught the basic physics of light, anatomy and physiology of the eye, cognitive and perception theories, colour theories, Gestalt psychology, aesthetics, natural reading patterns, design principles, semiotics, persuasion, camera/filming actions and image-types, and so forth. Colleges for visual communications differ in their approach, but most combine theory and practice in some form.\n\nVisual communication takes place through pictures, graphs and charts, as well as through signs, signals and symbols. It may be used either independently or as an adjunct to the other methods of communication.\n\nVisual communication contains image aspects. The interpretation of images is subjective and to understand the depth of meaning, or multiple meanings, communicated in an image requires analysis. Images can be analysed though many perspectives, for example these six major perspectives presented by Paul Martin Lester:\n\nWhen a viewer has an opinion about an image based on their personal thoughts. Personal response depends on the viewer’s thoughts and values individually. This might be sometimes in conflict with cultural values. Also when a viewer has viewed an image with a personal perspective, it is hard to change the view of the image on the viewer, and the image can even be seen in other ways.\n\nAn image’s view can be arising from the history of the use media. Through times sort images have been changed, because the use of different (new) media. For example: The result of using the computer to edit images (e.g. Photoshop) is quite different when comparing images that are made and edited by craft.\n\nWhen the view of an image is influenced by the use of lights, position and the presentation of the image. The right use of light, position and presentation of the image can improve the view of the image. It makes the image looks better than the reality.\n\nFrom this perspective, the maker of the image, the viewer and the image itself must be responsible morally and ethically to the image. This perspective is also categorized in six categories: categorical imperative, utilitarianism, hedonism, golden mean, golden rule and veil of ignorance.\n\nSymbolization is an important definition for this perspective. Cultural perspective involves identity of symbols. The uses of words that are related with the image, the use of heroes in the image, etc. are the symbolization of the image. The cultural perspective can also be seen as the semiotic perspective.\n\nThe view of images in the critical perspective is when the viewers criticise the images, but the critics have been made in interests of the society, although an individual makes the critics. This way this perspective differs from the personal perspective.\n\nVisual aids are often used to help audiences of informative and persuasive speeches understand the topic being presented. Visual aids can play a large role in how the audience understands and takes in information that is presented. There are many different types of visual aids that range from handouts to PowerPoints. The type of visual aid a speaker uses depends on their preference and the information they are trying to present. Each type of visual aid has pros and cons that must be evaluated to ensure it will be beneficial to the overall presentation. Before incorporating visual aids into speeches, the speaker should understand that if used incorrectly, the visual will not be an aid, but a distraction.Planning ahead is important when using visual aids. It is necessary to choose a visual aid that is appropriate for the material and audience. The purpose of the visual aid is to \"enhance\" the presentation.\n\nObjects\n\nModels\n\nGraphs\n\nMaps\n\nTables\n\nPhotographs\n\nDrawings or diagrams\n\nChalkboards and whiteboards are very useful visual aids, particularly when more advanced types of media are unavailable. They are cheap and also allow for much flexibility.\nThe use of chalkboards or whiteboards is convenient, but they are not a perfect visual aid. Often, using this medium as an aid can create confusion or boredom. Particularly if a student who is not familiar with how to properly use visual aids attempts to draw on a board while they are speaking, they detract time and attention from their actual speech.\n\nA poster is a very simple and easy visual aid. Posters can display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations. The biggest drawback of using a poster as a visual aid is that often a poster can appear unprofessional. Since a poster board paper is relatively flimsy, often the paper will bend or fall over. The best way to present a poster is to hang it up or tape it to a wall.\n\nHandouts can also display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations. An important aspect of the use of a handout is that a person can keep a handout with them long after the presentation is over. This can help the person better remember what was discussed. Passing out handouts, however, can be extremely distracting. Once a handout is given out, it might potentially be difficult to bring back your audience’s attention. The person who receives the handout might be tempted to read what is on the paper, which will keep them from listening to what the speaker is saying. If using a handout, the speaker distributes the hand out right before you reference it. Distributing handouts is acceptable in a lecture that is an hour or two, but in a short lecture of five to ten minutes, a handout should not be used.\n\nA video can be a great visual aid and attention grabber, however, a video is not a replacement for an actual speech. There are several potential drawbacks to playing a video during a speech or lecture. First, if a video is playing that includes audio, the speaker will not be able to talk. Also, if the video is very exciting and interesting, it can make what the speaker is saying appear boring and uninteresting. The key to showing a video during a presentation is to make sure to transition smoothly into the video and to only show very short clips.\n\nThere are several types of projectors. These include slide projectors, PowerPoint presentations, overhead projectors, and computer projectors. Slide projectors are the oldest form of projector, and are no longer used. PowerPoint presentations are very popular and are used often. Overhead projectors are still used but are somewhat inconvenient to use. In order to use an overhead projector, a transparency must be made of whatever is being projected onto the screen. This takes time and costs money. Computer projectors are the most technologically advanced projectors. When using a computer projector, pictures and slides are easily taken right from a computer either online or from a saved file and are blown up and shown on a large screen. Though computer projectors are technologically advanced, they are not always completely reliable because technological breakdowns are not uncommon of the computers of today.\n\nPowerPoint presentations can be an extremely useful visual aid, especially for longer presentations. For five- to ten-minute presentations, it is probably not worth the time or effort to put together a PowerPoint. For longer presentations, however, PowerPoints can be a great way to keep the audience engaged and keep the speaker on track. A potential drawback of using a PowerPoint is that it usually takes a lot of time and energy to put together. There is also the possibility of a computer malfunction, which can mess up the flow of a presentation.\n\nSocial media is one of the most effective ways to communicate. The incorporation of text and images deliver messages quicker and more simplistic through social media platforms. A potential drawback can be there is limited access due to the internet access requirement and certain limitations to the number of characters and image size.\n\n",
                "Graphic communication\n\nGraphic communication as the name suggests is communication using graphic elements. These elements include symbols such as glyphs and icons, images such as drawings and photographs, and can include the passive contributions of substrate, color and surroundings. It is the process of creating, producing, and distributing material incorporating words and images to convey data, concepts, and emotions.\n\nThe field of graphic communications encompasses all phases of the graphic communications processes from origination of the idea (design, layout, and typography) through reproduction, finishing and distribution of two- or three-dimensional products or electronic transmission.\n\nGraphic communication involves the use of visual material to relate ideas such as drawings, photographs, slides, and sketches. The drawings of plans and refinements and a rough map sketched to show the way could be considered graphical communication.\n\nAny medium that uses a graphics to aid in conveying a message, instruction, or an idea is involved in graphical communication. One of the most widely used forms of graphical communication is the drawing.\n\nThe earliest graphics known to anthropologists studying prehistoric periods are cave paintings and markings on boulders, bone, ivory, and antlers, which were created during the Upper Paleolithic period from 40,000–10,000 B.C. or earlier. Many of these played a major role in geometry. They used graphics to represent their mathematical theories such as the Circle Theorem and the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nGraphics are visual presentations on some surface, such as a wall, canvas, computer screen, paper, or stone to brand, inform, illustrate, or entertain. Examples are photographs, drawings, line art, graphs, diagrams, typography, numbers, symbols, geometric designs, maps, engineering drawings, or other images. Graphics often combine text, illustration, and color. Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.\n\nGraphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred.\n\nCommunication is the process whereby information is imparted by a sender to a receiver via a medium. It requires that all parties have an area of communicative commonality. There are auditory means, such as speaking, singing and sometimes tone of voice, and nonverbal, physical means, such as body language, sign language, paralanguage, touch, eye contact, by using writing. Communication is defined as a process by which we assign and convey meaning in an attempt to create shared understanding. This process requires a vast repertoire of skills in intrapersonal and interpersonal processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, analyzing, and evaluating. if you use these processes it is developmental and transfers to all areas of life: home, school, community, work, and beyond. It is through communication that collaboration and cooperation occur.\n\nVisual communication as the name suggests is communication through visual aid. It is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. Primarily associated with two dimensional images, it includes: signs, typography, drawing, graphic design, illustration, colour and electronic resources. It solely relies on vision. It is a form of communication with visual effect. It explores the idea that a visual message with text has a greater power to inform, educate or persuade a person. It is communication by presenting information through Visual form. The evaluation of a good visual design is based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on aesthetic or artistic preference. There are no universally agreed-upon principles of beauty and ugliness. There exists a variety of ways to present information visually, like gestures, body languages, video and TV. Here, focus is on the presentation of text, pictures, diagrams, photos, et cetera, integrated on a computer display. The term visual presentation is used to refer to the actual presentation of information. Recent research in the field has focused on web design and graphically oriented usability. Graphic designers use methods of visual communication in their professional practice.\n\nCommunication design is a mixed discipline between design and information-development which is concerned with how intermission such as printed, crafted, electronic media or presentations communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the message aside from the aesthetics in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic business thinking, utilizing market research, creativity, and problem-solving.\n\nThe term graphic design can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines which focus on visual communication and presentation. Various methods are used to create and combine symbols, images and/or words to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to produce the final result. Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.\n\nCommon uses of graphic design include magazines, advertisements, product packaging and web design. For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as shapes and color which unify the piece. Composition is one of the most important features of graphic design especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.\n\nThe term representation, according to O'Shaughnessy and Stadler (2005), can carry a range of meanings and interpretations. In literary theory representation is commonly defined in three ways.\n\nRepresentation, according to Mitchell (1995), began with early literary theory in the ideas of Plato and Aristotle, and has evolved into a significant component of language, Saussurian and communication studies. Aristotle discusses representation in three ways:\nThe \"means\" of literary representation is language. The means of graphical representation are graphics. Graphical representation of data is one of the most commonly used modes of presentation.\nThe purpose of graphical communication is transfer message or information to the receiver in effective way.when professional organizations prepare reports then usually use the mode of graphical presentations.\n\n\n\n",
                "Visual rhetoric\n\nVisual rhetoric is the fairly recent development of a theoretical framework describing how visual images communicate meaning, as opposed to aural, verbal, or other messages. Visual rhetoric generally falls under a group of terms, which all encompass visual literacy. Purdue OWL defines visual literacy as one's ability to \"read\" an image. In other words, it is one's ability to understand what an image is attempting to communicate. This includes understanding creative choices made with the image such as coloring, shading, and object placement. This type of awareness comes from an understanding how images communicate meaning, also known as visual rhetoric. The study of visual rhetoric is different from that of visual or graphic design, in that it emphasizes images as sensory expressions of cultural meaning, as opposed to purely aesthetic consideration. Visual rhetoric has been approached from a variety of academic fields of study such as art history, linguistics, semiotics, cultural studies, business and technical communication, speech communication, and classical rhetoric. As a result, it can be difficult to discern the exact relationship between different parts of the field of visual rhetoric. Some examples of artifacts analyzed by visual rhetoricians are charts, paintings, sculpture, videogames, diagrams, web pages, advertisements, movies, architecture, newspapers, or photographs. Visual rhetoric seeks to develop rhetorical theory in a way that is more comprehensive and inclusive with regard to images and their interpretations. Visual images and material objects have become more relevant in light of recent technological developments for understanding general communicative means. Visual rhetoric is a conscious, communicative decision; the colors, form, medium, and size is chosen on purpose.<ref name=\"10/21/13\"></ref> However, a person may come in contact with a sign, but if they have no relation to the sign, its message is arbitrary. Therefore, in order for artifacts or products to be conceptualized as visual rhetoric, they must have three characteristics: they must be symbolic, involve human intervention, and be presented to an audience for the purpose of communicating.\n\nThe exact history of the field of visual rhetoric is difficult to trace, as it could be argued that \"visual rhetoric\" has been studied and practiced as long as images have. The term emerged largely as a mechanism to set aside a certain area of study and to focus attention on the specific rhetorical traits of visual mediums. In the history of rhetoric, study has been geared toward linguistics. Visual symbols were deemed trivial and subservient, thus were largely ignored. As a result, rhetorical theory has been created with a significant exclusion of visual rhetoric. As visual rhetoric is studied, it catalyzes a series of challenges against linguistic rhetoric altogether. Linguistic rhetoric alone creates many boundaries, and the holistic picture emerges with the introduction of visual elements. According to Sonja Foss, scholars of visual rhetoric analyze photographs, drawings, paintings, graphs and tables, interior design and architecture, sculpture, Internet images, and film. From a rhetorical perspective, the focus is on the contextual response rather than the aesthetic response. An aesthetic response is a viewer's direct perception with the sensory aspects of the visual, whereas with a rhetorical response, meaning is given to the visual. Suddenly, every part of the artifact has significance in the message being conveyed; each line, each shading, each person has a purpose.\n\nSonja Foss states that while studying visual objects, rhetorical scholars tend to have three areas of study: nature, function, or evaluation. Nature encompasses the literal components of the artifact. This is a primary focus of visual rhetoric because to understand the function of an image, it is necessary to understand the substantive and stylistic nature of the artifact itself. For Foss, function holds a somewhat literal definition—it represents the function (or perhaps purpose) an image serves for an audience. The emotion an image aims to evoke is its function. The evaluation of an artifact determines if the image serves its function3. For example, if the nature of an image is dark and edgy, and the function of the image is to instill fear in the audience, the evaluation would determine whether the audience was scared.\n\nAs shown in the works of the Groupe µ, visual rhetoric is closely related to the study of semiotics. Semiotic theory seeks to describe the rhetorical significance of sign-making. Visual rhetoric is a broader study, covering all the visual ways humans try to communicate, outside academic policing. Visual rhetoric applies visual images to convey messages and images are composed of elements including \"size, color, line, and shape.\" In images, meanings are created by the layout and spatial positions of these elements. The entities that constitute an image are socially, politically, and culturally constructed. The same image may represent different rhetorical meanings to people from different societies and cultures. To achieve rhetorical effects and convey messages accurately, the choice of the elements in an image and the arrangements of them should fit certain audiences, societies, and cultures.\n\nIn \"The Rhetoric of the Image,\" French theorist Roland Barthes also examines the semiotic nature of images, and the ways that images function to communicate specific messages. Barthes pointed out that messages transmitted by visual images include linguistic, coded iconic and non-coded iconic messages. Phillips and McQuarrie (2004) categorize visual rhetorical images into two dimensions: meaning operation and visual structure. Meaning operation refers to the relations and connections between elements in visual images. Visual structure refers to the way that the elements are visually displayed.\n\nVisual tropes and tropic thinking are a part of visual rhetoric (the art of visual persuasion and visual communication using visual images). The study includes, but is not limited to, the various ways in which it can be applied throughout visual art history.\n\nAlthough visual rhetoric is more commonly linked with areas such as marketing, advertising, and art, it pervades in every medium in culture- even science. Critic, Nathan Stormer, offers such an analysis of visual rhetoric surrounding images of reproduction, using The Miracle of Life as his scientific artifact. Although producer Lennart Nilson, rejects any responsibility for establishing \"apparent truths\" saying \"I am not the man who shall decide when human life started. I am a reporter. I am a photographer\", Stormer argues that the portrayal of the reproductive journey found its way into political definitions of \"life\" exemplifying American people's reliance on biology and science to understand all unknown human processes. Stormer argues that the film is deeply problematic because its effect \"deems the creation of human life a value that supersedes cultural and individual considerations and that centralizes life's worth in reproductive structures and practices.\" Nilson's inspired images of the fetus became a central part of pro-life visual claims that life is real after conception. Stormer argues that his portrayal of the virtual body serves as the foundation for medical discourse about life versus death and supports a vision of the \"normalized\", gendered, heterosexual individual for the public to consume as scientific truth. He calls upon specific examples in the film such as the visual power given to sex hormones that appear to dominate the cycle of reproduction and create a gendered narrative. The sperm are \"proactive agents\" who \"make rational decisions based on the economy and politics of the woman's reproductive system\" while the egg \"waits\" and then \"nurtures\". Stormer critiques the reproduction cycle as primal, based on gender, and beyond our control in the exterior world as well. He urges consumers of visual rhetoric, even if it appears to be absolute truth, to be aware of its construction as purposeful, bias, and reflective of culture. \"When considering definitions of life and our bodily rights in terms of sexual practices, we should question established truths carefully because rhetoric such as Nilson's is often unwittingly accorded the status of absolute truth.\"\n\nThe field of composition studies has recently (re)turned its attention to visual rhetoric. In an increasingly visual society, proponents of visual rhetoric in composition classes suggest that an increased literacy requires skill not only with writing but also with visual communication. This skill relates to an understanding of the mediated nature of all communication, and to an awareness of the act of representation. Visual rhetoric can be merged into a composition classroom to assist in writing development. Student writers can first be assigned an observation task, for example, observing a work of art in a museum. Based on the observation, instructors design a series of writing activities, from easy to difficult: a descriptive paragraph, an entertaining poem, a short essay on learning experience, a narrative, and a long essay on their own subjects. The writing activities can also be combined with in-class or off-class readings, guiding students through the process of writing.\n\nGraffiti is a \"pictorial or visual inscription on a accessible surface.\" According to Hanauer, Graffiti achieves three functions; the first is to allow marginalized texts to participate in the public discourse, the second is that graffiti serves the purpose of expressing openly \"controversial contents\", and the third is to allow \"marginal groups to the possibility of expressing themselves publicly.\" Gross and Gross indicated that graffiti is capable of serving a rhetorical purpose. In addition, Wiens' (2014) research showed that graffiti can be considered an alternative way of creating rhetorical meaning for issues such as homelessness.\n\nThe \"canonical approach\" to studying visual rhetoric relates visual concepts to the canons of Western classical rhetoric (Inventio, Dispositio, Elocutio, Memoria and Pronuntiatio). In the textbook \"Designing Visual Language: Strategies for Professional Communicators,\" its authors list six canons which guide the rhetorical impact of a document: arrangement, emphasis, clarity, conciseness, tone and ethos. According to Kostelnick and Roberts these canons can be defined as:\n\nThese six visual cognates provide an extension of classical rhetoric that can be used as a starting point for analyzing images rhetorically.\n\nVisual rhetoric is usually used to denote non-textual artifacts, yet any mark on a surface—including text—can be seen as \"visual.\" Consider the texts available at Project Gutenberg. These \"plain vanilla\" texts, lacking any visual connection to their original, published forms, nevertheless suggest important questions about visual rhetoric. Their bare-bones manner of presentation implies, for example, that the \"words themselves\" are more important than the visual forms in which the words were originally presented. Given that such texts can easily be read by a speech synthesizer, they also suggest important questions about the relationship between writing and speech, or orality and literacy.\n\n\n"

                "Visual communication\n\nVisual communication is communication through a visual aid and is described as the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. Visual communication in part or whole relies on vision, and is primarily presented or expressed with two-dimensional images, it includes signs, typography, drawing, graphic design, illustration, industrial design, advertising, animation colour and electronic resources. It also explores the idea that a visual message accompanying text has a greater power to inform, educate, or persuade a person or audience to make an impact.\n\nVisual communication is carried out through visual aids.\nThe evaluation of a good visual communication design is mainly based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on personal aesthetic and/or artistic preference as there are no universally agreed-upon principles of beauty and ugliness. Excluding two dimensional images, there are other ways to express information visually - gestures and body language, animation (digital or analogue), and film. Visual communication by e-mail, a textual medium, is commonly expressed with ASCII art, emoticons, and embedded digital images.\n\nThe term 'visual presentation' is used to refer to the actual presentation of information through a visible medium such as text or images. Recent research in the field has focused on web design and graphically-oriented usability. Graphic designers also use methods of visual communication in their professional practice. Visual communication on the World Wide Web is perhaps the most important form of communication that takes place while users are surfing the Internet. When experiencing the web, one uses THE eyes as the primary sense, and therefore the visual presentation of a website is very important for users to understand the message or of the communication taking place.The Eye of Horus is often referred to as the symbol of visual communication. It is said to be a representation of an eclipse, as the corona around the pupil is like the corona around the sun during a solar eclipse.\n\nAldous Huxley is highly regarded as one of the most prominent explorers of visual communication and sight-related theories. Becoming near-blind in his teen years as the result of an illness set the stage for what would make him one of the most intellectual people to have ever explored visual communication. His work includes important novels on the dehumanizing aspects of scientific progress, most famously \"Brave New World\" and \"The Art of Seeing\". He described \"seeing\" as being the sum of sensing, selecting, and perceiving. One of his most famous quotes is \"The more you see, the more you know.\"\n\nMax Wertheimer is said to be the father of Gestalt psychology. Gestalt means \"form\" or \"shape\" in German, and the study of Gestalt psychology show emphasis in simplicity, as its properties group visuals by similarity in shape or color and proximity. Looking for continuation, closure, and figure-ground principles in studied images is also intensively taught.\n\nStudents studying visual communication are taught the basic physics of light, anatomy and physiology of the eye, cognitive and perception theories, colour theories, Gestalt psychology, aesthetics, natural reading patterns, design principles, semiotics, persuasion, camera/filming actions and image-types, and so forth. Colleges for visual communications differ in their approach, but most combine theory and practice in some form.\n\nVisual communication takes place through pictures, graphs and charts, as well as through signs, signals and symbols. It may be used either independently or as an adjunct to the other methods of communication.\n\nVisual communication contains image aspects. The interpretation of images is subjective and to understand the depth of meaning, or multiple meanings, communicated in an image requires analysis. Images can be analysed though many perspectives, for example these six major perspectives presented by Paul Martin Lester:\n\nWhen a viewer has an opinion about an image based on their personal thoughts. Personal response depends on the viewer’s thoughts and values individually. This might be sometimes in conflict with cultural values. Also when a viewer has viewed an image with a personal perspective, it is hard to change the view of the image on the viewer, and the image can even be seen in other ways.\n\nAn image’s view can be arising from the history of the use media. Through times sort images have been changed, because the use of different (new) media. For example: The result of using the computer to edit images (e.g. Photoshop) is quite different when comparing images that are made and edited by craft.\n\nWhen the view of an image is influenced by the use of lights, position and the presentation of the image. The right use of light, position and presentation of the image can improve the view of the image. It makes the image looks better than the reality.\n\nFrom this perspective, the maker of the image, the viewer and the image itself must be responsible morally and ethically to the image. This perspective is also categorized in six categories: categorical imperative, utilitarianism, hedonism, golden mean, golden rule and veil of ignorance.\n\nSymbolization is an important definition for this perspective. Cultural perspective involves identity of symbols. The uses of words that are related with the image, the use of heroes in the image, etc. are the symbolization of the image. The cultural perspective can also be seen as the semiotic perspective.\n\nThe view of images in the critical perspective is when the viewers criticise the images, but the critics have been made in interests of the society, although an individual makes the critics. This way this perspective differs from the personal perspective.\n\nVisual aids are often used to help audiences of informative and persuasive speeches understand the topic being presented. Visual aids can play a large role in how the audience understands and takes in information that is presented. There are many different types of visual aids that range from handouts to PowerPoints. The type of visual aid a speaker uses depends on their preference and the information they are trying to present. Each type of visual aid has pros and cons that must be evaluated to ensure it will be beneficial to the overall presentation. Before incorporating visual aids into speeches, the speaker should understand that if used incorrectly, the visual will not be an aid, but a distraction.Planning ahead is important when using visual aids. It is necessary to choose a visual aid that is appropriate for the material and audience. The purpose of the visual aid is to \"enhance\" the presentation.\n\nObjects\n\nModels\n\nGraphs\n\nMaps\n\nTables\n\nPhotographs\n\nDrawings or diagrams\n\nChalkboards and whiteboards are very useful visual aids, particularly when more advanced types of media are unavailable. They are cheap and also allow for much flexibility.\nThe use of chalkboards or whiteboards is convenient, but they are not a perfect visual aid. Often, using this medium as an aid can create confusion or boredom. Particularly if a student who is not familiar with how to properly use visual aids attempts to draw on a board while they are speaking, they detract time and attention from their actual speech.\n\nA poster is a very simple and easy visual aid. Posters can display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations. The biggest drawback of using a poster as a visual aid is that often a poster can appear unprofessional. Since a poster board paper is relatively flimsy, often the paper will bend or fall over. The best way to present a poster is to hang it up or tape it to a wall.\n\nHandouts can also display charts, graphs, pictures, or illustrations. An important aspect of the use of a handout is that a person can keep a handout with them long after the presentation is over. This can help the person better remember what was discussed. Passing out handouts, however, can be extremely distracting. Once a handout is given out, it might potentially be difficult to bring back your audience’s attention. The person who receives the handout might be tempted to read what is on the paper, which will keep them from listening to what the speaker is saying. If using a handout, the speaker distributes the hand out right before you reference it. Distributing handouts is acceptable in a lecture that is an hour or two, but in a short lecture of five to ten minutes, a handout should not be used.\n\nA video can be a great visual aid and attention grabber, however, a video is not a replacement for an actual speech. There are several potential drawbacks to playing a video during a speech or lecture. First, if a video is playing that includes audio, the speaker will not be able to talk. Also, if the video is very exciting and interesting, it can make what the speaker is saying appear boring and uninteresting. The key to showing a video during a presentation is to make sure to transition smoothly into the video and to only show very short clips.\n\nThere are several types of projectors. These include slide projectors, PowerPoint presentations, overhead projectors, and computer projectors. Slide projectors are the oldest form of projector, and are no longer used. PowerPoint presentations are very popular and are used often. Overhead projectors are still used but are somewhat inconvenient to use. In order to use an overhead projector, a transparency must be made of whatever is being projected onto the screen. This takes time and costs money. Computer projectors are the most technologically advanced projectors. When using a computer projector, pictures and slides are easily taken right from a computer either online or from a saved file and are blown up and shown on a large screen. Though computer projectors are technologically advanced, they are not always completely reliable because technological breakdowns are not uncommon of the computers of today.\n\nPowerPoint presentations can be an extremely useful visual aid, especially for longer presentations. For five- to ten-minute presentations, it is probably not worth the time or effort to put together a PowerPoint. For longer presentations, however, PowerPoints can be a great way to keep the audience engaged and keep the speaker on track. A potential drawback of using a PowerPoint is that it usually takes a lot of time and energy to put together. There is also the possibility of a computer malfunction, which can mess up the flow of a presentation.\n\nSocial media is one of the most effective ways to communicate. The incorporation of text and images deliver messages quicker and more simplistic through social media platforms. A potential drawback can be there is limited access due to the internet access requirement and certain limitations to the number of characters and image size.\n\n",
                "Graphic communication\n\nGraphic communication as the name suggests is communication using graphic elements. These elements include symbols such as glyphs and icons, images such as drawings and photographs, and can include the passive contributions of substrate, color and surroundings. It is the process of creating, producing, and distributing material incorporating words and images to convey data, concepts, and emotions.\n\nThe field of graphic communications encompasses all phases of the graphic communications processes from origination of the idea (design, layout, and typography) through reproduction, finishing and distribution of two- or three-dimensional products or electronic transmission.\n\nGraphic communication involves the use of visual material to relate ideas such as drawings, photographs, slides, and sketches. The drawings of plans and refinements and a rough map sketched to show the way could be considered graphical communication.\n\nAny medium that uses a graphics to aid in conveying a message, instruction, or an idea is involved in graphical communication. One of the most widely used forms of graphical communication is the drawing.\n\nThe earliest graphics known to anthropologists studying prehistoric periods are cave paintings and markings on boulders, bone, ivory, and antlers, which were created during the Upper Paleolithic period from 40,000–10,000 B.C. or earlier. Many of these played a major role in geometry. They used graphics to represent their mathematical theories such as the Circle Theorem and the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nGraphics are visual presentations on some surface, such as a wall, canvas, computer screen, paper, or stone to brand, inform, illustrate, or entertain. Examples are photographs, drawings, line art, graphs, diagrams, typography, numbers, symbols, geometric designs, maps, engineering drawings, or other images. Graphics often combine text, illustration, and color. Graphic design may consist of the deliberate selection, creation, or arrangement of typography alone, as in a brochure, flier, poster, web site, or book without any other element. Clarity or effective communication may be the objective, association with other cultural elements may be sought, or merely, the creation of a distinctive style.\n\nGraphics can be functional or artistic. The latter can be a recorded version, such as a photograph, or an interpretation by a scientist to highlight essential features, or an artist, in which case the distinction with imaginary graphics may become blurred.\n\nCommunication is the process whereby information is imparted by a sender to a receiver via a medium. It requires that all parties have an area of communicative commonality. There are auditory means, such as speaking, singing and sometimes tone of voice, and nonverbal, physical means, such as body language, sign language, paralanguage, touch, eye contact, by using writing. Communication is defined as a process by which we assign and convey meaning in an attempt to create shared understanding. This process requires a vast repertoire of skills in intrapersonal and interpersonal processing, listening, observing, speaking, questioning, analyzing, and evaluating. if you use these processes it is developmental and transfers to all areas of life: home, school, community, work, and beyond. It is through communication that collaboration and cooperation occur.\n\nVisual communication as the name suggests is communication through visual aid. It is the conveyance of ideas and information in forms that can be read or looked upon. Primarily associated with two dimensional images, it includes: signs, typography, drawing, graphic design, illustration, colour and electronic resources. It solely relies on vision. It is a form of communication with visual effect. It explores the idea that a visual message with text has a greater power to inform, educate or persuade a person. It is communication by presenting information through Visual form. The evaluation of a good visual design is based on measuring comprehension by the audience, not on aesthetic or artistic preference. There are no universally agreed-upon principles of beauty and ugliness. There exists a variety of ways to present information visually, like gestures, body languages, video and TV. Here, focus is on the presentation of text, pictures, diagrams, photos, et cetera, integrated on a computer display. The term visual presentation is used to refer to the actual presentation of information. Recent research in the field has focused on web design and graphically oriented usability. Graphic designers use methods of visual communication in their professional practice.\n\nCommunication design is a mixed discipline between design and information-development which is concerned with how intermission such as printed, crafted, electronic media or presentations communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the message aside from the aesthetics in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic business thinking, utilizing market research, creativity, and problem-solving.\n\nThe term graphic design can refer to a number of artistic and professional disciplines which focus on visual communication and presentation. Various methods are used to create and combine symbols, images and/or words to create a visual representation of ideas and messages. A graphic designer may use typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to produce the final result. Graphic design often refers to both the process (designing) by which the communication is created and the products (designs) which are generated.\n\nCommon uses of graphic design include magazines, advertisements, product packaging and web design. For example, a product package might include a logo or other artwork, organized text and pure design elements such as shapes and color which unify the piece. Composition is one of the most important features of graphic design especially when using pre-existing materials or diverse elements.\n\nThe term representation, according to O'Shaughnessy and Stadler (2005), can carry a range of meanings and interpretations. In literary theory representation is commonly defined in three ways.\n\nRepresentation, according to Mitchell (1995), began with early literary theory in the ideas of Plato and Aristotle, and has evolved into a significant component of language, Saussurian and communication studies. Aristotle discusses representation in three ways:\nThe \"means\" of literary representation is language. The means of graphical representation are graphics. Graphical representation of data is one of the most commonly used modes of presentation.\nThe purpose of graphical communication is transfer message or information to the receiver in effective way.when professional organizations prepare reports then usually use the mode of graphical presentations.\n\n\n\n",
                "Graphic design\n\nGraphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving using one or more of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term \"graphic design\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging and signage.\n\nThe term graphic design was coined by William Addison Dwiggins in 1922. However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of Lascaux, to Rome's Trajan's Column to the illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of Ginza, Tokyo. In \"Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary\". This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the Rosetta Stone. \"The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the \"true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men\"\" The Egyptians also invented papyrus, paper made from reeds found along the Nile, on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the \"Dark Ages\", from 500 to 1450 , monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.\n\nIn both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of visual communication in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between advertising, art, graphic design and fine art has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, languages and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, \"the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience.\"\n\nGraphic design in the United States began with Benjamin Franklin who used his newspaper \"The Pennsylvania Gazette\", to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. \"Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, Andrew Bradford as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his \"General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America\" (the precursor to the Saturday Evening Post) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named called the \"Pennsylvania Fireplace\". His invention is still sold today and is known as \"the Franklin stove\". \"\n\nAmerican advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making \"headlines\". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize logos, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.\n\nDuring the Tang Dynasty (618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using movable type printing, making books widely available during the Song dynasty (960–1279).\n\nDuring the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter William Hogarth used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.\n\nIn Mainz Germany, in 1448, Johann Gutenberg introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a printing press and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, criers announced products for sale just as ancient Romans had done.\n\nThe printing press made books more widely available. Aldus Manutius developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called Humanist or Old Style. Additionally, William Caxton, England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed \"\"squis\"\" or \"\"pin up\" posters,\" in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe\".\" The term \"Siquis\" came from the Roman era when public notices were posted stating \"\"if anybody...\"\", which is Latin for \"\"si quis\"\". These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of \"wants\" called \"want ads\" and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed \"advices\". The \"Advices\" were what we know today as \"want ad media\" or \"advice columns\".\n\nIn 1638 Harvard University received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller Benjamin Harris received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, \"'Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick'\". It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.\n\nJohn Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the \"'Boston News-Letter'\", which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as \"\"Weeklies\"\". The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. \"'The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.\"' The initial use of the \"Boston News-Letter\" carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th, 1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in Oyster Bay, owned by William Bradford, a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, The New York Gazette. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the \"American Weekly Mercury\", 1719. \"The Mercury\" and William Brooker's \"Massachusetts Gazette\", first published a day earlier.\n\nIn late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.\n\nIn 1849, Henry Cole became one of the major forces in design education in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his \"Journal of Design and Manufactures\". He organized the Great Exhibition as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1896, William Morris' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the Arts and Crafts movement, and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the Private Press movement, directly influenced Art Nouveau.\n\nThe term \"graphic design\" first appeared in print in the 1922 essay \"New Kind of Printing Calls for New Design\" by William Addison Dwiggins, an American book designer in the early 20th century. Raffe's \"Graphic Design\", published in 1927, was the first book to use \"Graphic Design\" in its title.\n\nThe signage in the London Underground is a classic design example of the modern era and used a typeface designed by Edward Johnston in 1916.\n\nIn the 1920s, Soviet constructivism applied 'intellectual production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.\n\nJan Tschichold codified the principles of modern typography in his 1928 book, \"New Typography\". He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential. Tschichold, Bauhaus typographers such as Herbert Bayer and László Moholy-Nagy and El Lissitzky greatly influenced graphic design. They pioneered production techniques and stylistic devices used throughout the twentieth century. The following years saw graphic design in the modern style gain widespread acceptance and application. The post-World War II American economy revealed a greater need for graphic design, mainly in advertising and packaging. The spread of the German Bauhaus school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a \"mass-produced\" minimalism to America; sparking \"modern\" architecture and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include Adrian Frutiger, designer of the typefaces Univers and Frutiger; Paul Rand, who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as corporate identity; Alex Steinweiss, credited with the invention of the album cover; and Josef Müller-Brockmann, who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.\n\nThe professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with consumerism. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the First Things First manifesto. First launched by Ken Garland in 1964, it was re-published as the First Things First 2000 manifesto in 1999 in the magazine \"Emigre\" 51 stating \"We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design.\" Both editions attracted signatures from practitioners and thinkers such as Rudy VanderLans, Erik Spiekermann, Ellen Lupton and Rick Poynor. The 2000 manifesto was also published in Adbusters, known for its strong critiques of visual culture.\n\nGraphic design is applied to everything visual, from road signs to technical schematics, from interoffice memorandums to reference manuals.\n\nDesign can aid in selling a product or idea. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as logos, colors, packaging and text as part of branding (see also advertising). Branding has increasingly become important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.\n\nGraphic design is applied in the entertainment industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl album covers, comic books, DVD covers, opening credits and closing credits in filmmaking, and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.\n\nFrom scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as information design. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include data visualization, which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with information graphics.\n\nA graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing text and either preexisting imagery or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as interactive design, or multimedia design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.\n\nThe \"process school\" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these message. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.\n\nTypography includes type design, modifying type glyphs and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).\n\nTypography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation.\n\nPage layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of type (text), images (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a dieline for elements that are not printed with ink such as die/laser cutting, foil stamping or blind embossing.\n\nPrintmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on paper and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.\n\nAside from technology, graphic design requires judgment and creativity. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and rendering. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an art director), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.\n\nThe method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using traditional media and guides, or digital image editing tools on computers. Tools in computer graphics often take on traditional names such as \"scissors\" or \"pen\". Some graphic design tools such as a grid are used in both traditional and digital form.\n\nIn the mid-1980s desktop publishing and graphic art software applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as pencils can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the creative process. Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.\n\nDesigners disagree whether computers enhance the creative process. Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or paste-up. While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.\n\nSome designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered layouts are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.\n\nGraphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and \"industry standard\" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of Adobe Systems Incorporated. Adobe Photoshop (a raster-based program for photo editing) and Adobe Illustrator (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed raster images and vector graphics in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as Adobe InDesign, Serif PagePlus and QuarkXpress. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design. These include Inkscape (for vector graphics), GIMP (for photo-editing and image manipulation), Krita (for painting) and Scribus (for page layout).\n\nSince the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in interface design, in an environment commonly referred to as a Graphical User Interface (GUI). This has included web design and software design, when end user interactivity is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with software developers and web developers to create the look and feel of a web site or software application. An important aspect of interface design is icon design.\n\nUser experience design considers how a user interacts with and responds to an interface, service or product.\n\nExperiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.\n\nExperiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are wayfinding, placemaking, branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.\n\nGraphic design career paths cover all parts of the creative spectrum and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2016 median pay was $53,316 per year. The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include graphic designer, art director, creative director, animator and entry level production artist. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as \"DTP Associate\" or \"Graphic Artist\". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as illustration, photography, animation or interactive design.\n\nEmployment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.\n\nGraphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations. Graphic designers may also work freelance, working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.\n\nA graphic designer typically reports to the art director, creative director or senior media creative. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as brand development and corporate identity development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.\n\nJeff Howe of \"Wired Magazine\" first used the term \"crowdsourcing\" in his 2006 article, \"The Rise of Crowdsourcing.\" It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design.\n\n\n\nGraphic design tutorial videos are needed so other like my self can learn."

                "Flip trick\n\nA flip trick is a type of skateboarding trick in which the skateboard rotates around its vertical axis, or its vertical axis and its horizontal axis simultaneously. The first flip trick called a kickflip, originally called a \"magic flip,\" was invented by professional skateboarder Rodney Mullen.\n\nThe following is a list of general skateboarding terms that will assist novice readers to better understand the descriptions of flip tricks contained in this article:\n\nThe concepts of frontside and backside originate from surfing, whereby the terms defined the position of the surfer in relation to the wave.\n\n\nAn abbreviated form of the title \"nose ollie\", a nollie is an ollie executed at the front of the skateboard when the rider shifts his stance from the bottom to the top of the board. The rider then uses his front foot, instead of his back foot, to propel the board upwards. Professional skateboarders Paulo Diaz, Karl Watson, Shuriken Shannon, Tuukka Korhonen, Sean Malto and Tiago Lemos have been recognized for their ability to perform the nollie trick.\n\nA switch is a stance that is opposite to one's natural stance. For example, riding with your left foot forwards as opposed to normally riding with your right foot forwards. A \"regular\" skater's switch stance is \"goofy\", and .\n\nFirst executed by Eddie Elguera during the 1970s, \"fakie\" is a skateboarding stance in which the skater is in his normal stance; however rolling backwards(towards the back foot). .\n\nThe shuvit move was invented by professional skateboarder Eddy Dela Rosa. A \"shuvit\" involves rotating the skateboard in a 180-degree motion without flipping the board. It involves pushing (or \"popping\") the tail while also shoving the board under the rider's feet. While the board rotates beneath the rider, he/she maintains the same position in the air. If performed with a larger rotation, the trick is named according to the extent of the rotation: a 360-, 540-degree, etc. shuvit. Professional skateboarder Christophe \"Willow\" Wildgrube performed a frontside 360-degree pop shuvit for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website.\n\nFor the execution of a grind, one makes moving contact with an object using the axles between the wheels, called trucks. Generally, no other part of the skateboard should be in contact with the object that is the subject of the grind. Numerous variations have been invented, whereby flip tricks are combined with grinds, such as the 'kickflip 50-50', 'nollie flip crooked grind', or 'crooked grind nollie flip out'.\n\nIn a slide, one makes contact with an object using any part of the wooden deck construction of the skateboard, including the griptape, and moves along the object. Numerous variations have been invented, whereby flip tricks are combined with slides, such as the \"kickflip boardslide\" and the \"kickflip tailslide\".\n\nGrabs are a skateboarding trick usually executed on transitional terrain, in the air between takeoff and landing. They consist of the rider holding on to any part of the skateboard while in air. They can also be executed on flat ground—for example, a \"boneless\" is a grab trick performed on flat ground, whereby one foot is used to lift off the ground and the other is used to grab the skateboard. Numerous variations have been invented, whereby flip tricks are combined with grabs, such as the \"kickflip indy grab\".\n\nThe fundamental tricks include the ollie, frontside 180, backside 180, pop shove-it, kickflip and heelflip. Combinations and variations were then derived from these basic tricks, such as the kickflip shove-it (varial kickflip), heelflip front sideshove-it (varial heelflip), hardflip, inward heelflip, nollie flip, nollie heelflip, nollie 360 flip, fakie kickflip, fakie heelflip, fakie 360 flip and the laser flip (heelflip 360 fs shuvit).\n\nAll tricks can be performed in any of the four stances—natural, fakie, switch, and nollie—and all flip tricks can be performed frontside or backside. When the board spins on both axes, it is more common for both to spin in the same direction, such as with 360 flips and laser flips; however, the board flips in contrasting angles for hardflips and inward heelflips.\n\nA finger flip requires the skateboarder to flip the board in any direction using their fingers on the nose or tail; the first ollie finger flip was invented by Mullen in 1986. Mullen has been filmed executing finger flip 360-flips and Tony Hawk executed the first finger flip in 'vert' skateboarding (skateboarding on ramp structures that consist of vertical transition).\n\nThis was the first version of the kickflip, whereby the rider hooks one foot under the board to create the flipping motion. Mullen explained to Canadian magazine, \"SBC Skateboarding\":\nPeople were doing the original Kickflips, where you hook your foot over the side, and the set-up was so rotten. You had to stand parallel [like a skier]. People tried that trick on banks, and rolled in standing like that and fell straight back. I understood that this trick needed no set-up, and it’d be an important move—for me, at least. I knew it gave me a whole new doorway to go through.\n\nA flip whereby the rider alights from the board, flips the board horizontally, 360 degrees, and then catches the board with his/her feet when the board re-lands on its wheels.\n\nWhen a skateboarder horizontally flips the board 360 degrees by flicking the corner of the board towards the skater—the trick was invented by Mullen in 1982 in a Floridian farmhouse. Instances of multiple spins are named according to how many spins are completed (e.g. double kickflip, triple kickflip, etc.)—professional skateboarder Daewon Song was filmed in 2010, performing both a double and triple kickflip, in a web video entitled \"Daewon Dorking Around at DVS\".\n\nSimilar to a kickflip, the heelflip is instead executed with the heel section flipping away from the skater this time. For a regular-footed skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of a view from behind the skater. Again, a kick formulates part of the ollie, but unlike the kickflip, the kick is directed forward and outwards, away from the rider's toe side (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel—hence the name. The trick was invented by Mullen in 1982. Instances of multiple spins are named according to how many spins are completed (e.g. double heelflip, triple heelflip, etc.)—skateboard videographer, Jon Fistemanu, is filmed executing a double heelflip in a 2010 web video entitled \"Daewon Dorking Around at DVS\".\n\nA kickflip combined with a frontside or backside 180-degree ollie—the trick is also known as a frontside or backside flip. The backside 180 kickflip was invented by Mullen in 1984. Professional skateboarder Andrew Reynolds performed a frontside kickflip for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website. Professional skateboarder (and co-owner of The Berrics) Steve Berra performed a backside kickflip for the \"Trickipedia\" section of his website. Multiple spins can also be incorporated into this trick and a frontside 180 double kickflip was filmed for the \"Skateology\" web-based video series.\n\nA heelflip combined with a frontside or backside 180-degree movement—the trick is also known as a frontside or backside \"heel\". Song is filmed performing a frontside heelflip on a transitional structure located on the back of a truck in a web-based video entitled \"DVS Daewon x Almost Love Child\".\n\nA late flip is a kickflip executed in a secondary motion, using your front or back foot, after or at the peak of an ollie—this is different from the one fluid motion that is involved with the execution of an ollie. Professional skateboarder Mike Mo Capaldi used a late flip variation in his heat against Shane O'Neill in the \"Battle at the Berrics V\" competition.\n\nAn \"[[Freestyle skaterrics website.\n\nThis flip trick variation involves the execution of a back-foot ollie impossible (the board wrapping 360 degrees around your back foot), followed by a flipping of the board, also with the back foot, as part of the same motion. The trick is also called the \"Mo flip\" because it was popularized by professional skateboarder [[Mike Mo Capaldi]].\n\nProfessional skateboarder [[Chris Haslam (skateboarder)|Chris Haslam]] was filmed performing this trick in slow motion and the footage was published on the Internet-based RIDE Channel. Haslam performs the trick while adopting his natural stance (goofy), but when the trick is performed \"switch\" it is called a \"Merlin twist.\"\n\nA varial kickflip (also known as a kickflip shuvit or 180 flip) is a kickflip combined with a backside-pop shuvit. The trick featured prominently in the Blueprint video \"The First Broadcast\" and the trick has received a significant amount of criticism from within the skateboard community; former Blueprint rider Mark Baines has stated in an online interview:\nThe shuv-it flip thing is weird. I don’t think there are many tricks that look bad all the time. Gino can do heelflips and make them look like the best trick ever. It’s how it’s done not what it is. I wouldn’t say my shuv-it flips were that good though. The fakie varial flip in First Broadcast is the best thing I ever filmed though. People basically hear or read something on a forum then feel they gotta hate it I suppose. I don’t really know. Like I say a lot of the time with tricks it’s how it’s done.\nA \"varial heelflip\" (originally known as a \"heelflip shuvit\") is a heelflip combined with a frontside pop shuvit. Professional skateboarders [[Chico Brenes]] and Moose (the latter filmed the [[High-definition video|high-definition (HD)]] version) filmed the trick for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website. The official name of the trick in the 21st century was a point of contention among skateboarders; the issue was discussed on The Berrics website in early March 2013 in a short video segment entitled \"Name Game\" and the \"varial heelflip\" title emerged as the favored name.\n\nA combination of a 360-degree backside-pop shuvit and a kickflip. Also known as a tre flip. Professional skateboarders such as Josh Kalis, Capaldi, Ethan Fowler, and Stefan Janoski have been recognized for their 360 flips. The trick was invented by Mullen in 1983.\n\nAn extra rotation can also be added, known as a \"360 double flip\", and Capaldi, O'Neill, and Song have been filmed executing the trick; O'Neill was also filmed executing the trick in switch stance as part of [[The Berrics#Battle at the Berrics 6|Battle at the Berrics 6]]. Footage of professional skateboarder Chris Cole, executing a 360 triple flip, was released on the internet in 2010.\n\nA combination of a fakie laser flip (360 Heelflip) and a frontside half-cab. The invention of this trick has been credited to professional skateboarder [[Rick Howard]]; however, Howard has publicly stated that he does not appreciate the recognition, as he does not believe that he is the trick's inventor. Song has executed the trick numerous times during the period from 2011 to early 2013 (X Games Real Street, \"5-Incher\", \"5-Incher B-Side Edit\", \"iFun\" web clip, and \"Who Is Daewon Song?\"). Early in his career, Song also performed the trick on transition without the tail hitting the ground—as is usually the case in skateboarding—and the trick also appears in his World Industries \"Love Child\" video part.\n\nA hardflip combines a frontside pop shuvit with a kickflip. This trick is awkward to execute, and the board sometimes appears to move vertically through the legs—the degree of verticality is determined by the front-foot action. The first hardflip to be captured on film was in the World Industries \"Love Child\" video and was executed by Daewon Song—Song stated in an online interview:\nThe worst hardflip ever documented? It was the first, but it was the worst, so it's cool. So it's like first and worst. Back then, too, I didn't even know what it was. [Be]cause all I know is that I had to mule-kick the f*** out of my front...back foot, move it out of the way, and if you shot a photo, there would definitely be three frames of something that just did not look right.\n\nProfessional skateboarders such as Stevie Williams (executed a hardflip to nosegrind at Love Park in [[Philadelphia]], U.S.), Gino Ianucci, Chet Thomas, and Kris Markovic have been recognized for their hardflips. In the Almost \"5-Incher\" video, [[Lewis Marnell]] performs a hardflip to 5-0 grind. Sponsored skateboarder Brandon Turner executed a hardflip down the famous Carlsbad Gap (no longer in existence) in California, US.\n\nDouble hardflips have also been executed and Jake McAtee was filmed in 2009 performing the variation on a \"hip\" structure located at a skate park.\n\nA 360 frontside pop shuvit combined with a \nkickflip. Pro skater Sean Malto and Donovan strain both performed 360 hardflips in an unsanctioned battle for Battle of the Berrics X in 2017.\nProfessional skateboarder Jimmy Carlin was filmed executing a 360 hardflip down a set of stairs in the video \"Capital Motion\". American skateboarder Robbyn Spangler-Magby (amateur) has also been filmed executing the trick—at 1,000 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] with a Redlake N3 high speed camera—for the Skateology web-based video series.\n\nThe 360 Hard-Flip was first documented in the 2005 video \"Synopsis\" it was performed by Al Garcia and was executed over a hip. The video featured top skaters Gershon Mosley, Aaron Snyder, and Dan Pageau. \"Synopsis\" marks the first video that both Mike Mo and Nick Merlino made their first appearance in.\n\nA nollie hardflip late backside 180 (often mistakenly thought of as a hardflip late backside 180), this trick was popularized by [[Kareem Campbell]] with his only performance of it on transition in Issue 30 of \"411 Video Magazine\" covering September-October 1998.\n\nA hardflip with backside 360-degree body rotation—the trick has been credited to Spangler-Magby.\n\nA flip trick in which a frontside 360 shuvit is combined with a heelflip (also known as frontside 360 shove-it heel flips)—the trick was invented by Mullen. Professional skateboarder [[Torey Pudwill]] has been recognized for his laser flips and he performed the trick for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website. Double laser flips have also been performed.\n\nA backside-pop shuvit (180 degree) combined with a heelflip. Flow skateboarder James Espinoza was filmed performing a fakie variation on The Berrics website.\n\nAn inward heelflip executed at the front of the board in the nollie position. Professional skateboarder Bryan Herman performs the trick in a promotional video clip for his signature model shoe the Emerica \"G6\", and professional skateboarder [[Chris Cole (skateboarder)|Chris Cole]] was filmed executing a nollie inward heelflip at the Woodward facility in [[Egypt]] in 2010. Professional skateboarder Lenny Rivas filmed a \"Trick Tip\" for CCS TV (Internet video channel for the CCS online retail outlet) in December 2012.\n\nA backside 360 shuvit combined with a heelflip.\n\nAn inward heelflip with two heelflip rotations. Unsponsored skateboarder Carell Harvey was filmed, with a Redlake N3 high-speed camera at 1,000 frames per second, performing the variation in 2011.\n\nA 360 inward double is a 360 inward heelflip with two heelflip rotations.\n\nA bigspin inward heel is a 360-degree inward heelflip with a 180-degree body rotation in the same direction. It is believed that pro-skater Tom Stano created this trick in an early 1980s skating video.\n\nThe skateboarder's body spins 360 degrees in the same direction as the board during a kickflip. Professional skateboarder [[Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder)|Paul Rodriguez]] finished in second place in \"[[The Berrics#Battle at the Berrics 2|The Battle of the Berrics 2]]\" (contest) to Cole, as he was unable to execute the 360-degree kickflip.\n\nA bigflip is a 360 flip combined with a backside 180-degree body rotation. Rodriguez executes a bigspin down a set of stairs in the final scene of the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] \"#skateeverydamnday\" commercial that was filmed in China in 2012. Professional skateboarder Mark Appleyard performed the trick for \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website.\n\nA 540-degree flip with a 180-degree body rotation (when a 360-degree body rotation is executed, the trick is known as a \"Gazelle flip/360 Bigspin\").\n\nA 720 flip with a 180-degree backside rotation of the body (when the board spins 720 degrees, does one flip and your body does a 180 degree rotation the same way your board does). Invented and landed by Sewa Kroetkov and filmed by Chris Chann.\n\nA Laser flip combined with a frontside 180-degree body rotation in the same direction. Amateur skateboarder Felipe Gustavo performs a switch version for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website.\n\nA hardflip with a frontside 360-degree body rotation. The double grape flip consists of two hardflips and the 360-degree body rotation—the double variation was invented by [[Donovan Strain]].\n\nFlipping the board by using one foot that is under the board and flipping it in the kickflip or heelflip direction—this trick was invented by Mullen in 1992. While skateboarding on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], Mullen performs numerous variations of this flip trick in his \"[[Rodney Mullen vs. Daewon Song#Round 3|Almost: Round Three]]\" video part.\n\nA shuv-it, with a late underflip performed by the back foot. While professional skateboarders rarely perform this trick, numerous segments of home video footage, in which unsponsored skateboarders perform the trick, has been published on the Internet.\n\nThe rider uses the same pressure that would be applied if he/she is attempting to adopt a \"[[Freestyle skateboarding tricks#Primo Slide|primo]]\" position (when the board is positioned on its side/edge); however, one foot is placed under the board so that the board is not completely in a \"dark\" position (when the board is upside down, with the griptape facing the ground). The other foot is then placed on the tail of the board when the board is upside down—the foot beneath the board is then used to scoop the board up, and then around. The rider then jumps onto the board to land in the starting position. Mullen invented the Casper 360 flip in 1983.\n\nA flatground trick performed without touching the floor. Starting in a normal stance, the rider uses backfoot pressure to flip the board into the \"dark\" position, standing on the underside of the board's tail and nose with either foot. Then, in one swift movement, the skateboarder applies pressure to the side of the board, with either foot lifting up onto the opposite side of the board. The skateboarder then uses the other foot to scoop the board over and around, while jumping to land back on the right side of the board.\n\nA nollie casper flip is a half-nollie flip that is caught upside down, with the front foot under the front trucks; the board is then flipped back over, heelflip-style, with a combined pop shuvit action.\n\nThis flip trick is a half-heelflip—the front foot catches the board upside down—combined with a backside shuvit.\n\nA kickflip or heelflip shuvit with a 180-degree body rotation in the opposite direction to the rotation of the board.\n\nA [[nightmare flip]] is a varial kickflip with an extra kickflip rotation. Also known as varial double kickflip\n\nA Hospital flip consists of two separate motions: firstly, the skateboarder performs a kickflip but stalls the rotation of the board at the halfway point; the front foot then executes an upward flick that causes the board to spin 180 degrees along the longitudinal axis.\n\nFootage of an alpha flip is provided in a YouTube tutorial by Cotton Mouth Skateboards that features a skateboarder combining a backside 180 with a 360-degree hospital flip of the board around the front foot. The tutorial states: \"The front foot never leaves the board(Its easier this way. However, it is a hospital flip, not an impossible, so it may).\"\n\nFootage of both a regular beta flip and fakie beta flip were published on the Cotton Mouth Skateboards YouTube channel in 2012 and 2010, respectively. In the 2010 video clip, the skateboarder describes a fakie beta flip as, \"a fakie backside 360 while you do an alpha flip\"; thus, a beta flip can be described as a backside 360 with a 360-degree rotation of the board around the front foot.\n\nPerformed by pushing with the front foot directly off the nose of the board after an ollie, causing the board to rotate almost vertically 180 degrees towards the frontfoot between the rider's legs while flipping the board 180 degrees so it lands wheels down. Carlin has described the trick as \"Pretty much a varial flip that goes down.\" The trick was invented by Darrell Stanton.\n\nA dolphin/forward flip with a 360-degree rotation. It was named the \"Reda flip\" by Moroccan skateboarder Reda Hadada. Two days after he landed the trick, Chris Chann also landed it. He was inspired by Hadada's video and changed the name to \"Dragon flip\" for his YouTube series \"Trick Challenge\" (episode 11) in April 2014. Chan got the idea for the name from the [[anime]] television series \"[[Dragon Ball Z]]\", which he had been watching the night before filming.\n\nA forward flip combined with a heelflip.\n\nFor an unward flip, the board rotates in the same manner as an \"inward heelflip\", but the board is flipped from under the board with the front foot. This trick is easiest in the nollie position and is considered the complete opposite of a \"nerdflip\". Due to the awkward foot positioning required for an unward flip, the flip trick is typically performed by advanced skateboarders. The trick was invented by Mullen.\n\nA flip trick in which a 540-degree board flip is combined with a 360-degree body rotation in the same direction. So basically a big flip (big spin with kickflip) then immediately after landing 180 pivot. The trick was invented by Mullen in 1981.<ref name=\"Gaz\" /\n\nThis trick is performed like a kickflip, but after the board has made the full kickflip rotation, the front foot flips the board back in the opposite direction like a heelflip from the underside of the board. It is essentially a kickflip with a late front foot underflip.\n\nA pressure varial kickflip.\n\nA pressure 360 flip, flipped with the toe of the back foot. \n\nA quarter-kickflip, late back-foot varial heelflip that was invented by Mullen.\n\nA nollie backside flip followed by a late kickflip—the trick was invented by [[Jerry Hsu]] and was captured in the [[Osiris Shoes|Osiris]] shoe company video \"The Storm\". Hsu was filmed performing the trick on transition during the 2009 Zumiez Couch Tour.\n\nA one and a half varial kick-flip (almost a nightmare flip) that transitions into an anti-Casper flip in a single motion.\n\nA half kick flip shuv-it that transitions into a half late heel flip in a single motion—the trick is named after its inventor, professional skateboarder [[Chris Haslam (skateboarder)|Chris Haslam]].\n\nInvented by Haslam, the name of the trick is taken from the Russian ([[Cyrillic]]) version of the name of fellow professional skateboarder Nestor Judkins (sponsored by [[Enjoi]] skateboards, Krux trucks, RVCA clothing, and [[adidas]] footwear). The trick is a switch, half frontside flip to back foot bigspin flip. In his online introduction of the truck for sponsor, Strange Notes ([[Independent Trucks]]), Haslam explained:\n\nHaslam also invented a switch flip trick that, as of 2012, had not been named. The trick was filmed for the Strange Notes company under the title, \"Chris Haslam Crazy Ass trick\".\n\nThe rider is in a \"hang ten\" position and then pops the board down, resulting in a pressure nollie hardflip through the rider's legs.\n\nThis flip trick can be executed while rolling along or in a stationary position. The skateboarder can either start on the board or on the ground (if the board is rolling, the skateboarder usually hops off the board first). The skateboarder places his/her hands on the board and then quickly pulls the board's edge up, causing it to flip, and then the skater lands on the board with both feet.\n\nFor a rail flip, the skateboarder stands on the side of the board and uses the back foot to flip the board with pressure.\n\nA Railstand nightmare flip is a double-kick flip shuvit executed from a \"primo\" position.\n\nA Frightmare flip is a nightmare flip with a frontside 180-degree body rotation.\n\nA \"no comply\" is a trick where the skater plants his/her foot, and then uses the back foot and knee to lift the board off the ground. It is a freestyle trick that can be combined with pressure flips, finger flips, and spins. In 2011, a no comply frontside bigspin heelflip was filmed by the Skateology web-based video series.\n\nHaslam performed a \"Switch No Comply Frontside 360 Heelflip\" in May 2013 for the Ride Channel's \"Skateboarding in Slow Motion\" segment.\n\nA trick whereby the front foot is planted on the ground and a pressure flip is then performed in one motion. This flip trick usually involves running and catching the board with front foot.\n\nA bigspin kickflip, whereby the skateboarder's body transitions into a fakie backside 180 after the bigspin kickflip has completed its rotation.\n\nA flip trick in which the board flips in a similar fashion to a frontside kickflip, but the action of the front foot is absent—the flip of the board is reliant upon the pushing down action of the back foot. Aaron \"Jaws\" Homoki has filmed a \"Trick Tip\" video for the RIDE Channel on YouTube, in which he commends professional skateboarder [[Chad Muska]] for his execution of the trick. Muska has received broader recognition for his execution of the trick and it is, therefore, also called a \"Muska flip\".\n\nA late back-foot varial/shuvit flip—the name of the trick was coined by Jimmy Carlin; however, it is unclear who invented the trick.\n\nIs basically an inward heelflip without the heelflip as it is executed only by the same foot used to pop it up whether in the nose or tail—pressure flips are executed using a scooping technique, rather than the \"popping\" action of ollie-based tricks. In an instructional video, Hawk described the action that underpins the trick as a \"pushing/scooping action, instead of an ollie\" and states that the trick is \"old school\", forgotten by later generations of skateboarders. American skateboard shop owner and former professional skateboarder Nate Sherwood is well known for a variety of pressure flip tricks, and Sherwood invented the \"Laser pressure flip\".\n\nA pressure kickflip that rotates 360 degrees.\n\nThe trick became the second flip trick to be named the \"Mo flip,\" as it is a highlight of Capaldi's opening part in Lakai's \"Fully Flared\" video, as well as during his finals match against Shane O'neill in the \"Battle Of The Berrics 5\" contest. The trick is later performed by [[Nyjah Huston]] in \"Battle At The Berrics 7\" in April 2014.\n\nFlip tricks can be executed by 'popping' the boards nose or tail, or by using the foot to lift the board up from underneath (underflip). Basic flip tricks are performed by popping the board with one foot, and using the other foot to flip the raised end. Less common flip variations can be achieved popping the board in an unusual way, where the pop itself makes the board flip. These include pressure flips and toe flips that were more popular in early skateboarding. Flip tricks are usually performed while the skateboarder is rolling, although they may be performed while stationary.\n\n[[Category:Skateboarding tricks]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]",
                "Kickflip\n\nThe kickflip is a maneuver in skateboarding in which a rider flips their skateboard 360° along the axis that extends from the nose to the tail of the deck. When the rider is regular footed the board spins clockwise if viewed from the front.\n\nIt was the first of many modern flip tricks to be invented or modified by Rodney Mullen in the early 1980s. The original kickflip was invented by pioneer Curt Lindgren prior to 1978 and was later modified and popularized by Mullen. In March 2011, the first kickflip in surfing was landed by Zoltan \"The Magician\" Torkos. Torkos's feat was widely criticized and remains disputed as to whether or not it traveled up and off the lip of the wave.\n\nIn the 1970s freestyle skateboarders learned to flip the board over beneath them by lifting an edge of the board with the top of one toe. While the board flipped completely over, It did not gain much clearance from the ground, and the setup required the rider to stand more parallel to the direction of motion, with both feet facing the nose. Very well known and commonly performed today, the kickflip is a basic skateboarding trick. Once they have mastered the trick on flat ground, many skateboarders like to up the stakes and start taking this recently learned maneuver down obstacles. They also start combining it with other tricks such as kickflip to frontside boardslide.\n\nIn 1982 Rodney Mullen invented the modern form of the trick, initially naming it the \"magic flip\". He first would use his relatively new flatground ollie to leave the ground, then, instead of lifting an edge with a toe, he initiated the flip by sliding his front foot off the top of the board.\n\nMullen's kickflip technique gave him more control in several areas: the height of the clearance, the initiation time and speed of the flip, and the board's direction during the flip. This technique was quickly adopted by freestyle skaters and later by street skaters, introducing skateboarding to the era of flip tricks, many of which Rodney Mullen also created.\n\nTo perform a kickflip, the rider ollies into the air, and lifts the back foot from the board while simultaneously sliding the front foot off the skateboard diagonally forward and towards the heel of the foot. This front foot motion, sometimes called \"the flick\" , spins the board, flipping it completely over. Before landing, the rider stops the spin by returning the feet to the board as it nears its original position.\n\nThe board revolves around its longitudinal axis, like an aileron roll. To understand this motion and the direction of rotation, imagine stepping backwards off of a skateboard, leaving it in front of you, then rolling it over on the ground toward you; during the kickflip, the board spins similarly, but in mid-air beneath the rider. During a heelflip, a similar trick, the board rotates in the opposite direction.\nOnce a skateboarder masters the kickflip, many variations are possible:\n\n\n\n",
                "Skateboarding\n\nSkateboarding is an action sport which involves riding and performing tricks using a skateboard. Skateboarding can also be considered a recreational activity, an art form, a job, or a method of transportation. Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders throughout the years. A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4.8 billion in annual revenue with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world. In 2016, it was announced that skateboarding will be represented at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nSince the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders, Freestyle BMXers, aggressive skaters, and very recently, scooters. However, skateboarding has become controversial in areas in which the activity, although illegal, has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps, benches, plazas and parks.\n\nThe first skateboards started with wooden boxes, or boards, with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom. Crate scooters preceded skateboards, having a wooden crate attached to the nose (front of the board), which formed rudimentary handlebars. The boxes turned into planks, similar to the skateboard decks of today. An American WAC, Betty Magnuson, reported seeing French children in the Montmartre section of Paris riding on boards with roller skate wheels attached to them in late 1944. \nSkateboarding, as we know it, was probably born sometime in the late 1940s, or early 1950s, when surfers in California wanted something to do when the waves were flat. This was called \"sidewalk surfing\" - a new wave of surfing on the sidewalk as the sport of surfing became highly popular. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. The first manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the Chicago Roller Skate Company to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted \"sidewalk surfing\" and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers, and performed barefoot.\nBy the 1960s a small number of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as Jack's, Kips', Hobie, Bing's and Makaha started building skateboards that resembled small surfboards, and assembled teams to promote their products. One of the earliest Skateboard exhibitions was sponsored by Makaha's founder, Larry Stevenson, in 1963 and held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School in Hermosa Beach, California. Some of these same teams of skateboarders were also featured on a television show called \"Surf's Up\" in 1964, hosted by Stan Richards, that helped promote skateboarding as something new and fun to do.\n\nAs the popularity of skateboarding began expanding, the first skateboarding magazine, \"The Quarterly Skateboarder\" was published in 1964. John Severson, who published the magazine, wrote in his first editorial:\n\nThe magazine only lasted four issues, but resumed publication as \"Skateboarder\" in 1975. The first broadcast of an actual skateboarding competition was the 1965 National Skateboarding Championships, which were held in Anaheim, California and aired on ABC’s “Wide World of Sports. Because skateboarding was a new sport during this time, there were only two original disciplines during competitions: flatland freestyle and slalom downhill racing.\n\nOne of the earliest sponsored skateboarders, Patti McGee, was paid by Hobie and Vita Pak to travel around the country to do skateboarding exhibitions and to demonstrate skateboarding safety tips. McGee made the cover of \"Life\" magazine in 1965 and was featured on several popular television programs—\"The Mike Douglas Show\", \"What's My Line?\" and \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\"—which helped make skateboarding even more popular at the time. Some other well known surfer-style skateboarders of the time were Danny Bearer, Torger Johnson, Bruce Logan, Bill and Mark Richards, Woody Woodward, & Jim Fitzpatrick.\n\nThe growth of the sport during this period can also be seen in sales figures for Makaha, which quoted $10 million worth of board sales between 1963 and 1965 (Weyland, 2002:28). By 1966 a variety of sources began to claim that skateboarding was dangerous, resulting in shops being reluctant to sell them, and parents being reluctant to buy them. In 1966 sales had dropped significantly (ibid) and Skateboarder Magazine had stopped publication. The popularity of skateboarding dropped and remained low until the early 1970s.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Frank Nasworthy started to develop a skateboard wheel made of polyurethane, calling his company Cadillac Wheels. Prior to this new material, skateboards wheels were metal or \"clay\" wheels. The improvement in traction and performance was so immense that from the wheel's release in 1972 the popularity of skateboarding started to rise rapidly again, causing companies to invest more in product development. Nasworthy commissioned artist Jim Evans to do a series of paintings promoting Cadillac Wheels, they were featured as ads and posters in the resurrected Skateboarder magazine, and proved immensely popular in promoting the new style of skateboarding.\n\nIn the early 1970s skateparks hadn't been invented yet, so skateboarders would flock and skateboard in such urban places as The Escondido reservoir in San Diego, California. Skateboarding magazine would publish the location and Skateboarders made up nicknames for each location such as the Tea Bowl, the Fruit Bowl, Bellagio, the Rabbit Hole, Bird Bath, the Egg Bowl, Upland Pool and the Sewer Slide. Some of the development concepts in the terrain of skateparks were actually taken from the Escondido reservoir. Many companies started to manufacture trucks (axles) specially designed for skateboarding, reached in 1976 by Tracker Trucks. As the equipment became more maneuverable, the decks started to get wider, reaching widths of and over, thus giving the skateboarder even more control. A banana board is a skinny, flexible skateboard made of polypropylene with ribs on the underside for structural support. These were very popular during the mid-1970s and were available in a myriad of colors, bright yellow probably being the most memorable, hence the name.\n\nIn 1975 skateboarding had risen back in popularity enough to have one of the largest skateboarding competitions since the 1960s, the Del Mar National Championships, which is said to have had up to 500 competitors. The competition lasted two days and was sponsored by Bahne Skateboards & Cadillac Wheels. While the main event was won by freestyle spinning skate legend Russ Howell, a local skate team from Santa Monica, California, the Zephyr team, ushered in a new era of surfer style skateboarding during the competition that would have a lasting impact on skateboarding's history. With a team of 12, including skating legends such as Jay Adams, Tony Alva, Peggy Oki & Stacy Peralta, they brought a new progressive style of skateboarding to the event, based on the style of Hawaiian surfers Larry Bertlemann, Buttons Kaluhiokalani and Mark Liddell. Craig Stecyk, a photo journalist for Skateboarder Magazine, wrote about and photographed the team, along with Glen E. Friedman, and shortly afterwards ran a series on the team called the Dogtown articles, which eventually immortalized the Zephyr skateboard team. The team became known as the Z-Boys and would go on to become one of the most influential teams in skateboarding's history.\n\nSoon, skateboarding contests for cash and prizes, using a professional tier system, began to be held throughout California, such as the California Free Former World Professional Skateboard Championships, which featured Freestyle and Slalom competitions.\n\nA precursor to the extreme sport of street luge, that was sanctioned by the United States Skateboarding Association (USSA), also took place during the 1970s in Signal Hill, California. The competition was called \"The Signal Hill Skateboarding Speed Run\", with several competitors earning entries into the Guinness Book of World Records, at the time clocking speeds of over 50 mph on a skateboard. Due to technology and safety concerns at the time, when many competitors crashed during their runs, the sport did not gain popularity or support during this time.\n\nIn March 1976, Skateboard City skatepark in Port Orange, Florida and Carlsbad Skatepark in San Diego County, California would be the first two skateparks to be opened to the public, just a week apart. They were the first of some 200 skateparks that would be built through 1982. This was due in part to articles that were running in the investment journals at the time, stating that skateparks were a good investment. Notable skateboarders from the 1970s also include Ty Page, Tom Inouye, Laura Thornhill, Ellen O'Neal, Kim Cespedes, Bob Biniak, Jana Payne, Waldo Autry, Robin Logan, Bobby Piercy, Russ Howell, Ellen Berryman, Shogo Kubo, Desiree Von Essen, Henry Hester, Robin Alaway, Paul Hackett, Michelle Matta, Bruce Logan, Steve Cathey, Edie Robertson, Mike Weed, David Hackett, Gregg Ayres, Darren Ho, and Tom Sims.\n\nManufacturers started to experiment with more exotic composites and metals, like fiberglass and aluminium, but the common skateboards were made of maple plywood. The skateboarders took advantage of the improved handling of their skateboards and started inventing new tricks. Skateboarders, most notably Ty Page, Bruce Logan, Bobby Piercy, Kevin Reed, and the Z-Boys started to skate the vertical walls of swimming pools that were left empty in the 1976 California drought. This started the \"vert\" trend in skateboarding. With increased control, vert skaters could skate faster and perform more dangerous tricks, such as slash grinds and frontside/backside airs. This caused liability concerns and increased insurance costs to skatepark owners, and the development (first by Norcon, then more successfully by Rector) of improved knee pads that had a hard sliding cap and strong strapping proved to be too-little-too-late. During this era, the \"freestyle\" movement in skateboarding began to splinter off and develop into a much more specialized discipline, characterized by the development of a wide assortment of flat-ground tricks.\n\nAs a result of the \"vert\" skating movement, skate parks had to contend with high liability costs that led to many park closures. In response, vert skaters started making their own ramps, while freestyle skaters continued to evolve their flatland style. Thus, by the beginning of the 1980s, skateboarding had once again declined in popularity.\n\nThis period was fueled by skateboard companies that were run by skateboarders. The focus was initially on vert ramp skateboarding. The invention of the no-hands aerial (later known as the ollie) by Alan Gelfand in Florida in 1976, and the almost parallel development of the grabbed aerial by George Orton and Tony Alva in California, made it possible for skaters to perform airs on vertical ramps. While this wave of skateboarding was sparked by commercialized vert ramp skating, a majority of people who skateboarded during this period didn't ride vert ramps. As most people could not afford to build vert ramps, or did not have access to nearby ramps, street skating increased in popularity.\n\nFreestyle skating remained healthy throughout this period, with pioneers such as Rodney Mullen inventing many of the basic tricks that would become the foundation of modern street skating, such as the \"Impossible\" and the \"kickflip\". The influence that freestyle exerted upon street skating became apparent during the mid-1980s; however, street skating was still performed on wide vert boards with short noses, slide rails, and large soft wheels. In response to the tensions created by this confluence of skateboarding \"genres\", a rapid evolution occurred in the late 1980s to accommodate the street skater. Since few skateparks were available to skaters at this time, street skating pushed skaters to seek out shopping centers and public and private property as their \"spot\" to skate. (Public opposition, in which businesses, governments, and property owners have banned skateboarding on properties under their jurisdiction or ownership, would progressively intensify over the following decades.) By 1992, only a small fraction of skateboarders continuing to take part in a highly technical version of street skating, combined with the decline of vert skating, produced a sport that lacked the mainstream appeal to attract new skaters.\n\nSkateboarding during the 1990s became dominated by street skateboarding. Most boards are about wide and long. The wheels are made of an extremely hard polyurethane, with hardness (durometer) approximately 99A. The wheel sizes are relatively small so that the boards are lighter, and the wheels' inertia is overcome quicker, thus making tricks more manageable. Board styles have changed dramatically since the 1970s but have remained mostly alike since the mid-1990s. The contemporary shape of the skateboard is derived from the freestyle boards of the 1980s with a largely symmetrical shape and relatively narrow width. This form had become standard by the mid '90s.\n\nBy 2001 skateboarding had gained so much popularity that more people under the age of 18 rode skateboards (10.6 million) than played baseball (8.2 million), although traditional organized team sports still dominated youth programs overall. Skateboarding and skateparks began to be viewed and used in a variety of new ways to complement academic lessons in schools, including new non-traditional physical education skateboarding programs, like Skatepass and Skateistan, to encourage youth to have better attendance, self-discipline and confidence. This was also based on the healthy physical opportunities skateboarding was understood to bring participants for muscle & bone strengthening and balance, as well as the positive impacts it can have on youth in teaching them mutual respect, social networking, artistic expression and an appreciation of the environment.\n\nIn 2003 Go Skateboarding Day was founded in southern California by the International Association of Skateboard Companies to promote skateboarding throughout the world. It is celebrated annually on June 21 \"to define skateboarding as the rebellious, creative celebration of independence it continues to be.\"\nAccording to market research firm American Sports Data the number of skateboarders worldwide increased by more than 60 percent between 1999 and 2002—from 7.8 million to 12.5 million.\n\nMany cities also began implementing recreation plans and statutes during this time period, as part of their vision for local parks and communities to make public lands more available, in particular, for skateboarding, inviting skateboarders to come in off of the city streets and into organized skateboarding activity areas. By 2006 there were over 2,400 skateparks worldwide and the design of skateparks themselves had made a transition, as skaters turned designers. Many new places to skateboard designed specifically for street skaters, such as the \"Safe Spot Skate Spot\" program, first initiated by professional skateboarder Rob Dyrdek throughout many cities, allowed for the creation of smaller alternative safe skate plazas to be built at a lower cost. One of the largest locations ever built to skateboard in the world, SMP Skatepark in China, at 12,000 square meters in size, was built complete with a 5,000-seat stadium.\n\nIn 2009 Skatelab opened the Skateboarding Hall of Fame & Skateboard Museum. Nominees are chosen by the International Association of Skateboard Companies (IASC).\n\nRecently, barefoot skating has been experiencing a revival. Many skaters ride barefoot, particularly in summer and in warmer countries, such as South Africa, Australia, Spain and South America. The plastic penny board is intended to be ridden barefoot, as is the surfboard-inspired hamboard.\n\nWith the evolution of skateparks and ramp skating, the skateboard began to change. Early skate tricks had consisted mainly of two-dimensional freestyle manoeuvres like riding on only two wheels (\"wheelie\" or \"manual\"), spinning only on the back wheels (a \"pivot\"), high jumping over a bar and landing on the board again, also known as a \"hippie jump\", long jumping from one board to another, (often over small barrels or fearless teenagers), or slalom. Another popular trick was the Bertlemann slide, named after Larry Bertelemann's surfing manoeuvres.\n\nIn 1976, skateboarding was transformed by the invention of the ollie by Alan \"Ollie\" Gelfand. It remained largely a unique Florida trick until the summer of 1978, when Gelfand made his first visit to California. Gelfand and his revolutionary maneuvers caught the attention of the West Coast skaters and the media where it began to spread worldwide. The ollie was adapted to flat ground by Rodney Mullen in 1982. Mullen also invented the \"Magic Flip,\" which was later renamed the kickflip, as well as many other tricks including, the 360 Kickflip, which is a 360 pop shove-it and a kickflip in the same motion. The flat ground ollie allowed skateboarders to perform tricks in mid-air without any more equipment than the skateboard itself, it has formed the basis of many street skating tricks. A recent development in the world of trick skating is the 1080, which was first ever landed by Tom Schaar in 2012.\n\nSkateboarding was popularized by the 1986 skateboarding cult classic \"Thrashin'\". Directed by David Winters and starring Josh Brolin, it features appearances from many famous skaters such as Tony Alva, Tony Hawk, Christian Hosoi and Steve Caballero. \"Thrashin<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" also had a direct impact on \"Lords of Dogtown\", as Catherine Hardwicke, who directed \"Lords of Dogtown\", was hired by Winters to work on \"Thrashin<nowiki>'</nowiki>\" as a production designer where she met, worked with and befriended many famous skaters including the real Tony Alva, Tony Hawk, Christian Hosoi and Steve Caballero.\n\nSkateboarding was, at first, tied to the culture of surfing. As skateboarding spread across the United States to places unfamiliar with surfing or surfing culture, it developed an image of its own. For example, the classic film short \"Video Days\" (1991) portrayed skateboarders as reckless rebels.\n\nCalifornia duo Jan and Dean recorded the song \"Sidewalk Surfin'\" in 1964, which is the Beach Boys song \"Catch a Wave\" with new lyrics associated with skateboarding.\n\nThe image of the skateboarder as a rebellious, non-conforming youth has faded in recent years. Certain cities still oppose the building of skateparks in their neighborhoods, for fear of increased crime and drugs in the area. The rift between the old image of skateboarding and a newer one is quite visible: magazines such as \"Thrasher\" portray skateboarding as dirty, rebellious, and still firmly tied to punk, while other publications, \"Transworld Skateboarding\" as an example, paint a more diverse and controlled picture of skateboarding. Furthermore, as more professional skaters use hip hop, reggae, or hard rock music accompaniment in their videos, many urban youths, hip-hop fans, reggae fans, and hard rock fans are also drawn to skateboarding, further diluting the sport's punk image.\n\nFilms such as the 1986 \"Thrashin<nowiki>'</nowiki>\", \"Grind\" and \"Lords of Dogtown\", have helped improve the reputation of skateboarding youth, depicting individuals of this subculture as having a positive outlook on life, prone to poking harmless fun at each other, and engaging in healthy sportsman's competition. According to the film, lack of respect, egotism and hostility towards fellow skateboarders is generally frowned upon, albeit each of the characters (and as such, proxies of the \"stereotypical\" skateboarder) have a firm disrespect for authority and for rules in general. Group spirit is supposed to heavily influence the members of this community. In presentations of this sort, showcasing of criminal tendencies is absent, and no attempt is made to tie extreme sports to any kind of illegal activity.\n\n\"Gleaming the Cube\", a 1989 movie starring Christian Slater as a skateboarding teen investigating the death of his adopted Vietnamese brother, was somewhat of an iconic landmark to the skateboarding genre of the era. Many well-known skaters had cameos in the film, including Tony Hawk and Rodney Mullen, where Mullen served as Slater's stunt double.\n\nThe increasing availability of technology is apparent within the skateboarding community. Many skateboarders record and edit videos of themselves and friends skateboarding. However, part of this culture is to not merely replicate but to innovate; emphasis is placed on finding new places and landing new tricks.\n\nSkateboarding video games have also become very popular in skateboarding culture. Some of the most popular are the \"Tony Hawk\" series and \"Skate series\" for various consoles (including hand-held) and personal computer.\n\nWhilst early skateboarders generally rode barefoot, preferring direct foot-to-board contact, and some skaters continue to do so, one of the early leading trends associated with the sub-culture of skateboarding itself, was the sticky sole \"Slip-On\" Skate shoe, most popularized by Sean Penn's skateboarding character from the film Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Because early skateboarders were actually surfers trying to emulate the sport of surfing, at the time when skateboards first came out on the market, many skateboarded barefoot. But skaters often lacked traction, which led to foot injuries. This necessitated the need for a shoe that was specifically designed and marketed for skateboarding, such as the Randy \"720\", manufactured by the Randolph Rubber Company, and Vans sneakers, which eventually became cultural iconic signifiers for skateboarders during the 70s & 80's as skateboarding became more widespread.\n\nWhile the skate shoes design afforded better connection & traction with the deck, skaterboarders themselves could often be identified when wearing the shoes, with Tony Hawk once saying, \"If you were wearing Vans shoes in 86, you were a skateboarder\" Because of its connection with skateboarding, Vans financed the legendary skateboarding documentary \"Dogtown and Z-Boys\" and was the first sneaker company to endorse a professional skateboarder Stacy Peralta. Vans has a long history of being a major sponsor of many of skateboarding's competitions and events throughout skateboarding's history as well, including the Vans Warped Tour and the Vans Triple Crown Series.\n\nAs it eventually became more apparent that skateboarding had a particular identity with a style of shoe, other brands of shoe companies began to specifically design skate shoes for functionality and style to further enhance the experience and culture of skateboarding including such brands as; Converse, Nike, DC Shoes, Globe, Adidas, Zoo York and World Industries. Many professional skateboarders are designed a pro-model skate shoe, with their name on it, once they have received a skateboarding sponsorship after becoming notable skateboarders. Some shoe companies involved with skateboarding, like Sole Technology, an American footwear company that makes the Etnies skate shoe brand, further distinguish themselves in the market by collaborating with local cities to open public Skateparks, such as the etnies skatepark in Lake Forest, California.\n\nIndividuality and a self-expressed casual style have always been cultural values for skateboarders, as uniforms and jerseys are not typically worn. This type of personal style for skateboarders is often reflected in the graphical designs illustrated on the bottom of the deck of skateboards, since its initial conception in the mid seventies, when Wes Humpston and Jim Muri first began doing design work for Dogtown Skateboards out of their garage by hand, creating the very first iconic skateboard-deck art with the design of the \"Dogtown Cross\".\n\nPrior to the mid-seventies many early skateboards were originally based upon the concept of “Sidewalk Surfing” and were tied to the surf culture, skateboards were surfboard like in appearance with little to no graphics located under the bottom of the skateboard-deck. Some of the early manufactured skateboards such as \"Roller Derby\", the \"Duraflex Surfer\" and the \"Banana board\" are characteristic. Some skateboards during that time were manufactured with company logo's or stickers across the top of the deck of the skateboard, as griptape was not initially used for construction. But as skateboarding progressed & evolved, and as artist began to design and add influence to the artwork of skateboards, designs and themes began to change.\n\nThere were several artistic skateboarding pioneer's that had an influence on the culture of skateboarding during the 1980s, that transformed skateboard-deck art like Jim Phillips, who's edgy comic-book style \"Screaming Hand\", not only became the main logo for Santa Cruz Skateboards, but eventually transcended into tattoos of the same image for thousands of people & vinyl collectable figurines over the years. Artist Vernon Courtlandt Johnson is said to have used his artwork of skeletons and skulls, for Powell Peralta, during the same time that the music genres of punk rock and new wave music were beginning to mesh with the culture of skateboarding. Some other notable skateboard artists that made contribrutions to the culture of skateboarding also include Andy Jenkins, Todd Bratrud, Neil Blender, Marc McKee, Tod Swank, Mark Gonzales, Lance Mountain, Natas Kaupas and Jim Evans.\n\nOver the years skateboard-deck art has continued to influence and expand the culture of skateboarding, as many people began collecting skateboards based on their artistic value and nostalgia. Productions of limited editions with particular designs and types of collectible prints that can be hung on the wall, have been created by such famous artist as Andy Warhol and Keith Haring. Most professional skateboarders today have their own signature skateboard decks, with their favorite artistic designs printed on them using Computer graphics.\n\nSkateboards, along with other small-wheeled transportation such as in-line skates and scooters, suffer a safety problem: riders may easily be thrown from small cracks and outcroppings in pavement, especially where the cracks run across the direction of travel. Hitting such an irregularity is the major cause of falls and injuries. The risk may be reduced at higher travel speeds.\n\nSevere injuries are relatively rare. Commonly, a skateboarder who falls suffers from scrapes, cuts, bruises, and sprains. Among injuries reported to a hospital, about half involve broken bones, usually the long bones in the leg or arm. One-third of skateboarders with reported injuries are very new to the sport, having started skating within one week of the injury. Although less common, involving 3.5–9 percent of reported injuries, traumatic head injuries and death are possible severe outcomes.\n\nSkating as a form of transportation exposes the skateboarder to the dangers of other traffic. Skateboarders on the street may be hit by other vehicles or may fall into vehicular traffic.\n\nSkateboarders also pose a risk to other pedestrians and traffic. If the skateboarder falls, the skateboard may roll or fly into another person. A skateboarder who collides with a person who is walking or biking may injure or, rarely, kill that person.\n\nMany jurisdictions require skateboarders to wear bicycle helmets to reduce the risk of head injuries and death. Other protective gear, such as wrist guards, also reduce injury. Some medical researchers have proposed restricting skateboarding to designated, specially designed areas, to reduce the number and severity of injuries, and to eliminate injuries caused by motor vehicles or to other pedestrians.\n\nThe use, ownership and sale of skateboards were forbidden in Norway from 1978 to 1989 because of the high number of injuries caused by boards. The ban led skateboarders to construct ramps in the forest and other secluded areas to avoid the police. There was, however, one legal skatepark in the country in Frognerparken in Oslo.\n\nThe use of skateboards solely as a form of transportation is often associated with the longboard. Depending on local laws, using skateboards as a form of transportation outside residential areas may or may not be legal. Backers cite portability, exercise, and environmental friendliness as some of the benefits of skateboarding as an alternative to automobiles.\n\nThe United States Marine Corps tested the usefulness of commercial off-the-shelf skateboards during urban combat military exercises in the late 1990s in a program called Urban Warrior '99. Their special purpose was \"for maneuvering inside buildings in order to detect tripwires and sniper fire\".\n\nTrampboarding is a variant of skateboarding that uses a board without the trucks and the wheels on a trampoline. Using the bounce of the trampoline gives height to perform a tricks, whereas in skateboarding you need to make the height by performing an ollie. Trampboarding is seen on YouTube in numerous videos.\n\nSwing boarding is the activity where a skateboard deck is suspended from a pivot point above the rider which allows the rider to swing about that pivot point. The board swings in an arc which is a similar movement to riding a half pipe. The incorporation of a harness and frame allows the rider to perform turns spins all while flying though the air.\n\nSkateboarding damages urban terrain features such as curbs, benches, and ledges when skateboarders perform \"grinds\" and other tricks on these surfaces. Private industry has responded to this problem by using skate deterrent devices, such as the Skatestopper, in efforts to prevent further damage and to reduce skateboarding on these surfaces.\n\nThe enactment of ordinances and the posting of signs stating \"Skateboarding is not allowed\" have also become common methods to discourage skateboarding in public areas in many cities, to protect pedestrians and property. In the area of street skating, tickets and arrest from police for trespassing and vandalism are not uncommon.\n\nSkateboarding has become an important problem in Freedom Plaza, a National Park within the Pennsylvania Avenue National Historic Site in Washington, D.C. The Plaza contains copies of portions of Pierre (Peter) Charles L'Enfant's 1791 plan for the nation's capital city that have been inscribed in the park's raised marble surface.\n\nFreedom Plaza has become a popular location for skateboarding, although the activity is illegal and has resulted in police actions. A 2016 National Park Service management plan for the Historic Site states that skateboarding has damaged stonework, sculptures, walls, benches, steps, and other surfaces in some areas of the Plaza. The management plan further states that skateboarding presents a persistent law enforcement and management challenge, as popular websites advertise the Plaza's attractiveness for the activity. The plan notes that vandals have removed \"No Skateboarding\" signs and recommends the replacement of those signs.\n\nA professional skateboarder promoted on Facebook the use of governmental sites for the prohibited activity during the 2013 federal government shutdown in the United States.\n\nNonetheless, efforts have been taken to improve recognition of the cultural heritage as well as positive effects of skateboarding in cities. By raising £790,000, the Long Live Southbank initiative managed to curb the destruction of a forty years old spot in London due to urban planning, a salvaging operation whose effect extends beyond skateboarding. The presence of skateboarders on this public space keeps the area under nearly constant watch and drives homeless people away, increasing the feeling of safety in the area. The activity attracts artists such as photographers and film makers, as well as a significant number of tourists, which in turn drives economic activity in the neighborhood. \n\n\n"

                "Flip trick\n\nA flip trick is a type of skateboarding trick in which the skateboard rotates around its vertical axis, or its vertical axis and its horizontal axis simultaneously. The first flip trick called a kickflip, originally called a \"magic flip,\" was invented by professional skateboarder Rodney Mullen.\n\nThe following is a list of general skateboarding terms that will assist novice readers to better understand the descriptions of flip tricks contained in this article:\n\nThe concepts of frontside and backside originate from surfing, whereby the terms defined the position of the surfer in relation to the wave.\n\n\nAn abbreviated form of the title \"nose ollie\", a nollie is an ollie executed at the front of the skateboard when the rider shifts his stance from the bottom to the top of the board. The rider then uses his front foot, instead of his back foot, to propel the board upwards. Professional skateboarders Paulo Diaz, Karl Watson, Shuriken Shannon, Tuukka Korhonen, Sean Malto and Tiago Lemos have been recognized for their ability to perform the nollie trick.\n\nA switch is a stance that is opposite to one's natural stance. For example, riding with your left foot forwards as opposed to normally riding with your right foot forwards. A \"regular\" skater's switch stance is \"goofy\", and .\n\nFirst executed by Eddie Elguera during the 1970s, \"fakie\" is a skateboarding stance in which the skater is in his normal stance; however rolling backwards(towards the back foot). .\n\nThe shuvit move was invented by professional skateboarder Eddy Dela Rosa. A \"shuvit\" involves rotating the skateboard in a 180-degree motion without flipping the board. It involves pushing (or \"popping\") the tail while also shoving the board under the rider's feet. While the board rotates beneath the rider, he/she maintains the same position in the air. If performed with a larger rotation, the trick is named according to the extent of the rotation: a 360-, 540-degree, etc. shuvit. Professional skateboarder Christophe \"Willow\" Wildgrube performed a frontside 360-degree pop shuvit for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website.\n\nFor the execution of a grind, one makes moving contact with an object using the axles between the wheels, called trucks. Generally, no other part of the skateboard should be in contact with the object that is the subject of the grind. Numerous variations have been invented, whereby flip tricks are combined with grinds, such as the 'kickflip 50-50', 'nollie flip crooked grind', or 'crooked grind nollie flip out'.\n\nIn a slide, one makes contact with an object using any part of the wooden deck construction of the skateboard, including the griptape, and moves along the object. Numerous variations have been invented, whereby flip tricks are combined with slides, such as the \"kickflip boardslide\" and the \"kickflip tailslide\".\n\nGrabs are a skateboarding trick usually executed on transitional terrain, in the air between takeoff and landing. They consist of the rider holding on to any part of the skateboard while in air. They can also be executed on flat ground—for example, a \"boneless\" is a grab trick performed on flat ground, whereby one foot is used to lift off the ground and the other is used to grab the skateboard. Numerous variations have been invented, whereby flip tricks are combined with grabs, such as the \"kickflip indy grab\".\n\nThe fundamental tricks include the ollie, frontside 180, backside 180, pop shove-it, kickflip and heelflip. Combinations and variations were then derived from these basic tricks, such as the kickflip shove-it (varial kickflip), heelflip front sideshove-it (varial heelflip), hardflip, inward heelflip, nollie flip, nollie heelflip, nollie 360 flip, fakie kickflip, fakie heelflip, fakie 360 flip and the laser flip (heelflip 360 fs shuvit).\n\nAll tricks can be performed in any of the four stances—natural, fakie, switch, and nollie—and all flip tricks can be performed frontside or backside. When the board spins on both axes, it is more common for both to spin in the same direction, such as with 360 flips and laser flips; however, the board flips in contrasting angles for hardflips and inward heelflips.\n\nA finger flip requires the skateboarder to flip the board in any direction using their fingers on the nose or tail; the first ollie finger flip was invented by Mullen in 1986. Mullen has been filmed executing finger flip 360-flips and Tony Hawk executed the first finger flip in 'vert' skateboarding (skateboarding on ramp structures that consist of vertical transition).\n\nThis was the first version of the kickflip, whereby the rider hooks one foot under the board to create the flipping motion. Mullen explained to Canadian magazine, \"SBC Skateboarding\":\nPeople were doing the original Kickflips, where you hook your foot over the side, and the set-up was so rotten. You had to stand parallel [like a skier]. People tried that trick on banks, and rolled in standing like that and fell straight back. I understood that this trick needed no set-up, and it’d be an important move—for me, at least. I knew it gave me a whole new doorway to go through.\n\nA flip whereby the rider alights from the board, flips the board horizontally, 360 degrees, and then catches the board with his/her feet when the board re-lands on its wheels.\n\nWhen a skateboarder horizontally flips the board 360 degrees by flicking the corner of the board towards the skater—the trick was invented by Mullen in 1982 in a Floridian farmhouse. Instances of multiple spins are named according to how many spins are completed (e.g. double kickflip, triple kickflip, etc.)—professional skateboarder Daewon Song was filmed in 2010, performing both a double and triple kickflip, in a web video entitled \"Daewon Dorking Around at DVS\".\n\nSimilar to a kickflip, the heelflip is instead executed with the heel section flipping away from the skater this time. For a regular-footed skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of a view from behind the skater. Again, a kick formulates part of the ollie, but unlike the kickflip, the kick is directed forward and outwards, away from the rider's toe side (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel—hence the name. The trick was invented by Mullen in 1982. Instances of multiple spins are named according to how many spins are completed (e.g. double heelflip, triple heelflip, etc.)—skateboard videographer, Jon Fistemanu, is filmed executing a double heelflip in a 2010 web video entitled \"Daewon Dorking Around at DVS\".\n\nA kickflip combined with a frontside or backside 180-degree ollie—the trick is also known as a frontside or backside flip. The backside 180 kickflip was invented by Mullen in 1984. Professional skateboarder Andrew Reynolds performed a frontside kickflip for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website. Professional skateboarder (and co-owner of The Berrics) Steve Berra performed a backside kickflip for the \"Trickipedia\" section of his website. Multiple spins can also be incorporated into this trick and a frontside 180 double kickflip was filmed for the \"Skateology\" web-based video series.\n\nA heelflip combined with a frontside or backside 180-degree movement—the trick is also known as a frontside or backside \"heel\". Song is filmed performing a frontside heelflip on a transitional structure located on the back of a truck in a web-based video entitled \"DVS Daewon x Almost Love Child\".\n\nA late flip is a kickflip executed in a secondary motion, using your front or back foot, after or at the peak of an ollie—this is different from the one fluid motion that is involved with the execution of an ollie. Professional skateboarder Mike Mo Capaldi used a late flip variation in his heat against Shane O'Neill in the \"Battle at the Berrics V\" competition.\n\nAn \"[[Freestyle skaterrics website.\n\nThis flip trick variation involves the execution of a back-foot ollie impossible (the board wrapping 360 degrees around your back foot), followed by a flipping of the board, also with the back foot, as part of the same motion. The trick is also called the \"Mo flip\" because it was popularized by professional skateboarder [[Mike Mo Capaldi]].\n\nProfessional skateboarder [[Chris Haslam (skateboarder)|Chris Haslam]] was filmed performing this trick in slow motion and the footage was published on the Internet-based RIDE Channel. Haslam performs the trick while adopting his natural stance (goofy), but when the trick is performed \"switch\" it is called a \"Merlin twist.\"\n\nA varial kickflip (also known as a kickflip shuvit or 180 flip) is a kickflip combined with a backside-pop shuvit. The trick featured prominently in the Blueprint video \"The First Broadcast\" and the trick has received a significant amount of criticism from within the skateboard community; former Blueprint rider Mark Baines has stated in an online interview:\nThe shuv-it flip thing is weird. I don’t think there are many tricks that look bad all the time. Gino can do heelflips and make them look like the best trick ever. It’s how it’s done not what it is. I wouldn’t say my shuv-it flips were that good though. The fakie varial flip in First Broadcast is the best thing I ever filmed though. People basically hear or read something on a forum then feel they gotta hate it I suppose. I don’t really know. Like I say a lot of the time with tricks it’s how it’s done.\nA \"varial heelflip\" (originally known as a \"heelflip shuvit\") is a heelflip combined with a frontside pop shuvit. Professional skateboarders [[Chico Brenes]] and Moose (the latter filmed the [[High-definition video|high-definition (HD)]] version) filmed the trick for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website. The official name of the trick in the 21st century was a point of contention among skateboarders; the issue was discussed on The Berrics website in early March 2013 in a short video segment entitled \"Name Game\" and the \"varial heelflip\" title emerged as the favored name.\n\nA combination of a 360-degree backside-pop shuvit and a kickflip. Also known as a tre flip. Professional skateboarders such as Josh Kalis, Capaldi, Ethan Fowler, and Stefan Janoski have been recognized for their 360 flips. The trick was invented by Mullen in 1983.\n\nAn extra rotation can also be added, known as a \"360 double flip\", and Capaldi, O'Neill, and Song have been filmed executing the trick; O'Neill was also filmed executing the trick in switch stance as part of [[The Berrics#Battle at the Berrics 6|Battle at the Berrics 6]]. Footage of professional skateboarder Chris Cole, executing a 360 triple flip, was released on the internet in 2010.\n\nA combination of a fakie laser flip (360 Heelflip) and a frontside half-cab. The invention of this trick has been credited to professional skateboarder [[Rick Howard]]; however, Howard has publicly stated that he does not appreciate the recognition, as he does not believe that he is the trick's inventor. Song has executed the trick numerous times during the period from 2011 to early 2013 (X Games Real Street, \"5-Incher\", \"5-Incher B-Side Edit\", \"iFun\" web clip, and \"Who Is Daewon Song?\"). Early in his career, Song also performed the trick on transition without the tail hitting the ground—as is usually the case in skateboarding—and the trick also appears in his World Industries \"Love Child\" video part.\n\nA hardflip combines a frontside pop shuvit with a kickflip. This trick is awkward to execute, and the board sometimes appears to move vertically through the legs—the degree of verticality is determined by the front-foot action. The first hardflip to be captured on film was in the World Industries \"Love Child\" video and was executed by Daewon Song—Song stated in an online interview:\nThe worst hardflip ever documented? It was the first, but it was the worst, so it's cool. So it's like first and worst. Back then, too, I didn't even know what it was. [Be]cause all I know is that I had to mule-kick the f*** out of my front...back foot, move it out of the way, and if you shot a photo, there would definitely be three frames of something that just did not look right.\n\nProfessional skateboarders such as Stevie Williams (executed a hardflip to nosegrind at Love Park in [[Philadelphia]], U.S.), Gino Ianucci, Chet Thomas, and Kris Markovic have been recognized for their hardflips. In the Almost \"5-Incher\" video, [[Lewis Marnell]] performs a hardflip to 5-0 grind. Sponsored skateboarder Brandon Turner executed a hardflip down the famous Carlsbad Gap (no longer in existence) in California, US.\n\nDouble hardflips have also been executed and Jake McAtee was filmed in 2009 performing the variation on a \"hip\" structure located at a skate park.\n\nA 360 frontside pop shuvit combined with a \nkickflip. Pro skater Sean Malto and Donovan strain both performed 360 hardflips in an unsanctioned battle for Battle of the Berrics X in 2017.\nProfessional skateboarder Jimmy Carlin was filmed executing a 360 hardflip down a set of stairs in the video \"Capital Motion\". American skateboarder Robbyn Spangler-Magby (amateur) has also been filmed executing the trick—at 1,000 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] with a Redlake N3 high speed camera—for the Skateology web-based video series.\n\nThe 360 Hard-Flip was first documented in the 2005 video \"Synopsis\" it was performed by Al Garcia and was executed over a hip. The video featured top skaters Gershon Mosley, Aaron Snyder, and Dan Pageau. \"Synopsis\" marks the first video that both Mike Mo and Nick Merlino made their first appearance in.\n\nA nollie hardflip late backside 180 (often mistakenly thought of as a hardflip late backside 180), this trick was popularized by [[Kareem Campbell]] with his only performance of it on transition in Issue 30 of \"411 Video Magazine\" covering September-October 1998.\n\nA hardflip with backside 360-degree body rotation—the trick has been credited to Spangler-Magby.\n\nA flip trick in which a frontside 360 shuvit is combined with a heelflip (also known as frontside 360 shove-it heel flips)—the trick was invented by Mullen. Professional skateboarder [[Torey Pudwill]] has been recognized for his laser flips and he performed the trick for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website. Double laser flips have also been performed.\n\nA backside-pop shuvit (180 degree) combined with a heelflip. Flow skateboarder James Espinoza was filmed performing a fakie variation on The Berrics website.\n\nAn inward heelflip executed at the front of the board in the nollie position. Professional skateboarder Bryan Herman performs the trick in a promotional video clip for his signature model shoe the Emerica \"G6\", and professional skateboarder [[Chris Cole (skateboarder)|Chris Cole]] was filmed executing a nollie inward heelflip at the Woodward facility in [[Egypt]] in 2010. Professional skateboarder Lenny Rivas filmed a \"Trick Tip\" for CCS TV (Internet video channel for the CCS online retail outlet) in December 2012.\n\nA backside 360 shuvit combined with a heelflip.\n\nAn inward heelflip with two heelflip rotations. Unsponsored skateboarder Carell Harvey was filmed, with a Redlake N3 high-speed camera at 1,000 frames per second, performing the variation in 2011.\n\nA 360 inward double is a 360 inward heelflip with two heelflip rotations.\n\nA bigspin inward heel is a 360-degree inward heelflip with a 180-degree body rotation in the same direction. It is believed that pro-skater Tom Stano created this trick in an early 1980s skating video.\n\nThe skateboarder's body spins 360 degrees in the same direction as the board during a kickflip. Professional skateboarder [[Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder)|Paul Rodriguez]] finished in second place in \"[[The Berrics#Battle at the Berrics 2|The Battle of the Berrics 2]]\" (contest) to Cole, as he was unable to execute the 360-degree kickflip.\n\nA bigflip is a 360 flip combined with a backside 180-degree body rotation. Rodriguez executes a bigspin down a set of stairs in the final scene of the [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] \"#skateeverydamnday\" commercial that was filmed in China in 2012. Professional skateboarder Mark Appleyard performed the trick for \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website.\n\nA 540-degree flip with a 180-degree body rotation (when a 360-degree body rotation is executed, the trick is known as a \"Gazelle flip/360 Bigspin\").\n\nA 720 flip with a 180-degree backside rotation of the body (when the board spins 720 degrees, does one flip and your body does a 180 degree rotation the same way your board does). Invented and landed by Sewa Kroetkov and filmed by Chris Chann.\n\nA Laser flip combined with a frontside 180-degree body rotation in the same direction. Amateur skateboarder Felipe Gustavo performs a switch version for the \"Trickipedia\" section of The Berrics website.\n\nA hardflip with a frontside 360-degree body rotation. The double grape flip consists of two hardflips and the 360-degree body rotation—the double variation was invented by [[Donovan Strain]].\n\nFlipping the board by using one foot that is under the board and flipping it in the kickflip or heelflip direction—this trick was invented by Mullen in 1992. While skateboarding on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], Mullen performs numerous variations of this flip trick in his \"[[Rodney Mullen vs. Daewon Song#Round 3|Almost: Round Three]]\" video part.\n\nA shuv-it, with a late underflip performed by the back foot. While professional skateboarders rarely perform this trick, numerous segments of home video footage, in which unsponsored skateboarders perform the trick, has been published on the Internet.\n\nThe rider uses the same pressure that would be applied if he/she is attempting to adopt a \"[[Freestyle skateboarding tricks#Primo Slide|primo]]\" position (when the board is positioned on its side/edge); however, one foot is placed under the board so that the board is not completely in a \"dark\" position (when the board is upside down, with the griptape facing the ground). The other foot is then placed on the tail of the board when the board is upside down—the foot beneath the board is then used to scoop the board up, and then around. The rider then jumps onto the board to land in the starting position. Mullen invented the Casper 360 flip in 1983.\n\nA flatground trick performed without touching the floor. Starting in a normal stance, the rider uses backfoot pressure to flip the board into the \"dark\" position, standing on the underside of the board's tail and nose with either foot. Then, in one swift movement, the skateboarder applies pressure to the side of the board, with either foot lifting up onto the opposite side of the board. The skateboarder then uses the other foot to scoop the board over and around, while jumping to land back on the right side of the board.\n\nA nollie casper flip is a half-nollie flip that is caught upside down, with the front foot under the front trucks; the board is then flipped back over, heelflip-style, with a combined pop shuvit action.\n\nThis flip trick is a half-heelflip—the front foot catches the board upside down—combined with a backside shuvit.\n\nA kickflip or heelflip shuvit with a 180-degree body rotation in the opposite direction to the rotation of the board.\n\nA [[nightmare flip]] is a varial kickflip with an extra kickflip rotation. Also known as varial double kickflip\n\nA Hospital flip consists of two separate motions: firstly, the skateboarder performs a kickflip but stalls the rotation of the board at the halfway point; the front foot then executes an upward flick that causes the board to spin 180 degrees along the longitudinal axis.\n\nFootage of an alpha flip is provided in a YouTube tutorial by Cotton Mouth Skateboards that features a skateboarder combining a backside 180 with a 360-degree hospital flip of the board around the front foot. The tutorial states: \"The front foot never leaves the board(Its easier this way. However, it is a hospital flip, not an impossible, so it may).\"\n\nFootage of both a regular beta flip and fakie beta flip were published on the Cotton Mouth Skateboards YouTube channel in 2012 and 2010, respectively. In the 2010 video clip, the skateboarder describes a fakie beta flip as, \"a fakie backside 360 while you do an alpha flip\"; thus, a beta flip can be described as a backside 360 with a 360-degree rotation of the board around the front foot.\n\nPerformed by pushing with the front foot directly off the nose of the board after an ollie, causing the board to rotate almost vertically 180 degrees towards the frontfoot between the rider's legs while flipping the board 180 degrees so it lands wheels down. Carlin has described the trick as \"Pretty much a varial flip that goes down.\" The trick was invented by Darrell Stanton.\n\nA dolphin/forward flip with a 360-degree rotation. It was named the \"Reda flip\" by Moroccan skateboarder Reda Hadada. Two days after he landed the trick, Chris Chann also landed it. He was inspired by Hadada's video and changed the name to \"Dragon flip\" for his YouTube series \"Trick Challenge\" (episode 11) in April 2014. Chan got the idea for the name from the [[anime]] television series \"[[Dragon Ball Z]]\", which he had been watching the night before filming.\n\nA forward flip combined with a heelflip.\n\nFor an unward flip, the board rotates in the same manner as an \"inward heelflip\", but the board is flipped from under the board with the front foot. This trick is easiest in the nollie position and is considered the complete opposite of a \"nerdflip\". Due to the awkward foot positioning required for an unward flip, the flip trick is typically performed by advanced skateboarders. The trick was invented by Mullen.\n\nA flip trick in which a 540-degree board flip is combined with a 360-degree body rotation in the same direction. So basically a big flip (big spin with kickflip) then immediately after landing 180 pivot. The trick was invented by Mullen in 1981.<ref name=\"Gaz\" /\n\nThis trick is performed like a kickflip, but after the board has made the full kickflip rotation, the front foot flips the board back in the opposite direction like a heelflip from the underside of the board. It is essentially a kickflip with a late front foot underflip.\n\nA pressure varial kickflip.\n\nA pressure 360 flip, flipped with the toe of the back foot. \n\nA quarter-kickflip, late back-foot varial heelflip that was invented by Mullen.\n\nA nollie backside flip followed by a late kickflip—the trick was invented by [[Jerry Hsu]] and was captured in the [[Osiris Shoes|Osiris]] shoe company video \"The Storm\". Hsu was filmed performing the trick on transition during the 2009 Zumiez Couch Tour.\n\nA one and a half varial kick-flip (almost a nightmare flip) that transitions into an anti-Casper flip in a single motion.\n\nA half kick flip shuv-it that transitions into a half late heel flip in a single motion—the trick is named after its inventor, professional skateboarder [[Chris Haslam (skateboarder)|Chris Haslam]].\n\nInvented by Haslam, the name of the trick is taken from the Russian ([[Cyrillic]]) version of the name of fellow professional skateboarder Nestor Judkins (sponsored by [[Enjoi]] skateboards, Krux trucks, RVCA clothing, and [[adidas]] footwear). The trick is a switch, half frontside flip to back foot bigspin flip. In his online introduction of the truck for sponsor, Strange Notes ([[Independent Trucks]]), Haslam explained:\n\nHaslam also invented a switch flip trick that, as of 2012, had not been named. The trick was filmed for the Strange Notes company under the title, \"Chris Haslam Crazy Ass trick\".\n\nThe rider is in a \"hang ten\" position and then pops the board down, resulting in a pressure nollie hardflip through the rider's legs.\n\nThis flip trick can be executed while rolling along or in a stationary position. The skateboarder can either start on the board or on the ground (if the board is rolling, the skateboarder usually hops off the board first). The skateboarder places his/her hands on the board and then quickly pulls the board's edge up, causing it to flip, and then the skater lands on the board with both feet.\n\nFor a rail flip, the skateboarder stands on the side of the board and uses the back foot to flip the board with pressure.\n\nA Railstand nightmare flip is a double-kick flip shuvit executed from a \"primo\" position.\n\nA Frightmare flip is a nightmare flip with a frontside 180-degree body rotation.\n\nA \"no comply\" is a trick where the skater plants his/her foot, and then uses the back foot and knee to lift the board off the ground. It is a freestyle trick that can be combined with pressure flips, finger flips, and spins. In 2011, a no comply frontside bigspin heelflip was filmed by the Skateology web-based video series.\n\nHaslam performed a \"Switch No Comply Frontside 360 Heelflip\" in May 2013 for the Ride Channel's \"Skateboarding in Slow Motion\" segment.\n\nA trick whereby the front foot is planted on the ground and a pressure flip is then performed in one motion. This flip trick usually involves running and catching the board with front foot.\n\nA bigspin kickflip, whereby the skateboarder's body transitions into a fakie backside 180 after the bigspin kickflip has completed its rotation.\n\nA flip trick in which the board flips in a similar fashion to a frontside kickflip, but the action of the front foot is absent—the flip of the board is reliant upon the pushing down action of the back foot. Aaron \"Jaws\" Homoki has filmed a \"Trick Tip\" video for the RIDE Channel on YouTube, in which he commends professional skateboarder [[Chad Muska]] for his execution of the trick. Muska has received broader recognition for his execution of the trick and it is, therefore, also called a \"Muska flip\".\n\nA late back-foot varial/shuvit flip—the name of the trick was coined by Jimmy Carlin; however, it is unclear who invented the trick.\n\nIs basically an inward heelflip without the heelflip as it is executed only by the same foot used to pop it up whether in the nose or tail—pressure flips are executed using a scooping technique, rather than the \"popping\" action of ollie-based tricks. In an instructional video, Hawk described the action that underpins the trick as a \"pushing/scooping action, instead of an ollie\" and states that the trick is \"old school\", forgotten by later generations of skateboarders. American skateboard shop owner and former professional skateboarder Nate Sherwood is well known for a variety of pressure flip tricks, and Sherwood invented the \"Laser pressure flip\".\n\nA pressure kickflip that rotates 360 degrees.\n\nThe trick became the second flip trick to be named the \"Mo flip,\" as it is a highlight of Capaldi's opening part in Lakai's \"Fully Flared\" video, as well as during his finals match against Shane O'neill in the \"Battle Of The Berrics 5\" contest. The trick is later performed by [[Nyjah Huston]] in \"Battle At The Berrics 7\" in April 2014.\n\nFlip tricks can be executed by 'popping' the boards nose or tail, or by using the foot to lift the board up from underneath (underflip). Basic flip tricks are performed by popping the board with one foot, and using the other foot to flip the raised end. Less common flip variations can be achieved popping the board in an unusual way, where the pop itself makes the board flip. These include pressure flips and toe flips that were more popular in early skateboarding. Flip tricks are usually performed while the skateboarder is rolling, although they may be performed while stationary.\n\n[[Category:Skateboarding tricks]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]",
                "Rotation\n\nA rotation is a circular movement of an object around a center (or point) of rotation. A three-dimensional object can always be rotated around an infinite number of imaginary lines called \"rotation axes\" ( ). If the axis passes through the body's center of mass, the body is said to rotate upon itself, or spin. A rotation about an external point, e.g. the Earth about the Sun, is called a revolution or orbital revolution, typically when it is produced by gravity. The axis is called a pole.\n\nMathematically, a rotation is a rigid body movement which, unlike a translation, keeps a point fixed. This definition applies to rotations within both two and three dimensions (in a plane and in space, respectively.)\n\nAll rigid body movements are rotations, translations, or combinations of the two.\n\nA rotation is simply a progressive radial orientation to a common point. That common point lies within the axis of that motion. The axis is 90 degrees perpendicular to the plane of the motion. If the axis of the rotation lies external of the body in question then the body is said to orbit. There is no fundamental difference between a “rotation” and an “orbit” and or \"spin\". The key distinction is simply where the axis of the rotation lies, either within or outside of a body in question. This distinction can be demonstrated for both “rigid” and “non rigid” bodies.\n\nIf a rotation around a point or axis is followed by a second rotation around the same point/axis, a third rotation results. The reverse (inverse) of a rotation is also a rotation. Thus, the rotations around a point/axis form a group. However, a rotation around a point or axis and a rotation around a different point/axis may result in something other than a rotation, e.g. a translation.\n\nRotations around the \"x\", \"y\" and \"z\" axes are called \"principal rotations\". Rotation around any axis can be performed by taking a rotation around the \"x\" axis, followed by a rotation around the \"y\" axis, and followed by a rotation around the \"z\" axis. That is to say, any spatial rotation can be decomposed into a combination of principal rotations.\n\nIn flight dynamics, the principal rotations are known as \"yaw\", \"pitch\", and \"roll\" (known as Tait–Bryan angles). This terminology is also used in computer graphics.\n\nIn astronomy, rotation is a commonly observed phenomenon. Stars, planets and similar bodies all spin around on their axes. The rotation rate of planets in the solar system was first measured by tracking visual features. Stellar rotation is measured through Doppler shift or by tracking active surface features.\n\nThis rotation induces a centrifugal acceleration in the reference frame of the Earth which slightly counteracts the effect of gravity the closer one is to the equator. One effect is that an object weighs slightly less at the equator. Another is that the Earth is slightly deformed into an oblate spheroid.\n\nAnother consequence of the rotation of a planet is the phenomenon of precession. Like a gyroscope, the overall effect is a slight \"wobble\" in the movement of the axis of a planet. Currently the tilt of the Earth's axis to its orbital plane (obliquity of the ecliptic) is 23.44 degrees, but this angle changes slowly (over thousands of years). (See also Precession of the equinoxes and Pole star.)\n\nWhile revolution is often used as a synonym for rotation, in many fields, particularly astronomy and related fields, revolution, often referred to as orbital revolution for clarity, is used when one body moves around another while rotation is used to mean the movement around an axis. Moons revolve around their planet, planets revolve about their star (such as the Earth around the Sun); and stars slowly revolve about their galaxial center. The motion of the components of galaxies is complex, but it usually includes a rotation component.\n\nMost planets in our solar system, including Earth, spin in the same direction as they orbit the Sun. The exceptions are Venus and Uranus. Uranus rotates nearly on its side relative to its orbit. Current speculation is that Uranus started off with a typical prograde orientation and was knocked on its side by a large impact early in its history. Venus may be thought of as rotating slowly backwards (or being \"upside down\"). The dwarf planet Pluto (formerly considered a planet) is anomalous in this and other ways.\n\nThe speed of rotation is given by the angular frequency (rad/s) or frequency (turn/s, turns per minute), or period (seconds, days, etc.). The time-rate of change of angular frequency is angular acceleration (rad/s²), This change is caused by torque. The ratio of the two (how heavy is it to start, stop, or otherwise change rotation) is given by the moment of inertia.\n\nThe angular velocity vector (an \"axial vector\") also describes the direction of the axis of rotation. Similarly the torque is an axial vector.\n\nThe physics of the rotation around a fixed axis is mathematically described with the axis–angle representation of rotations. According to the right-hand rule, the direction away from the observer is associated with clockwise rotation and the direction towards the observer with counterclockwise rotation, like a screw.\n\nThe laws of physics are currently believed to be invariant under any fixed rotation. (Although they do appear to change when viewed from a rotating viewpoint: see rotating frame of reference.)\n\nIn modern physical cosmology, the cosmological principle is the notion that the distribution of matter in the universe is homogeneous and isotropic when viewed on a large enough scale, since the forces are expected to act uniformly throughout the universe and have no preferred direction, and should, therefore, produce no observable irregularities in the large scale structuring over the course of evolution of the matter field that was initially laid down by the Big Bang.\n\nIn particular, for a system which behaves the same regardless of how it is oriented in space, its Lagrangian is rotationally invariant. According to Noether's theorem, if the action (the integral over time of its Lagrangian) of a physical system is invariant under rotation, then angular momentum is conserved.\n\nEuler rotations provide an alternative description of a rotation. It is a composition of three rotations defined as the movement obtained by changing one of the Euler angles while leaving the other two constant. Euler rotations are never expressed in terms of the external frame, or in terms of the co-moving rotated body frame, but in a mixture. They constitute a mixed axes of rotation system, where the first angle moves the line of nodes around the external axis \"z\", the second rotates around the line of nodes and the third one is an intrinsic rotation around an axis fixed in the body that moves.\n\nThese rotations are called precession, nutation, and \"intrinsic rotation\".\n\nIn flight dynamics, the principal rotations described with Euler angles above are known as \"pitch\", \"roll\" and \"yaw\". The term rotation is also used in aviation to refer to the upward pitch (nose moves up) of an aircraft, particularly when starting the climb after takeoff.\n\nPrincipal rotations have the advantage of modelling a number of physical systems such as gimbals, and joysticks, so are easily visualised, and are a very compact way of storing a rotation. But they are difficult to use in calculations as even simple operations like combining rotations are expensive to do, and suffer from a form of gimbal lock where the angles cannot be uniquely calculated for certain rotations.\n\nMany amusement rides provide rotation. A Ferris wheel has a horizontal central axis, and parallel axes for each gondola, where the rotation is opposite, by gravity or mechanically. As a result, at any time the orientation of the gondola is upright (not rotated), just translated. The tip of the translation vector describes a circle. A carousel provides rotation about a vertical axis. Many rides provide a combination of rotations about several axes. In Chair-O-Planes the rotation about the vertical axis is provided mechanically, while the rotation about the horizontal axis is due to the centripetal force. In roller coaster inversions the rotation about the horizontal axis is one or more full cycles, where inertia keeps people in their seats.\n\nRotation of a ball or other object, usually called \"spin\", plays a role in many sports, including topspin and backspin in tennis, \"English\", \"follow\" and \"draw\" in billiards and pool, curve balls in baseball, spin bowling in cricket, flying disc sports, etc. Table tennis paddles are manufactured with different surface characteristics to allow the player to impart a greater or lesser amount of spin to the ball.\n\nRotation of a player one or more times around a vertical axis may be called \"spin\" in figure skating, \"twirling\" (of the baton or the performer) in baton twirling, or \"360\", \"540\", \"720\", etc. in snowboarding, etc. Rotation of a player or performer one or more times around a horizontal axis may be called a flip, roll, somersault, \"heli\", etc. in gymnastics, waterskiing, or many other sports, or a \"one-and-a-half\", \"two-and-a-half\", \"gainer\" (starting facing away from the water), etc. in diving, etc. A combination of vertical and horizontal rotation (back flip with 360°) is called a \"möbius\" in waterskiing freestyle jumping.\n\nRotation of a player around a vertical axis, generally between 180 and 360 degrees, may be called a \"spin move\" and is used as a deceptive or avoidance maneuver, or in an attempt to play, pass, or receive a ball or puck, etc., or to afford a player a view of the goal or other players. It is often seen in hockey, basketball, football of various codes, tennis, etc.\n\nThe \"end result\" of any sequence of rotations of any object in 3D about a fixed point is always equivalent to a rotation about an axis. However, an object may \"physically\" rotate in 3D about a fixed point on more than one axis simultaneously, in which case there is no single fixed axis of rotation - just the fixed point. However, these two descriptions can be reconciled - such a physical motion can always be re-described in terms of a single axis of rotation, provided the orientation of that axis relative to the object is allowed to change moment by moment.\n\n",
                "Freestyle skateboarding tricks\n\nA freestyle skateboarding trick is a trick done on a skateboard while freestyle skateboarding. Some of these tricks are done in a stationary position, unlike many other skateboarding tricks. The keys to a good freestyle contest run are variety, difficulty, fluidity, and creativity. It should also be noted that this is a partial list, and a full list would never be possible, because new tricks and new combinations are always being created.\n\nNotes: \n\n1970s skate competitions such as the ones shown in Lords of Dogtown would often have an event to see who could do the most consecutive 360 spins on a skateboard. Variations include one foot spins (on the nose or tail, or grabbing the foot while spinning), two feet spins (on the nose or tail), crossfoot spins, 2-board spins, etc.\n\nA trick in which the board rotates 360-degrees while the skateboarder turns 180 degrees in the same direction above it. If the skateboarder rotates in the opposite direction of the skateboard it is called Anti-Bigspin. Can be done in any direction from any position, and is often seen done out of a Casper in freestyle.\n\nHigher rotations are possible, with the rotation of the board noted before the name of the trick; a 540 Bigspin combined a 540 Shove-It and a 180 turn of the body, for example. Once the body turns another 180 degrees, the trick becomes a Gazelle.\n\nThis is a Half Truckhook Impossible caught in a 50/50. The rider stands on the tail, puts his front foot under the board and starts to jump backwards, while also scooping the board in front of him. This will cause the board to flip over and get upside-down. The rider catches the tail of the board with the front hand and lands with the foot which was under the board on the truck. The reason this trick got the name \"Broken Fingers\" is because how dangerous it can be; if you do not jump high enough or don't lean back enough on the landing, there's a good chance you are going to crush your own fingers. There is also a no handed version of this trick - a crossfooted Half Truckhook Impossible caught into a No Handed 50/50.\n\nThis trick was invented by Keith Butterfield. To do the Butter Flip, you stand in Heelside Railstand, and hop both feet to one side of the board. Both feet are side by side with no gap larger than an inch or two between them. The rider puts pressure onto the end of the board, using the foot that is not on the wheel. It pops the board up and you grab it with your hand on the same side of your body as the foot that was on the wheel. This trick is the method used to go from Heelside Railstand to a Pogo or 50/50. You can catch the board with your foot as well rather than your hand making it a Butter Flip to a No Handed 50/50.\n\nA trick where the skater using one foot wraps the board around their other leg which is planted on the ground, then unwraps it to land back in a riding position. Mike Vallely helped bringing popularity to the trick. \"Flamingo or Figure Four\" was the original way of doing it because it looks like a Flamingo or the number 4 - where the board is touching the inside knee/thigh. This trick had little use till later faster versions were perfected (to accommodate the backside 180 re-entry on banks and ramps)Thus \"wrapping your calf\" instead of your knee. Invented by Derek Belen, made popular by Rey Gregorio, then perfected by Dorian Tucker, and Kris Markovich.\n\nA freestyle stance where the skateboard is upside down and balanced on the point of the tail. The skater's back foot is on the underside of the tail and the board maintains its angled position by the skater's front foot being hooked under the deck. It is important to note that having the front foot on the floor is considered cheating, and not a proper casper.\n\nAlso invented by Bobby \"Casper\" Boyden, this trick has nothing to do with the Casper stance. While rolling fakie or nollie, enter a Heelside Railstand one footed. The foot that's not touching the wheel will point down and nudge the griptape side of the skateboard while the rider spins 180 degrees towards the direction of the trucks. After the board and rider have rotated 180 degrees, the feet work together to nudge the skateboard down into a rolling position.\n\nThis is a specific Truck-To-Truck Transfer. Think of it as a half Impossible from a 50/50 to a switch 50/50 – still standing on the back foot. The rider starts from a 50/50, \"throws\" the board over the foot that stands on the truck and jumps up. When the board has done the \"half wrap\", the rider lands on the truck and catches the nose of the board with the same hand he used to flip it. Marco Sassi became the first person in the world to do a 360 Carousel in 2014, successfully completing a full impossible around the foot to land back in the original 50-50 position. To date (July 2015), only two other freestylers have managed to do the same.\n\nThis trick was invented by Vince W the teacher and coache. A Coconut Wheelie or Coco Slide is like a Primo Slide but the deck never touches the ground, so you hold it in a Wheelie on the side. \n\nThis trick is done with two boards, one foot in a tailwheelie on one board and another foot on the second board in a nosewheelie. This trick was seen in the Girl Skateboards video \"Yeah Right!\", Gus Van Sant's film Paranoid Park, and the \"Lords of Dogtown\" movie. The Tony Hawk's Underground game calls this a \"Yeah Right Manual\".\n\nIt's one of the oldest freestyle tricks.\n\nVariations include rollerskate-like double-board tailwheelies and double-board nosewheelies, but also crossfoot wheelies and spins, or a one-foot double-board daffy, possibly invented by Kilian Martin (2010). It's also possible to \"lose\" one of the boards and continue with a one-foot wheelie.\n\nA series of 180-degree pivots. Can be done both ways but both start on the nose (or on the tail while rolling fakie). While rolling forward, pressure is placed on the nose just enough to lift the back wheels. Once the back wheels are lifted, the rider turns either frontside or backside 180 degrees with the nose acting as a pivot point. This is all done quickly - you do not stall on any part. When the 180 pivot is done, you quickly do another in reverse. If you originally did a 180 Frontside Pivot, you will now do a 180 Backside Pivot. When these 180 pivots are done in consecutive lines, they are considered End-Overs (End Over End). It is not uncommon for freestyle skateboarders to throw in harder pivots in to the mix of 180 pivots. A rider may do a string of 180 pivots where every two 180 pivots he follows with one 360 pivot, or alternate between two-footed and one-pivots. \n\nFan Flip is the name give to a Pogo Fingerflip back to Pogo. The rider does a regular pogo, fingerflips (typically with his front hand), jumps up and kicks his legs to the side. After the board completes the flip he catches the board on the truck, usually landing back on the side he started from. It can be also be done from or to a no-handed pogo (still using a fingerflip), or from a no-handed 50-50 back to a no-handed 50-50 using just the feet, in which case it is called, unsurprisingly, a no-handed Fan Flip.\n\nA Fingerflip can be considered an umbrella term for a series of tricks involving the use of a flick of the fingers to flip the skateboard. The rider rolls forward, grabs the nose of the board with the front hand and flips the board while simultaneously jumping up in the air. The rider will come down on the board or catch the board in mid-air. Many variations have been done including the Double Fingerflip, Varial Fingerflip, Backhand Fingerflips, and 360 Fingerflips. There are fakie versions of all the Fingerflips. Ollie Fingerflip variations are typically considered to be harder than regular fingerflip variations because the rider must Ollie first before initiating the Fingerflip. Professional freestyler Darryl Grogan is known for his Ollie 360 Fingerflip, and Rodney Mullen is known to use an Ollie Varial Fingerflip in many of his runs and video footage.\n\nNote that fingerflips are different from handflips, which involve grabbing along the edge of the board and use the full hand to throw the board into a flip. \n\nA 540-degree rotation of the board while the rider spins 360 degrees in the same direction above it. Usually done off the front end of the board and spun backside while travelling forwards, but can be done in any direction and combined with flips. Effectively, this is the next step up from a Bigspin.\n\nThis is a Nose Manual, but without facing the riding direction. The rider increases speed, then places the front foot on the nose while keeping the back foot over the back wheels. While riding, the board tends to turn frontside or backside, ending with a spin.\n\nVariations: One-Wheeled, Backward, Hang Ten (two feet on the nose)\n\nWhile in a Hang Ten position, the skater pops down on the Nose, causing the board to do a Nollie Hardflip motion, traveling vertically between the riders legs and landing back in normal position. If the half flip is done with a Nosegrab, the trick is referred to as a Hazze Flip, named for Hazze Lindgren.\n\nThis trick involves standing on the board in Tailstop with just one foot and spinning the board in an Impossible around that foot with your lead or back hand. You can use either foot and either hand, but both feet must not touch the ground. Not to be confused with the Godzilla Railflip, which is a Triple Varial Railflip with a Body Varial.\n\nA One Handed Handstand, where one hand is planted on the floor and the other hand holds the board in the air. This trick can be done from Tailstop or a Railstand. There are many variations of this trick, because you can do every kind of Fingerflip with the other hand. You can also do \"Varials\" by grabbing the wheel of your board and spin it. The trick can be landed straight, in Tailstop, in a Casper or even in a 50/50 or pogo.\n\nA Handstand on a skateboard. Many variations evolved from this, including One Handed Handstands, Headstands, Frogstands, Handstand Wheelies, Handstand Pivots, and Handstand Handflips/Fingerflips. The Handstand was taken to the other stances too such as Railstand Handstands, with the Single, Double, Varial and 360 Flips out of them and flips which were landed in Railstands again. Also TV Stands, which are Handstands done in 50/50s.\n\nA Backside 360 Nollie, invented by Rodney Mullen. It is done by placing your front foot on the nose of the board and your back foot in Nollie Heelflip position. Then right before you begin the Nollie start to pivot just a little. Then begin your Nollie. If you cannot get a full Nollie 360, try landing it in a 270 and pivot the rest of the way. Once you learned it good enough going 270, then go for the full 360. If you want to pivot at the end, never pivot on the nose, always do it on the back wheels. Variations: grabs, frontside, flips out.\nA trick originally invented by Rodney Mullen where the board wraps vertically over the back foot in a 360 degree rotation. The original Impossible involved hooking the front foot under the nose to lift the board before the back foot began its scoop; later, Mullen would figure out how to \"ollie\" into the trick by simply popping from a regular riding position. There are many variations of both the Nosehook Impossible and Ollie Impossible that have been created over the years, and Darryl Grogan in particular is known for doing many different variations. He was the first to land Impossibles Crossfooted, Halfcab, and to one foot landing. Rodney Mullen has done many variations off the nose, also known as \"Nollie\" Impossibles.\n\nAnother freestyle footwork trick. Set up with your one foot, or your other foot, on the tail of the board, put your one foot on the nose of the board. Two things will happen now, and both must be done at the same time. Pressure is applied to the nose and you pivot 180 degrees on the tail to the side your other foot's heel was facing. Your one foot is also removed prior to the 180 degree pivot and brought to where your board will end up after the 180 degree pivot. It is an advanced version of the End-Over or 180 pivot on the nose or tail because your other foot is detached from the board.\n\nInvented by: Brian Remmer\n\nThe Kickback is a really old freestyle trick, involving a half flip backwards and then a one and a half flips forwards. It is done by placing your front foot on the front bolts and the toes of the back foot along the heelside edge in the middle of your board. You start pushing down on the toes of the back foot and when the board catches your toes, you jump, kick the board forwards, and catch it on the grip tape.\n\nFlip an \"Old School\" Kickflip and turn your body in the air, catching the board with the back foot on the nose, and pivot 180 degrees on the front wheels before the back wheels hit the ground. Invented by Matt Barden in 1980, the trick has since spawned countless variations; some people omit the body varial, landing with their front foot on the nose (a \"nose M80\"), some start rolling fakie, some do a double flip instead of a single one, and some replace the pivot with a fakie bigspin. Other variations include doing the turn in a casper or casper disaster or following the pivot with an immediate spacewalk. \n\nA trick similar to a bicycle wheelie where the rider balances with the front or back wheels off and without the tail or nose on the ground. Manuals can be done with both feet, with one foot or on one wheel. In One Foot Manuals the rider places one foot parallel to the board and balances on the nose or tail. A Manual in which both feet are straight on the nose is called a Hang Ten; its tail counterpart is called a Heelie. The rider can also do English Manuals, by keeping the back foot somewhere where the back bolts are and the front foot underneath the nose and hooks the board up until he manuals. The most difficult variation is the Swedish Manual, most likely named after Swedish pro Stefan \"Lillis\" Akesson. This is the same as the English Manual, except you place your front foot on the nose pointing forward and use your back toes to hook the board up until you Nose Manual. One of the most difficult manual maneuvers is the Hang Ten Nosemanual, where the skater places both of his feet on the nose of the board and performs a nose manual by balancing on the front two wheels. A crossfoot variation is also possible.\n\nAnother type of End-Over. Rather than a rider doing a 180 pivot on the nose frontside and then doing one backside or doing one backside first and then frontside after, the rider pivots backside and backside or frontside and frontside giving the rider the appearance that he/she is taking very large steps forward or backward. The frontside variation has the rider always facing forward, and for the fakie version the rider always twists blind or backside.\n\nMultiple-board tricks expand the versality in the height. Balancing on two, three or more boards placed upon each other may increase the freestyle experience for some novice skaters.\n\nHowever, it is possible to increase the difficulty by making real tricks out of them: Multiple-Board Handstand, Multiple-Board Handstand Flip-out, Ollie-To-Multiple-Board, Rock'n Roll-To-Multiple-Board \"Slide\", Multiple-Board Wheelie, etc.\n\nIn this trick the front foot slides off the side of the board, with the body weight on the back foot over the tail, the board 'snaps' up and can be guided with the back leg/knee. To ride away the rider jumps with his/her front foot back on. The No Comply was commonly used by street skaters in the mid to late 1980s, most commonly being done off parking blocks by bumping the tail off them. This trick has many variations, including 180, 360, Varials, Flips, Fingerflips, Impossibles, etc. Ray Barbee is noted as a master of No Comply variations to many who have watched the earlier Powell videos.\n\nThe original Impossible, this is a trick that flips in the same fashion as the Ollie Impossible, but done with the assistance of the other foot. In its most basic form, the rider starts in tailstop before hooking their front foot under the nose of the board and pulling the board upwards until it is in a vertical position, allowing the back foot to push \"through\" the board and continue with the standard end-over-end Impossible wrapping motion. This can also be done crossfooted, with the front foot hooked under the truck (a \"Truckhook Impossible\"), or rolling (typically done backwards with a 180-degree turn before the Impossible).\n\nOriginally just called the Kickflip and also known as the \"Classic Flip\", this trick dates back to the 1970s and was invented by Curt Lindgren. You stand in the middle of your board with your feet side-by-side, pointed towards the nose. One foot - typically the back foot, although either is acceptable - is hooked around the edge of the board, and as the other foot pushes down, the hooked foot kicks sideways as the rider jumps upwards, turning his body to land back into a normal riding position. Many variations - such as Doubleflips, Varial Flips, 360 Flips and M-80s - have been invented over the years, and more continue to be invented today.\n\nNote that your feet should never touch the ground in the trick, and turning the hooked foot so that it points directly at the other foot is technically an underflip and considered bad form.\n\nThis trick was what allowed flatland skateboarding to reach a vertical height and has given rise to obstacles to the merger of freestyle street creating a completely new style of skateboarding: skateboarding streetstyle. Skateboarding streetstyle made it possible for tricks so they could be done on obstacles. The Ollie was originally developed by Alan \"Ollie\" Gelfand in a bowl, but was bought to flat ground by Rodney Mullen. He understood that with the proper positioning of the foot, the board could pop into the air.\n\nWhile standing still, the rider taps the board fast down on the tail with the back foot and then the front foot changes the upward move into a slightly forward move, thus leveling the board horizontally. In the air, the rider bends his knees and allows the skateboard to launch.\n\nThis trick can be done standing still or moving forward or backward. It can be done in an impressive number of variations including all kinds of combinations of spins, jumps and combined rotations of the body.\n\nThis trick involves the combination of an Ollie with an Airwalk. The rider initiates an Ollie and grabs the board with the front hand. While this is being done the rider kicks the front foot forward (diagonal on the riding direction) and kicks the back foot backwards (diagonal on the riding direction). Like many others, this trick was invented by Rodney Mullen, and comes with an array of variations, including fingerflips and 180 spins.\n\nDone with the board straight up against your legs, this move uses the skateboard as a pogo stick. One foot is on the bottom truck, and one or both hands grab the nose to help lift the board up as the rider hops. It can also be done by squeezing the board between both legs in a no-handed variant, or stood with one foot on the truck and the other crossed over behind it with the toes of that foot pushing against the griptape for a cross-footed pogo.\n\nThis is basically a flip using only one foot (back foot or front foot), where the board is both launched into the air and flipped with one motion. Like Ollie Flips, Pressure Flips can be done nollie or fakie in any combination of flipping and rotational directions. The most common Pressure Flip spins backside, flipping in a heelflip direction - resulting in something very similar to an Inward Heelflip.\n\nThis is a Railstand but done while moving, so you slide along the ground on the side of your board. Invented by Primo Desiderio. The original Primo Slide involved sliding backside 180 degrees, but many skaters now hold them in a straight line, flipping into and out of them. \n\nA Railstand is when one edge of your board is on the ground and you are standing on the other, usually with your feet also on the wheels. From this position you can do many tricks, including Flips, 180s, 360 Spins and combinations of the above (landing into another railstand if you wish), landing into Casper, into 50/50, etc. The railstand and many variations were invented in the 1970s by Bobby \"Casper\" Boyden. A Heelside Railstand is to stand on the board in railstand, with your griptape facing your back, and toeside is the reverse. There are several ways to get into Heelside Railstand as opposed to the limited ways, if not just one way of getting into Toeside Railstand. A common variation of a Railstand is a Cooperstand, which is a Railstand with one foot on a wheel, and the other on the nose. While in Railstand, the limit to what you can do is almost non existent. You do not have to just flip. You can kick the board under you so it spins without flipping while you stand on one wheel, you can walk along the rail in a series of cross-stepping maneuvers, or you can spin a 360 on one wheel while the board remains in place.\n\nThe San Francisco Flip is a type of a Truck-To-Transfer where the rider enters a No-Handed 50/50 and does a \"No-Handed Carousel\" to a Crossfoot No-Handed 50/50. Invented by Guenter Mokulys in the 1980s, and very rare.\n\nInvented by Rodney Mullen, and usually done from a Pogo or a 50-50, this trick involves the front leg tracing a circle around the nose of the board without touching the ground. Experienced skaters can do several Saran Wraps continuously.\n\nNot, contrary to popular belief, merely an Airwalk with the legs kicked in the other direction, a scarewalk is a back handed Airwalk, resulting in the board being held worryingly close to the rider's crotch - hence the name. \n\nA Shove-It is a 180 degree spin (instead of a flip) of the board. Which direction it spins is usually described in the name, such as frontside or backside. When called just a \"Shove-It\", it is assumed it is only a 180 degree Shove-It. If it is any higher in degrees, it is stated. For example, a 360 Shove-It must have the 360 stated or it should be assumed to only be 180 degrees of spin.\n\nIn freestyle, Shove-Its are usually done off the front end of the board while riding forwards, as this combination helps ensure flat and fast spins. In streetstyle, Shove-Its are often popped (unsurprisingly called a Pop Shuvit) and can be done from either end of the board. In both styles, frontside or backside rotations are possible.\n\nSometimes Shove-Its are passed off as Impossibles; it's worth mentioning that a Shove-It should spin totally flat, and a good Impossible should spin totally vertical, with the foot pushing it around during the vertical rotation. A Shove-It where the back foot stays with it throughout the spin is not an Impossible.\n\nA truck-to-truck transfer where the rider switches from a pogo on one truck to a pogo on the other truck where the board remains upside down throughout; during the trick, the board turns over about 90 degrees. Variations: switch foot, same foot and flips.\n\nAnother kind of \"Walk\" in freestyle skateboarding. The rider enters a Manual on two wheels and swings the other end of the board from side-to-side; the wider the swing, the better the Spacewalk looks. The front wheels cannot touch the ground while the Spacewalk is being done. Many variations exist including Nose Spacewalks, Hang Ten Spacewalks, Backward Spacewalks, One-Knee-Kneeled Spacewalks (invented by Günter Mokulys) and many more.\n\nAn Old School Hand plant trick in which one holds the board in one hand, does a One Handed Handstand, puts the board under the feet, then comes back down. It is used as a fancy way to get onto one's board. This is like an Invert on Vert, but done on flatground. This trick was one of the first street tricks.\n\nA trick invented by Rodney Mullen. To do the trick, get into a Pogo and then continuously switch from on foot to the other, with one \"bounce\" of the pogo to keep your balance for each step. The trick should look like you were \"walking\" on the truck.\n\nA Handstand done in a 50/50. While in a 50/50 or Pogo the rider grabs the bottom truck (the one with the back foot on) hops up into a Handstand with the other hand holding the nose of the board. Land the trick by doing a half flip out of it. If you grab the top truck it is called a \"Jawbreaker\", which was invented by Primo Desiderio.\n\nA classic footwork step in which you put one foot in the middle of the board, step to the nose with the back foot, and bring the nose to the back, spinning the board 180 around the center foot. With practice this move can be done quite fast and many times in a row - or even backwards - but it is generally better to do it slower while maintaining balance to create an illusion of speed.\n\nConsidered as one of the most difficult tricks, it was invented by Joachim \"YoYo\" Schulz (YoYo is his nickname) in the early 1980s. This is the same as the Street Plant but done without the feet touching the ground. Usually done by rolling fakie and with one hand planted on the ground as the other is grabbing the board. Schulz has invented numerous variations of this trick, like very stylish One-Foot Yoyo Sadplants.\n\nTerry Synnott is often seen doing this trick which is a cross between the YoYo Plant and the HoHo Plant. The HoHo Plant involves a Handstand with both hands on the ground and the board resting on your feet while the skater is upside down. The rider starts to roll fakie into the YoYo Plant with one hand on the ground and one on the board, and once he is in the YoYo Plant, he removes his hand from the board to enter the Ho-Ho position.\n\nA kickflip or heelflip with a twist; the kickflip is combined with a backside shove-it, and a heelflip is combined with a frontside one.\n"

                "Weezer\n\nWeezer is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1992, consisting of Rivers Cuomo (lead vocals, lead guitar), Patrick Wilson (drums), Brian Bell (rhythm guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and Scott Shriner (bass, backing vocals).\n\nAfter signing to Geffen Records in 1993, Weezer released their debut self-titled album, also known as the \"Blue Album\", in 1994. Backed by successful music videos for the singles \"Buddy Holly\", \"Undone – The Sweater Song\" and \"Say It Ain't So\", the Blue Album became a triple-platinum success. Their second album, \"Pinkerton\" (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but went on to achieve cult status and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and \"Pinkerton\" are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for \"Pinkerton\", bassist Matt Sharp left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.\n\nIn 2001, Weezer returned with another self-titled album, also known as the \"Green Album\", with new bassist Mikey Welsh. With a more pop sound, and promoted by singles \"Hash Pipe\" and \"Island in the Sun\", the album was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left the band and was replaced by current bassist Scott Shriner. Weezer's fourth album, \"Maladroit\" (2002), achieved mostly positive reviews but weaker sales. \"Make Believe\" (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single \"Beverly Hills\" became Weezer's first single to top the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and the first to reach the top ten on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \n\nIn 2008, Weezer released a third self-titled album, also known as the \"Red Album\", featuring \"TR-808s, synths, Southern rap, and baroque counterpoint,\" to mixed reviews. Its lead single, \"Pork and Beans\", became the band's third song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a successful YouTube music video. \"Raditude\" (2009) and \"Hurley\" (2010) featured more \"modern pop production\" and songs co-written with other artists, achieved further mixed reviews and moderate sales. The band's ninth and tenth albums, \"Everything Will Be Alright in the End\" (2014) and the band’s fourth self-titled album, also known as the \"White Album\" (2016), returned to a rock style and achieved more positive reviews. Their eleventh album, \"Pacific Daydream\", which was released on October 27, 2017, signified a drastic departure from their long-time alternative rock style in favor of a mainstream pop sound. Weezer has sold 9.2 million albums in the US and over 17 million worldwide.\n\nVocalist and lead guitarist Rivers Cuomo, drummer Patrick Wilson, bassist Matt Sharp and guitarist Jason Cropper formed Weezer in 1992. The band had its first practice on February 14 of that year; their first gig was closing for Keanu Reeves' band Dogstar shortly after. Weezer signed with Geffen Records on June 25, 1993 and the group recorded its debut album with producer Ric Ocasek at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. During the recording, Cropper left the band and was replaced by guitarist Brian Bell.\n\n\"Weezer\" (also referred to as the \"Blue Album\") was released in May 1994. Geffen originally did not wish to release a single, to see what sales could be generated by word-of-mouth alone. DJ Marco Collins of the Seattle radio station The End started playing \"Undone – The Sweater Song\", leading Geffen to release it as the first single. The music video was directed by Spike Jonze. Filmed in an unbroken take, it featured Weezer performing on a sound stage with little action, bar a pack of dogs swarming the set. The video became an instant hit on MTV.\n\nJonze also directed the band's second video, \"Buddy Holly\", splicing footage from the 1970s television sitcom \"Happy Days\" with Weezer performing in a remade \"Arnold's Drive-In.\" The video achieved heavy rotation on MTV and went on to win four MTV Video Music Awards, including Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative Music Video, and two \"Billboard\" Music Video Awards. The video was also featured on the companion CD for the Microsoft Windows 95 computer operating system. A third single, \"Say It Ain't So\", followed. \"Weezer\" is certified triple platinum in the United States, making it Weezer's best-selling album. It is certified double platinum in Canada.\n\nIn 1994, Weezer took a break from touring for the Christmas holidays. Cuomo traveled to his home state of Connecticut and began recording demos for Weezer's next album. His original concept was a space-themed rock opera titled \"Songs from the Black Hole \"that would express his mixed feelings about success. Weezer developed the concept through intermittent recording sessions through 1995. At the end of the year, Cuomo began studying at Harvard University, where his songwriting became \"darker, more visceral and exposed, less playful\", and the \"Songs from the Black Hole \"album was abandoned.\n\nWeezer's second album, \"Pinkerton\", was released on September 24, 1996. It produced three singles: \"El Scorcho\", \"The Good Life\", and \"Pink Triangle\". In addition to a lawsuit filed against the band over the title of the album, \"Pinkerton\" sold poorly compared to the Blue Album, perhaps due to its darker, more abrasive sound, and it was voted \"one of the worst albums of 1996\" in a \"Rolling Stone\" reader poll. However, the album eventually came to be considered among Weezer's best work; in 2002, \"Rolling Stone\" readers voted \"Pinkerton\" the 16th greatest album of all time, and it has been listed in several critics' \"best albums of all time\" lists.\n\nWeezer completed the \"Pinkerton\" tour in mid-1997 and went on hiatus. Wilson returned to his home in Portland, Oregon to work on his side project, the Special Goodness, and Bell worked on his band Space Twins. Sharp left Weezer to complete the follow-up album for his group the Rentals. He said of his departure from Weezer: \"I don't really know how to speak on this because I don't know what should be kept private and what should be shared. I certainly have my view of it, as I'm sure everybody else has their sort of foggy things. When you have a group that doesn't communicate, you're going to have a whole lot of different stories.\"\n\nCuomo returned to Harvard but took a break to focus on songwriting. He gathered Boston-area musicians and rehearsed new material, including possible songs for the next Weezer album. The group had several different line-ups and played several shows at local clubs, including the band's first show at T.T. the Bear's on October 8, 1997. Future Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh was a constant of the group's evolving lineups. Wilson eventually flew to Boston to sit in on drums. The Boston songs were abandoned, but live recordings of the Boston shows are traded on the internet.\n\nIn February 1998, Cuomo, Bell and Wilson reunited in Los Angeles to start work on the next Weezer album. Rumors suggest Sharp did not rejoin the band and left the group in April 1998, which Sharp denies. The group hired Welsh as its new bassist.\n\nWeezer continued rehearsing and cut demos until the fall of 1998. Frustration and creative disagreements led to a decline in rehearsals, and in late 1998, Wilson left for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo. In November 1998, the band played two club shows with a substitute drummer in California under the name Goat Punishment, consisting entirely of covers of Nirvana and Oasis songs. In the months following, Cuomo entered a period of depression, painting the walls of his home black and putting fiberglass insulation over his windows to prevent light entering.\n\nWeezer did not reunite until April 2000, when the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan made Weezer a lucrative offer to play in August 2000. The festival served as a catalyst for Weezer's productivity, and from April to May 2000, the band rehearsed and demoed new songs in Los Angeles. They returned to live shows in June 2000, playing small unpromoted concerts under the name Goat Punishment. In June 2000, the band joined the American Warped Tour for nine dates.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Weezer went on tour (including dates on the popular Vans Warped Tour). The band's setlist consisted of 14 new songs; when 13 of these songs did not appear on Weezer's next album, fans of the songs started a petition demanding the release of studio versions. Eventually, the band went back into the studio to produce a third album. The band chose the title \"Weezer\" (2001) to repeat the self-titled name of the band's first release. This album became known as the Green Album due to its green album artwork. Shortly after the release, Weezer went on another American tour. The band attracted a new generation of fans thanks to heavy MTV rotation for the videos of the band's hit singles \"Hash Pipe\" and \"Island in the Sun\".\n\nAs reported on August 16, 2001, by MTV, Welsh was checked into a psychiatric hospital. His whereabouts were previously unknown, as he went missing before the filming of the second video for \"Island in the Sun\". Weezer was prompted to find a temporary replacement for Welsh. Through a mutual friend, Cuomo received Scott Shriner's number and asked if he was interested in filling in for Welsh. Shriner accepted the invitation.\n\nThe band took an experimental approach for the recording process of its fourth album by allowing fans to download demos from its official website in return for feedback. After the release of the album, the band said that this process was something of a failure, as the fans did not supply the group with coherent, constructive advice. Cuomo eventually delegated song selection for the album to the band's original A&R rep, Todd Sullivan, saying that Weezer fans chose the \"wackest songs.\" Only the song \"Slob\" was included on the album due to general fan advice.\n\nThe recording was also done without input from Weezer's record label, Interscope. Cuomo had what he then described as a \"massive falling out\" with the label. In early 2002, well before the official release of the album, the label sent out a letter to radio stations requesting the song be pulled until an official, sanctioned single was released. Interscope also briefly shut down Weezer's audio/video download webpage, removing all the MP3 demos. Online Weezer fans staged a brief protest, with several websites proclaiming \"Free \"Maladroit\"\".\n\nIn April 2002, former bassist Matt Sharp sued the band, alleging, among several accusations, that he was owed money for cowriting several Weezer songs. The suit was later settled out of court.\n\nThe fourth album, \"Maladroit\", was released on May 14, 2002, only one year after its predecessor. The album served as a harder-edged version of the band's trademark catchy pop-influenced music, and was replete with busy 1980s-style guitar solos. Although met with generally positive critical reviews, its sales were not as strong as those for the Green Album. Two singles were released from the album. The music video for \"Dope Nose\" featured an obscure Japanese motorcycle gang, and was put into regular rotation. The music video for \"Keep Fishin'\" combined Weezer with the Muppets, and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega.\n\nWeezer released its much-delayed first DVD on March 23, 2004. The \"Video Capture Device\" DVD chronicles the band from its beginnings through \"Maladroit\"'s Enlightenment Tour. Compiled by Karl Koch, the DVD features home video footage, music videos, commercials, rehearsals, concert performances, television performances, and band commentary. The DVD was certified \"gold\" on November 8, 2004.\n\nFrom December 2003 to the fall of 2004, Weezer recorded a large amount of material intended for a new album to be released in the spring of 2005 with producer Rick Rubin. The band's early recording efforts became available to the public through the band's website. The demos were a big hit, but none of the songs recorded at this time were included on the finished album. That album, titled \"Make Believe,\" was released on May 10, 2005. Despite commercial success, \"Make Believe\" got a mixed reception from critics, receiving an average score of 52 on review collator Metacritic. Although some reviews, such as AMG's, compared it favorably to \"Pinkerton\", others, among them Pitchfork's score of 0.4 out of 10, panned the album as predictable and lyrically poor.\n\nThe album's first single, \"Beverly Hills\", became a hit in the U.S. and worldwide, staying on the charts for several months after its release. It became the first Weezer song to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. \"Beverly Hills\" was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, the first ever Grammy nomination for the band. The video was also nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. The second single off \"Make Believe\" was \"We Are All on Drugs\". MTV refused to play the song, so Weezer re-recorded the lyrics by replacing \"on drugs\" with \"in love\" and renaming the song \"We Are All in Love\". In early 2006, it was announced that \"Make Believe\" was certified platinum, and \"Beverly Hills\" was the second most popular song download on iTunes for 2005, finishing just behind \"Hollaback Girl\" by Gwen Stefani. \"Make Believe\"'s third single, \"Perfect Situation\", spent four weeks in a row at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. \"This Is Such a Pity\" was the band's fourth single from the album, but no music video was made for its release. The \"Make Believe\" tour also found the band using additional instruments onstage, adding piano, synthesizers, pseudophones, and guitarist Bobby Schneck.\n\nThe band has announced the possible release of a live DVD composed of footage from the 2005 Japan tour. It will consist of a two-day, seven-camera shoot of the shows in Japan, plus material that will be drawn from various behind-the-scenes footage. The DVD was announced in late 2005, but in a 2006 update on the band's Web site, Karl Koch noted it was \"apparently edited, but has been put on hold for now.\"\n\n\"Weezer\" (also referred to as the \"Red Album\") was released in June 2008. Rick Rubin produced the album and Rich Costey mixed it. The record was described as \"experimental\", and according to Cuomo, who claimed it at the time to be Weezer's \"boldest and bravest and showiest album,\" included longer and non-traditional songs, TR-808 drum machines, synthesizers, Southern rap, baroque counterpoint, and band members other than Cuomo writing, singing, and switching instruments. Pat Wilson said the album cost about a million dollars to make, contrasting it with the $150,000 budget of the Blue Album. The album's singles were produced by Jacknife Lee. Its lead single, \"Pork and Beans\", topped the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks charts for 11 weeks, and its music video won a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video. The second single, \"Troublemaker\", debuted at No. 39 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and peaked at No. 2. In October 2008, the group announced that the third single would be \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\".\n\nOn May 30, 2008, the Toledo Free Press revealed in an interview with Scott Shriner that Weezer would be unveiling the \"Hootenanny Tour\", in which fans would be invited to bring their own instruments to play along with the band. Said Shriner: \"They can bring whatever they want... oboes, keyboards, drums, violins, and play the songs with us as opposed to us performing for them.\"\n\nThe band performed five dates in Japan at the beginning of September and then embarked on what was dubbed the 'Troublemaker' tour, consisting of 21 dates around North America, including two in Canada. Angels and Airwaves and Tokyo Police Club joined the band as support at each show, and Brian Bell's 'other' band The Relationship also performed at a handful of dates. Shortly before the encore at each show, the band would bring on fans with various instruments and perform Island in the Sun and Beverly Hills with the band. At a show in Austin, after Tokyo Police Club had played its set, Cuomo was wheeled out in a box and mimed to a recording of rare Weezer demo, 'My Brain', dressed in pajamas and with puppets on his hands, before being wheeled off again. This bizarre event later surfaced as the climax to a promo video for Cuomo's second demo album, Alone 2.\n\nWeezer toured with Blink-182 in 2009, including an August 30 stop at the Virgin Festival at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland. Drummer Josh Freese joined Weezer on a temporary basis to play drums on the tour, while Pat Wilson switched to guitar. Wilson said in an interview for Yahoo! Music that Cuomo wanted \"to be active and more free on stage and him having guitar on was an impediment.\" Freese stated he was a Weezer fan and did not want to pass up the opportunity to play with the band.\n\n\"Raditude\"'s album artwork was revealed on September 11, featuring a National Geographic contest-winning photograph of a jumping dog named Sidney. The record's release was pushed to November 3, 2009, where it debuted as the seventh best-selling album of the week on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The band scheduled tour dates in December 2009 extending into early 2010 to coincide with the new album's release. On December 6, 2009, Cuomo was injured when his tour bus crashed in upstate New York due to black ice. Cuomo suffered three broken ribs, and his assistant broke two ribs. His wife, baby daughter, and their nanny were also on the bus, but they escaped injury. Weezer cancelled tour dates the following day. The band resumed touring on January 20, 2010.\n\nIn December 2009, it was revealed that the band was no longer with Geffen Records. The band stated that new material would still be released, but the band members were unsure of the means, whether it be self-released, released online, or getting signed by another label. Eventually, the band was signed to the independent label Epitaph.\n\nWeezer co-headlined The Bamboozle in May, 2010, and performed at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In August, 2010, Weezer performed at the Reading and Leeds Festival, and performed at the Voodoo Experience festival in New Orleans, LA in October 2010.\n\nThe album \"Hurley\" was released in September 2010 through Epitaph Records. The name comes from the character Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes from the television show \"Lost\". Jorge Garcia, the actor who portrayed Hurley, stated that being featured on the album cover is \"one of the biggest honors of [his] career.\" Weezer used internet streaming service YouTube as a way to promote the album. Weezer loaned itself to 15 amateur online video producers, \"going along with whatever plans the creator could execute in about 30 minutes.\" The band was promoted through popular channels such as Barely Political, Ray William Johnson and Fred Figglehorn. The Gregory Brothers solicited musical and vocal contributions from the band on one of its compositions built around speeches by Rep. Charles Rangel and President Barack Obama. Weezer calls the promotion \"The YouTube Invasion\".\n\nIn November 2010, Weezer released a compilation album composed of re-recorded versions of unused recordings spanning various years, \"Death to False Metal\". On the same day a deluxe version of \"Pinkerton\", which includes \"25 demos, outtakes and live tracks\" was also released. A third volume of Cuomo's solo \"\" series, titled \"Alone III: The Pinkerton Years\", consisting of demos and outtakes from the \"Pinkerton\" sessions, was released on December 12, 2011. The band also contributed a cover of the Cars' \"You Might Think\" for the Disney-Pixar film \"Cars 2\".\n\nOn October 8, 2011 former Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh was found dead in a Chicago, Illinois hotel room. Weezer performed in Chicago the next day and dedicated the concert to Welsh, who was expected to have attended.\n\nWeezer began working on its ninth studio album in September 2010 with the intent of a 2011 release, but the year ended without seeing a release. The band headlined a four-day rock-themed Carnival Cruise from Miami to Cozumel that set sail on January 19, 2012. In July 2012, Weezer headlined the inaugural Bunbury Music Festival in Cincinnati, Ohio. In early 2013 the band brought its Memories Tour to Australia—the band's first Australian tour since 1996. The band played its first two albums in full at several venues. The band also headlined the Punkspring 2013 tour in Japan and later in the year toured Canada and USA. They played multiple nights in cites around the U.S. The first night shows were dedicated to playing their hits, then the Blue album in full, front to back. The second night, they played Pinkerton in the same fashion. Karl did a \"Memories\" slide show at the Gibson amphitheater in Los Angeles (And most likely many other venues around the U.S.) The slide show consisted of photos of gigs over the years and highlighted the loss of their fanclub team members Mykel and Carli in 1997. \n\nIn January 2014, the band started to record its ninth studio album with producer Ric Ocasek, who previously worked with the band on its first two self-titled albums. A clip of a new song was posted on the band's official YouTube account on March 19, 2014, which confirmed previous rumors of the band being in the studio. On June 12, 2014, it was revealed that the album title would be \"Everything Will Be Alright in the End\". It was released on October 7, 2014 to generally favorable reviews, becoming the band's best-reviewed release since \"Pinkerton\".\n\nOn October 26, 2015, the band released a new single, \"Thank God for Girls\", through Apple Music and to radio the same day. The following week, the band released a second single, \"Do You Wanna Get High?\". Cuomo claimed in an interview with Zane Lowe, that the band was not working on a new album. Later, on January 14, 2016, Weezer released a third single, \"King of the World\", and announced that the band's fourth self-titled album, also known as the \"White Album\", which continued the critical success of the band's previous release. In support of the album, the band performed on the Weezer & Panic! at the Disco Summer Tour 2016 with Panic! at the Disco in 2016. The band later signed to Atlantic Records as part of a joint venture between Warner Music Group and Crush Management.\n\nSoon after the release of the White Album, Cuomo discussed plans for Weezer's next album, provisionally titled the \"Black Album': \"It’s going to maybe be like Beach Boys gone bad [...] I’m thinking of swearing, which is something I’ve never done in songs.” Cuomo also said the album would tackle “more mature topics” and be “less summer day and more winter night”. He suggested the band could return to the recording studio as soon as October 2016. Weezer delayed recording after Cuomo felt his new material was more \"like reveries from a beach at the end of the world [... as if] the Beach Boys and the Clash fell in love by the ocean and had one hell of an amazing baby\".\n\nOn March 16, 2017, the band released a new song titled \"Feels Like Summer\", revealed to be the lead single of the upcoming album. The song drew a mixed reaction from fans but became their biggest hit on Alternative radio in a decade. \"Feels Like Summer\" was heard on The Weather Channel's local forecast segments on July 4, 2017, and again on August 18, 2017. It was also heard on some of the network's promos that summer. On August 16, the band announced that their new album, \"Pacific Daydream\" would be released on October 27. On August 17, the promotional single from the album, \"Mexican Fender\", was released. The following month, \"Beach Boys\" was released, and the month after, they released \"Weekend Woman\" to positive reception. \n\nIn October 2017, Cuomo reiterated his intentions to still release the Black Album, giving May 2018 as a tentative release date.\n\nWeezer has been described as alternative rock, power pop, pop punk, emo, pop rock, indie rock,\nemo pop, geek rock, and pop. The members of Weezer have listed several influences, among them Kiss (with direct references in the song \"In the Garage\"), Nirvana (who were labelmates of the band at DGC for a very brief time before Kurt Cobain's death), the Pixies (especially early in the band's career), the Cars (Ric Ocasek has even produced several of Weezer's records), Pavement, Oasis, Green Day and Wax. Cuomo credited the Beach Boys as a major influence, specifically \"Pet Sounds\", describing Weezer's sound as \"Beach Boys with Marshall stacks.\"\n\nArtists such as Fun., Charli XCX, Real Estate, Dinosaur Pile-Up, Cymbals Eat Guitars, DNCE and the Fall of Troy list Weezer as an influence.\n\nPatrick Wilson started his side-project the Special Goodness in 1996, for which he sings and plays guitar and bass. In May 2012, he released his fourth record with the Special Goodness, entitled \"Natural\".\n\nBrian Bell started the Space Twins in 1994, releasing three singles and an album, \"The End of Imagining\", in 2003. In 2006, Bell started a new band called the Relationship, and did not contribute any songs for Weezer's \"Raditude\" in order to save material for the Relationship. The Relationship's self-titled debut was released in 2010, with a follow-up, Clara Obscura, released in 2017.\n\nFormer bassist Matt Sharp started the Rentals in 1994. After releasing \"Return of the Rentals\" in 1995, Sharp went on to quit Weezer in 1998 to focus more on the Rentals. Sharp has also released work under his own name.\n\nMikey Welsh played with Juliana Hatfield, the Kickovers, Heretix, Jocobono, Slower and Left Nut.\n\nScott Shriner released a single under the name Shriners in 2012 entitled \"Pretty (Watch the Shadow)\".\n\nOn December 18, 2007, Cuomo released \"Alone - The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo\", a compilation of his demos recorded from 1992 to 2007, including some demos from the unfinished \"Songs from the Black Hole\" album. A second compilation, \"\", was released on November 25, 2008, and a third, \"\", on December 12, 2011. The album was sold exclusively with a book, \"The Pinkerton Diaries\", which collects Cuomo's writings from the \"Pinkerton\" era.\n\nOn March 20, 2013, Cuomo and Scott Murphy of the band Allister released \"Scott & Rivers\", a Japanese-language album.\n\nOn December 4, 2008, iOS developer Tapulous released the game \"Christmas With Weezer\", featuring gameplay similar to \"Tap Tap Revenge\" and six Christmas carols performed by the band. A digital EP featuring the songs, titled \"Christmas with Weezer\", was also released on December 16, 2008.\n\nOn June 11, 2010, the band released a new single, \"Represent\". The song was said to be an \"unofficial US anthem\" to coincide with the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe band recorded a cover of \"I'm a Believer\" for the movie \"Shrek Forever After\". Previously, Weezer had planned to include an early version of \"My Best Friend\" from \"Make Believe\" in \"Shrek 2\", but it was rejected due to the song sounding \"too much like it was written for Shrek\".\n\nCurrent members\n\nTouring members\nFormer members\n\nFormer touring members\nTimeline\n\nThe Grammy Award is an award presented by The Recording Academy to recognize achievement in the mainly English-language music industry.

                "Pinkerton (album)\n\nPinkerton is the second studio album by American rock band Weezer, released on September 24, 1996 on DGC Records. After abandoning plans for a rock opera titled \"Songs from the Black Hole\", Weezer recorded \"Pinkerton\" between songwriter Rivers Cuomo's terms at Harvard University, where he wrote much of the album. It is the last Weezer album to feature bassist Matt Sharp.\n\nTo better capture their live sound, Weezer self-produced \"Pinkerton\", creating a darker, more abrasive album than their 1994 self-titled debut. Cuomo's lyrics express disillusionment with the rock lifestyle; the album is named after the character BF Pinkerton from Giacomo Puccini's 1904 opera \"Madama Butterfly\", whom Cuomo described as an \"asshole American sailor similar to a touring rock star\". Like the opera, the album contains references to Japanese culture.\n\n\"Pinkerton\" produced three singles: \"El Scorcho\", \"The Good Life\" and \"Pink Triangle\". It debuted at number 19 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 and fell short of sales expectations after the success of Weezer's debut. It initially received mixed reviews, but went on to achieve cult status and wide acclaim years later; the 2010 \"Deluxe Edition\" reissue holds a perfect score of 100 on aggregate review website Metacritic.\n\nIn 1994, after the multi-platinum success of Weezer's self-titled debut album, Weezer took a break from touring for the Christmas holidays. In his home state of Connecticut, songwriter Rivers Cuomo began preparing material for Weezer's next album using an 8-track recorder. His original concept was a science fiction rock opera titled \"Songs from the Black Hole \"that expressed his mixed feelings about success. Weezer developed \"Songs from the Black Hole\" through intermittent recording sessions throughout 1995.\n\nIn March, Cuomo, who was born with one leg shorter than the other, had extensive leg surgery to lengthen his right leg, followed by painful physiotherapy sessions. This affected his songwriting, as he would spend long periods hospitalized, unable to walk without the use of a cane, and under the influence of painkillers. In the same period, Cuomo applied to study classical composition at Harvard University with an application letter describing his disillusionment with the rock lifestyle, writing:\n\nFans ask me all the time what it is like to be a rock star. I can tell that they are dreaming, as I dreamed, when I was a kid, of someday ruling the world with a rock band. I tell them the same thing I would tell any young rock-star-to-be [...] you will get lonely. You will meet two hundred people every night, but each conversation will generally last approximately thirty seconds, and consist of you trying to convince them that no, you do not want their underwear. Then you will be alone again, in your motel room. Or you will be on your bus, in your little space, trying to kill the nine hours it takes to get to the next city, whichever city it is. This is the life of a rock star.\n\nCuomo felt frustrated by the \"limitations of rock\". Every night after performing with Weezer, he would listen to Giacomo Puccini's 1904 opera \"Madama Butterfly; \"the \"depth of emotion and sadness and tragedy\" inspired him to go further with his music. By May 1996, Cuomo's songwriting had become \"darker, more visceral and exposed, less playful\", and the \"Songs from the Black Hole\" concept was abandoned. Weezer's second album would instead feature songs written while Cuomo was at Harvard, chronicling his loneliness and frustration, or what Cuomo referred to as his \"dark side\".\n\nIn 1995, a few days before Cuomo left to study at Harvard University, Weezer gathered for two weeks of recording at New York City's Electric Lady Studios where they had recorded their debut, and tracked the songs \"Why Bother?\", \"Getchoo\", \"No Other One\" and \"Tired of Sex\". Weezer hoped to explore \"deeper, darker, more experimental stuff\" which would better resemble the band's live sound; to this end, they decided against hiring a producer, feeling that \"the best way for us to sound like ourselves is to record on our own.\" To give the album a live, \"raw\" feel, Cuomo, guitarist Brian Bell and bassist Matt Sharp recorded their vocals in tandem around three microphones rather than overdubbing them separately.\n\nWhile Cuomo was at Harvard other Weezer members worked on side projects. Sharp promoted the debut album by his band The Rentals. Bell and drummer Patrick Wilson worked on material for their bands the Space Twins and the Special Goodness, respectively. In January 1996, during Cuomo's winter break, Weezer regrouped for a two-week recording session at Sound City Studios in Van Nuys, California to complete the songs they had worked on the previous August. After recording new songs \"El Scorcho\" and \"Pink Triangle\", Weezer separated again while Cuomo returned to Harvard.\n\nDuring Cuomo's 1996 spring break, Weezer regrouped at Sound City Studios and recorded three new songs, \"The Good Life\", \"Across the Sea\" and \"Falling for You\", before Cuomo returned to Harvard for his university finals. The band completed the album in mid-1996 in Los Angeles. Two additional tracks, \"I Swear It's True\" and \"Getting Up and Leaving\", were abandoned prior to the mixing process.\n\n\"Pinkerton\" features a darker, more abrasive sound than Weezer's debut. Writing from a more direct and personal perspective, Cuomo wrote of his dysfunctional relationships, sexual frustration, and struggles with identity. The album charts his \"cycle between 'lame-o and partier'.\" At just under thirty-five minutes, \"Pinkerton\" is, according to Cuomo, \"short by design.\"\n\nThe album's first song, \"Tired of Sex\", written before the release of the \"Blue Album\", has Cuomo describing meaningless sex encounters with groupies, reciting his list of encounters and wondering why true love eludes him. \"Across the Sea\" was inspired by a letter Cuomo received from a Japanese fan: \"When I got the letter, I fell in love with her. It was such a great letter. I was very lonely at the time, but at the same time I was very depressed that I would never meet her.\" Second single \"The Good Life\" chronicles the rebirth of Cuomo after an identity crisis as an Ivy League loner. Cuomo, who felt isolated at Harvard, wrote the song after \"becoming frustrated with that hermit's life I was leading, the ascetic life. And I think I was starting to become frustrated with my whole dream about purifying myself and trying to live like a monk or an intellectual and going to school and holding out for this perfect, ideal woman. And so I wrote the song. And I started to turn around and come back the other way.\" Lead single \"El Scorcho\" addresses Cuomo's shyness and inability to approach a girl while at Harvard; he explained that the song \"is more about me, because at that point I hadn't even talked to the girl, I didn't really know much about her.\" The album's final single, \"Pink Triangle\", describes a man who falls in love and wants to get married, but discovers the object of his devotion is a lesbian.\n\n\"Pinkerton\" is named after the character BF Pinkerton from \"Madama Butterfly\", who marries a Japanese woman named Butterfly. Calling him an \"asshole American sailor similar to a touring rock star\", Cuomo felt the character was \"the perfect symbol for the part of myself that I am trying to come to terms with on this album.\" Other titles considered included \"Playboy\" and \"Diving into the Wreck\" (after a poem by Adrienne Rich).\n\nLike \"Madama Butterfly\", \"Pinkerton\" views Japanese culture from the perspective of an outsider who considers Japan fragile and sensual; the album infuses the Japanese allusions with its narrator's romantic disappointments and sexual frustration. Cuomo wrote that \"Pinkerton\" \"is really the clash of East vs West. My hindu, zen, kyokushin, self-denial, self-abnegation, no-emotion, cool-faced side versus my Italian-American heavy metal side.\" He stated that \"the ten songs are sequenced in the order in which I wrote them (with two minor exceptions). So as a whole, the album kind of tells the story of my struggle with my inner Pinkerton.\"\n\nThe artwork on the album's cover is \"Kambara yoru no yuki\" (\"Night snow at Kambara\"), print number 16 in Japanese ukiyo-e artist Hiroshige's popular \"53 Stations of the Tōkaidō\" series. Lyrics from \"Madama Butterfly\" are printed on the \"Pinkerton\" CD in their original Italian: \"Everywhere in the world, the roving Yankee takes his pleasure and his profit, indifferent to all risks. He drops anchor at random...\"\n\nBehind the album's CD tray is a map with the title \"Isola della farfalla e penisola di cane\" (Italian for \"Island of the Butterfly and Peninsula of Dog\"); on the map are a ship named USS Pinkerton and \"Mykel and Carli Island\", an allusion to Weezer's fan club founders. The map includes the names of some of Cuomo's influences, including Howard Stern, Yngwie Malmsteen, Brian Wilson, Lou Barlow, Joe Matt, Camille Paglia and Ace Frehley.\n\nGeffen A&R rep Todd Sullivan described \"Pinkerton\" as a \"very brave record,\" but worried: \"What sort of light does this put the band in? It could have been interpreted as them being a disposable pop band.\" The label was pleased with the record and felt that \"no one's going to be disappointed\".\n\nWeezer turned down a video treatment for lead single \"El Scorcho\" proposed by Spike Jonze, who had previously helped raise the band's status with his videos for \"Undone – The Sweater Song\" and \"Buddy Holly\". Cuomo explained: \"I really don't want the songs to come across untainted this time around... I really want to communicate my feelings directly and because I was so careful in writing that way. I'd hate for the video to kinda misrepresent the song, or exaggerate certain aspects.\" The final video featured the band playing in an assembly hall in Los Angeles, surrounded by light fixtures flashing in time to the music. Mark Romanek, the video's director, quit after numerous arguments with Cuomo, leaving Cuomo to edit the video himself. The video debuted on MTV's 120 Minutes and received moderate airplay.\n\nA day before \"Pinkerton\" was to be released on September 24, 1996, a restraining order was obtained against the band and Geffen by Encino, California-based security firm Pinkerton's Inc. The company sued Weezer and Geffen for alleged federal trademark infringement, claiming they were trying to capitalize on the company's reputation. Under the terms of the restraining order, which had Pinkerton's Inc seeking two million dollars in damages, Weezer would be kept from \"selling, distributing, or advertising an album with the name \"Pinkerton\".\" Geffen spokesman Dennis Dennehy defended the title, arguing that \"to Weezer, Pinkerton is a character in Puccini's opera \"Madama Butterfly\"... It was not meant to be aimed at any sort of corporate entity.\" Cuomo wrote a six-page paper defending his choice of the title, explaining \"why I chose it, and how it works for the album, and how it's essential.\" The case was thrown out of court after the judge determined that \"the hardship of not issuing the \"Pinkerton\" disc would be greater for Geffen than any hardship Pinkerton's Inc or its shareholders might incur from consumers who mistakenly presume the company has anything to do with the album.\"\n\nAs it became apparent that \"Pinkerton\" was not meeting expected sales figures, Weezer felt pressure to make another music video more to the liking of MTV. The music video for \"The Good Life\", directed by Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris, stars Mary Lynn Rajskub as a pizza delivery girl and uses simultaneous camera angles appearing on screen as a fractured full image. Geffen rush-released the video to try to save the commercially failing album, but was not successful.\n\nIn October 1996, the band toured the Far East with concert appearances in Australia, New Zealand and Japan. Afterwards, the band flew home to Los Angeles, where Patrick Wilson and Matt Sharp made a promotional appearance on the nationally syndicated radio show Modern Rock Live\" \"in an attempt to improve the album's standing on the US album charts. A few days later, on November 1, Weezer launched its tour of North America at the Ventura Theatre in Ventura, California. On November 6, Weezer performed an acoustic set at Shorecrest High School in Seattle due to a contest won by a student. A few of the songs performed at the acoustic set were released in 1997 on the \"Good Life\" EP. Weezer continued to tour until Christmas 1996.\n\n\"Pinkerton\" debuted and peaked at number 19 on the US \"Billboard\" charts, selling 47,000 copies its first week, falling far short of sales of its multi-platinum predecessor, \"The Blue Album\". Initial reviews were mixed. Jeff Gordinier of \"Entertainment Weekly\" criticized Weezer's choice to self-produce the album and dismissed it as \"a collection of get-down party anthems for agoraphobics\". Writing for \"Rolling Stone\", Rob O'Connor called the songwriting \"juvenile\" and described the song \"Tired of Sex\" as \"aimless\". \"Rolling Stone\" readers voted the album the third worst of 1996. Some listeners were perturbed by the sexual nature of the lyrics; \"Melody Maker\" praised \"Pinkerton\"'\"s\" music, but advised the listener \"to ignore the lyrics entirely.\"\n\nMark Beaumont of \"NME\" praised the album, writing that \"by the time the affecting acoustic lament 'Butterfly' wafts in like Big Star at a wildlife protection meeting, \"Pinkerton\" starts feeling like a truly moving album.\" Ryan Schreiber of \"Pitchfork\" awarded the album 7.5 out of 10, writing that \"\"Pinkerton\" might actually be a bit much for fans who were wooed with the clean production and immediately accessible sound of these guys' debut, but if given a chance, it might surprise even some anti-Weezer folk.\"\n\nDespite \"Pinkerton\"'s mixed reception, in later years it garnered enduring sales, critical acclaim and cult status through internet word-of-mouth, and eventually came to be considered among Weezer's best work by fans and critics.\n\nCuomo was embarrassed by \"Pinkerton's\" reception and the confessional nature of its songs. In August 1997, he wrote: \"This has been a tough year. It's not just that the world has said \"Pinkerton\" isn't worth a shit, but that the \"Blue\" album wasn't either. It was a fluke. It was the [\"Buddy Holly\"] video. I'm a shitty songwriter.\" In 2001, he told \"Entertainment Weekly\": \"It's a hideous record... It was such a hugely painful mistake that happened in front of hundreds of thousands of people and continues to happen on a grander and grander scale and just won't go away. It's like getting really drunk at a party and spilling your guts in front of everyone and feeling incredibly great and cathartic about it, and then waking up the next morning and realizing what a complete fool you made of yourself.\"\n\nAfter the \"Pinkerton\" tour, Sharp left the band and Weezer went on a five-year hiatus. Cuomo moved to simpler songwriting with less personal lyrics; he stated that Weezer's subsequent albums the \"Green Album\" (2001) and \"Maladroit\" (2002) were \"very intentionally not about me. Not about what was going on in my life, at least in a conscious way.\" \"Rolling Stone\" described the \"squeaky-clean power pop\" \"Green Album\" as the \"anti-\"Pinkerton\"\", with album art and a production style that recalled the band's debut.\n\nDespite \"Pinkerton\"'s initial failure, during Weezer's hiatus the album amassed a cult following. By the time of the release of the \"Green Album\" in 2001, a wave of mainstream emo bands including Jimmy Eat World, Saves the Day, Dashboard Confessional and Motion City Soundtrack had cited it as a major influence. Cuomo was not comforted by this development, and told \"Rolling Stone\" in 2001: \"The most painful thing in my life these days is the cult around \"Pinkerton.\" It's just a sick album, sick in a diseased sort of way. It's such a source of anxiety because all the fans we have right now have stuck around because of that album. But, honestly, I never want to play those songs again; I never want to hear them again.\"\n\n\"Pinkerton\"'s critical standing continued to rise. In 2002, \"Rolling Stone\" readers voted it the 16th greatest album of all time. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" gave the album a new review, awarding it five stars out of five and adding it to the \"\"Rolling Stone\" Hall of Fame\". In 2005, \"Spin\" named it number 61 in its list of the 100 best albums from 1985 to 2005. In 2003, Pitchfork placed \"Pinkerton\" at #53 on their \"Top 100 Albums of the 1990s\" list, and gave it a perfect rating. In 2007, Drowned in Sound praised it as \"the ultimate break-up album, the best unrequited love album and the greatest collection of confused emotions captured in the universe... EVER!\" \"Guitar World\" ranked it #76 on its list of the \"Top 100 Guitar Albums of All-Time\". New Zealand's \"The Movement\" placed it #12 on its list of \"The 101 Best Albums of the 90s\" and \"Pure Pop\" of Mexico ranked it #21 on its list of \"The 50 Best Albums of the 90s.\" It received perfect scores from both AllMusic and \"Tiny Mix Tapes\", the latter calling it \"one of the best albums of the 20th century.\" The 2010 \"Deluxe Edition\" reissue holds a perfect 100 out of 100 score (indicating \"universal acclaim\") on aggregate review website Metacritic.\n\nBy 2008, Cuomo had reconsidered the album, saying: \"\"Pinkerton\"'s great. It's super-deep, brave, and authentic. Listening to it, I can tell that I was really going for it when I wrote and recorded a lot of those songs.\" In 2010, Bell told \"The Aquarian Weekly\": \"\"Pinkerton\" has definitely taken on a life of its own and became more successful and more accepted ... As an artist, you just have to do what you believe in at the time, whether it’s accepted or not. You just have to keep going with it.\" In 2015, following the \"Pinkerton\" reissue and the \"Memories\" tour, in which Weezer performed \"Blue\" and \"Pinkerton\" in their entirety, Cuomo said:The experience of learning those songs again, singing them every night, working on them with the guys, and then being in a relatively small venue with 1,000 of the most hardcore Weezer fans and hearing them sing every syllable, seeing them air-drum all the fills—it was such an amazing experience and so different from what we'd been doing the years before that ... So it was a great feeling of validation from the fans, for this album that was so personal to me and had been such a source of pain for years.\n\nBy August 2009, \"Pinkerton\" had sold 852,000 copies in the United States and was certified gold. It was certified platinum on 16 September 2016, almost 20 years after its release.\n\n\"Pinkerton\" has featured in several music publication \"best of\" lists.\n\nOn November 20, 2010, DGC released a \"deluxe\" \"Pinkerton\" reissue with an additional disc containing live performances, B-sides, and previously unreleased songs. The reissue debuted at number six on the \"Billboard\" Catalog Albums chart and achieved a perfect score on the aggregate review website Metacritic. In 2010 and 2011, Weezer performed the \"Blue Album\" and \"Pinkerton\" in their entirety on the \"Memories\" tour.\n\nOn December 12, 2011, Cuomo released the third album of his demos, \"\". It comprises demos recorded between 1993 and 1996, when Cuomo was studying at Harvard and writing material for \"Pinkerton\" and the abandoned \"Songs from the Black Hole\" project. The album was included with a book, \"The Pinkerton Diaries\", which collects Cuomo's writings from the era.\n\nIn May 2016, \"Pinkerton\" was reissued on vinyl by the record subscription service Vinyl Me, Please. The album is pressed on \"dark blue translucent vinyl with black marbling\" and is packaged in a custom sleeve with pop-out art, a custom lyric sheet, artwork by Japanese painter Fuco Ueda, and a sake cocktail recipe.\n\nAdapted from the booklet enclosed with the album.</small>\n\nWeezer\n\nProduction\n\n\nWorks cited\n\n",
                "Weezer (2001 album)\n\nWeezer, also known as the Green Album, is the third studio album by American rock band Weezer, released on May 15, 2001, through Geffen Records. Produced by Ric Ocasek, this is the only Weezer album to feature bassist Mikey Welsh, who replaced Matt Sharp. The album is grounded in the power pop genre, featuring strong melodies, crisp vocal harmonies, and prominent guitar riffs. It is also Weezer's quickest-selling album.\n\n\"Weezer\" received generally favorable reviews. The album was often recognized as a rebirth for the band, after a five-year hiatus following their 1996 album \"Pinkerton\". The album attained chart success by debuting at number 4 in the US and number 2 in Canada. The album also charted within the top ten in Norway and Sweden. Since its release in 2001, the album has sold over 1,600,000 copies in the United States.\n\nThree singles were released from the album, including \"Hash Pipe\", \"Island in the Sun\", and \"Photograph\". Its first single, \"Hash Pipe\", was a worldwide modern rock hit, charting on seven different charts, despite their record label's reluctance to release it as the first single.\n\nFollowing the commercial and critical failure of \"Pinkerton\" (1996), Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo placed the band on hiatus. He returned to Harvard University to finish his studies, but eventually dropped out to focus on songwriting. During this time, Cuomo played with a different group of musicians in the band Homie, based in Boston. One of the members of Homie was Mikey Welsh, a bass player who would eventually be asked to replace Matt Sharp in Weezer.\n\nBy February 1998, Cuomo had quietly disbanded Homie and headed to Los Angeles to begin work on Weezer demos with Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson. At this point, bassist Matt Sharp was absent from numerous Weezer rehearsals and was becoming estranged from the band. On April 8, 1998, Sharp announced his official exit from Weezer to devote all his energies to his band, The Rentals. It was quickly announced that former Homie member Welsh would take over on bass for Weezer. Frustration and creative disagreements led to a decline in rehearsals, and, in the latter half of 1998, drummer Patrick Wilson left for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo, who went into a period of admitted depression, during which he painted the walls of his home black and put \"fiberglass insulation all over the windows and then black sheets of fiberglass so that no light could get through.\"\n\nBy the beginning of 1999, Weezer had once again gone their separate ways. Drummer Patrick Wilson resumed his efforts with his side-band The Special Goodness, guitarist Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield. Meanwhile, Cuomo focused his energy on songwriting, crafting 121 songs, nearly half of which would become demos. During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from contact with the outside world. Cuomo also received braces on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem. Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him. In turn, Cuomo would eventually reveal songs he was working on to Bell.\n\nUnbeknownst to the band, their fanbase was connecting and growing on the internet, which was helping to boost the reputation and sales of \"Pinkerton\". When it was released, \"Pinkerton\" was considered a critical and commercial failure; however, in the years following the release of the album, it would gain a much more positive reputation due to word-of-mouth on message boards and various web pages. This expanding internet activity would later set the stage for the band's 2001 comeback. Renewed interaction between band members took place when Weezer was offered a lucrative offer to perform in Japan in August 2000 for the Summer Sonic Festival. Rehearsals for the show reinvigorated the band into talking about making a new album. The band returned to performing in June 2000, playing low-key shows around Los Angeles under the pseudonym Goat Punishment, ensuring that Weezer would only perform for longtime fans who would recognize the name.\n\nEventually, the band started performing at higher profile gigs such as the Warped Tour. Cuomo later remarked, \"We went in there fully expecting to be booed and to have things thrown at us. But it was exactly the opposite, people were singing along to all the songs and just going crazy, giving us the best support. And I think that gave us the confidence we needed.\" The positive response to the Warped Tour performances led to further shows being scheduled. When touring began to wind down, MP3 demos captured live on the band's mobile unit and sound checks began to surface on file-sharing services and eventually for downloading on the band's official website. These songs were often referred to as \"Summer Songs of 2000\" (commonly abbreviated as \"SS2K\").\n\nOn October 23, Cuomo announced that the band would start recording material \"with or without\" a producer. However, the band's record label decided to have the band employ a record producer due to the commercial failure of their self-produced album \"Pinkerton.\" The band began rehearsing and arranging both the \"Summer Songs of 2000\" and newer material Cuomo had written at his home with engineer Chad Bamford. The band eventually decided to hire Ric Ocasek—who had also produced their debut album—as producer, and began sending demos to Ocasek during the summer of 2000. There was much debate among the band members as to whether they should record in Los Angeles or Ocasek's New York home, with the band eventually deciding to record in Los Angeles at Cello Studios. The band continued to demo new music daily and started to weed through more than seventy-five demos, eventually homing in on twenty-five potential album tracks in anticipation of Ocasek's arrival. Ocasek worked with the band to trim these down further to eighteen songs.\n\nRecording sessions for the album began in early December, with Ocasek providing creative feedback to the band by telephone. On December 27, the band embarked on what would be close to six weeks of studio work by playing songs repetitively in order to track the bass and drums parts. They also did \"scratch takes\" of the vocals and guitar, designed to get accurate rhythm tracks before being redone more efficiently later in the recording process. While recording the album, the band continued to perform gigs under the pseudonym Goat Punishment.\n\nDuring the recording sessions, an executive at the band's label, Geffen Records, visited to observe the band's progress and expressed dissatisfaction with several tracks. This feedback eventually forced the band to discard a few of the album's possible songs. The band then relocated for three weeks to a smaller studio in another part of Cello Studios where Cuomo and Bell worked on guitar takes while the entire band recorded vocal tracks. Ocasek said: \"Rivers always does his guitar parts in one take.\"\n\nMixing for the album began on January 31 by Tom Lord-Alge at South Beach Studios. Bell was absent from the mixing process.\n\nThe art direction of the album was handled by Chris Bilheimer with photography from Marina Chavez and Karl Koch. The album cover was shot between band practices and featured Mikey Welsh, Rivers Cuomo, Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson standing left to right in front of a plain, lime-green backdrop in a manner similar to the band's debut album. This was done as a tribute to Ric Ocasek, who had also produced their first album, and also to symbolize the band's back-to-basics approach they took while recording the album. This approach is alluded to in a quote in the liner notes of the album: \"Torniamo all'antico e sarà un progresso\", from Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi that means \"Let us return to old times and that will be progress.\"\n\nThe picture inside of the CD booklet is a photo of Weezer playing live, featuring (in the lower right hand corner) an overlay of the silhouettes of Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot from the television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". (Hence the liner note citation \"MST3K silhouette appears courtesy of Best Brains, Inc.\")\n\nThis was Weezer's first album to feature a transparent CD tray. Under the CD tray of the album, the word \"No\" can be found on the back of the spine. Some fans speculate that this is a response to the inside tray of Radiohead's album \"OK Computer\" which contains the text \"I like you. I like you. You are a wonderful person. I'm full of enthusiasm. I'm going places. I'll be happy to help you. I am an important person, would you like to come home with me?\" Weezer's official explanation was vague, with webmaster Karl Koch stating \"No means no.\"\n\nThe album contains the dedication \"In loving memory of Mykel and Carli.\" Mykel and Carli Allan were sisters devoted to developing fan clubs for up-and-coming bands. The sisters had been influential in starting and developing Weezer's official fan club in the 1990s and, along with their young sister Trysta, died in a car accident in 1997.\n\nThe album was met with enthusiasm from the record label; according to Weezer collaborator Karl Koch, \"They had nothing but supportive and excited things to say about it.\" However, the album's original release date of April 17 was postponed due to executives not liking Cuomo's choice of \"Hash Pipe\" as the first single. Citing the song's lurid content about a transvestite prostitute as inappropriate, they suggested that \"Don't Let Go\" be chosen as the first single. However, Cuomo continued to fight and \"Hash Pipe\" eventually became the album's first single. The label tried to postpone the release date further until June, but the band convinced them to adhere to the original May 15 release date.\n\nThe first single from the album was \"Hash Pipe\". The video for \"Hash Pipe\" was directed by Marcos Siega and was the first of many Weezer videos that Siega would direct. In the video, Weezer performs in an arena while a group of sumo wrestlers are fighting in the background. The song title was often censored as \"H*** Pipe\" (the title employed on the music video's title card) or \"Half Pipe.\" The song became a huge hit on the MTV show \"Total Request Live\", and also received heavy rotation on radio, eventually peaking at number two on the US Modern Rock Charts. The song even landed the band a nomination for \"High Times\" magazine's \"Pot Song of the Year\".\n\nThe next single, \"Island in the Sun\", was a successful radio hit and became one of the band's biggest oversea hits. It peaked at number 11 on the US Modern Rock Charts and at number 31 on the UK Top 40. Two music videos were created for the song: the first video, directed by Marcos Siega, shows Weezer playing the song at a Mexican couple's wedding reception and features all four band members. This version remains the more obscure of the two, receiving less airplay than the second. The executives at MTV disliked Siega's video, prompting the band to film a second video. This second version was directed by Spike Jonze and featured the band playing with various wild animals on a supposedly remote hill (although it was actually filmed a short distance outside of Los Angeles, possibly near Simi Valley). Only Brian Bell, Rivers Cuomo and Patrick Wilson appear in this video, as then bassist Mikey Welsh had left the band shortly before shooting. It is also rumored that original bassist Matt Sharp was approached to be in the video, though it is unclear if the offer was ever actually made. Scott Shriner, who was filling in for Welsh and would later become a permanent member of Weezer, stated in the commentary for \"\" that he almost asked the band to let him appear in the video. The second video received much wider airplay than the original and has become the standard video for the song.\n\nThe third and final single from the album was \"Photograph\", which was released to radio in early November. The single peaked at number 17 on the US Modern Rock Charts. In Japan it was released as the first single instead of \"Hash Pipe.\" The band felt the song didn't have the staying power of the previous singles, and thus decided to pass on a big-name director for the music video, opting instead to have Karl Koch shoot and edit a video from on-the-road footage.\n\n\"Weezer\" received generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who gave the album a rating of four and a half stars, stated that \"this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but \"nobody\" else does it this so well, no matter how many bands try.\" PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: \"The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words. And even the songs' lengths are nice and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where you want to hear these songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board was one of the best ideas the band had, as the Green Album is certainly water tight all around.\" \"Drowned in Sound\" gave the album a very positive review, saying \"After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third. One listen to the Green Album has you eating out of Rivers Cuomo's hand just like in the past. [...] Rivers Cuomo is one of the greatest song-writers that has picked up a guitar. Anyone who can with hold the charms of the Geek-rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes. Sorry to be blunt but it's the way it is. God I think the sun's finally taking its toll.\" The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001, tying with System of a Down's \"Toxicity\" and Mogwai's \"Rock Action\". \"Q\" listed \"Weezer\" as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.\n\nNot all the reviews were complimentary. Spencer Owen, writing in \"Pitchfork\", called the album \"average from beginning to end.\" In addition, Sarah Dempster from \"NME\" was disappointed with the album and said, \"The most irritating aspect of the Green Album is, however, the maddening itch of wasted opportunity.\"\n\nIn the United States, \"Weezer\" debuted at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200 on the week of May 15, 2001. In two weeks the album had sold 215,000 copies. It was certified platinum on September 13, 2001. As of August 2009, the album has sold over 1,600,000 copies in the United States. In Canada, the album debuted at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart. In June 2001, the album was later certified platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) for sales of 80,000 units.\n\nThe album debuted at number thirty-one on the UK Albums Chart. In Australia, the album peaked at number twenty-five. The album has since been certified two-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 140,000 copies. \"Weezer\" also peaked in the Top Ten in Norway and Sweden, charting and eight and seven respectively.\n\nUK and Japanese bonus tracks\n\nJapanese bonus track\nAdapted from the album liner notes.\nWeezer\n\nProduction\nCharts\n\nCertifications\n\nSingles\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n\n"

                "Weezer\n\nWeezer is an American rock band formed in Los Angeles in 1992, consisting of Rivers Cuomo (lead vocals, lead guitar), Patrick Wilson (drums), Brian Bell (rhythm guitar, backing vocals, keyboards), and Scott Shriner (bass, backing vocals).\n\nAfter signing to Geffen Records in 1993, Weezer released their debut self-titled album, also known as the \"Blue Album\", in 1994. Backed by successful music videos for the singles \"Buddy Holly\", \"Undone – The Sweater Song\" and \"Say It Ain't So\", the Blue Album became a triple-platinum success. Their second album, \"Pinkerton\" (1996), featuring a darker, more abrasive sound, was a commercial failure and initially received mixed reviews, but went on to achieve cult status and critical acclaim years later. Both the Blue Album and \"Pinkerton\" are now frequently cited among the best albums of the 1990s. Following the tour for \"Pinkerton\", bassist Matt Sharp left the band and Weezer went on hiatus.\n\nIn 2001, Weezer returned with another self-titled album, also known as the \"Green Album\", with new bassist Mikey Welsh. With a more pop sound, and promoted by singles \"Hash Pipe\" and \"Island in the Sun\", the album was a commercial success and received mostly positive reviews. After the Green Album tour, Welsh left the band and was replaced by current bassist Scott Shriner. Weezer's fourth album, \"Maladroit\" (2002), achieved mostly positive reviews but weaker sales. \"Make Believe\" (2005) received mixed reviews, but its single \"Beverly Hills\" became Weezer's first single to top the US Modern Rock Tracks chart and the first to reach the top ten on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \n\nIn 2008, Weezer released a third self-titled album, also known as the \"Red Album\", featuring \"TR-808s, synths, Southern rap, and baroque counterpoint,\" to mixed reviews. Its lead single, \"Pork and Beans\", became the band's third song to top the Modern Rock Tracks chart, backed by a successful YouTube music video. \"Raditude\" (2009) and \"Hurley\" (2010) featured more \"modern pop production\" and songs co-written with other artists, achieved further mixed reviews and moderate sales. The band's ninth and tenth albums, \"Everything Will Be Alright in the End\" (2014) and the band’s fourth self-titled album, also known as the \"White Album\" (2016), returned to a rock style and achieved more positive reviews. Their eleventh album, \"Pacific Daydream\", which was released on October 27, 2017, signified a drastic departure from their long-time alternative rock style in favor of a mainstream pop sound. Weezer has sold 9.2 million albums in the US and over 17 million worldwide.\n\nVocalist and lead guitarist Rivers Cuomo, drummer Patrick Wilson, bassist Matt Sharp and guitarist Jason Cropper formed Weezer in 1992. The band had its first practice on February 14 of that year; their first gig was closing for Keanu Reeves' band Dogstar shortly after. Weezer signed with Geffen Records on June 25, 1993 and the group recorded its debut album with producer Ric Ocasek at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. During the recording, Cropper left the band and was replaced by guitarist Brian Bell.\n\n\"Weezer\" (also referred to as the \"Blue Album\") was released in May 1994. Geffen originally did not wish to release a single, to see what sales could be generated by word-of-mouth alone. DJ Marco Collins of the Seattle radio station The End started playing \"Undone – The Sweater Song\", leading Geffen to release it as the first single. The music video was directed by Spike Jonze. Filmed in an unbroken take, it featured Weezer performing on a sound stage with little action, bar a pack of dogs swarming the set. The video became an instant hit on MTV.\n\nJonze also directed the band's second video, \"Buddy Holly\", splicing footage from the 1970s television sitcom \"Happy Days\" with Weezer performing in a remade \"Arnold's Drive-In.\" The video achieved heavy rotation on MTV and went on to win four MTV Video Music Awards, including Breakthrough Video and Best Alternative Music Video, and two \"Billboard\" Music Video Awards. The video was also featured on the companion CD for the Microsoft Windows 95 computer operating system. A third single, \"Say It Ain't So\", followed. \"Weezer\" is certified triple platinum in the United States, making it Weezer's best-selling album. It is certified double platinum in Canada.\n\nIn 1994, Weezer took a break from touring for the Christmas holidays. Cuomo traveled to his home state of Connecticut and began recording demos for Weezer's next album. His original concept was a space-themed rock opera titled \"Songs from the Black Hole \"that would express his mixed feelings about success. Weezer developed the concept through intermittent recording sessions through 1995. At the end of the year, Cuomo began studying at Harvard University, where his songwriting became \"darker, more visceral and exposed, less playful\", and the \"Songs from the Black Hole \"album was abandoned.\n\nWeezer's second album, \"Pinkerton\", was released on September 24, 1996. It produced three singles: \"El Scorcho\", \"The Good Life\", and \"Pink Triangle\". In addition to a lawsuit filed against the band over the title of the album, \"Pinkerton\" sold poorly compared to the Blue Album, perhaps due to its darker, more abrasive sound, and it was voted \"one of the worst albums of 1996\" in a \"Rolling Stone\" reader poll. However, the album eventually came to be considered among Weezer's best work; in 2002, \"Rolling Stone\" readers voted \"Pinkerton\" the 16th greatest album of all time, and it has been listed in several critics' \"best albums of all time\" lists.\n\nWeezer completed the \"Pinkerton\" tour in mid-1997 and went on hiatus. Wilson returned to his home in Portland, Oregon to work on his side project, the Special Goodness, and Bell worked on his band Space Twins. Sharp left Weezer to complete the follow-up album for his group the Rentals. He said of his departure from Weezer: \"I don't really know how to speak on this because I don't know what should be kept private and what should be shared. I certainly have my view of it, as I'm sure everybody else has their sort of foggy things. When you have a group that doesn't communicate, you're going to have a whole lot of different stories.\"\n\nCuomo returned to Harvard but took a break to focus on songwriting. He gathered Boston-area musicians and rehearsed new material, including possible songs for the next Weezer album. The group had several different line-ups and played several shows at local clubs, including the band's first show at T.T. the Bear's on October 8, 1997. Future Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh was a constant of the group's evolving lineups. Wilson eventually flew to Boston to sit in on drums. The Boston songs were abandoned, but live recordings of the Boston shows are traded on the internet.\n\nIn February 1998, Cuomo, Bell and Wilson reunited in Los Angeles to start work on the next Weezer album. Rumors suggest Sharp did not rejoin the band and left the group in April 1998, which Sharp denies. The group hired Welsh as its new bassist.\n\nWeezer continued rehearsing and cut demos until the fall of 1998. Frustration and creative disagreements led to a decline in rehearsals, and in late 1998, Wilson left for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo. In November 1998, the band played two club shows with a substitute drummer in California under the name Goat Punishment, consisting entirely of covers of Nirvana and Oasis songs. In the months following, Cuomo entered a period of depression, painting the walls of his home black and putting fiberglass insulation over his windows to prevent light entering.\n\nWeezer did not reunite until April 2000, when the Fuji Rock Festival in Japan made Weezer a lucrative offer to play in August 2000. The festival served as a catalyst for Weezer's productivity, and from April to May 2000, the band rehearsed and demoed new songs in Los Angeles. They returned to live shows in June 2000, playing small unpromoted concerts under the name Goat Punishment. In June 2000, the band joined the American Warped Tour for nine dates.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, Weezer went on tour (including dates on the popular Vans Warped Tour). The band's setlist consisted of 14 new songs; when 13 of these songs did not appear on Weezer's next album, fans of the songs started a petition demanding the release of studio versions. Eventually, the band went back into the studio to produce a third album. The band chose the title \"Weezer\" (2001) to repeat the self-titled name of the band's first release. This album became known as the Green Album due to its green album artwork. Shortly after the release, Weezer went on another American tour. The band attracted a new generation of fans thanks to heavy MTV rotation for the videos of the band's hit singles \"Hash Pipe\" and \"Island in the Sun\".\n\nAs reported on August 16, 2001, by MTV, Welsh was checked into a psychiatric hospital. His whereabouts were previously unknown, as he went missing before the filming of the second video for \"Island in the Sun\". Weezer was prompted to find a temporary replacement for Welsh. Through a mutual friend, Cuomo received Scott Shriner's number and asked if he was interested in filling in for Welsh. Shriner accepted the invitation.\n\nThe band took an experimental approach for the recording process of its fourth album by allowing fans to download demos from its official website in return for feedback. After the release of the album, the band said that this process was something of a failure, as the fans did not supply the group with coherent, constructive advice. Cuomo eventually delegated song selection for the album to the band's original A&R rep, Todd Sullivan, saying that Weezer fans chose the \"wackest songs.\" Only the song \"Slob\" was included on the album due to general fan advice.\n\nThe recording was also done without input from Weezer's record label, Interscope. Cuomo had what he then described as a \"massive falling out\" with the label. In early 2002, well before the official release of the album, the label sent out a letter to radio stations requesting the song be pulled until an official, sanctioned single was released. Interscope also briefly shut down Weezer's audio/video download webpage, removing all the MP3 demos. Online Weezer fans staged a brief protest, with several websites proclaiming \"Free \"Maladroit\"\".\n\nIn April 2002, former bassist Matt Sharp sued the band, alleging, among several accusations, that he was owed money for cowriting several Weezer songs. The suit was later settled out of court.\n\nThe fourth album, \"Maladroit\", was released on May 14, 2002, only one year after its predecessor. The album served as a harder-edged version of the band's trademark catchy pop-influenced music, and was replete with busy 1980s-style guitar solos. Although met with generally positive critical reviews, its sales were not as strong as those for the Green Album. Two singles were released from the album. The music video for \"Dope Nose\" featured an obscure Japanese motorcycle gang, and was put into regular rotation. The music video for \"Keep Fishin'\" combined Weezer with the Muppets, and had heavy rotation on MTV. Both videos were directed by Marcos Siega.\n\nWeezer released its much-delayed first DVD on March 23, 2004. The \"Video Capture Device\" DVD chronicles the band from its beginnings through \"Maladroit\"'s Enlightenment Tour. Compiled by Karl Koch, the DVD features home video footage, music videos, commercials, rehearsals, concert performances, television performances, and band commentary. The DVD was certified \"gold\" on November 8, 2004.\n\nFrom December 2003 to the fall of 2004, Weezer recorded a large amount of material intended for a new album to be released in the spring of 2005 with producer Rick Rubin. The band's early recording efforts became available to the public through the band's website. The demos were a big hit, but none of the songs recorded at this time were included on the finished album. That album, titled \"Make Believe,\" was released on May 10, 2005. Despite commercial success, \"Make Believe\" got a mixed reception from critics, receiving an average score of 52 on review collator Metacritic. Although some reviews, such as AMG's, compared it favorably to \"Pinkerton\", others, among them Pitchfork's score of 0.4 out of 10, panned the album as predictable and lyrically poor.\n\nThe album's first single, \"Beverly Hills\", became a hit in the U.S. and worldwide, staying on the charts for several months after its release. It became the first Weezer song to hit No. 1 on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. \"Beverly Hills\" was nominated for Best Rock Song at the 48th Annual Grammy Awards, the first ever Grammy nomination for the band. The video was also nominated for Best Rock Video at the 2005 MTV Video Music Awards. The second single off \"Make Believe\" was \"We Are All on Drugs\". MTV refused to play the song, so Weezer re-recorded the lyrics by replacing \"on drugs\" with \"in love\" and renaming the song \"We Are All in Love\". In early 2006, it was announced that \"Make Believe\" was certified platinum, and \"Beverly Hills\" was the second most popular song download on iTunes for 2005, finishing just behind \"Hollaback Girl\" by Gwen Stefani. \"Make Believe\"'s third single, \"Perfect Situation\", spent four weeks in a row at number one on the Billboard Modern Rock chart. \"This Is Such a Pity\" was the band's fourth single from the album, but no music video was made for its release. The \"Make Believe\" tour also found the band using additional instruments onstage, adding piano, synthesizers, pseudophones, and guitarist Bobby Schneck.\n\nThe band has announced the possible release of a live DVD composed of footage from the 2005 Japan tour. It will consist of a two-day, seven-camera shoot of the shows in Japan, plus material that will be drawn from various behind-the-scenes footage. The DVD was announced in late 2005, but in a 2006 update on the band's Web site, Karl Koch noted it was \"apparently edited, but has been put on hold for now.\"\n\n\"Weezer\" (also referred to as the \"Red Album\") was released in June 2008. Rick Rubin produced the album and Rich Costey mixed it. The record was described as \"experimental\", and according to Cuomo, who claimed it at the time to be Weezer's \"boldest and bravest and showiest album,\" included longer and non-traditional songs, TR-808 drum machines, synthesizers, Southern rap, baroque counterpoint, and band members other than Cuomo writing, singing, and switching instruments. Pat Wilson said the album cost about a million dollars to make, contrasting it with the $150,000 budget of the Blue Album. The album's singles were produced by Jacknife Lee. Its lead single, \"Pork and Beans\", topped the \"Billboard\" Modern Rock Tracks charts for 11 weeks, and its music video won a Grammy for Best Short Form Music Video. The second single, \"Troublemaker\", debuted at No. 39 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart and peaked at No. 2. In October 2008, the group announced that the third single would be \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\".\n\nOn May 30, 2008, the Toledo Free Press revealed in an interview with Scott Shriner that Weezer would be unveiling the \"Hootenanny Tour\", in which fans would be invited to bring their own instruments to play along with the band. Said Shriner: \"They can bring whatever they want... oboes, keyboards, drums, violins, and play the songs with us as opposed to us performing for them.\"\n\nThe band performed five dates in Japan at the beginning of September and then embarked on what was dubbed the 'Troublemaker' tour, consisting of 21 dates around North America, including two in Canada. Angels and Airwaves and Tokyo Police Club joined the band as support at each show, and Brian Bell's 'other' band The Relationship also performed at a handful of dates. Shortly before the encore at each show, the band would bring on fans with various instruments and perform Island in the Sun and Beverly Hills with the band. At a show in Austin, after Tokyo Police Club had played its set, Cuomo was wheeled out in a box and mimed to a recording of rare Weezer demo, 'My Brain', dressed in pajamas and with puppets on his hands, before being wheeled off again. This bizarre event later surfaced as the climax to a promo video for Cuomo's second demo album, Alone 2.\n\nWeezer toured with Blink-182 in 2009, including an August 30 stop at the Virgin Festival at Merriweather Post Pavilion in Columbia, Maryland. Drummer Josh Freese joined Weezer on a temporary basis to play drums on the tour, while Pat Wilson switched to guitar. Wilson said in an interview for Yahoo! Music that Cuomo wanted \"to be active and more free on stage and him having guitar on was an impediment.\" Freese stated he was a Weezer fan and did not want to pass up the opportunity to play with the band.\n\n\"Raditude\"'s album artwork was revealed on September 11, featuring a National Geographic contest-winning photograph of a jumping dog named Sidney. The record's release was pushed to November 3, 2009, where it debuted as the seventh best-selling album of the week on the \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The band scheduled tour dates in December 2009 extending into early 2010 to coincide with the new album's release. On December 6, 2009, Cuomo was injured when his tour bus crashed in upstate New York due to black ice. Cuomo suffered three broken ribs, and his assistant broke two ribs. His wife, baby daughter, and their nanny were also on the bus, but they escaped injury. Weezer cancelled tour dates the following day. The band resumed touring on January 20, 2010.\n\nIn December 2009, it was revealed that the band was no longer with Geffen Records. The band stated that new material would still be released, but the band members were unsure of the means, whether it be self-released, released online, or getting signed by another label. Eventually, the band was signed to the independent label Epitaph.\n\nWeezer co-headlined The Bamboozle in May, 2010, and performed at the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In August, 2010, Weezer performed at the Reading and Leeds Festival, and performed at the Voodoo Experience festival in New Orleans, LA in October 2010.\n\nThe album \"Hurley\" was released in September 2010 through Epitaph Records. The name comes from the character Hugo \"Hurley\" Reyes from the television show \"Lost\". Jorge Garcia, the actor who portrayed Hurley, stated that being featured on the album cover is \"one of the biggest honors of [his] career.\" Weezer used internet streaming service YouTube as a way to promote the album. Weezer loaned itself to 15 amateur online video producers, \"going along with whatever plans the creator could execute in about 30 minutes.\" The band was promoted through popular channels such as Barely Political, Ray William Johnson and Fred Figglehorn. The Gregory Brothers solicited musical and vocal contributions from the band on one of its compositions built around speeches by Rep. Charles Rangel and President Barack Obama. Weezer calls the promotion \"The YouTube Invasion\".\n\nIn November 2010, Weezer released a compilation album composed of re-recorded versions of unused recordings spanning various years, \"Death to False Metal\". On the same day a deluxe version of \"Pinkerton\", which includes \"25 demos, outtakes and live tracks\" was also released. A third volume of Cuomo's solo \"\" series, titled \"Alone III: The Pinkerton Years\", consisting of demos and outtakes from the \"Pinkerton\" sessions, was released on December 12, 2011. The band also contributed a cover of the Cars' \"You Might Think\" for the Disney-Pixar film \"Cars 2\".\n\nOn October 8, 2011 former Weezer bassist Mikey Welsh was found dead in a Chicago, Illinois hotel room. Weezer performed in Chicago the next day and dedicated the concert to Welsh, who was expected to have attended.\n\nWeezer began working on its ninth studio album in September 2010 with the intent of a 2011 release, but the year ended without seeing a release. The band headlined a four-day rock-themed Carnival Cruise from Miami to Cozumel that set sail on January 19, 2012. In July 2012, Weezer headlined the inaugural Bunbury Music Festival in Cincinnati, Ohio. In early 2013 the band brought its Memories Tour to Australia—the band's first Australian tour since 1996. The band played its first two albums in full at several venues. The band also headlined the Punkspring 2013 tour in Japan and later in the year toured Canada and USA. They played multiple nights in cites around the U.S. The first night shows were dedicated to playing their hits, then the Blue album in full, front to back. The second night, they played Pinkerton in the same fashion. Karl did a \"Memories\" slide show at the Gibson amphitheater in Los Angeles (And most likely many other venues around the U.S.) The slide show consisted of photos of gigs over the years and highlighted the loss of their fanclub team members Mykel and Carli in 1997. \n\nIn January 2014, the band started to record its ninth studio album with producer Ric Ocasek, who previously worked with the band on its first two self-titled albums. A clip of a new song was posted on the band's official YouTube account on March 19, 2014, which confirmed previous rumors of the band being in the studio. On June 12, 2014, it was revealed that the album title would be \"Everything Will Be Alright in the End\". It was released on October 7, 2014 to generally favorable reviews, becoming the band's best-reviewed release since \"Pinkerton\".\n\nOn October 26, 2015, the band released a new single, \"Thank God for Girls\", through Apple Music and to radio the same day. The following week, the band released a second single, \"Do You Wanna Get High?\". Cuomo claimed in an interview with Zane Lowe, that the band was not working on a new album. Later, on January 14, 2016, Weezer released a third single, \"King of the World\", and announced that the band's fourth self-titled album, also known as the \"White Album\", which continued the critical success of the band's previous release. In support of the album, the band performed on the Weezer & Panic! at the Disco Summer Tour 2016 with Panic! at the Disco in 2016. The band later signed to Atlantic Records as part of a joint venture between Warner Music Group and Crush Management.\n\nSoon after the release of the White Album, Cuomo discussed plans for Weezer's next album, provisionally titled the \"Black Album': \"It’s going to maybe be like Beach Boys gone bad [...] I’m thinking of swearing, which is something I’ve never done in songs.” Cuomo also said the album would tackle “more mature topics” and be “less summer day and more winter night”. He suggested the band could return to the recording studio as soon as October 2016. Weezer delayed recording after Cuomo felt his new material was more \"like reveries from a beach at the end of the world [... as if] the Beach Boys and the Clash fell in love by the ocean and had one hell of an amazing baby\".\n\nOn March 16, 2017, the band released a new song titled \"Feels Like Summer\", revealed to be the lead single of the upcoming album. The song drew a mixed reaction from fans but became their biggest hit on Alternative radio in a decade. \"Feels Like Summer\" was heard on The Weather Channel's local forecast segments on July 4, 2017, and again on August 18, 2017. It was also heard on some of the network's promos that summer. On August 16, the band announced that their new album, \"Pacific Daydream\" would be released on October 27. On August 17, the promotional single from the album, \"Mexican Fender\", was released. The following month, \"Beach Boys\" was released, and the month after, they released \"Weekend Woman\" to positive reception. \n\nIn October 2017, Cuomo reiterated his intentions to still release the Black Album, giving May 2018 as a tentative release date.\n\nWeezer has been described as alternative rock, power pop, pop punk, emo, pop rock, indie rock,\nemo pop, geek rock, and pop. The members of Weezer have listed several influences, among them Kiss (with direct references in the song \"In the Garage\"), Nirvana (who were labelmates of the band at DGC for a very brief time before Kurt Cobain's death), the Pixies (especially early in the band's career), the Cars (Ric Ocasek has even produced several of Weezer's records), Pavement, Oasis, Green Day and Wax. Cuomo credited the Beach Boys as a major influence, specifically \"Pet Sounds\", describing Weezer's sound as \"Beach Boys with Marshall stacks.\"\n\nArtists such as Fun., Charli XCX, Real Estate, Dinosaur Pile-Up, Cymbals Eat Guitars, DNCE and the Fall of Troy list Weezer as an influence.\n\nPatrick Wilson started his side-project the Special Goodness in 1996, for which he sings and plays guitar and bass. In May 2012, he released his fourth record with the Special Goodness, entitled \"Natural\".\n\nBrian Bell started the Space Twins in 1994, releasing three singles and an album, \"The End of Imagining\", in 2003. In 2006, Bell started a new band called the Relationship, and did not contribute any songs for Weezer's \"Raditude\" in order to save material for the Relationship. The Relationship's self-titled debut was released in 2010, with a follow-up, Clara Obscura, released in 2017.\n\nFormer bassist Matt Sharp started the Rentals in 1994. After releasing \"Return of the Rentals\" in 1995, Sharp went on to quit Weezer in 1998 to focus more on the Rentals. Sharp has also released work under his own name.\n\nMikey Welsh played with Juliana Hatfield, the Kickovers, Heretix, Jocobono, Slower and Left Nut.\n\nScott Shriner released a single under the name Shriners in 2012 entitled \"Pretty (Watch the Shadow)\".\n\nOn December 18, 2007, Cuomo released \"Alone - The Home Recordings of Rivers Cuomo\", a compilation of his demos recorded from 1992 to 2007, including some demos from the unfinished \"Songs from the Black Hole\" album. A second compilation, \"\", was released on November 25, 2008, and a third, \"\", on December 12, 2011. The album was sold exclusively with a book, \"The Pinkerton Diaries\", which collects Cuomo's writings from the \"Pinkerton\" era.\n\nOn March 20, 2013, Cuomo and Scott Murphy of the band Allister released \"Scott & Rivers\", a Japanese-language album.\n\nOn December 4, 2008, iOS developer Tapulous released the game \"Christmas With Weezer\", featuring gameplay similar to \"Tap Tap Revenge\" and six Christmas carols performed by the band. A digital EP featuring the songs, titled \"Christmas with Weezer\", was also released on December 16, 2008.\n\nOn June 11, 2010, the band released a new single, \"Represent\". The song was said to be an \"unofficial US anthem\" to coincide with the 2010 FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe band recorded a cover of \"I'm a Believer\" for the movie \"Shrek Forever After\". Previously, Weezer had planned to include an early version of \"My Best Friend\" from \"Make Believe\" in \"Shrek 2\", but it was rejected due to the song sounding \"too much like it was written for Shrek\".\n\nCurrent members\n\nTouring members\nFormer members\n\nFormer touring members\nTimeline\n\nThe Grammy Award is an award presented by The Recording Academy to recognize achievement in the mainly English-language music industry.

                "Weezer (2008 album)\n\nWeezer, also known as the Red Album, is the eponymous sixth studio album by American rock band Weezer, released on June 3, 2008. Rick Rubin and Jacknife Lee both produced parts of the album, with the band producing a handful of tracks themselves. Like the group's 1994 debut album, the Blue Album, other band members contributed to songwriting. This is the first and, so far, the only Weezer album to feature lead vocals from all four band members. The album also features more musical experimentation in comparison to their previous efforts, especially shown in such songs as \"Dreamin'\", \"The Angel and The One\" and \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\", and is also the only album of theirs besides Blue Album to feature songs longer than four minutes.\n\nThis is the third self-titled Weezer album, after their debut, the Blue Album (1994), and the Green Album (2001); so-called because of the main background color used on each album's cover art. Since the Red Album, Weezer has released a fourth self-titled album, known as the White Album (2016), with a follow up planned for release sometime in 2018.\n\nTwo official singles were released from the album—\"Pork and Beans\" and \"Troublemaker\"—with both becoming relatively successful modern rock songs. The video for the former also became the most-watched video on the internet the weekend following its release. Additionally, an unconventional Hootenanny Tour replaced the traditional rock concert tour to promote the album. Despite this, the album proved to be less successful than their previous album, \"Make Believe\", failing to be certified Gold.\n\nAfter the platinum success of their fifth album \"Make Believe\", the band once again was put on hiatus. Frontman Rivers Cuomo returned to Harvard University to complete his education. He ended up graduating Phi Beta Kappa. Cuomo also married Kyoko Ito on June 18, 2006, a woman he had known since March 1997. He proposed to her in Tokyo shortly before Christmas of 2005. The wedding was held at a secluded beach on Paradise Cove in Malibu and was attended by over a hundred people, including six of the seven members who played in Weezer (Mikey Welsh was not in attendance) as well as notables Justin Fisher, Kevin Ridel and Rick Rubin.\n\nMeanwhile, members Patrick Wilson and Brian Bell appeared in the 2006 film \"Factory Girl\" playing John Cale and Lou Reed respectively and contributing a cover of the Velvet Underground song \"Heroin\" for the film. Also during this time, Bell formed a new side-band called The Relationship while Wilson started work on material for the next Special Goodness album. He also had a second child, Ian Patrick Wilson, with his wife in early 2008.\n\nThe band announced in June 2007 that recording sessions for the album would begin in July. In December 2007, Cuomo released \",\" which featured home demos that Cuomo has recorded from 1992-2007. It was also during this time that a mysterious website called \"albumsix.com\" began gaining attention. The website gave false information about the album such as the album title would be \"\"Tout Ensemble\"\" (French for \"All Together\") and a fake release date. The website fooled several news outlets such as \"Pitchfork\" and \"Rolling Stone\". The website was later revealed to be a hoax by some fans. Band historian/webmaster Karl Koch stated on Weezer's official website:\n\nAt the beginning of the album's creation each Weezer member asked themselves what they wanted to get out of the album. With that in mind, they set out to record. Recording was done in three sessions. Half of the album was recorded during the spring of 2007 with Rick Rubin overseeing production. The second session, started in July and finished on October 18, was produced by Weezer themselves at Malibu. The third and final session of recording was done at the request of Geffen Records, who claimed that there was not enough commercial material on the album. This session was produced by Jacknife Lee and completed in March 2008.\nIn the first podcast released on www.riverspodcast.com, Rivers mentioned playing drums on two songs on the album. In an interview with \"Pitchfork\", Cuomo stated the album would contain \"longer songs, non-traditional song forms, different people writing and singing, instrument switching, TR-808s, synths, Southern rap, and baroque counterpoint.\"\n\nThe majority of the album's content was written by Rivers Cuomo. However, for the first time since their debut album other members of the band contributed songwriting as well. Cuomo consciously strived to write less traditionally-structured songs, breaking away from the \"verse-chorus--verse-chorus-bridge\" structure that was present on past albums. Much of the album's subject matter is rooted in past experiences and nostalgia.\n\n\"Troublemaker\", which was considered for the first single, introduces the theme of nostalgia for the album, with Cuomo \"reliving his lost youth\". \"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived (Variations on a Shaker Hymn)\" is a track that includes piano, police sirens, rapped vocals and Cuomo singing in falsetto. Bass player Scott Shriner was particularly proud of the song saying, \"The song 'The Greatest Man That Ever Lived' is a masterpiece that includes ten different styles of music based around a common theme. It's awesome. That word gets abused a lot, like 'Wow, these pancakes are awesome,' but 'Greatest Man' is . . . awesome!\" \"Pork and Beans\", the album's third track and first single, was written by Cuomo as a reaction to a meeting with Geffen where the band was told it needed to record more-commercial material.\n\n\"Heart Songs\" is about all the artists and records that have influenced Cuomo from Gordon Lightfoot's \"The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald\" when he was 5 years old to Nirvana's \"Nevermind\" in his early 20s. The song misidentifies the cover of \"I Think We're Alone Now\" as being by Debbie Gibson instead of Tiffany, an error that was brought to Cuomo's attention while recording. Cuomo opted to keep the error in due to his own memories and the personal nature of the song. Cuomo told \"Pitchfork\" that the song was partly inspired by the Mariah Carey song \"We Belong Together\". Cuomo's childhood friend Adam Orth commented on the autobiographical element of the lyrics for \"Everybody Get Dangerous\". \"Dreamin'\" was formerly known as \"Daydreamer\" and was described in the liner notes to \"\" as an \"epic, 6-minute, symphonic type of art song.\" \"This is the Way\", featured on \"Alone\", was written as a more straightforward counterpart, and was originally selected by the band to be recorded for the Weezer album, but Cuomo persuaded the others to go with \"Dreamin'\" instead.\n\n\"Thought I Knew\" was also the name of a song by Brian Bell's band The Relationship, and is a reworking and re-recording of the track with Weezer sung as a lead vocal by Brian Bell. The song was originally written in a minor key. However, Bell felt that historically the band's songs haven't worked in minor and that the song needed to feel more uplifting. So he changed the song from minor to major and sped up the tempo. \"Cold Dark World\" is a song that was written by Rivers Cuomo and Scott Shriner and features Shriner on lead vocals. Shriner commented, \"...I wrote this kind of creepy music, and Rivers wrote these kind of happy, positive lyrics, but when you put it together, it made a super-creepy song which I'm really proud of.\" \"Automatic\" was written by Patrick Wilson and features him on lead vocals, saying that the song \"is interesting. It's a big rock tune but it's kinda got a vibe to it and the lyrics are just about me wanting to give as much love as I can to my family...\"\n\n\"The Angel and the One\" serves as the album's closer. Some members of the band have claimed that this is their favorite track, including Pat Wilson. Cuomo stated that initially the song \"started out as a really standard pop song called 'bad girl' and had a verse and a chorus and bridge and all that stuff. And I just wasn't satisfied with it. It was too normal. So one day I sat down with my acoustic guitar and I just played [this] song over and over, on basically looping it. My fingers hurt so much, I just kept playing it. And over the hour that I was playing it, the song slowly evolved and it smoothed over and the sections blurred into each other. And it turned into this spiritual reverie that is really just one long development without any distinction between sections.\"\n\nThe album's deluxe edition featured four bonus tracks. \"Pig\" leaked as a demo in early 2007, this song details the life of a pig including playing in the mud as a piglet, falling in love, getting married, raising children and eventually being slaughtered. The final version of the track appears on the deluxe edition of the Weezer album. \"King\" is the last song on the deluxe edition of the Weezer album and is sung by Scott Shriner. In the liner notes for the deluxe edition Scott says that the song was not being voted by the rest of the band but was one of his favorite tracks from the demos Rivers played for the band. One day Scott called up Rivers and demanded the band add the song on the album, Rivers responded by saying that if he [Scott] wanted the song so bad he should sing it, and so he did. The song apparently took the longest to record and perfect, taking three weeks.\n\nThe album's cover debuted on Spinner.com on April 21, 2008. It features the band members Brian Bell, Patrick Wilson, Rivers Cuomo and Scott Shriner in various outfits standing left to right in front of a red backdrop, and is in a manner similar to their debut and 2001 album. The cover was photographed by Sean Murphy. \"Pitchfork\" writer Amy Phillips compared the cover to the Village People saying, \"Meet the new Village People: The Bartender, the Professor, the Cowboy, and the Biker.\" The cover received mixed reactions from fans wondering if the cover was a hoax. The cover was reconfirmed by the band's publicist Jim Merlis, \"Yes, that's absolutely the cover. It's what they chose. They looked at a bunch of mockups, and that's the one they decided to go with. It's not a joke.\"\n\nFrom a Buzznet.com interview with Scott Shriner:\nOn April 1, 2008, \"Rolling Stone\" reported that the album would once again be self-titled and become known as \"The Red Album\", with the first single being titled \"Pork and Beans\". The record was one of the first albums to be released on the new microSD slotMusic media format. In addition to the full album in a DRM-free MP3 format, the memory card also includes album art, liner notes, videos, and other features.\n\nSeveral of the songs were featured in several media outlets. \"Troublemaker\" was featured in the trailer for Disney's comedy film \"G-Force\". The album's fifth track, \"Everybody Get Dangerous\", was played briefly in the film \"21\", although it was later excluded from the official soundtrack release. \"Automatic\" was remixed by LA Riots for the video game \"Gran Turismo 5 Prologue\".\n\nThe album was promoted with a tour throughout 2008 called the \"Troublemaker Tour\" with even a bonus track off the album \"King\" also being played live. This would be the last time the band would tour to promote a new release of theirs until the 2014 release of Everything Will Be Alright in the End.\n\nThe album received generally positive reviews, with a Metacritic score of 64, based on 32 reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the album a positive review of 4 and a half stars out of five calling the album, \"A cheerfully restless record, one where all the parts don't fit and it's better because of it, as it has a wild, willing personality, suggesting that Weezer is comfortable as a band in a way they never quite have been before.\" \"The Boston Globe\" called the songs, \"consistently vibrant, catchy, and well-built.\" IGN also gave the album a score of 6.9 out of ten, stating, \"The Red Album is totally bizarre, a certifiable mess, and a hell of a lot of fun.\" \"NME\" complimented Cuomo's songwriting saying, \"Musically, it’s a record that does much to further the claim for Cuomo’s songwriting greatness.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" gave it a score of three-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"a rush, starting with a sustained, four-song soliloquy on pop music's allure.\"\n\nAmong the negative reviews, Tiny Mix Tapes called the album \"a sad portrait of a band that has been totally destroyed by fame and the pressures that come along with it,\" and \"The A.V. Club\" saying: \"If the so-called 'Red Album' really is an elaborate goof on an all-too-forgiving fan base, that doesn't make Weezer's newest worst album any less insipid.\" \"Pitchfork\" gave the record 4.7/10, lamenting that \"like the YouTube culture the 'Pork and Beans' video depicts so well, the song-- and this album-- relies on a high quantity of short-lived pretty good ideas to distract from a shortage of great ones.\" \"Prefix Magazine\" said that if the Red Album's \"songs were formulaic, shiny, and easily digestible like everything on \"Green\" or \"Maladroit\", the vacuity of the new songs wouldn't be as big a problem. But 'Heart Songs,' 'Thought I Knew'--these are just plain bad.\"\n\nThe Red Album debuted at the fourth spot of the \"Billboard\" 200, with 126,000 copies sold in its first week. As of August 2009, according to Nielsen SoundScan, the Red Album has sold 443,000 copies.\n\nAll songs written by Rivers Cuomo, except where noted.

                "Weezer (2001 album)\n\nWeezer, also known as the Green Album, is the third studio album by American rock band Weezer, released on May 15, 2001, through Geffen Records. Produced by Ric Ocasek, this is the only Weezer album to feature bassist Mikey Welsh, who replaced Matt Sharp. The album is grounded in the power pop genre, featuring strong melodies, crisp vocal harmonies, and prominent guitar riffs. It is also Weezer's quickest-selling album.\n\n\"Weezer\" received generally favorable reviews. The album was often recognized as a rebirth for the band, after a five-year hiatus following their 1996 album \"Pinkerton\". The album attained chart success by debuting at number 4 in the US and number 2 in Canada. The album also charted within the top ten in Norway and Sweden. Since its release in 2001, the album has sold over 1,600,000 copies in the United States.\n\nThree singles were released from the album, including \"Hash Pipe\", \"Island in the Sun\", and \"Photograph\". Its first single, \"Hash Pipe\", was a worldwide modern rock hit, charting on seven different charts, despite their record label's reluctance to release it as the first single.\n\nFollowing the commercial and critical failure of \"Pinkerton\" (1996), Weezer frontman Rivers Cuomo placed the band on hiatus. He returned to Harvard University to finish his studies, but eventually dropped out to focus on songwriting. During this time, Cuomo played with a different group of musicians in the band Homie, based in Boston. One of the members of Homie was Mikey Welsh, a bass player who would eventually be asked to replace Matt Sharp in Weezer.\n\nBy February 1998, Cuomo had quietly disbanded Homie and headed to Los Angeles to begin work on Weezer demos with Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson. At this point, bassist Matt Sharp was absent from numerous Weezer rehearsals and was becoming estranged from the band. On April 8, 1998, Sharp announced his official exit from Weezer to devote all his energies to his band, The Rentals. It was quickly announced that former Homie member Welsh would take over on bass for Weezer. Frustration and creative disagreements led to a decline in rehearsals, and, in the latter half of 1998, drummer Patrick Wilson left for his home in Portland pending renewed productivity from Cuomo, who went into a period of admitted depression, during which he painted the walls of his home black and put \"fiberglass insulation all over the windows and then black sheets of fiberglass so that no light could get through.\"\n\nBy the beginning of 1999, Weezer had once again gone their separate ways. Drummer Patrick Wilson resumed his efforts with his side-band The Special Goodness, guitarist Bell worked on his band Space Twins and Welsh toured with Juliana Hatfield. Meanwhile, Cuomo focused his energy on songwriting, crafting 121 songs, nearly half of which would become demos. During this time, he isolated himself and abstained from contact with the outside world. Cuomo also received braces on his teeth, further damaging his self-esteem. Bell would occasionally visit Cuomo and play songs with him. In turn, Cuomo would eventually reveal songs he was working on to Bell.\n\nUnbeknownst to the band, their fanbase was connecting and growing on the internet, which was helping to boost the reputation and sales of \"Pinkerton\". When it was released, \"Pinkerton\" was considered a critical and commercial failure; however, in the years following the release of the album, it would gain a much more positive reputation due to word-of-mouth on message boards and various web pages. This expanding internet activity would later set the stage for the band's 2001 comeback. Renewed interaction between band members took place when Weezer was offered a lucrative offer to perform in Japan in August 2000 for the Summer Sonic Festival. Rehearsals for the show reinvigorated the band into talking about making a new album. The band returned to performing in June 2000, playing low-key shows around Los Angeles under the pseudonym Goat Punishment, ensuring that Weezer would only perform for longtime fans who would recognize the name.\n\nEventually, the band started performing at higher profile gigs such as the Warped Tour. Cuomo later remarked, \"We went in there fully expecting to be booed and to have things thrown at us. But it was exactly the opposite, people were singing along to all the songs and just going crazy, giving us the best support. And I think that gave us the confidence we needed.\" The positive response to the Warped Tour performances led to further shows being scheduled. When touring began to wind down, MP3 demos captured live on the band's mobile unit and sound checks began to surface on file-sharing services and eventually for downloading on the band's official website. These songs were often referred to as \"Summer Songs of 2000\" (commonly abbreviated as \"SS2K\").\n\nOn October 23, Cuomo announced that the band would start recording material \"with or without\" a producer. However, the band's record label decided to have the band employ a record producer due to the commercial failure of their self-produced album \"Pinkerton.\" The band began rehearsing and arranging both the \"Summer Songs of 2000\" and newer material Cuomo had written at his home with engineer Chad Bamford. The band eventually decided to hire Ric Ocasek—who had also produced their debut album—as producer, and began sending demos to Ocasek during the summer of 2000. There was much debate among the band members as to whether they should record in Los Angeles or Ocasek's New York home, with the band eventually deciding to record in Los Angeles at Cello Studios. The band continued to demo new music daily and started to weed through more than seventy-five demos, eventually homing in on twenty-five potential album tracks in anticipation of Ocasek's arrival. Ocasek worked with the band to trim these down further to eighteen songs.\n\nRecording sessions for the album began in early December, with Ocasek providing creative feedback to the band by telephone. On December 27, the band embarked on what would be close to six weeks of studio work by playing songs repetitively in order to track the bass and drums parts. They also did \"scratch takes\" of the vocals and guitar, designed to get accurate rhythm tracks before being redone more efficiently later in the recording process. While recording the album, the band continued to perform gigs under the pseudonym Goat Punishment.\n\nDuring the recording sessions, an executive at the band's label, Geffen Records, visited to observe the band's progress and expressed dissatisfaction with several tracks. This feedback eventually forced the band to discard a few of the album's possible songs. The band then relocated for three weeks to a smaller studio in another part of Cello Studios where Cuomo and Bell worked on guitar takes while the entire band recorded vocal tracks. Ocasek said: \"Rivers always does his guitar parts in one take.\"\n\nMixing for the album began on January 31 by Tom Lord-Alge at South Beach Studios. Bell was absent from the mixing process.\n\nThe art direction of the album was handled by Chris Bilheimer with photography from Marina Chavez and Karl Koch. The album cover was shot between band practices and featured Mikey Welsh, Rivers Cuomo, Brian Bell and Patrick Wilson standing left to right in front of a plain, lime-green backdrop in a manner similar to the band's debut album. This was done as a tribute to Ric Ocasek, who had also produced their first album, and also to symbolize the band's back-to-basics approach they took while recording the album. This approach is alluded to in a quote in the liner notes of the album: \"Torniamo all'antico e sarà un progresso\", from Italian opera composer Giuseppe Verdi that means \"Let us return to old times and that will be progress.\"\n\nThe picture inside of the CD booklet is a photo of Weezer playing live, featuring (in the lower right hand corner) an overlay of the silhouettes of Mike Nelson, Tom Servo and Crow T. Robot from the television show \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\". (Hence the liner note citation \"MST3K silhouette appears courtesy of Best Brains, Inc.\")\n\nThis was Weezer's first album to feature a transparent CD tray. Under the CD tray of the album, the word \"No\" can be found on the back of the spine. Some fans speculate that this is a response to the inside tray of Radiohead's album \"OK Computer\" which contains the text \"I like you. I like you. You are a wonderful person. I'm full of enthusiasm. I'm going places. I'll be happy to help you. I am an important person, would you like to come home with me?\" Weezer's official explanation was vague, with webmaster Karl Koch stating \"No means no.\"\n\nThe album contains the dedication \"In loving memory of Mykel and Carli.\" Mykel and Carli Allan were sisters devoted to developing fan clubs for up-and-coming bands. The sisters had been influential in starting and developing Weezer's official fan club in the 1990s and, along with their young sister Trysta, died in a car accident in 1997.\n\nThe album was met with enthusiasm from the record label; according to Weezer collaborator Karl Koch, \"They had nothing but supportive and excited things to say about it.\" However, the album's original release date of April 17 was postponed due to executives not liking Cuomo's choice of \"Hash Pipe\" as the first single. Citing the song's lurid content about a transvestite prostitute as inappropriate, they suggested that \"Don't Let Go\" be chosen as the first single. However, Cuomo continued to fight and \"Hash Pipe\" eventually became the album's first single. The label tried to postpone the release date further until June, but the band convinced them to adhere to the original May 15 release date.\n\nThe first single from the album was \"Hash Pipe\". The video for \"Hash Pipe\" was directed by Marcos Siega and was the first of many Weezer videos that Siega would direct. In the video, Weezer performs in an arena while a group of sumo wrestlers are fighting in the background. The song title was often censored as \"H*** Pipe\" (the title employed on the music video's title card) or \"Half Pipe.\" The song became a huge hit on the MTV show \"Total Request Live\", and also received heavy rotation on radio, eventually peaking at number two on the US Modern Rock Charts. The song even landed the band a nomination for \"High Times\" magazine's \"Pot Song of the Year\".\n\nThe next single, \"Island in the Sun\", was a successful radio hit and became one of the band's biggest oversea hits. It peaked at number 11 on the US Modern Rock Charts and at number 31 on the UK Top 40. Two music videos were created for the song: the first video, directed by Marcos Siega, shows Weezer playing the song at a Mexican couple's wedding reception and features all four band members. This version remains the more obscure of the two, receiving less airplay than the second. The executives at MTV disliked Siega's video, prompting the band to film a second video. This second version was directed by Spike Jonze and featured the band playing with various wild animals on a supposedly remote hill (although it was actually filmed a short distance outside of Los Angeles, possibly near Simi Valley). Only Brian Bell, Rivers Cuomo and Patrick Wilson appear in this video, as then bassist Mikey Welsh had left the band shortly before shooting. It is also rumored that original bassist Matt Sharp was approached to be in the video, though it is unclear if the offer was ever actually made. Scott Shriner, who was filling in for Welsh and would later become a permanent member of Weezer, stated in the commentary for \"\" that he almost asked the band to let him appear in the video. The second video received much wider airplay than the original and has become the standard video for the song.\n\nThe third and final single from the album was \"Photograph\", which was released to radio in early November. The single peaked at number 17 on the US Modern Rock Charts. In Japan it was released as the first single instead of \"Hash Pipe.\" The band felt the song didn't have the staying power of the previous singles, and thus decided to pass on a big-name director for the music video, opting instead to have Karl Koch shoot and edit a video from on-the-road footage.\n\n\"Weezer\" received generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 73 out of 100. AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who gave the album a rating of four and a half stars, stated that \"this may seem like nothing special -- it's just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks -- but \"nobody\" else does it this so well, no matter how many bands try.\" PopMatters' writer Jason Thompson also gave the album a positive review, praising the decision of the band to have Ric Ocasek produce them again: \"The guitar solos ring out as joyful as the words. And even the songs' lengths are nice and compact. Weezer comes in, plays the song, and exits. No overkill makes for many moments where you want to hear these songs again and again. Perhaps having producer Ric Ocasek back on board was one of the best ideas the band had, as the Green Album is certainly water tight all around.\" \"Drowned in Sound\" gave the album a very positive review, saying \"After creating the two greatest pop-rock records in existence it's time to add a third. One listen to the Green Album has you eating out of Rivers Cuomo's hand just like in the past. [...] Rivers Cuomo is one of the greatest song-writers that has picked up a guitar. Anyone who can with hold the charms of the Geek-rock quartet are obviously made of stone and complete assholes. Sorry to be blunt but it's the way it is. God I think the sun's finally taking its toll.\" The album would later rank at number 3 in their list of the best albums of 2001, tying with System of a Down's \"Toxicity\" and Mogwai's \"Rock Action\". \"Q\" listed \"Weezer\" as one of the best 50 albums of 2001.\n\nNot all the reviews were complimentary. Spencer Owen, writing in \"Pitchfork\", called the album \"average from beginning to end.\" In addition, Sarah Dempster from \"NME\" was disappointed with the album and said, \"The most irritating aspect of the Green Album is, however, the maddening itch of wasted opportunity.\"\n\nIn the United States, \"Weezer\" debuted at number four on the \"Billboard\" 200 on the week of May 15, 2001. In two weeks the album had sold 215,000 copies. It was certified platinum on September 13, 2001. As of August 2009, the album has sold over 1,600,000 copies in the United States. In Canada, the album debuted at number two on the Canadian Albums Chart. In June 2001, the album was later certified platinum by the Canadian Recording Industry Association (CRIA) for sales of 80,000 units.\n\nThe album debuted at number thirty-one on the UK Albums Chart. In Australia, the album peaked at number twenty-five. The album has since been certified two-times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) for shipment of 140,000 copies. \"Weezer\" also peaked in the Top Ten in Norway and Sweden, charting and eight and seven respectively.\n\nUK and Japanese bonus tracks\n\nJapanese bonus track\nAdapted from the album liner notes.\nWeezer\n\nProduction\nCharts\n\nCertifications\n\nSingles\nFootnotes\nBibliography\n\n"

                "Scuba diving\n\nScuba diving is a form of underwater diving where the diver uses a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) which is completely independent of surface supply, to breathe underwater. Scuba divers carry their own source of breathing gas, usually compressed air, allowing them greater independence and freedom of movement than surface-supplied divers, and longer underwater endurance than breath-hold divers. Open circuit scuba systems discharge the breathing gas into the environment as it is exhaled, and consist of one or more diving cylinders containing breathing gas at high pressure which is supplied to the diver through a regulator. They may include additional cylinders for decompression gas or emergency breathing gas. Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow recycling of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced compared to that of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. Rebreathers extend the time spent underwater compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption, they produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid disturbing marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.\n\nScuba diving may be done recreationally or professionally in a number of applications, including scientific, military and public safety roles, but most commercial diving uses surface-supplied diving equipment when this is practicable. Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers.\n\nA scuba diver primarily moves underwater by using fins attached to the feet, but external propulsion can be provided by a diver propulsion vehicle, or a sled pulled from the surface. Other equipment includes a mask to improve underwater vision, exposure protection, equipment to control buoyancy, and equipment related to the specific circumstances and purpose of the dive. Some scuba divers use a snorkel when swimming on the surface. Scuba divers are trained in the procedures and skills appropriate to their level of certification by instructors affiliated to the diver certification organisations which issue these certifications. These include standard operating procedures for using the equipment and dealing with the general hazards of the underwater environment, and emergency procedures for self-help and assistance of a similarly equipped diver experiencing problems. A minimum level of fitness and health is required by most training organisations, but a higher level of fitness may be appropriate for some applications.\n\nThe history of scuba diving is closely linked with the history of scuba equipment. By the turn of the twentieth century, two basic architectures for underwater breathing apparatus had been pioneered; open-circuit surface supplied equipment where the diver's exhaled gas is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit breathing apparatus where the diver's carbon dioxide is filtered from unused oxygen, which is then recirculated. Closed circuit equipment was more easily adapted to scuba in the absence of reliable, portable, and economical high pressure gas storage vessels.\nBy the mid twentieth century, high pressure cylinders were available and two systems for scuba had emerged: open-circuit scuba where the diver's exhaled breath is vented directly into the water, and closed-circuit scuba where the carbon dioxide is removed from the diver's exhaled breath which has oxygen added and is recirculated.\n\nThese were the first systems that became popular with recreational divers. They were safer than early rebreather systems, less expensive to operate, and allowed dives to greater depths.\n\nAn important step for the development of open circuit scuba technology was the invention of the demand regulator, a mechanism that conserves air supply by providing air flow only when the outlet pressure is reduced when the diver inhales. In 1864, the French engineers Auguste Denayrouze and Benoît Rouquayrol designed and patented their \"Rouquayrol-Denayrouze diving suit\" after adapting a pressure regulator and developing it for underwater use. This would be the first diving suit that could supply air to the diver on demand by adjusting the flow of air from the tank to meet the diver’s breathing and pressure requirements. The system still had to use surface supply, as the pressure cylinder provided was only a low capacity accumulator.\n\nThe first open-circuit scuba system was devised in 1925 by Yves Le Prieur in France. Inspired by the simple ambient pressure supply valve apparatus of Maurice Fernez and the freedom it allowed the diver, he conceived an idea to make it free of the hose from the surface pump by using Michelin cylinders as the air supply, containing three litres of air compressed to . The \"Fernez-Le Prieur\" diving apparatus was demonstrated at the swimming pool of Tourelles in Paris in 1926. The unit consisted of a cylinder of compressed air carried on the back of the diver, connected to a pressure regulator designed by Le Prieur and adjusted manually by the diver, with two gauges, one for tank pressure and one for output (supply) pressure. Air was supplied continuously through the mouthpiece and ejected through a short exhaust pipe fitted with a valve as in the Fernez design, however, the lack of a demand regulator and the consequent low endurance of the apparatus limited the practical use of LePrieur’s device.\n\nFernez had previously invented the noseclip, a mouthpiece (equipped with a one-way valve for exhalation) and diving goggles, and Yves le Prieur just joined to those three Fernez elements a hand-controlled regulator and a compressed-air cylinder. Fernez's goggles did not cover the nose, which allows the diver to equalise the internal pressure by letting air flow into the goggles through the nose, so they did not allow a dive deeper than ten metres due to \"mask squeeze\". In 1933, Le Prieur replaced all the Fernez equipment (goggles, noseclip and valve) by a full face mask, directly supplied with constant flow air from the cylinder.\n\nIn 1942, during the German occupation of France, Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Émile Gagnan designed the first successful and safe open-circuit scuba, known as the Aqua-Lung. Their system combined an improved demand regulator with high-pressure air tanks. Émile Gagnan, an engineer employed by the Air Liquide company, miniaturized and adapted the regulator to use with gas generators, in response to constant fuel shortage that was a consequence of German requisitioning. Gagnan's boss, Henri Melchior, knew that his son-in-law Jacques-Yves Cousteau was looking for an automatic demand regulator to increase the useful period of the underwater breathing apparatus invented by Commander le Prieur, so he introduced Cousteau to Gagnan in December 1942. On Cousteau's initiative, the Gagnan's regulator was adapted to diving, and the new Cousteau-Gagnan patent was registered some weeks later in 1943.\n\nThe alternative concept, developed in roughly the same time frame was closed-circuit scuba. The body consumes and metabolises only a small fraction of inhaled oxygen – the situation is even more wasteful of oxygen when the breathing gas is compressed as it is in ambient pressure breathing systems underwater. The rebreather recycles the exhaled breathing gas, while constantly replenishing it from the supply so that the oxygen level does not get depleted. The apparatus also has to remove the exhaled carbon dioxide, as a buildup of CO levels would result in respiratory distress and hypercapnia.\n\nThe first commercially practical scuba rebreather was designed and built by the diving engineer Henry Fleuss in 1878, while working for Siebe Gorman in London. His self contained breathing apparatus consisted of a rubber mask connected to a breathing bag, with an estimated 50–60% oxygen supplied from a copper tank and carbon dioxide scrubbed by passing it through a bundle of rope yarn soaked in a solution of caustic potash, the system giving a dive duration of up to about three hours. This apparatus was first used under operational conditions in 1880 by Alexander Lambert, the lead diver on the Severn Tunnel construction project, who was able to travel in the darkness to close several submerged sluice doors in the tunnel; this had defeated the best efforts of hard hat divers due to the danger of their air supply hoses becoming fouled on submerged debris, and the strong water currents in the workings.\n\nFleuss continually improved his apparatus, adding a demand regulator and tanks capable of holding greater amounts of oxygen at higher pressure. Sir Robert Davis, head of Siebe Gorman, improved the oxygen rebreather in 1910 with his invention of the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus, the first rebreather to be made in quantity. While intended primarily as an emergency escape apparatus for submarine crews, it was soon also used for diving, being a handy shallow water diving apparatus with a thirty-minute endurance, and as an industrial breathing set.\n\nThe rig comprised a rubber breathing/buoyancy bag containing a canister of barium hydroxide to scrub exhaled carbon dioxide and, in a pocket at the lower end of the bag, a steel pressure cylinder holding approximately of oxygen at a pressure of which was equipped with a control valve and connected to the breathing bag. Opening the cylinder's valve admitted oxygen to the bag at ambient pressure. The rig also included an emergency buoyancy bag on its front to help keep the wearer afloat. After further development by Davis in 1927 the DSEA was adopted by the Royal Navy.\n\nIn 1911 Dräger tested a self contained rebreather system for standard diving equipment, which used an injector system to circulate the breathing gas through the breathing loop and scrubber. This was put into service soon thereafter and was available in two versions, an oxygen rebreather DM20 for depths shallower than 20m, and a nitrox rebreather DM40 for depths up to 40m.\n\nDuring the 1930s and all through World War II, the British, Italians and Germans developed and extensively used oxygen rebreathers to equip the first frogmen. The British adapted the Davis Submerged Escape Apparatus and the Germans adapted the Dräger submarine escape rebreathers, for their frogmen during the war.\n\nThe Italians developed similar rebreathers for the combat swimmers of the Decima Flottiglia MAS, especially the Pirelli ARO. In the U.S. Major Christian J. Lambertsen invented an underwater free-swimming oxygen rebreather in 1939, which was accepted by the Office of Strategic Services. In 1952 he patented a modification of his apparatus, this time named SCUBA,(an acronym for \"self-contained underwater breathing apparatus\"), which became the generic English word for autonomous breathing equipment for diving, and later for the activity using the equipment. After World War II, military frogmen continued to use rebreathers since they do not make bubbles which would give away the presence of the divers. The high percentage of oxygen used by these early rebreather systems limited the depth at which they could be used due to the risk of convulsions caused by acute oxygen toxicity.\n\nAir Liquide started selling the Cousteau-Gagnan regulator commercially as of 1946 under the name of \"scaphandre Cousteau-Gagnan\" or CG45 (\"C\" for Cousteau, \"G\" for Gagnan and 45 for the 1945 patent). The same year Air Liquide created a division called \"La Spirotechnique\", to develop and sell regulators and other diving equipment. To sell his regulator in English-speaking countries Cousteau registered the Aqua-Lung trademark, which was first licensed to the U.S. Divers company.\n\nIn 1948 the Cousteau-Gagnan patent was also licensed to Siebe Gorman of England, Siebe Gorman was allowed to sell in Commonwealth countries, but had difficulty in meeting the demand and the U.S. patent prevented others from making the product. This patent was circumvented by Ted Eldred of Melbourne, Australia, who had been developing a rebreather called the Porpoise. When a demonstration of this rebreather resulted in a diver passing out, he developed the single-hose open-circuit scuba system, which separates the first stage and demand valve of the pressure regulator by a low-pressure hose, puts the demand valve at the diver's mouth, and releases exhaled gas through the demand valve casing. Eldred sold the first Porpoise Model CA single hose scuba early in 1952.\n\nEarly scuba sets were usually provided with a plain harness of shoulder straps and waist belt. The waist belt buckles were usually quick-release, and shoulder straps sometimes had adjustable or quick release buckles. Many harnesses did not have a backplate, and the cylinders rested directly against the diver's back.\n\nEarly scuba divers dived without a buoyancy aid. In an emergency they had to jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy life jackets (ABLJ) became available, which can be used to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit and as a lifejacket that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, and that can be quickly inflated. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. A low-pressure feed from the regulator first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the stabilizer jacket was introduced by ScubaPro. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator.\n\nA backplate and wing is an alternative configuration of scuba harness with a buoyancy compensation bladder known as a \"wing\" mounted behind the diver, sandwiched between the backplate and the cylinder or cylinders. Unlike stabilizer jackets, the backplate and wing is a modular system, in that it consists of separable components. This arrangement became popular with cave divers making long or deep dives, who needed to carry several extra cylinders, as it clears the front and sides of the diver for other equipment to be attached in the region where it is easily accessible. This additional equipment is usually suspended from the harness or carried in pockets on the exposure suit.\n\nIn 1911 Draeger of Germany tested an injector operated rebreather backpack for a standard diving suit. This concept was produced and marketed as the DM20 oxygen rebreather system and the DM40 nitrox rebreather system, in which air from one cylinder and oxygen from a second cylinder were mixed during injection through a nozzle which circulated the breathing gas through the scrubber and the rest of the loop. The DM40 was rated for depths up to 40m. In the 1950s the United States Navy (USN) documented enriched oxygen gas procedures for military use of what we today call nitrox, in the USN Diving Manual, and in 1970, Morgan Wells, who was the first director of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Diving Center, began instituting diving procedures for oxygen-enriched air. In 1979 NOAA published Wells' procedures for the scientific use of nitrox in the NOAA Diving Manual. In 1985 Dick Rutkowski, a former NOAA diving safety officer, formed IAND (International Association of Nitrox Divers) and began teaching nitrox use for recreational diving. This was considered dangerous by some, and met with heavy skepticism by the diving community. Nevertheless, in 1992 NAUI became the first existing major recreational diver training agency to sanction nitrox, and eventually, in 1996, the Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) announced full educational support for nitrox. The use of a single nitrox mixture has become part of recreational diving, and multiple gas mixtures are common in technical diving to reduce overall decompression time.\nTechnical diving is recreational scuba diving that exceeds the generally accepted recreational limits, and may expose the diver to hazards beyond those normally associated with recreational diving, and to greater risks of serious injury or death. These risks may be reduced by appropriate skills, knowledge and experience, and by using suitable equipment and procedures. The term \"technical diving\" has been credited to Michael Menduno, who was editor of the (now defunct) diving magazine \"aquaCorps Journal\". The concept and term are both relatively recent advents, although divers had already been engaging in what is now commonly referred to as technical diving for decades. In his 1989 book, \"Advanced Wreck Diving\", author and leading technical diver, Gary Gentile, commented that there was no accepted term for divers who dived beyond agency-specified recreational limits for non-professional purposes. Revised editions use the term technical diving, and Gentile published a further book in 1999 entitled \"The Technical Diving Handbook\".\n\nThere is some professional disagreement as to what exactly technical diving encompasses. Nitrox diving and rebreather diving were originally considered technical, but this is no longer universally the case as several certification agencies now offer recreational nitrox and recreational rebreather training and certification. Even those who agree on the broad definitions of technical diving may disagree on the precise boundaries between technical and recreational diving. One reasonably widely held definition is that any dive in which at some point of the planned profile it is not physically possible or physiologically acceptable to make a direct and uninterrupted vertical ascent to surface air is a technical dive. The equipment often involves breathing gases other than air or standard nitrox mixtures, multiple gas sources, and different equipment configurations. Over time, some equipment and techniques developed for technical diving have become more widely accepted for recreational diving.\n\nNitrogen narcosis limits the depth reachable by underwater divers when breathing nitrox mixtures. In 1924 the US Navy started to investigate the possibility of using helium and after animal experiments, human subjects breathing heliox 20/80 (20% oxygen, 80% helium) were successfully decompressed from deep dives, followed by salvage diver Max \"Gene\" Nohl's dive to 127 meters in 1937. and the 1939 US Navy salvage of USS \"Squalus\". In 1963 saturation dives using trimix were made during Project Genesis, and in 1979 a research team at the Duke University Medical Center Hyperbaric Laboratory started work which identified the use of trimix to prevent High Pressure Nervous Syndrome symptoms. Cave divers started using trimix to allow deeper dives and it was used extensively in the 1987 Wakulla Springs Project and spread to the north-east American wreck diving community, and by 1994 John Chatterton and Gary Gentile, dived on the \"RMS Lusitania\" expedition to a depth of 100 meters using trimix.\nThe challenges of deeper dives and longer penetrations and the large amounts of breathing gas necessary for these dive profiles reawakened interest in rebreathers. The ready availability of oxygen sensing cells beginning in the late 1980s led to a resurgence of interest in rebreather diving. By accurately measuring the partial pressure of oxygen, it became possible to maintain and accurately monitor a breathable gas mixture in the loop at any depth. In the mid 1990s semi-closed circuit rebreathers became available for the recreational scuba market, followed by closed circuit rebreathers around the turn of the millenium. Rebreathers are currently (2018) manufactured for the military, technical and recreational scuba markets.\nSidemount is a scuba diving equipment configuration which has basic scuba sets, each comprising a single cylinder with a dedicated regulator and pressure gauge, mounted alongside the diver, clipped to the harness below the shoulders and along the hips, instead of on the back of the diver. It originated as a configuration for advanced cave diving, as it facilitates penetration of tight sections of cave as, sets can be easily removed and remounted when necessary. The configuration allows easy access to cylinder valves, and provides easy and reliable gas redundancy. These benefits for operating in confined spaces were also recognized by divers who made wreck diving penetrations. Sidemount diving is now growing in popularity within the technical diving community for general decompression diving, and has become a popular specialty for recreational diving, with several diver certification agencies offering recreational and technical level sidemount training programs.\n\nThe defining equipment used by a scuba diver is the eponymous \"scuba\", the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus which allows the diver to breathe while diving, and is transported by the diver.\n\nAs one descends, in addition to the normal atmospheric pressure at the surface, the water exerts increasing hydrostatic pressure of approximately 1 bar (14.7 pounds per square inch) for every 10 m (33 feet) of depth. The pressure of the inhaled breath must balance the surrounding or ambient pressure to allow inflation of the lungs. It becomes virtually impossible to breathe air at normal atmospheric pressure through a tube below three feet under the water.\n\nMost recreational scuba diving is done using a half mask which covers the diver's eyes and nose, and a mouthpiece to supply the breathing gas from the demand valve or rebreather. Inhaling from a regulator's mouthpiece becomes second nature very quickly. The other common arrangement is a full face mask which covers the eyes, nose and mouth, and often allows the diver to breathe through the nose. Professional scuba divers are more likely to use full face masks, which protect the diver's airway if the diver loses consciousness.\n\nOpen circuit scuba has no provision for using the breathing gas more than once for respiration. The gas inhaled from the scuba equipment is exhaled to the environment, or occasionally into another item of equipment for a special purpose, usually to increase buoyancy of a lifting device such as a buoyancy compensator, inflatable surface marker buoy or small lifting bag. The breathing gas is generally provided from a high-pressure diving cylinder through a scuba regulator. By always providing the appropriate breathing gas at ambient pressure, demand valve regulators ensure the diver can inhale and exhale naturally and without excessive effort, regardless of depth, as and when needed.\n\nThe most commonly used scuba set uses a \"single-hose\" open circuit 2-stage demand regulator, connected to a single back-mounted high-pressure gas cylinder, with the first stage connected to the cylinder valve and the second stage at the mouthpiece. This arrangement differs from Émile Gagnan's and Jacques Cousteau's original 1942 \"twin-hose\" design, known as the Aqua-lung, in which the cylinder pressure was reduced to ambient pressure in one or two stages which were all in the housing mounted to the cylinder valve or manifold. The \"single-hose\" system has significant advantages over the original system for most applications.\n\nIn the \"single-hose\" two-stage design, the first stage regulator reduces the cylinder pressure of up to about to an intermediate pressure (IP) of about above ambient pressure. The second stage demand valve regulator, supplied by a low-pressure hose from the first stage, delivers the breathing gas at ambient pressure to the diver's mouth. The exhaled gases are exhausted directly to the environment as waste through a non-return valve on the second stage housing. The first stage typically has at least one outlet port delivering gas at full tank pressure which is connected to the diver's submersible pressure gauge or dive computer, to show how much breathing gas remains in the cylinder.\n\nLess common are closed circuit (CCR) and semi-closed (SCR) rebreathers which unlike open-circuit sets that vent off all exhaled gases, process all or part of each exhaled breath for re-use by removing the carbon dioxide and replacing the oxygen used by the diver.\n\nRebreathers release little or no gas bubbles into the water, and use much less stored gas volume, for an equivalent depth and time because exhaled oxygen is recovered; this has advantages for research, military, photography, and other applications. Rebreathers are more complex and more expensive than open-circuit scuba, and special training and correct maintenance are required for them to be safely used, due to the larger variety of potential failure modes.\n\nIn a closed-circuit rebreather the oxygen partial pressure in the rebreather is controlled, so it can be maintained at a safe continuous maximum, which reduces the inert gas (nitrogen and/or helium) partial pressure in the breathing loop. Minimising the inert gas loading of the diver's tissues for a given dive profile reduces the decompression obligation. This requires continuous monitoring of actual partial pressures with time and for maximum effectiveness requires real-time computer processing by the diver's decompression computer. Decompression can be much reduced compared to fixed ratio gas mixes used in other scuba systems and, as a result, divers can stay down longer or require less time to decompress. A semi-closed circuit rebreather injects a constant mass flow of a fixed breathing gas mixture into the breathing loop, or replaces a specific percentage of the respired volume, so the partial pressure of oxygen at any time during the dive depends on the diver's oxygen consumption and/or breathing rate. Planning decompression requirements requires a more conservative approach for a SCR than for a CCR, but decompression computers with a real time oxygen partial pressure input can optimise decompression for these systems.\n\nBecause rebreathers produce very few bubbles, they do not disturb marine life or make a diver's presence known at the surface; this is useful for underwater photography, and for covert work.\n\nFor some diving, gas mixtures other than normal atmospheric air (21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, 1% trace gases) can be used, so long as the diver is competent in their use. The most commonly used mixture is nitrox, also referred to as Enriched Air Nitrox (EAN), which is air with extra oxygen, often with 32% or 36% oxygen, and thus less nitrogen, reducing the risk of decompression sickness or allowing longer exposure to the same pressure for equal risk. The reduced nitrogen may also allow for no stops or shorter decompression stop times or a shorter surface interval between dives. A common misconception is that nitrox can reduce narcosis, but research has shown that oxygen is also narcotic.\n\nThe increased partial pressure of oxygen due to the higher oxygen content of nitrox increases the risk of oxygen toxicity, which becomes unacceptable below the maximum operating depth of the mixture. To displace nitrogen without the increased oxygen concentration, other diluent gases can be used, usually helium, when the resultant three gas mixture is called trimix, and when the nitrogen is fully substituted by helium, heliox.\n\nFor dives requiring long decompression stops, divers may carry cylinders containing different gas mixtures for the various phases of the dive, typically designated as Travel, Bottom, and Decompression gases. These different gas mixtures may be used to extend bottom time, reduce inert gas narcotic effects, and reduce decompression times.\n\nTo take advantage of the freedom of movement afforded by scuba equipment, the diver needs to be mobile underwater.\n\nPersonal mobility is enhanced by fins and optionally diver propulsion vehicles. Fins have a large blade area and use the more powerful leg muscles, so are much more efficient for propulsion and maneuvering thrust than arm and hand movements, but require skill to provide fine control. Several types of fin are available, some of which may be more suited for maneuvering, alternative kick styles, speed, endurance, reduced effort or ruggedness.\n\nStreamlining dive gear will reduce drag and improve mobility. Balanced trim which allows the diver to align in any desired direction also improves streamlining by presenting the smallest section area to the direction of movement and allows propulsion thrust to be used more efficiently.\n\nOccasionally a diver may be towed using a \"sled\", an unpowered device towed behind a surface vessel which conserves the diver's energy and allows more distance to be covered for a given air consumption and bottom time. The depth is usually controlled by the diver by using diving planes or by tilting the whole sled. Some sleds are faired to reduce drag on the diver.\n\nTo dive safely, divers must control their rate of descent and ascent in the water and be able to maintain a constant depth in midwater. Ignoring other forces such as water currents and swimming, the diver's overall buoyancy determines whether they ascend or descend. Equipment such as diving weighting systems, diving suits (wet, dry or semi-dry suits are used depending on the water temperature) and buoyancy compensators can be used to adjust the overall buoyancy. When divers want to remain at constant depth, they try to achieve neutral buoyancy. This minimises the effort of swimming to maintain depth and therefore reduces gas consumption.\n\nThe buoyancy force on the diver is the weight of the volume of the liquid that they and their equipment displace minus the weight of the diver and their equipment; if the result is positive, that force is upwards. The buoyancy of any object immersed in water is also affected by the density of the water. The density of fresh water is about 3% less than that of ocean water. Therefore, divers who are neutrally buoyant at one dive destination (e.g. a fresh water lake) will predictably be positively or negatively buoyant when using the same equipment at destinations with different water densities (e.g. a tropical coral reef).\n\nThe removal (\"ditching\" or \"shedding\") of diver weighting systems can be used to reduce the diver's weight and cause a buoyant ascent in an emergency.\n\nDiving suits made of compressible materials decrease in volume as the diver descends, and expand again as the diver ascends, causing buoyancy changes. Diving in different environments also necessitates adjustments in the amount of weight carried to achieve neutral buoyancy. The diver can inject air into dry suits to counteract the compression effect and squeeze. Buoyancy compensators allow easy and fine adjustments in the diver's overall volume and therefore buoyancy. For open circuit divers, changes in the diver's average lung volume during a breathing cycle can be used to make fine adjustments of buoyancy.\n\nNeutral buoyancy in a diver is an unstable state. It is changed by small differences in ambient pressure caused by a change in depth, and the change has a positive feedback effect. A small descent will increase the pressure, which will compress the gas filled spaces and reduce the total volume of diver and equipment. This will further reduce the buoyancy, and unless counteracted, will result in sinking more rapidly. The equivalent effect applies to a small ascent, which will trigger an increased buoyancy and will result in accelerated ascent unless counteracted. The diver must continuously adjust buoyancy or depth in order to remain neutral. Fine control of buoyancy can be achieved by controlling the average lung volume in open circuit scuba, but this feature is not available to the closed circuit rebreather diver, as exhaled gas remains in the breathing loop. This is a skill which improves with practice until it becomes second nature.\n\nBuoyancy changes with depth variation are proportional to the compressible part of the volume of the diver and equipment, and to the proportional change in pressure, which is greater per unit of depth near the surface. Minimising the volume of gas required in the buoyancy compensator will minimise the buoyancy fluctuations with changes in depth. This can be achieved by accurate selection of ballast weight, which should be the minimum to allow neutral buoyancy with depleted gas supplies at the end of the dive unless there is an operational requirement for greater negative buoyancy during the dive.\n\nBuoyancy and trim can significantly affect drag of a diver. The effect of swimming with a head up angle, of about 15° as is quite common in poorly trimmed divers, can be an increase in drag in the order of 50%.\n\nThe ability to ascend at a controlled rate and remain at a constant depth is important for correct decompression. Recreational divers who do not incur decompression obligations can get away with imperfect buoyancy control, but when long decompression stops at specific depths are required, the risk of decompression sickness is increased by depth variations while at a stop. Decompression stops are typically done when the breathing gas in the cylinders has been largely used up, and the reduction in weight of the cylinders increases the buoyancy of the diver. Enough weight must be carried to allow the diver to decompress at the end of the dive with nearly empty cylinders.\n\nWater has a higher refractive index than air – similar to that of the cornea of the eye. Light entering the cornea from water is hardly refracted at all, leaving only the eye's crystalline lens to focus light. This leads to very severe hypermetropia. People with severe myopia, therefore, can see better underwater without a mask than normal-sighted people. \nDiving masks and helmets solve this problem by providing an air space in front of the diver's eyes. The refraction error created by the water is mostly corrected as the light travels from water to air through a flat lens, except that objects appear approximately 34% bigger and 25% closer in water than they actually are. The faceplate of the mask is supported by a frame and skirt, which are opaque or translucent, therefore total field-of-view is significantly reduced and eye–hand coordination must be adjusted.\n\nDivers who need corrective lenses to see clearly outside the water would normally need the same prescription while wearing a mask. Generic and custom corrective lenses are available for some two-window masks. Custom lenses can be bonded onto masks that have a single front window or two windows. Cylindrically curved faceplates such as those used for firefighting full-face masks produce severely distorted views underwater.\n\nAs a diver descends, they must periodically exhale through their nose to equalise the internal pressure of the mask with that of the surrounding water. Swimming goggles are not suitable for diving because they only cover the eyes and thus do not allow for equalisation. Failure to equalise the pressure inside the mask may lead to a form of barotrauma known as mask squeeze.\n\nMasks tend to fog when warm humid exhaled air condenses on the cold inside of the faceplate. To prevent fogging many divers spit into the dry mask before use, spread the saliva around the inside of the glass and rinse it out with a little water. The saliva residue allows condensation to wet the glass and form a continuous film, rather than tiny droplets. There are several commercial products that can be used as an alternative to saliva, some of which are more effective and last longer, but there is a risk of getting the anti-fog agent in the eyes.\n\nWater attenuates light by selective absorption. Pure water preferentially absorbs red light, and to a lesser extent, yellow and green, so the colour that is least absorbed is blue light. Dissolved materials may also selectively absorb colour in addition to the absorption by the water itself. In other words, as a diver goes deeper on a dive, more colour is absorbed by the water, and in clean water the colour becomes blue with depth. Colour vision is also affected by turbidity of the water which tends to reduce contrast. Artificial light is useful to provide light in the darkness, to restore contrast at close range, and to restore natural colour lost to absorption.\n\nProtection from heat loss in cold water is usually provided by wetsuits or dry suits. These also provide protection from sunburn, abrasion and stings from some marine organisms. Where thermal insulation is not important, lycra suits/diving skins may be sufficient.\n\nA wetsuit is a garment, usually made of foamed neoprene, which provides thermal insulation, abrasion resistance and buoyancy. The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to conduct heat. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low density, providing buoyancy in water. Suits range from a thin (2 mm or less) \"shortie\", covering just the torso, to a full 8 mm semi-dry, usually complemented by neoprene boots, gloves and hood. A good close fit and few zips helps the suit to remain waterproof and reduce flushing – the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside. Improved seals at the neck, wrists and ankles and baffles under the entry zip produce a suit known as \"semi-dry\".\n\nA dry suit also provides thermal insulation to the wearer while immersed in water, and normally protects the whole body except the head, hands, and sometimes the feet. In some configurations, these are also covered. Dry suits are usually used where the water temperature is below 15 °C (60 °F) or for extended immersion in water above 15 °C (60 °F), where a wet suit user would get cold, and with an integral helmet, boots, and gloves for personal protection when diving in contaminated water. Dry suits are designed to prevent water entering. This generally allows better insulation making them more suitable for use in cold water. They can be uncomfortably hot in warm or hot air, and are typically more expensive and more complex to don. For divers, they add some degree of complexity as the suit must be inflated and deflated with changes in depth in order to avoid \"squeeze\" on descent or uncontrolled rapid ascent due to over-buoyancy.\n\nUnless the maximum depth of the water is known, and is quite shallow, a diver must monitor the depth and duration of a dive to avoid decompression sickness. Traditionally this was done by using a depth gauge and a diving watch, but electronic dive computers are now in general use, as they are programmed to do real-time modelling of decompression requirements for the dive, and automatically allow for surface interval. Many can be set for the gas mixture to be used on the dive, and some can accept changes in the gas mix during the dive. Most dive computers provide a fairly conservative decompression model, and the level of conservatism may be selected by the user within limits. Most decompression computers can also be set for altitude compensation to some degree.\n\nIf the dive site and dive plan require the diver to navigate, a compass may be carried, and where retracing a route is critical, as in cave or wreck penetrations, a guide line is laid from a dive reel.\n\nIn less critical conditions, many divers simply navigate by landmarks and memory, a procedure also known as pilotage or natural navigation.\n\nA scuba diver should always be aware of the remaining breathing gas supply, and the duration of diving time that this will safely support, taking into account the time required to surface safely and an allowance for foreseeable contingencies. This is usually monitored by using a submersible pressure gauge on each cylinder.\n\nCutting tools such as knives, line cutters or shears are often carried by divers to cut loose from entanglement in nets or lines.\nA surface marker buoy on a line held by the diver indicates the position of the diver to the surface personnel. This may be an inflatable marker deployed by the diver at the end of the dive, or a sealed float, towed for the whole dive. A surface marker also allows easy and accurate control of ascent rate and stop depth for safer decompression.\n\nVarious surface detection aids may be carried to help surface personnel spot the diver after ascent.\n\nDivers may carry underwater photographic or video equipment, or tools for a specific application in addition to diving equipment.\n\nThe underwater environment is unfamiliar and hazardous, and to ensure diver safety, simple, yet necessary procedures must be followed. A certain minimum level of attention to detail and acceptance of responsibility for one's own safety and survival are required. Most of the procedures are simple and straightforward, and become second nature to the experienced diver, but must be learned, and take some practice to become automatic and faultless, just like the ability to walk or talk. Most of the safety procedures are intended to reduce the risk of drowning, and many of the rest are to reduce the risk of barotrauma and decompression sickness. In some applications getting lost is a serious hazard, and specific procedures to minimise the risk are followed.\n\nThe purpose of dive planning is to ensure that divers do not exceed their comfort zone or skill level, or the safe capacity of their equipment, and includes scuba gas planning to ensure that the amount of breathing gas to be carried is sufficient to allow for any reasonably foreseeable contingencies. Before starting a dive both the diver and their buddy do equipment checks to ensure everything is in good working order and available. Recreational divers are responsible for planning their own dives, unless in training, when the instructor is responsible. Divemasters may provide useful information and suggestions to assist the divers, but are generally not responsible for the details unless specifically employed to do so. In professional diving teams all team members are usually expected to contribute to planning and to check the equipment they will use, but the overall responsibility for the safety of the team lies with the supervisor as the appointed on-site representative of the employer.\n\nSome procedures are common to almost all scuba dives, or are used to manage very common contingencies. These are learned at entry level and may be highly standardised to allow efficient cooperation between divers trained at different schools.\n\nInert gas components of the diver's breathing gas accumulate in the tissues during exposure to elevated pressure during a dive, and must be eliminated during the ascent to avoid formation of symptomatic bubbles in tissues where the concentration is too high to remain in solution. This process is called decompression. Most recreational and professional scuba divers avoid obligatory decompression stops by following a dive profile which only requires a limited rate of ascent for decompression, but will commonly also do an optional short shallow decompression stop known as a safety stop to further reduce risk before surfacing. In some cases, particularly in technical diving, more complex decompression procedures are necessary. Decompression may follow a pre-planned series of ascents interrupted by stops, or may be monitored by a personal decompression computer.\n\nThese include debriefing where appropriate, and equipment maintenance, to ensure that the equipment is kept in good condition for later use.\n\nBuddy and team diving procedures are intended to ensure that a recreational scuba diver who gets into difficulty underwater is in the presence of a similarly equipped person who understands and can render assistance. Divers are trained to assist in those emergencies specified in the training standards for their certification, and are required to demonstrate competence in a set of prescribed buddy assist skills. The fundamentals of buddy/team safety are centred on diver communication, redundancy of gear and breathing gas by sharing with the buddy, and the added situational perspective of another diver.\n\nSolo divers take responsibility for their own safety and compensate for the absence of a buddy with skill, vigilance and appropriate equipment. Like buddy or team divers, properly equipped solo divers rely on the redundancy of critical articles of dive gear which may include at least two independent supplies of breathing gas and ensuring that there is always enough available to safely terminate the dive if any one supply fails. The difference between the two practices is that this redundancy is carried and managed by the solo diver instead of a buddy. Agencies that certify for solo diving require candidates to have a high level of dive experience – usually about 100 dives or more.\n\nSince the inception of scuba, there has been ongoing debate regarding the wisdom of solo diving with strong opinions on both sides of the issue. This debate is complicated by the fact that the line which separates a solo diver from a buddy/team diver is not always clear. For example, should a scuba instructor (who supports the buddy system) be considered a solo diver if their students do not have the knowledge or experience to assist the instructor through an unforeseen scuba emergency? Should the buddy of an underwater photographer consider themselves as effectively diving alone since their buddy (the photographer) is giving most or all of their attention to the subject of the photograph? This debate has motivated some prominent scuba agencies such as Global Underwater Explorers (GUE) to stress that its members only dive in teams and \"remain aware of team member location and safety at all time.\" Other agencies such as Scuba Diving International (SDI) and Professional Association of Diving Instructors (PADI) have taken the position that divers might find themselves alone (by choice or by accident) and have created certification courses such as the \"SDI Solo Diver Course\" and the \"PADI Self-Reliant Diver Course\" in order to train divers to handle such possibilities.\n\nThe most urgent underwater emergencies usually involve a compromised breathing gas supply. Divers are trained in procedures for donating and receiving breathing gas from each other in an emergency, and may carry an independent alternative air source if they do not choose to rely on a buddy. Divers may need to make an emergency ascent in the event of a loss of breathing gas which cannot be managed at depth. Controlled emergency ascents are almost always a consequence of loss of breathing gas, while uncontrolled ascents are usually the result of a buoyancy control failure.\n\nDivers may be trained in procedures which have been approved by the training agencies for recovery of an unresponsive diver to the surface, where it might be possible to administer first aid. Not all recreational divers have this training as some agencies do not include it in entry level training. Professional divers may be required by legislation or code of practice to have a standby diver at any diving operation, who is both competent and available to attempt rescue of a distressed diver.\n\nTwo basic types of entrapment are significant hazards for scuba divers: Inability to navigate out of an enclosed space, and physical entrapment which prevents the diver from leaving a location. The first case can usually be avoided by staying out of enclosed spaces, and when the objective of the dive includes penetration of enclosed spaces, taking precautions such as the use of lights and guidelines, for which specialised training is provided in the standard procedures. The most common form of physical entrapment is getting snagged on ropes, lines or nets, and use of a cutting implement is the standard method of dealing with the problem. The risk of entanglement can be reduced by careful configuration of equipment to minimise those parts which can easily be snagged, and allow easier disentanglement. Other forms of entrapment such as getting wedged into tight spaces can often be avoided, but must otherwise be dealt with as they happen. The assistance of a buddy may be helpful where possible.\n\nScuba diving in relatively hazardous environments such as caves and wrecks, areas of strong water movement, relatively great depths, with decompression obligations, with equipment that has more complex failure modes, and with gases that are not safe to breathe at all depths of the dive require specialised safety and emergency procedures tailored to the specific hazards, and often specialised equipment. These conditions are generally associated with technical diving.\n\nThe depth range applicable to scuba diving depends on the application and training. The major worldwide recreational diver certification agencies consider to be the limit for recreation diving. British and European agencies, including BSAC and SAA, recommend a maximum depth of Shallower limits are recommended for divers who are youthful, inexperienced, or who have not taken training for deep dives. Technical diving extends these depth limits through changes to training, equipment, and the gas mix used. The maximum depth considered safe is controversial and varies among agencies and instructors, however, there are programs that train divers for dives to . \n\nProfessional diving usually limits the allowed planned decompression depending on the code of practice, operational directives, or statutory restrictions. Depth limits depend on the jurisdiction, and maximum depths allowed range from to more than , depending on the breathing gas used and the availability of a decompression chamber nearby or on site. Commercial diving using scuba is generally restricted for reasons of occupational health and safety. Surface supplied diving allows better control of the operation and eliminates or significantly reduces the risks of loss of breathing gas supply and losing the diver. Scientific and media diving applications may be exempted from commercial diving constraints, based on acceptable codes of practice and a self-regulatory system.\n\nScuba diving may be performed for a number of reasons, both personal and professional. Recreational diving is done purely for enjoyment and has a number of echnical disciplines to increase interest underwater, such as cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and deep diving. Underwater tourism is mostly done on scuba and the associated tour guiding must follow suit.\n\nDivers may be employed professionally to perform tasks underwater. Some of these tasks are suitable for scuba.\n\nThere are divers who work, full or part-time, in the recreational diving community as instructors, assistant instructors, divemasters and dive guides. In some jurisdictions the professional nature, with particular reference to responsibility for health and safety of the clients, of recreational diver instruction, dive leadership for reward and dive guiding is recognised and regulated by national legislation. \n\nOther specialist areas of scuba diving include military diving, with a long history of military frogmen in various roles. Their roles include direct combat, infiltration behind enemy lines, placing mines or using a manned torpedo, bomb disposal or engineering operations. In civilian operations, many police forces operate police diving teams to perform \"search and recovery\" or \"search and rescue\" operations and to assist with the detection of crime which may involve bodies of water. In some cases diver rescue teams may also be part of a fire department, paramedical service or lifeguard unit, and may be classed as public service diving.\n\nUnderwater maintenance and research in large aquariums and fish farms, and harvesting of marine biological resources such as fish, abalones, crabs, lobsters, scallops, sea crayfish may be done on scuba. Boat and ship underwater hull inspection, cleaning and some aspects of maintenance (ships husbandry) may be done on scuba by commercial divers and boat owners or crew. \n\nLastly, there are professional divers involved with underwater environment, such as underwater photographers or underwater videographers, who document the underwater world, or scientific diving, including marine biology, geology, hydrology, oceanography and underwater archaeology. This work is normally done on scuba as it provides the necessary mobility. Rebreathers may be used when the noise of open circuit would alarm the subjects or the bubbles could interfere with the images. Scientific diving under the OSHA (US) exemption has been defined as being diving work done by persons with, and using, scientific expertise to observe, or gather data on, natural phenomena or systems to generate non-proprietory information, data, knowledge or other products as a necessary part of a scientific, research or educational activity, following the direction of a diving safety manual and a diving control safety board. \n\nThe choice between scuba and surface-supplied diving equipment is based on both legal and logistical constraints. Where the diver requires mobility and a large range of movement, scuba is usually the choice if safety and legal constraints allow. Higher risk work, particularly in commercial diving, may be restricted to surface-supplied equipment by legislation and codes of practice.\n\nThe safety of underwater diving depends on four factors: the environment, the equipment, behaviour of the individual diver and performance of the dive team. The underwater environment can impose severe physical and psychological stress on a diver, and is mostly beyond the diver's control. Scuba equipment allows the diver to operate underwater for limited periods, and the reliable function of some of the equipment is critical to even short term survival. Other equipment allows the diver to operate in relative comfort and efficiency. The performance of the individual diver depends on learned skills, many of which are not intuitive, and the performance of the team depends on communication and common goals.\n\nThere is a large range of hazards to which the diver may be exposed. These each have associated consequences and risks, which should be taken into account during dive planning. Where risks are marginally acceptable it may be possible to mitigate the consequences by setting contingency and emergency plans in place, so that damage can be minimised where reasonably practicable. The acceptable level of risk varies depending on legislation, codes of practice and personal choice, with recreational divers having a greater freedom of choice.\n\nDivers operate in an environment for which the human body is not well suited. They face special physical and health risks when they go underwater or use high pressure breathing gas. The consequences of diving incidents range from merely annoying to rapidly fatal, and the result often depends on the equipment, skill, response and fitness of the diver and diving team. The hazards include the aquatic environment, the use of breathing equipment in an underwater environment, exposure to a pressurised environment and pressure changes, particularly pressure changes during descent and ascent, and breathing gases at high ambient pressure. Diving equipment other than breathing apparatus is usually reliable, but has been known to fail, and loss of buoyancy control or thermal protection can be a major burden which may lead to more serious problems. There are also hazards of the specific diving environment, and hazards related to access to and egress from the water, which vary from place to place, and may also vary with time. Hazards inherent in the diver include pre-existing physiological and psychological conditions and the personal behaviour and competence of the individual. For those pursuing other activities while diving, there are additional hazards of task loading, of the dive task and of special equipment associated with the task.\n\nThe presence of a combination of several hazards simultaneously is common in diving, and the effect is generally increased risk to the diver, particularly where the occurrence of an incident due to one hazard triggers other hazards with a resulting cascade of incidents. Many diving fatalities are the result of a cascade of incidents overwhelming the diver, who should be able to manage any single reasonably foreseeable incident. Although there are many dangers involved in scuba diving, divers can decrease the risks through proper procedures and appropriate equipment. The requisite skills are acquired by training and education, and honed by practice. Open-water certification programmes highlight diving physiology, safe diving practices, and diving hazards, but do not provide the diver with sufficient practice to become truly adept.\n\nScuba divers by definition carry their breathing gas supply with them during the dive, and this limited quantity must get them back to the surface safely. Pre-dive planning of appropriate gas supply for the intended dive profile lets the diver allow for sufficient breathing gas for the planned dive and contingencies. They are not connected to a surface control point by an umbilical, such as surface-supplied divers use, and the freedom of movement that this allows, also allows the diver to penetrate overhead environments in Ice diving, Cave diving and Wreck diving to the extent that the diver may lose their way and be unable to find the way out. This problem is exacerbated by the limited breathing gas supply, which gives a limited amount of time before the diver will drown if unable to surface. The standard procedure for managing this risk is to lay a continuous guide line from open water, which allows the diver to be sure of the route to the surface. \n\nMost scuba diving, particularly recreational scuba, uses a breathing gas supply mouthpiece which is gripped by the diver's teeth, and which can be dislodged relatively easily by impact. This is generally easily rectified unless the diver is incapacitated, and the associated skills are part of entry-level training. The problem becomes severe and immediately life-threatening if the diver loses both consciousness and the mouthpiece. Rebreather mouthpieces which are open when out of the mouth may let in water which can flood the loop, making them unable to deliver breathing gas, and will lose buoyancy as the gas escapes, thus putting the diver in a situation of two simultaneous life-threatening problems. Skills to manage this situation are a necessary part of training for the specific configuration. Full-face masks reduce these risks and are generally preferred for professional scuba diving, but can make emergency gas sharing difficult, and are less popular with recreational divers who often rely on gas sharing with a buddy as their breathing gas redundancy option.\n\nThe risks of dying during recreational, scientific or commercial diving are small, and on scuba, deaths are usually associated with poor gas management, poor buoyancy control, equipment misuse, entrapment, rough water conditions and pre-existing health problems. Some fatalities are inevitable and caused by unforeseeable situations escalating out of control, but the majority of diving fatalities can be attributed to human error on the part of the victim.\n\nEquipment failure is rare in open circuit scuba, and while the cause of death is commonly recorded as drowning, this is mainly the consequence of an uncontrollable series of events taking place in water. Air embolism is also frequently cited as a cause of death, and it, too is the consequence of other factors leading to an uncontrolled and badly managed ascent, possibly aggravated by medical conditions. About a quarter of diving fatalities are associated with cardiac events, mostly in older divers. There is a fairly large body of data on diving fatalities, but in many cases the data is poor due to the standard of investigation and reporting. This hinders research which could improve diver safety.\n\nAccording to death certificates, over 80% of the deaths were ultimately attributed to drowning, but other factors usually combined to incapacitate the diver in a sequence of events culminating in drowning, which is more a consequence of the medium in which the accidents occurred than the actual accident. Often the drowning obscures the real cause of death. Scuba divers should not drown unless there are other contributory factors as they carry a supply of breathing gas and equipment designed to provide the gas on demand. Drowning occurs as a consequence of preceding problems, such as unmanageable stress, cardiac disease, pulmonary barotrauma,unconsciousness from any cause, water aspiration, trauma, environmental hazards, equipment difficulties, inappropriate response to an emergency or failure to manage the gas supply.\n\nFatality rates are comparable with jogging (13 deaths per 100,000 persons per year) and are within the range where reduction is desirable by Health and Safety Executive (HSE) criteria,\nThe most frequent root cause for diving fatalities is running out of or low on gas. Other factors cited include buoyancy control, entanglement or entrapment, rough water, equipment misuse or problems and emergency ascent. The most common injuries and causes of death were drowning or asphyxia due to inhalation of water, air embolism and cardiac events. Risk of cardiac arrest is greater for older divers, and greater for men than women, although the risks are equal by age 65.\n\nSeveral plausible opinions have been put forward but have not yet been empirically validated. Suggested contributing factors included inexperience, infrequent diving, inadequate supervision, insufficient predive briefings, buddy separation and dive conditions beyond the diver's training, experience or physical capacity.\n\nDecompression sickness and arterial gas embolism in recreational diving have been associated with specific demographic, environmental, and diving behavioural factors. A statistical study published in 2005 tested potential risk factors: age, asthma, body mass index, gender, smoking, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, previous decompression illness, years since certification, number of dives in the previous year, number of consecutive diving days, number of dives in a repetitive series, depth of the previous dive, use of nitrox as breathing gas, and use of a dry suit. No significant associations with risk of decompression sickness or arterial gas embolism were found for asthma, body mass index, cardiovascular disease, diabetes or smoking. Greater dive depth, previous decompression illness, number of consecutive days diving, and male biological gender were associated with higher risk for decompression sickness and arterial gas embolism. The use of dry suits and nitrox breathing gas, greater frequency of diving in the previous year, greater age, and more years since certification were associated with lower risk, possibly as indicators of more extensive training and experience.\n\nRisk management has three major aspects besides equipment and training: Risk assessment, emergency planning and insurance cover.\nThe risk assessment for a dive is primarily a planning activity, and may range in formality from a part of the pre-dive buddy check for recreational divers, to a safety file with professional risk assessment and detailed emergency plans for professional diving projects. Some form of pre-dive briefing is customary with organised recreational dives, and this generally includes a recitation by the divemaster of the known and predicted hazards, the risk associated with the significant ones, and the procedures to be followed in case of the reasonably foreseeable emergencies associated with them. Insurance cover for diving accidents may not be included in standard policies. There are a few organisations which focus specifically on diver safety and insurance cover, such as the international Divers Alert Network\n\nScuba training is normally provided by a qualified instructor who is a member of one or more diver certification agencies or is registered with a government agency. Basic diver training entails the learning of skills required for the safe conduct of activities in an underwater environment, and includes procedures and skills for the use of diving equipment, safety, emergency self-help and rescue procedures, dive planning, and use of dive tables or a personal decompression computer.\n\nScuba skills which an entry level diver will normally learn include:\n\nSome knowledge of physiology and the physics of diving is considered necessary by most diver certification agencies, as the diving environment is alien and relatively hostile to humans. The physics and physiology knowledge required is fairly basic, and helps the diver to understand the effects of the diving environment so that informed acceptance of the associated risks is possible. The physics mostly relates to gases under pressure, buoyancy, heat loss, and light underwater. The physiology relates the physics to the effects on the human body, to provide a basic understanding of the causes and risks of barotrauma, decompression sickness, gas toxicity, hypothermia, drowning and sensory variations. More advanced training often involves first aid and rescue skills, skills related to specialised diving equipment, and underwater work skills.\n\nRecreational diver training is the process of developing knowledge and understanding of the basic principles, and the skills and procedures for the use of scuba equipment so that the diver is able to dive for recreational purposes with acceptable risk using the type of equipment and in similar conditions to those experienced during training. Recreational (including technical) scuba diving does not have a centralised certifying or regulatory agency, and is mostly self regulated. There are, however, several international organisations of varying size and market share that train and certify divers and dive instructors, and many diving related sales and rental outlets require proof of diver certification from one of these organisations prior to selling or renting certain diving products or services.\n\nNot only is the underwater environment hazardous but the diving equipment itself can be dangerous. There are problems that divers must learn to avoid and manage when they do occur. Divers need repeated practice and a gradual increase in challenge to develop and internalise the skills needed to control the equipment, to respond effective if they encounter difficulties, and to build confidence in their equipment and themselves. Diver practical training starts with simple but essential procedures, and builds on them until complex procedures can be managed effectively. This may be broken up into several short training programmes, with certification issued for each stage, or combined into a few more substantial programmes with certification issued when all the skills have been mastered.\n\nMany diver training organizations exist, throughout the world, offering diver training leading to certification: the issuing of a \"Diving Certification Card,\" also known as a \"C-card,\" or qualification card. This diving certification model originated at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1952 after two divers died while using university-owned equipment and the SIO instituted a system where a card was issued after training as evidence of competence. Diving instructors affiliated to a diving certification agency may work independently or through a university, a dive club, a dive school or a dive shop. They will offer courses that should meet, or exceed, the standards of the certification organization that will certify the divers attending the course. Certification of the diver is done by the certification organisation on application by the registered instructor.\n\nThe International Organization for Standardization has approved six recreational diving standards that may be implemented worldwide, and some of the standards developed by the World Recreational Scuba Training Council are consistent with the applicable ISO Standards, as are equivalent standards published by the Confédération Mondiale des Activités Subaquatiques and theEuropean Underwater Federation\n\nThe initial open water training for a person who is medically fit to dive and a reasonably competent swimmer is relatively short. Many dive shops in popular holiday locations offer courses intended to teach a novice to dive in a few days, which can be combined with diving on the vacation. Other instructors and dive schools will provide more thorough training, which generally takes longer. Dive operators, dive shops, and cylinder filling stations may refuse to allow uncertified people to dive with them, hire diving equipment or have their diving cylinders filled. This may be an agency standard, company policy, or specified by legislation.\n\nIt is fairly common for a national standard for commercial diver training and registration to apply within a country. These standards may be set by national government departments and empowered by national legislation, for example, in the case of the United Kingdom, where the standards are set by the Health and Safety Executive, and South Africa where they are published by the Department of Labour. Many national training standards and the associated diver registrations are recognised internationally among the countries which are members of the International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum (IDRCF). A similar arrangement exists for State legislated standards, as in the case of Canada and Australia. Registration of professional divers trained to these standards may be directly administered by government, as in the case of South Africa, where diver registration is done by the Department of Labour, or by an approved external agent, as in the case of the Australian Diver Accreditation Scheme (ADAS)\n\nThe following countries and organisations are members of the European Diving Technology committee, which publishes minimum standards for commercial diver training and competence accepted by these and some other countries through membership of the IDRCF and IDSA:\nAustria, Belgium, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Latvia, Romania, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Slovak republic, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, United Kingdom, International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA), International Oil and Gas Producers (IOGP), International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), International Diving Schools Association (IDSA), European Underwater Federation, and International Diving Regulators and Certifiers Forum (IDRCF). These standards include \"Commercial SCUBA Diver\".\n\nAn example of a widely accepted training standard – EDTC 2017 \"Commercial SCUBA Diver\" – requires the professional scuba diver to be certified as medically fit to dive, and competent in skills covering the scope of:\n\nInternational Diving Schools Association (IDSA) provides a Table of Equivalence of various national commercial diver training standards.\n\nMilitary scuba training is usually provided by the armed force's internal diver training facilities, to their specific requirements and standards, and generally involves basic scuba training, specific training related to the equipment used by the unit, and associated skills related to the particular unit. The general scope of requirements is generally similar to that for commercial divers, though standards of fitness and assessment may differ considerably.\n\nThe current (2017) scuba depth record is held by Ahmed Gabr of Egypt who reached a depth of in the Red Sea in 2014.\n\nThe record for cave penetration (horizontal distance from a known free surface) is held by Jon Bernot and Charlie Roberson of Gainesville, Florida, with a distance of .\n\nJarrod Jablonski and Casey McKinlay completed a traverse from Turner Sink to Wakulla Springs, on 15 December 2007, covering a distance of nearly . This traverse took approximately 7 hours, followed by 14 hours of decompression. and set the record as the longest cave diving traverse.\n\nThe current record for the longest continuous submergence using SCUBA gear was set by Mike Stevens of Birmingham, England at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham, during the annual National Boat, Caravan and Leisure Show between February 14 and February 23, 1986. He was continuously submerged for 212.5 hours. The record was ratified by the \"Guinness Book of Records\".\n\n",
                "Diving cylinder\n\nA diving cylinder, scuba tank or diving tank is a gas cylinder used to store and transport the high pressure breathing gas required by a scuba set. It may also be used for surface-supplied diving or as decompression gas or an emergency gas supply for surface supplied diving or scuba. Cylinders provide gas to the diver through the demand valve of a diving regulator or the breathing loop of a diving rebreather.\n\nDiving cylinders are usually manufactured from aluminium or steel alloys, and are normally fitted with one of two common types of cylinder valve for filling and connection to the regulator. Other accessories such as manifolds, cylinder bands, protective nets and boots and carrying handles may be provided. Various configurations of harness may be used to carry the cylinder or cylinders while diving, depending on the application. Cylinders used for scuba typically have an internal volume (known as water capacity) of between and a maximum working pressure rating from . Cylinders are also available in smaller sizes, such as 0.5, 1.5 and 2 litres, however these are often used for purposes such as inflation of surface marker buoys, drysuits and buoyancy compensators rather than breathing. Scuba divers may dive with a single cylinder, a pair of similar cylinders, or a main cylinder and a smaller \"pony\" cylinder, carried on the diver's back or clipped onto the harness at the sides. Paired cylinders may be manifolded together or independent. In some cases, more that two cylinders are needed. \n\nWhen pressurised, a cylinder carries an equivalent volume of free gas greater than its water capacity, because the gas is compressed up to several hundred times atmospheric pressure. The selection of an appropriate set of diving cylinders for a diving operation is based on the amount of gas required to safely complete the dive. Diving cylinders are most commonly filled with air, but because the main components of air can cause problems when breathed underwater at higher ambient pressure, divers may choose to breathe from cylinders filled with mixtures of gases other than air. Many jurisdictions have regulations that govern the filling, recording of contents, and labelling for diving cylinders. Periodic inspection and testing of cylinders is often obligatory to ensure the safety of operators of filling stations. Pressurised diving cylinders are considered dangerous goods for commercial transportation, and regional and international standards for colouring and labelling may also apply.\n\nThe term \"diving cylinder\" tends to be used by gas equipment engineers, manufacturers, support professionals, and divers speaking British English. \"Scuba tank\" or \"diving tank\" is more often used colloquially by non-professionals and native speakers of American English. The term \"oxygen tank\" is commonly used by non-divers; however, this is a misnomer since these cylinders typically contain (compressed atmospheric) breathing air, or an oxygen-enriched air mix. They rarely contain pure oxygen, except when used for rebreather diving, shallow decompression stops in technical diving or for in-water oxygen recompression therapy. Breathing pure oxygen at depths greater than can result in oxygen toxicity.\n\nDiving cylinders have also been referred to as bottles or flasks, usually preceded with the word scuba, diving, air, or bailout. Cylinders may also be called aqualungs, a genericized trademark derived from the Aqua-lung equipment made by the Aqua Lung/La Spirotechnique company, although that is more properly applied to an open circuit scuba set or open circuit diving regulator.\n\nDiving cylinders may also be specified by their application, as in bailout cylinders, stage cylinders, deco cylinders, sidemount cylinders, pony cylinders, suit inflation cylinders, etc.\n\nThe functional diving cylinder consists of a pressure vessel and a cylinder valve. There are usually one or more optional accessories depending on the specific application.\n\nThe pressure vessel is a seamless cylinder normally made of cold-extruded aluminium or forged steel. Filament wound composite cylinders are used in fire fighting breathing apparatus and oxygen first aid equipment because of their low weight, but are rarely used for diving, due to their high positive buoyancy. They are occasionally used when portability for accessing the dive site is critical, such as in cave diving. Composite cylinders certified to ISO-11119-2 or ISO-11119-3 may only be used for underwater applications if they are manufactured in accordance with the requirements for underwater use and are marked \"UW\".\n\nAn especially common cylinder provided at tropical dive resorts is the \"aluminium-S80\" which is an aluminium cylinder design with an internal volume of rated to hold a nominal volume of of atmospheric pressure gas at its rated working pressure of . Aluminium cylinders are also often used where divers carry many cylinders, such as in technical diving in water which is warm enough that the dive suit does not provide much buoyancy, because the greater buoyancy of aluminium cylinders reduces the amount of extra buoyancy the diver would need to achieve neutral buoyancy. They are also sometimes preferred when carried as \"sidemount\" or \"sling\" cylinders as the near neutral buoyancy allows them to hang comfortably along the sides of the diver's body, without disturbing trim, and they can be handed off to another diver or stage dropped with a minimal effect on buoyancy. Most aluminium cylinders are flat bottomed, allowing them to stand upright on a level surface, but some were manufactured with domed bottoms.\n\nThe aluminium alloys used for diving cylinders are 6061 and 6351. 6351 alloy is subject to sustained load cracking and cylinders manufactured of this alloy should be periodically eddy current tested according to national legislation and manufacturer's recommendations. 6351 alloy has been superseded for new manufacture, but many old cylinders are still in service.\n\nAluminium cylinders are usually manufactured by cold extrusion of aluminium billets in a process which first presses the walls and base, then trims the top edge of the cylinder walls, followed by press forming the shoulder and neck. The final structural process is machining the neck outer surface, boring and cutting the neck threads and O-ring groove. The cylinder is then heat-treated, tested and stamped with the required permanent markings. Aluminium diving cylinders commonly have flat bases, which allows them to stand upright on horizontal surfaces, and which are relatively thick to allow for rough treatment and considerable wear. This makes them heavier than they need to be for strength, but the extra weight at the base also helps keep the centre of gravity low which gives better balance in the water and reduces excess buoyancy.\n\nIn cold water diving, where a diver wearing a highly buoyant thermally insulating dive suit has a large excess of buoyancy, steel cylinders are often used because they are denser than aluminium cylinders. They also often have a lower mass than aluminium cylinders with the same gas capacity, due to considerably higher material strength, so the use of steel cylinders can result in both a lighter cylinder and less ballast required for the same gas capacity, a two way saving on overall dry weight carried by the diver.\nSteel cylinders are more susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It is not difficult to monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.\n\nSteel cylinders are manufactured with domed (convex) and dished (concave) bottoms. The dished profile allows them to stand upright on a horizontal surface, and is the standard shape for industrial cylinders. The cylinders used for emergency gas supply on diving bells are often this shape, and commonly have a water capacity of about 50 litres (\"J\"). Domed bottoms give a larger volume for the same cylinder mass, and are the standard for scuba cylinders up to 18 litres water capacity, though some concave bottomed cylinders have been marketed for scuba.\n\nSteel alloys used for dive cylinder manufacture are authorised by the manufacturing standard. For example, the US standard DOT 3AA requires the use of open-hearth, basic oxygen, or electric steel of uniform quality. Approved alloys include 4130X, NE-8630, 9115, 9125, Carbon-boron and Intermediate manganese, with specified constituents, including manganese and carbon, and molybdenum, chromium, boron, nickel or zirconium.\n\nSteel cylinders may be manufactured from steel plate discs, which are cold drawn to a cylindrical cup form, in two or three stages, and generally have a domed base if intended for the scuba market, so they cannot stand up by themselves. After forming the base and side walls, the top of the cylinder is trimmed to length, heated and hot spun to form the shoulder and close the neck. This process thickens the material of the shoulder. The cylinder is heat-treated by quenching and tempering to provide the best strength and toughness. The cylinders are machined to provide the neck thread and o-ring seat (if applicable), then chemically cleaned or shot-blasted inside and out to remove mill-scale. After inspection and hydrostatic testing they are stamped with the required permanent markings, followed by external coating with a corrosion barrier paint or hot dip galvanising.\n\nThe \"neck\" of the cylinder is internally threaded to fit a cylinder valve. There are several standards for neck threads, these include:\nParallel threads are made to several standards:\nThe 3/4\"NGS and 3/4\"BSP are very similar, having the same pitch and a pitch diameter that only differs by about , but they are not compatible, as the thread forms are different.\n\nAll parallel thread valves are sealed using an O-ring at top of the neck thread which seals in a chamfer or step in the cylinder neck and against the flange of the valve.\n\nThe shoulder of the cylinder carries \"stamp markings\" providing required information about the cylinder.\n\nThe purpose of the \"cylinder valve\" or \"pillar valve\" is to control gas flow to and from the pressure vessel and to provide a connection with the regulator or filling hose. Cylinder valves are usually machined from brass and finished by a protective and decorative layer of chrome plating. A metal or plastic \"dip tube\" or \"valve snorkel\" screwed into the bottom of the valve extends into the cylinder to reduce the risk of liquid or particulate contaminants in the cylinder getting into the gas passages when the cylinder is inverted, and blocking or jamming the regulator. Some of these dip tubes have a plain opening, but some have an integral filter.\n\nCylinder valves are classified by four basic aspects: the thread specification, the connection to the regulator, pressure rating, and distinguishing features.\n\nCylinder threads may be in two basic configurations: Taper thread and parallel thread. These thread specifications are detailed in a previous section. The valve thread specification must exactly match the neck thread specification of the cylinder. Improperly matched neck threads can fail under pressure and can have fatal consequences.\n\nA rubber \"o-ring\" forms a seal between the metal of the pillar valve and the metal of the diving regulator. Fluoroelastomer (e.g. viton) O-rings may be used with cylinders storing oxygen-rich gas mixtures to reduce the risk of fire. There are two basic types of cylinder valve to regulator connection in general use for Scuba cylinders containing air:\n\n\nThere are also cylinder valves for scuba cylinders containing gases other than air:\n\nYoke valves are rated between 200 and 240 bar, and there does not appear to be any mechanical design detail preventing connection between any yoke fittings, though some older yoke clamps will not fit over the popular 232/240 bar combination DIN/yoke cylinder valve as the yoke is too narrow.\n\nDIN valves are produced in 200 bar and 300 bar pressure ratings. The number of threads and the detail configuration of the connections is designed to prevent incompatible combinations of filler attachment or regulator attachment with the cylinder valve.\n\nAdaptors are available to allow connection of DIN regulators to yoke cylinder valves (A-clamp or yoke adaptor), and to connect yoke regulators to DIN cylinder valves. (plug adaptors and block adaptors) Plug adaptors are rated for 232/240 bar, and can only be used with valves which are designed to accept them. Block adaptors are generally rated for 200 bar, and can be used with almost any 200 bar DIN valve.\n\nThe most commonly used cylinder valve type is the single outlet plain valve, sometimes known as a \"K\" valve, which allows connection of a single regulator, and has no reserve function. It simply opens to allow gas flow, or closes to shut it off. Several configurations are used, with options of DIN or A-clamp connection, and vertical or transverse spindle arrangements. The valve is operated by turning a knob, usually rubber or plastic, which affords a comfortable grip. Several turns are required to fully open the valves. Some DIN valves are convertible to A-clamp by use of an insert which is screwed into the opening.\n\n\"Y\" and \"H\" cylinder valves have two outlets, each with its own valve, allowing two regulators to be connected to the cylinder. If one regulator \"freeflows\", which is a common failure mode, or ices up, which can happen in water below about 5 °C, its valve can be closed and the cylinder breathed from the regulator connected to the other valve. The difference between an H-valve and a Y-valve is that the Y-valve body splits into two posts roughly 90° to each other and 45° from the vertical axis, looking like a Y, while an H-valve is usually assembled from a valve designed as part of a manifold system with an additional valve post connected to the manifold socket, with the valve posts parallel and vertical, which looks a bit like an H. Y-valves are also known as \"slingshot valves\" due to their appearance.\n\nUntil the 1970s, when submersible pressure gauges on regulators came into common use, diving cylinders often used a mechanical reserve mechanism to indicate to the diver that the cylinder was nearly empty. The gas supply was automatically cut-off by a spring loaded valve when the gas pressure reached the reserve pressure. To release the reserve, the diver pulled down on a rod that ran along the side of the cylinder and which activated a lever to open a bypass valve. The diver would then finish the dive before the reserve (typically ) was consumed. On occasion, divers would inadvertently trigger the mechanism while donning gear or performing a movement underwater and, not realizing that the reserve had already been accessed, could find themselves out of air at depth with no warning whatsoever. These valves became known as \"J-valves\" from being item \"J\" in one of the first scuba equipment manufacturer catalogs. The standard non-reserve yoke valve at the time was item \"K\", and is often still referred to as a \"K-valve\". J-valves are still occasionally used by professional divers in zero visibility, where the submersible pressure gauge (SPG) can not be read. While the recreational diving industry has largely discontinued support and sales of the J-valve, the US Department of Defense, the US Navy, NOAA (the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration) and OSHA (the national Occupational Health and Safety Administration) all still allow or recommend the use of J-valves as an alternative to a bailout cylinder or as an alternative to a submersible pressure gauge. They are generally not available through recreational dive shops, but are still available from some manufacturers. They can be significantly more expensive than K-valves from the same manufacturer.\n\nLess common in the 1950s to 1970s was an R-valve which was equipped with a restriction that caused breathing to become difficult as the cylinder neared exhaustion, but that would allow less restricted breathing if the diver began to ascend and the ambient water pressure lessened, providing a larger pressure differential over the orifice. It was never particularly popular because if it was necessary for the diver to descend during exit from a cave or wreck, breathing would become progressively more difficult as the diver went deeper, eventually becoming impossible until the diver could ascend to a low enough ambient pressure.\n\nSome cylinder valve models have axial spindles - in line with the cylinder axis, and are not handed. Standard side-spindle valves have the valve knob on the diver's right side when back-mounted. Side-spindle valves used with manifolds must be a handed pair - one with the knob to the right and the other with the knob to the left, but in all cases the valve is opened by turning the knob anticlockwise, and closed by turning it clockwise. This is the convention with almost all valves for all purposes. Left hand side-spindle valves are used by sidemount divers.\n\nSome national standards require that the cylinder valve includes a bursting disk, a pressure relief device that will release the gas before the cylinder fails in the event of overpressurization. If a bursting disk ruptures during a dive the entire contents of the cylinder will be lost in a very short time. The risk of this happening to a correctly rated disc, in good condition, on a correctly filled cylinder is very low.\n\nAdditional components for convenience, protection or other functions, not directly required for the function as a pressure vessel.\n\nA cylinder manifold is a tube which connects two cylinders together so that the contents of both can be supplied to one or more regulators.\nThere are three commonly used configurations of manifold. The oldest type is a tube with a connector on each end which is attached to the cylinder valve outlet, and an outlet connection in the middle, to which the regulator is attached. A variation on this pattern includes a reserve valve at the outlet connector. The cylinders are isolated from the manifold when closed, and the manifold can be attached or disconnected while the cylinders are pressurised.\n\nMore recently, manifolds have become available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder side of the valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, as there is no valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or burst disk on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator. These manifolds can include a reserve valve, either in the main valve or at one cylinder. This system is mainly of historical interest.\n\nAlso known as a manifold cage or regulator cage, this is a structure which can be clamped to the neck of the cylinder or manifolded cylinders to protect the valves and regulator first stages from impact and abrasion damage while in use and from rolling the valve closed by friction of the handwheel against an overhead. A valve cage is often made of stainless steel, and some designs can snag on obstructions.\n\nCylinder bands are straps, usually of stainless steel, which are used to clamp two cylinders together as a twin set. The cylinders may be manifolded or independent. It is usual to use a cylinder band near the top of the cylinder, just below the shoulders, and one lower down. The conventional distance between centrelines for bolting to a backplate is .\n\nA cylinder boot is a hard rubber or plastic cover which fits over the base of a diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, and in the case of round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing in a dry place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.\n\nA cylinder net is a tubular net which is stretched over a cylinder and tied on at top and bottom. The function is to protect the paintwork from scratching, and on booted cylinders it also helps drain the surface between the boot and cylinder, which reduces corrosion problems under the boot. Mesh size is usually about . Some divers will not use boots or nets as they can snag more easily than a bare cylinder and constitute an entrapment hazard in some environments such as caves and the interior of wrecks. Occasionally sleeves made from other materials may be used to protect the cylinder.\n\nA cylinder handle may be fitted, usually clamped to the neck, to conveniently carry the cylinder. This can also increase the risk of snagging in an enclosed environment.\n\nThese are used to cover the cylinder valve orifice when the cylinder is not in use to prevent dust, water or other materials from contaminating the orifice. They can also help prevent the O-ring of a yoke type valve from falling out. The plug may be vented so that the leakage of gas from the cylinder does not pressurise the plug, making it difficult to remove.\n\nThe thickness of the cylinder walls is directly related to the working pressure, and this affects the buoyancy characteristics of the cylinder. A low-pressure cylinder will be more buoyant than a high-pressure cylinder with similar size and proportions of length to diameter and in the same alloy.\n\nScuba cylinders are technically all high-pressure gas containers, but within the industry in the US there are three nominal working pressure ratings (WP) in common use;\nUS-made aluminum cylinders usually have a standard working pressure of , and the compact aluminum range have a working pressure of .\nSome steel cylinders manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed the nominal working pressure by 10%, and this is indicated by a '+' symbol. This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate higher standard periodical hydrostatic test.\n\nThose parts of the world using the metric system usually refer to the cylinder pressure directly in bar but would generally use \"high pressure\" to refer to a working pressure cylinder, which can not be used with a yoke connector on the regulator. 232 bar is a very popular working pressure for scuba cylinders in both steel and aluminium.\n\nHydrostatic test pressure (TP) is specified by the manufacturing standard. This is usually 1.5 × working pressure, or in the USA, 1.67 × working pressure.\n\nCylinder working pressure is specified at a reference temperature, usually 15 °C or 20 °C. and cylinders also have a specified maximum safe working temperature, often 65 °C. The actual pressure in the cylinder will vary with temperature, as described by the gas laws, but this is acceptable in terms of the standards provided that the developed pressure when corrected to the reference temperature does not exceed the specified working pressure stamped on the cylinder. This allows cylinders to be safely and legally filled to a pressure that is higher than the specified working pressure when the filling temperature is greater than the reference temperature, but not more than 65 °C, provided that the filling pressure does not exceed the developed pressure for that temperature, and cylinders filled according to this provision will be at the correct working pressure when cooled to the reference temperature.\n\nThe internal pressure of a diving cylinder is measured at several stages during use. It is checked before filling, monitored during filling and checked when filling is completed. This can all be done with the pressure gauge on the filling equipment.\n\nPressure is also generally monitored by the diver. Firstly as a check of contents before use, then during use to ensure that there is enough left at all times to allow a safe completion of the dive, and often after a dive for purposes of record keeping and personal consumption rate calculation.\n\nThe pressure is also monitored during hydrostatic testing to ensure that the test is done to the correct pressure.\n\nMost diving cylinders do not have a dedicated pressure gauge, but this is a standard feature on most diving regulators, and a requirement on all filling facilities.\n\nThere are two widespread standards for pressure measurement of diving gas. In the USA and perhaps a few other places the pressure is measured in pounds per square inch (psi), and the rest of the world uses bar. Sometimes gauges may be calibrated in other metric units, such as kilopascal (kPa) or megapascal (MPa), or in atmospheres (atm, or ATA), particularly gauges not actually used underwater.\n\nThere are two commonly used conventions for describing the capacity of a diving cylinder. One is based on the internal volume of the cylinder. The other is based on nominal volume of gas stored.\n\nThe internal volume is commonly quoted in most countries using the metric system. This information is required by ISO 13769 to be stamped on the cylinder shoulder. It can be measured easily by filling the cylinder with fresh water. This has resulted in the term 'water capacity', abbreviated as WC which is often stamp marked on the cylinder shoulder. It's almost always expressed as a volume in litres, but sometimes as mass of the water in kg. Fresh water has a density close to one kilogram per litre so the numerical values are effectively identical at one decimal place accuracy.\n\nThese are representative examples, for a larger range, the on-line catalogues of the manufacturers such as Faber, Pressed Steel, Luxfer, and Catalina may be consulted. The applications are typical, but not exclusive.\n\nThe nominal volume of gas stored is commonly quoted as the cylinder capacity in the USA. It is a measure of the volume of gas that can be released from the full cylinder at atmospheric pressure. Terms used for the capacity include 'free gas volume' or 'free gas equivalent'. It depends on the internal volume and the working pressure of a cylinder. If the working pressure is higher, the cylinder will store more gas for the same volume.\n\nThe nominal working pressure is not necessarily the same as the actual working pressure used. Some steel cylinders manufactured to US standards are permitted to exceed the nominal working pressure by 10% and this is indicated by a '+' symbol. This extra pressure allowance is dependent on the cylinder passing the appropriate periodical hydrostatic test and is not necessarily valid for US cylinders exported to countries with differing standards. The nominal gas content of these cylinders is based on the 10% higher pressure.\n\nFor example, common Aluminum 80 (Al80) cylinder is an aluminum cylinder which has a nominal 'free gas' capacity of when pressurized to . It has an internal volume of .\n\n\nDivers may carry one cylinder or multiples, depending on the requirements of the dive. Where diving takes place in low risk areas, where the diver may safely make a free ascent, or where a buddy is available to provide an alternative air supply in an emergency, recreational divers usually carry only one cylinder. Where diving risks are higher, for example where the visibility is low or when recreational divers do deeper or decompression diving, and particularly when diving under an overhead, divers routinely carry more than one gas source.\n\nDiving cylinders may serve different purposes. One or two cylinders may be used as a primary breathing source which is intended to be breathed from for most of the dive. A smaller cylinder carried in addition to a larger cylinder is called a \"pony bottle\". A cylinder to be used purely as an independent safety reserve is called a \"bailout bottle\" or Emergency Gas Supply (EGS). A pony bottle is commonly used as a bailout bottle, but this would depend on the time required to surface.\n\nDivers doing technical diving often carry different gases, each in a separate cylinder, for each phase of the dive:\n\nFor safety, divers sometimes carry an additional independent scuba cylinder with its own regulator to mitigate out-of-air emergencies should the primary breathing gas supply fail. For much common recreational diving where a controlled emergency swimming ascent is acceptably safe, this extra equipment is not needed or used. This extra cylinder is known as a bail-out cylinder, and may be carried in several ways, and can be any size that can hold enough gas to get the diver safely back to the surface.\n\nFor open-circuit scuba divers, there are several options for the combined cylinder and regulator system:\n\n\n\n\n\nDiving cylinders are used in rebreather diving in two roles:\n\n\n\nSurface supplied divers are usually required to carry an emergency gas supply sufficient to allow them to return to a place of safety if the main gas supply fails. The usual configuration is a back mounted single cylinder supported by the diver's safety harness, with first stage regulator connected by a low-pressure hose to a bailout block, which may be mounted on the side of the helmet or band-mask or on the harness to supply a lightweight full-face mask. Where the capacity of a single cylinder in insufficient, plain manifolded twins or a rebreather may be used. For closed bell bounce and saturation dives the bailout set must be compact enough to allow the diver to pass through the bottom hatch of the bell. This sets a limit on the size of cylinders that can be used.\n\nDiving bells are required to carry an onboard supply of breathing gas for use in emergencies. The cylinders are mounted externally as there is insufficient space inside. They are fully immersed in the water during bell operations, and may be considered diving cylinders.\n\nSuit inflation gas may be carried in a small independent cylinder. Sometimes argon is used for superior insulation properties. This must be clearly labelled and may also need to be colour coded to avoid inadvertent use as a breathing gas, which could be fatal as argon is an asphyxiant.\n\nDivers also use gas cylinders above water for storage of oxygen for first aid treatment of diving disorders and as part of storage \"banks\" for diving air compressor stations, gas blending, surface supplied breathing gas and gas supplies for decompression chambers and saturation systems. Similar cylinders are also used for many purposes not connected to diving. For these applications they are not diving cylinders and may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as cylinders used underwater.\n\nIt is necessary to know the approximate length of time that a diver can breathe from a given cylinder so that a safe dive profile can be planned.\n\nThere are two parts to this problem: The cylinder and the diver.\n\nTwo features of the cylinder determine its gas carrying capacity:\n\n\nTo calculate the quantity of gas:\n\nIn those parts of the world using the metric system the calculation is relatively simple as atmospheric pressure may be approximated as 1 bar,\nSo a 12-litre cylinder at 232 bar would hold almost 12 × 232 / 1 =  of air at atmospheric pressure (also known as free air).\n\nIn the US the capacity of a diving cylinder is specified directly in cubic feet of free air at the nominal working pressure, as the calculation from internal volume and working pressure is relatively tedious in imperial units. For example, in the US and in many diving resorts in other countries, one might find aluminum cylinders of US manufacture with an internal capacity of filled to a working pressure of ; Taking atmospheric pressure as 14.7 psi, this gives 0.39 × 3000 / 14.7 = 80 ft³ These cylinders are described as \"80 cubic foot cylinders\", (the common \"aluminum 80\").\n\nUp to about 200 bar the ideal gas law remains valid and the relationship between the pressure, size of the cylinder and gas contained in the cylinder is linear; at higher pressures there is proportionally less gas in the cylinder. A 3-litre cylinder filled to 300 bar will only carry contain of atmospheric pressure gas and not the expected from the ideal gas law.\n\nThere are three main factors to consider:\n\nTo calculate the quantity of gas consumed:\n\nMetric examples:\n\nImperial examples:\n\nKeeping this in mind, it is not hard to see why technical divers who do long deep dives require multiple cylinders or rebreathers, and commercial divers normally use surface-supplied diving equipment, and only carry scuba as an emergency gas supply.\n\nThe amount of time that a diver can breathe from a cylinder is also known as air or gas endurance.\n\nMaximum breathing duration (T) for a given depth can be calculated as\n\nwhich, using the ideal gas law, is\n\nThis may be written as\n\nwith\n\nin any consistent system of units.\n\nAmbient pressure (P) is the surrounding water pressure at a given depth and is made up of the sum of the hydrostatic pressure and the air pressure at the surface. It is calculated as\n\nwith\n\nin a consistent system of units\n\nFor metric units, this formula can be approximated by\n\nwith depth in m and pressure in bar\n\nAmbient pressure is deducted from cylinder pressure, as the quantity of air represented by P can in practice not be used for breathing by the diver as it required to balance the ambient pressure of the water.\n\nThis formula neglects the cracking pressure required to open both first and second stages of the regulator, and pressure drop due to flow restrictions in the regulator, both of which are variable depending on the design and adjustment of the regulator, and flow rate, which depends on the breathing pattern of the diver and the gas in use. These factors are not easily estimated, so the calculated value for breathing duration will be more than the real value.\n\nHowever, in normal diving usage, a reserve is always factored in. The reserve is a proportion of the cylinder pressure which a diver will not plan to use other than in case of emergency. The reserve may be a quarter or a third of the cylinder pressure or it may be a fixed pressure, common examples are 50 bar and 500 psi. The formula above is then modified to give the usable breathing duration as\n\nwhere P is the reserve pres\n\nFor example, (using the first formula (1) for absolute maximum breathing time), a diver at a depth of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020 kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.\n\nUsing the same conditions and a reserve of 50 bar, the formula (4) for usable breathing time is follows:\n\nThis would give a dive time of 54 min at 15 m before reaching the reserve of 50 bar.\n\nIt is strongly recommended by diver training organisations and codes of practice that a portion of the usable gas of the cylinder be held aside as a safety reserve. The reserve is designed to provide gas for longer than planned decompression stops or to provide time to resolve underwater emergencies.\n\nThe size of the reserve depends upon the risks involved during the dive. A deep or decompression dive warrants a greater reserve than a shallow or a no stop dive. In recreational diving for example, it is recommended that the diver plans to surface with a reserve remaining in the cylinder of 500 psi, 50 bar or 25% of the initial capacity, depending of the teaching of the diver training organisation. This is because recreational divers practicing within \"no-decompression\" limits can normally make a direct ascent in an emergency. On technical dives where a direct ascent is either impossible (due to overhead obstructions) or dangerous (due to the requirement to make decompression stops), divers plan larger margins of safety. The simplest method uses the rule of thirds: one third of the gas supply is planned for the outward journey, one third is for the return journey and one third is a safety reserve.\n\nSome training agencies teach the concept of minimum gas, rock bottom gas management or critical pressures which allows a diver to calculate an acceptable reserve to get two divers to the surface in an emergency from any point in the planned dive profile.\n\nProfessional divers may be required by legislation or industry codes of practice to carry sufficient reserve gas to enable them to reach a place of safety, such as the surface, or a diving bell, based on the planned dive profile. This reserve gas is usually required to be carried as an independent emergency gas supply (EGS), also known as a bailout cylinder, set or bottle. This usually also applies to professional divers using surface-supplied diving equipment.\n\nThe density of air at sea level and 15 °C is approximately 1.225 kg/m. Most full-sized diving cylinders used for open circuit scuba hold more than of air when full, and as the air is used, the buoyancy of the cylinder increases by the weight removed. The decrease in external volume of the cylinder due to reduction of internal pressure is relatively small, and can be ignored for practical purposes.\n\nAs an example, a 12-litre cylinder may be filled to 230 bar before a dive, and be breathed down to 30 bar before surfacing, using 2,400 litres or 2.4 m of free air. The mass of gas used during the dive will depend on the mixture - if air is assumed, it will be approximately .\n\nThe loss of the weight of the gas taken from the cylinder makes the cylinder and diver more buoyant. This can be a problem if the diver is unable to remain neutrally buoyant towards the end of the dive because most of the gas has been breathed from the cylinder. The buoyancy change due to gas usage from back mounted cylinders is easily compensated by carrying sufficient diving weights to provide neutral buoyancy with empty cylinders at the end of a dive, and using the buoyancy compensator to neutralise the excess weight until the gas has been used.\n\nThe change in buoyancy of a diving cylinder during the dive can be more problematic with side-mounted cylinders, and the actual buoyancy at any point during the dive is a consideration with any cylinder that may be separated from the diver for any reason. Cylinders which will be stage-dropped or handed off to another diver should not change the diver's buoyancy beyond what can be compensated using their buoyancy compensator. Cylinders with approximately neutral buoyancy when full generally require the least compensation when detached.\n\nDiving cylinders are filled by attaching a high-pressure gas supply to the cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to flow into the cylinder until the desired pressure is reached, then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, both of which are hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.\n\nBreathing air supply can come directly from a high-pressure breathing air compressor, from a high-pressure storage system, or from a combined storage system with compressor. Direct charging is energy intensive, and the charge rate will be limited by the available power source and capacity of the compressor. A large-volume bank of high-pressure storage cylinders allows faster charging or simultaneous charging of multiple cylinders, and allows for provision of more economical high-pressure air by recharging the storage banks from a low-power compressor, or using lower cost off-peak electrical power.\n\nThe quality of compressed breathing air for diving is usually specified by national or organisational standards, and the steps generally taken to assure the air quality include:\n\nCylinders may also be filled directly from high-pressure storage systems by decanting, with or without pressure boosting to reach the desired charging pressure.\nCascade filling may be used for efficiency when multiple storage cylinders are available. High-pressure storage is commonly used when blending nitrox, heliox and trimix diving gases, and for oxygen for rebreathers and decompression gas.\n\nNitrox and trimix blending may include decanting the oxygen and/or helium, and topping up to working pressure using a compressor, after which the gas mixture must be analysed and the cylinder labeled with the gas composition.\n\nCompression of ambient air causes a temperature rise of the gas, proportional to the pressure increase. Ambient air is typically compressed in stages, and the gas temperature rises during each stage. Intercoolers and water cooling heat exchangers can remove this heat between stages.\n\nCharging an empty dive cylinder also causes a temperature rise as the gas inside the cylinder is compressed by the inflow of higher pressure gas, though this temperature rise may initially be tempered because compressed gas from a storage bank at room temperature decreases in temperature when it decreases in pressure, so at first the empty cylinder is charged with cold gas, but the temperature of the gas in the cylinder then increases to above ambient as the cylinder fills to the working pressure.\n\nExcess heat can be removed by immersion of the cylinder in a cold water bath while filling. However, immersion for cooling can also increase the risk of water contaminating the valve orifice of a completely depressurized tank and being blown into the cylinder during filling.\n\nCylinders may also be filled without water-bath cooling, and may be charged to above the nominal working pressure to the developed pressure appropriate to the temperature when filled. As the gas cools to ambient temperature, the pressure decreases, and will reach rated charging pressure at the rated temperature.\n\nLegal constraints to filling scuba cylinders will vary by jurisdiction.\n\nIn South Africa cylinders may be filled for commercial purposes by a person who is competent in the use of the filling equipment to be used, who knows the relevant sections of the applicable standards and regulations, and has written permission from the owner of the cylinder to fill it. The cylinder must be in test and suitable for the gas to be filled, and the cylinder may not be filled above the developed pressure for the temperature reached when it is filled. An external inspection of the cylinder must be made, and specified details of the cylinder and fill must be recorded. If the fill is of a gas other than air, the analysis of the completed fill must be recorded by the filler and signed by the customer. If the residual pressure in a cylinder presented for filling does not produce a reasonably strong flow of gas from the valve when opened the filler may refuse to fill the cylinder unless an acceptable reason is given for it being empty, as there is no way for the filler to check if it has been contaminated.\n\nDiving cylinders should only be filled with suitably filtered air from diving air compressors or with other breathing gases using gas blending or decanting techniques. In some jurisdictions, suppliers of breathing gases are required by legislation to periodically test the quality of compressed air produced by their equipment and to display the test results for public information. The standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures may allow some contaminants at levels unsafe for breathing, and their use in breathing gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal.\n\nSpecial precautions need to be taken with gases other than air:\n\nSpecialty mixed gas charging will almost always involve supply cylinders of high purity gas sourced from an industrial gas supplier.\n\nContaminated breathing gas at depth can be fatal. Concentrations which are acceptable at the surface ambient pressure will be increased by the pressure of depth and may then exceed acceptable or tolerable limits. Common contaminants are: carbon monoxide - a by-product of combustion, carbon dioxide - a product of metabolism, and oil and lubricants from the compressor.\n\nKeeping the cylinder slightly pressurized at all times during storage and transportation reduces the possibility of inadvertently contaminating the inside of the cylinder with corrosive agents, such as sea water, or toxic material, such as oils, poisonous gases, fungi or bacteria. A normal dive will end with some pressure remaining in the cylinder; if an emergency ascent has been made due to an out-of-gas incident, the cylinder will normally still contain some pressure and unless the cylinder had been submerged deeper than where the last gas was used it is not possible for water to get in during the dive.\n\nContamination by water during filling may be due to two causes. Inadequate filtration and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have dripped from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly to the extent that it may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.\n\nThe blast caused by a sudden release of the gas pressure inside a diving cylinder makes them very dangerous if mismanaged. The greatest risk of explosion exists while filling, but cylinders have also been known to burst when overheated. The cause of failure can range from reduced wall thickness or deep pitting due to internal corrosion, neck thread failure due to incompatible valve threads, or cracking due to fatigue, sustained high stresses, or overheating effects in aluminum.\nTank bursting due to overpressure may be prevented by a pressure-relief burst disc fitted to the cylinder valve, which bursts if the cylinder is overpressurised and vents air at a rapid controlled rate to prevent catastrophic tank failure. Accidental rupture of the burst disc can also occur during filling, due to corrosive weakening or stress from repeated pressurization cycles, but is remedied by replacement of the disc. Bursting discs are not required in all jurisdictions.\n\nOther failure modes that are a hazard while filling include valve thread failure, which can cause the valve to blow out of the cylinder neck, and filling whip failure.\n\nMost countries require diving cylinders to be checked on a regular basis. This usually consists of an internal visual inspection and a hydrostatic test. The inspection and testing requirements for scuba cylinders may be very different from the requirements for other compressed gas containers due to the more corrosive environment.\nA hydrostatic test involves pressurising the cylinder to its test pressure (usually 5/3 or 3/2 of the working pressure) and measuring its volume before and after the test. A permanent increase in volume above the tolerated level means the cylinder fails the test and must be permanently removed from service.\n\nAn inspection includes external and internal inspection for damage, corrosion, and correct colour and markings. The failure criteria vary according to the published standards of the relevant authority, but may include inspection for bulges, overheating, dents, gouges, electrical arc scars, pitting, line corrosion, general corrosion, cracks, thread damage, defacing of permanent markings, and colour coding.\n\nWhen a cylinder is manufactured, its specification, including \"manufacturer\", \"working pressure\", \"test pressure\", \"date of manufacture\", \"capacity\" and \"weight\" are stamped on the cylinder. After a cylinder passes the test, the test date, (or the test expiry date in some countries such as Germany), is punched into the shoulder of the cylinder for easy verification at fill time. The international standard for the stamp format is \"ISO 13769, Gas cylinders - Stamp marking\".\n\nFilling station operators may be required to check these details before filling the cylinder and may refuse to fill non-standard or out-of-test cylinders. \n\nA cylinder is due to be inspected and tested at the first time it is to be filled after the expiry of the interval as specified by the United Nations \"Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, Model Regulations\", or as specified by national or international standards applicable in the region of use.\n\n\nIf a cylinder passes the listed procedures, but the condition remains doubtful, further tests can be applied to ensure that the cylinder is fit for use. Cylinders that fail the tests or inspection and cannot be fixed should be rendered unserviceable after notifying the owner of the reason for failure.\nBefore starting work the cylinder must be identified from the labelling and permanent stamp markings, and the ownership and contents verified, and the valve must be removed after depressurising and verifying that the valve is open. Cylinders containing breathing gases do not need special precautions for discharge except that high oxygen fraction gases should not be released in an enclosed space because of the fire hazard. Before inspection the cylinder must be clean and free of loose coatings, corrosion products and other materials which may obscure the surface.\n\nThe cylinder is inspected externally for dents, cracks, gouges, cuts, bulges, laminations and excessive wear, heat damage, torch or electric arc burns, corrosion damage, illegible, incorrect or unauthorised permanent stamp markings, and unauthorised additions or modifications. Unless the cylinder walls are examined by ultrasonic methods, the interior must be visually inspected using sufficient illumination to identify any damage and defects, particularly corrosion. If the inner surface is not clearly visible it should first be cleaned by an approved method which does not remove a significant amount of wall material. When there is uncertainty whether a defect found during visual inspection meets the rejection criteria, additional tests may be applied, such as ultrasonic measurement of pitting wall thickness, or weight checks to establish total weight lost to corrosion.\n\nWhile the valve is off, the threads of cylinder and valve are checked to identify the thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves that are to be reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted.\n\nAfter the tests have been satisfactorily completed, a cylinder passing the test will be marked accordingly. Stamp marking will include the registered mark of the inspection facility and the date of testing (month and year). Records of a periodic inspection and test are made by the test station and kept available for inspection. These include: If a cylinder fails inspection or testing and cannot be recovered, the owner must be notified before making the empty cylinder unserviceable.\n\nInternal cleaning of diving cylinders may be required to remove contaminants or to allow effective visual inspection. Cleaning methods should remove contaminants and corrosion products without undue removal of structural metal. Chemical cleaning using solvents, detergents and pickling agents may be used depending on the contaminant and cylinder material. Tumbling with abrasive media may be needed for heavy contamination, particularly of heavy corrosion products.\n\nExternal cleaning may also be required to remove contaminants, corrosion products or old paint or other coatings. Methods which remove the minimum amount of structural material are indicated. Solvents, detergents and bead blasting are generally used. Removal of coatings by the application of heat may render the cylinder unserviceable by affecting the crystalline microstructure structure of the metal. This is a particular hazard for aluminium alloy cylinders, which may not be exposed to temperatures above those stipulated by the manufacturer.\n\nBefore any cylinder is filled, verification of inspection and testing dates and a visual examination for external damage and corrosion are required by law in some jurisdictions, and are prudent even if not legally required at other places. Inspection dates can be checked by looking at the visual inspection label and the hydrostatic test date is stamped on the shoulder of the cylinder.\n\nBefore use the user should verify the contents of the cylinder and check the function of the cylinder valve. This is usually done with a regulator connected to control the flow. Pressure and gas mixture are critical information for the diver, and the valve should open freely without sticking or leaking from the spindle seals. Failure to recognize that the cylinder valve was not opened or that a cylinder was empty has been observed in divers conducting a pre-dive check. Breathing gas bled from a cylinder may be checked for smell. If the gas does not smell right it should not be used. Breathing gas should be almost free of smell, though a very slight aroma of the compressor lubricant is fairly common. No smell of combustion products or volatile hydrocarbons should be discernible. \n\nA neatly assembled setup, with regulators, gauges, and delicate computers stowed inside the BCD, or clipped where they will not be walked on, and stowed under the boat bench or secured to a rack, is the practice of a competent diver.\n\nAs the scuba set is a life support system, no unauthorised person should touch a diver's assembled scuba gear, even to move it, without their knowledge and approval.\n\nFull cylinders should not be exposed to temperatures above 65 °C and cylinders should not be filled to pressures greater than the developed pressure appropriate to the certified working pressure of the cylinder.\n\nCylinders should be clearly labelled with their current contents. A generic \"Nitrox\" or \"Trimix\" label will alert the user that the contents may not be air, and must be analysed before use. In some parts of the world a label is required specifically indicating that the contents are air, and in other places a colour code without additional labels indicates by default that the contents are air.\n\nIn a fire, the pressure in a gas cylinder rises in direct proportion to its absolute temperature. If the internal pressure exceeds the mechanical limitations of the cylinder and there are no means to safely vent the pressurized gas to the atmosphere, the vessel will fail mechanically. If the vessel contents are ignitable or a contaminant is present this event may result in an explosion.\n\nThe major diving accident and fatality research studies that have been conducted globally including work by the Divers Alert Network, the Diving Incident Monitoring Study, and Project Stickybeak have each identified cases where the mortality was associated with the diving cylinder.\n\nSome recorded accidents associated with diving cylinders:\n\nCases of lateral epicondylitis have been reported caused by the handling of diving cylinders.\n\nCylinders should not be left standing unattended unless secured so that they can not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to the surroundings.\n\nBreathing quality gases do not normally deteriorate during storage in steel or aluminium cylinders. Provided there is insufficient water content to promote internal corrosion, the stored gas will remain unchanged for years if stored at temperatures within the allowed working range for the cylinder, usually below 65 °C. If there is any doubt, a check of oxygen fraction will indicate whether the gas has changed (the other components are inert). Any unusual smells would be an indication that the cylinder or gas was contaminated at the time of filling. However some authorities recommend releasing most of the contents and storing cylinders with a small positive pressure.\n\nAluminium cylinders have a low tolerance for heat, and a cylinder containing less than may lose sufficient strength in a fire to explode before the internal pressure rises enough to rupture the bursting disc, so storing aluminium cylinders with a bursting disc has a lower explosion risk in case of fire if stored either full or nearly empty.\n\nDiving cylinders are classified by the UN as dangerous goods for transportation purposes (US: Hazardous materials). Selecting the Proper Shipping Name (well known by the abbreviation PSN) is a way to help ensure that the dangerous goods offered for transport accurately represent the hazards.\n\nIATA Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) 55th Edition defines the Proper Shipping Name as \"the name to be used to describe a particular article or substance in all shipping documents and notifications and, where appropriate, on packagings\".\n\nThe International Maritime Dangerous Goods Code (IMDG Code) defines the Proper Shipping Name as \"that portion of the entry most accurately describing the goods in the Dangerous Goods List which is shown in upper-case characters (plus any letters which form an integral part of the name).\"\n\nInternational Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air states that provided that pressure in diving cylinders is less than , these can be carried as checked in or carry-on baggage. It maybe necessary to empty the cylinder to verify this. Once emptied, the cylinder valve should be closed to prevent moisture entering the cylinder. Security restrictions implemented by individual countries may further limit or forbid the carriage of some items permitted by ICAO, and airlines and security screening agencies have the right to refuse the carriage of certain items.\n\nSince 1996 the carriage of dangerous goods legislation of the UK has been harmonized with that of Europe.\n\nRoad transport\n\nThe 2009 (amended 2011) UK Carriage of Dangerous Goods and Use of Transportable Pressure Equipment Regulations (CDG Regulations) implement the European Agreement Concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road (ADR). Dangerous goods to be carried internationally in road vehicles must comply with standards for the packaging and labelling of the dangerous goods, and appropriate construction and operating standards for the vehicles and crew.\n\nThe regulations cover transportation of gas cylinders in a vehicle in a commercial environment. Transportation of pressurised diving gas cylinders with a combined water capacity of less than 1000 litres on a vehicle for personal use is exempt from ADR.\n\nTransport of gas cylinders in a vehicle, for commercial purposes, must follow basic legal safety requirements and, unless specifically exempted, must comply with ADR. The driver of the vehicle is legally responsible for the safety of the vehicle and any load being carried, and insurance for the vehicle should include cover for the carriage of dangerous goods.\n\nDiving gases, including compressed air, oxygen, nitrox, heliox, trimix, helium and argon, are non-toxic, non flammable, and may be oxidizer or asphyxiant, and are rated in Transport category 3.\nThe threshold quantity for these gases is 1000 litres combined water capacity of the cylinders. Pressure must be within the rated working pressure of the cylinder.\nEmpty air cylinders at atmospheric pressure are rated in Transport category 4, and there is no threshold quantity.\n\nCommercial loads below the 1000 litres threshold level are exempt from some of the requirements of ADR, but must comply with basic legal and safety requirements, including:\n\nAll loads above the threshold must comply with the full requirements of ADR.\n\nTransportation of hazardous materials for commercial purposes in the USA is regulated by Code of Federal Regulations Title 49 - Transportation, (abbreviated 49 CFR). A cylinder containing 200 kPa (29.0 psig/43.8 psia) or greater at 20 °C (68 °F) of non-flammable, nonpoisonous compressed gas, and being transported for commercial purposes is classified as HAZMAT (hazardous materials) in terms of 49 CFR 173.115(b) (1). Cylinders manufactured to DOT standards or special permits (exemptions)issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration and filled to the authorized working pressure are legal for commercial transport in the USA under the provisions and conditions of the regulations. Cylinders manufactured outside the USA may be transported under a special permit, and these have been issued for solid metal and composite cylinders with working pressures of up to 300 bar (4400 psi) by several manufacturers.\n\nSurface transport\n\nCommercial transportation of breathing gas cylinders with a combined weight of more than 1000 pounds may only be done by a commercial HAZMAT transportation company. Transport of cylinders with a combined weight of less than 1000 pounds requires a manifest, the cylinders must have been tested and inspected to federal standards, and the contents marked on each cylinder. Transportation must be done in a safe manner, with the cylinders restrained from movement. No special licence is required. DOT regulations require content labels for all cylinders under the regulations, but according to PSI, labelling of breathing air will not be enforced. Oxygen or non-air oxidizing (O ≥ 23.5% ) mixtures must be labelled. Private (non-commercial) transport of scuba cylinders is not covered by this regulation.\n\nAir transport\n\nEmpty scuba tanks or scuba tanks pressurized at less than 200 kPa are not restricted as hazardous materials. Scuba cylinders are only allowed in checked baggage or as a carry-on if the cylinder valve is completely disconnected from the cylinder and the cylinder has an open end to allow for a visual inspection inside.\n\nThe colours permitted for diving cylinders vary considerably by region, and to some extent by the gas mixture contained. In some parts of the world there is no legislation controlling the colour of diving cylinders. In other regions the colour of cylinders used for commercial diving, or for all underwater diving may be specified by national standards.\n\nIn many recreational diving settings where air and nitrox are the widely used gases, nitrox cylinders are identified with a green stripe on yellow background. Aluminium diving cylinders may be painted or anodized and when anodized may be coloured or left in their natural silver. Steel diving cylinders are usually painted, to reduce corrosion, often yellow or white to increase visibility. In some industrial cylinder identification colour tables, yellow shoulders means chlorine and more generally within Europe it refers to cylinders with toxic and/or corrosive contents; but this is of no significance in scuba since gas fittings would not be compatible.\n\nCylinders that are used for partial pressure gas blending with pure oxygen may also be required to display an \"oxygen service certificate\" label indicating they have been prepared for use with high partial pressures and gas fractions of oxygen.\n\nIn the European Union gas cylinders may be colour-coded according to EN 1098-3. In the UK this standard is optional. The \"shoulder\" is the domed top of the cylinder between the parallel section and the pillar valve. For mixed gases, the colours can be either bands or \"quarters\".\n\n\nThese breathing gas cylinders must also be labeled with their contents. The label should state the type of breathing gas contained by the cylinder.\n\nBreathing gas containers for offshore use may be coded and marked according to IMCA D043. IMCA colour coding for individual cylinders allows the body of the cylinder to be any colour that is not likely to cause misinterpretation of the hazard identified by the colour code of the shoulder.\n\nScuba cylinders are required to comply with the colours and markings specified in SANS 10019:2006.\n\n",
                "Decompression practice\n\nThe practice of decompression by divers comprises the planning and monitoring of the profile indicated by the algorithms or tables of the chosen decompression model, to allow asymptomatic and harmless release of excess inert gases dissolved in the tissues as a result of breathing at ambient pressures greater than surface atmospheric pressure, the equipment available and appropriate to the circumstances of the dive, and the procedures authorized for the equipment and profile to be used. There is a large range of options in all of these aspects.\n\nDecompression may be continuous or staged, where the ascent is interrupted by stops at regular depth intervals, but the entire ascent is part of the decompression, and ascent rate can be critical to harmless elimination of inert gas. What is commonly known as no-decompression diving, or more accurately no-stop decompression, relies on limiting ascent rate for avoidance of excessive bubble formation. Staged decompression may include deep stops depending on the theoretical model used for calculating the ascent schedule. Omission of decompression theoretically required for a dive profile exposes the diver to significantly higher risk of symptomatic decompression sickness, and in severe cases, serious injury or death. The risk is related to the severity of exposure and the level of supersaturation of tissues in the diver. Procedures for emergency management of omitted decompression and symptomatic decompression sickness have been published. These procedures are generally effective, but vary in effectiveness from case to case.\n\nThe procedures used for decompression depend on the mode of diving, the available equipment, the site and environment, and the actual dive profile. Standardized procedures have been developed which provide an acceptable level of risk in the circumstances for which they are appropriate. Different sets of procedures are used by commercial, military, scientific and recreational divers, though there is considerable overlap where similar equipment is used, and some concepts are common to all decompression procedures.\n\nDecompression in the context of diving derives from the reduction in ambient pressure experienced by the diver during the ascent at the end of a dive or hyperbaric exposure and refers to both the reduction in pressure and the process of allowing dissolved inert gases to be eliminated from the tissues during this reduction in pressure. When a diver descends in the water column the ambient pressure rises. Breathing gas is supplied at the same pressure as the surrounding water, and some of this gas dissolves into the diver's blood and other fluids. Inert gas continues to be taken up until the gas dissolved in the diver is in a state of equilibrium with the breathing gas in the diver's lungs, (see: \"Saturation diving\"), or the diver moves up in the water column and reduces the ambient pressure of the breathing gas until the inert gases dissolved in the tissues are at a higher concentration than the equilibrium state, and start diffusing out again. Dissolved inert gases such as nitrogen or helium can form bubbles in the blood and tissues of the diver if the partial pressures of the dissolved gases in the diver gets too high above the ambient pressure. These bubbles and products of injury caused by the bubbles can cause damage to tissues known as decompression sickness, or \"the bends\". The immediate goal of controlled decompression is to avoid development of symptoms of bubble formation in the tissues of the diver, and the long-term goal is to also avoid complications due to sub-clinical decompression injury.\n\nThe descent, bottom time and ascent are sectors common to all dives and hyperbaric exposures.\n\nDescent rate is generally allowed for in decompression planning by assuming a maximum descent rate specified in the instructions for the use of the tables, but it is not critical. Descent slower than the nominal rate reduces useful bottom time, but has no other adverse effect. Descent faster than the specified maximum will expose the diver to greater ingassing rate earlier in the dive, and the bottom time must be reduced accordingly. In the case of real-time monitoring by dive computer, descent rate is not specified, as the consequences are automatically accounted for by the programmed algorithm.\n\nBottom time is the time spent at depth before starting the ascent. Bottom time used for decompression planning may be defined differently depending on the tables or algorithm used. It may include descent time, but not in all cases. It is important to check how bottom time is defined for the tables before they are used. For example, tables using Bühlmann's algorithm define bottom time as the elapsed time between leaving the surface and the start of the \"final\" ascent \"at 10 metres per minute\", and if the ascent rate is slower, then the whole of the ascent time needs to be considered part of the bottom time for the algorithm to remain safe.\n\nThe ascent is an important part of the process of decompression, as this is the time when reduction of ambient pressure occurs, and it is of critical importance to safe decompression that the ascent rate is compatible with safe elimination of inert gas from the diver's tissues. Ascent rate must be limited to prevent supersaturation of tissues to the extent that unacceptable bubble development occurs. This is usually done by specifying a maximum ascent rate compatible with the decompression model chosen. This will be specified in the decompression tables or the user manual for the decompression software or personal decompression computer. The instructions will usually include contingency procedures for deviation from the specified rate, both for delays and exceeding the recommended rate. Failure to comply with these specifications will generally increase the risk of decompression sickness.\n\nTypically maximum ascent rates are in the order of per minute for dives deeper than . Some dive computers have variable maximum ascent rates, depending on depth. Ascent rates slower than the recommended standard for the algorithm will generally be treated by a computer as part of a multilevel dive profile and the decompression requirement adjusted accordingly. Faster ascent rates will elicit a warning and additional decompression stop time to compensate.\n\nA \"no decompression\", or \"no stop\" dive is a dive that needs no decompression stops during the ascent according to the chosen algorithm or tables, and relies on a controlled ascent rate for the elimination of excess inert gases. In effect, the diver is doing continuous decompression during the ascent.\n\nAs a precaution against any unnoticed dive computer malfunction, diver error or physiological predisposition to decompression sickness, many divers do an extra \"safety stop\" in addition to those prescribed by their dive computer or tables. A safety stop is typically 1 to 5 minutes at . They are usually done during no-stop dives and may be added to the obligatory decompression on staged dives. Many dive computers indicate a recommended safety stop as standard procedure for dives beyond specific limits of depth and time. The Goldman decompression model predicts a significant risk reduction following a safety stop on a low-risk dive\n\nThe no decompression limit (NDL) or no stop time, is the interval that a diver may theoretically spend at a given depth without having to perform decompression stops. The NDL helps divers plan dives so that they can stay at a given depth and ascend without stopping while avoiding unacceptable risk of decompression sickness.\n\nThe NDL is a theoretical time obtained by calculating inert gas uptake and release in the body, using a model such as the Bühlmann decompression algorithm. Although the science of calculating these limits has been refined over the last century, there is still much that is unknown about how inert gases enter and leave the human body. In addition, every individual's body is unique and may absorb and release inert gases at different rates. For this reason, dive tables typically have a degree of safety built into their recommendations. Divers can and do suffer decompression sickness while remaining inside NDLs, though the incidence is very low.\nEach NDL for a range of depths is printed on dive tables in a grid that can be used to plan dives. There are many different tables available as well as software programs and calculators, which will calculate no decompression limits. Most personal decompression computers (dive computers) will indicate a remaining no decompression limit at the current depth during a dive. The displayed interval is continuously revised to take into account changes of depth as well as elapsed time.\n\nContinuous decompression is decompression without stops. Instead of a fairly rapid ascent rate to the first stop, followed by a period at static depth during the stop, the ascent is slower, but without officially stopping. In theory this is the optimum decompression profile. In practice this is very difficult to do manually, and it may be necessary to stop the ascent occasionally to get back on schedule, but these stops are not part of the schedule, they are corrections. For example, USN treatment table 5, referring to treatment in a decompression chamber for type 1 decompression sickness, states \"Descent rate - 20 ft/min. Ascent rate - Not to exceed 1 ft/min. Do not compensate for slower ascent rates. Compensate for faster rates by halting the ascent.\"\n\nTo further complicate the practice, the ascent rate may vary with the depth, and is typically faster at greater depth and reduces as the depth gets shallower. In practice a continuous decompression profile may be approximated by ascent in steps as small as the chamber pressure gauge will resolve, and timed to follow the theoretical profile as closely as conveniently practicable. For example, USN treatment table 7 (which may be used if decompression sickness has reoccurred during initial treatment in the compression chamber) states \"Decompress with stops every 2 feet for times shown in profile below.\" The profile shows an ascent rate of 2 fsw every 40 min from 60 fsw (feet of sea water) to 40 fsw, followed by 2 ft every hour from 40 fsw to 20 fsw and 2 ft every two hours from 20 fsw to 4 fsw.\n\nDecompression which follows the procedure of relatively fast ascent interrupted by periods at constant depth is known as staged decompression. The ascent rate and the depth and duration of the stops are integral parts of the decompression process. The advantage of staged decompression is that it is far easier to monitor and control than continuous decompression.\n\nA decompression stop is a period a diver must spend at a relatively shallow constant depth during ascent after a dive to safely eliminate absorbed inert gases from the body tissues to avoid decompression sickness. The practice of making decompression stops is called staged decompression, as opposed to continuous decompression.\n\nThe diver identifies the requirement for decompression stops, and if they are needed, the depths and durations of the stops, by using decompression tables, software planning tools or a dive computer.\n\nThe ascent is made at the recommended rate until the diver reaches the depth of the first stop. The diver then maintains the specified stop depth for the specified period, before ascending to the next stop depth at the recommended rate, and follows the same procedure again. This is repeated until all required decompression has been completed and the diver reaches the surface.\n\nOnce on the surface the diver will continue to eliminate inert gas until the concentrations have returned to normal surface saturation, which can take several hours, and is considered in some models to be effectively complete after 12 hours, and by others to take up to, or even more than 24 hours.\n\nThe depth and duration of each stop is calculated to reduce the inert gas excess in the most critical tissues to a concentration which will allow further ascent without unacceptable risk. Consequently, if there is not much dissolved gas, the stops will be shorter and shallower than if there is a high concentration. The length of the stops is also strongly influenced by which tissue compartments are assessed as highly saturated. High concentrations in slow tissues will indicate longer stops than similar concentrations in fast tissues.\n\nShorter and shallower decompression dives may only need one single short shallow decompression stop, for example, 5 minutes at . Longer and deeper dives often need a series of decompression stops, each stop being longer but shallower than the previous stop.\n\nA deep stop was originally an extra stop introduced by divers during ascent, at a greater depth than the deepest stop required by their computer algorithm or tables. This practice is based on empirical observations by technical divers such as Richard Pyle, who found that they were less fatigued if they made some additional stops for short periods at depths considerably deeper than those calculated with the currently published decompression algorithms. More recently computer algorithms that are claimed to use deep stops have become available, but these algorithms and the practice of deep stops have not been adequately validated. Deep stops are likely to be made at depths where ingassing continues for some slow tissues, so the addition of deep stops of any kind can only be included in the dive profile when the decompression schedule has been computed to include them, so that such ingassing of slower tissues can be taken into account. Nevertheless, deep stops may be added on a dive that relies on a personal dive computer with real-time computation, as the PDC will track the effect of the stop on its decompression schedule. Deep stops are otherwise similar to any other staged decompression, but are unlikely to use a dedicated decompression gas, as they are usually not more than two to three minutes long.\n\nA study by Divers Alert Network in 2004 suggests that addition of a deep (c. 15 m) as well as a shallow (c. 6 m) safety stop to a theoretically no-stop ascent will significantly reduce decompression stress indicated by precordial doppler detected bubble (PDDB) levels. The authors associate this with gas exchange in fast tissues such as the spinal cord and consider that an additional deep safety stop may reduce the risk of spinal cord decompression sickness in recreational diving.\nA follow-up study found that the optimum duration for the deep safety stop under the experimental conditions was 2.5 minutes, with a shallow safety stop of 3 to 5 minutes. Longer safety stops at either depth did not further reduce PDDB.\n\nIn contrast, experimental work comparing the effect of deep stops observed a significant decrease in vascular bubbles following a deep stop after longer shallower dives, and an increase in bubble formation after the deep stop on shorter deeper dives, which is not predicted by the existing bubble model.\n\nA controlled comparative study by the Navy Experimental Diving Unit in the NEDU Ocean Simulation Facility wet-pot comparing the VVAL18 Thalmann Algorithm with a deep stop profile suggests that the deep stops schedule had a greater risk of DCS than the matched (same total stop time) conventional schedule. The proposed explanation was that slower gas washout or continued gas uptake offset benefits of reduced bubble growth at deep stops.\n\nPDISs are intermediate stops at a depth above the depth at which the leading compartment for the decompression calculation switches from ongassing to offgassing and below the depth of the first obligatory decompression stop, (or the surface, on a no-decompression dive). The ambient pressure at that depth is low enough to ensure that the tissues are mostly offgassing inert gas, although under a very small pressure gradient. This combination is expected to inhibit bubble growth. The leading compartment is generally not the fastest compartment except in very short dives, for which this model does not require an intermediate stop.\nThe 8 compartment Bühlmann - based UWATEC ZH-L8 ADT MB PMG decompression model in the Scubapro Galileo dive computer processes the dive profile and suggests an intermediate 2-minute stop that is a function of the tissue nitrogen loading at that time, taking into account the accumulated nitrogen from previous dives. Within the Haldanian logic of the model, at least three compartments are offgassing at the prescribed depth - the 5 and 10 minute half time compartments under a relatively high pressure gradient. Therefore, for decompression dives, the existing obligation is not increased during the stop.\n\nA PDIS is not a mandatory stop, nor is it considered a substitute for the more important shallow safety stop on a no-stop dive. Switching breathing gas mix during the ascent will influence the depth of the stop.\n\nThe PDIS concept was introduced by Sergio Angelini.\n\nA decompression schedule is a specified ascent rate and series of increasingly shallower decompression stops—often for increasing amounts of time—that a diver performs to outgas inert gases from their body during ascent to the surface to reduce the risk of decompression sickness. In a decompression dive, the decompression phase may make up a large part of the time spent underwater (in many cases it is longer than the actual time spent at depth).\n\nThe depth and duration of each stop is dependent on many factors, primarily the profile of depth and time of the dive, but also the breathing gas mix, the interval since the previous dive and the altitude of the dive site. The diver obtains the depth and duration of each stop from a dive computer, decompression tables or dive planning computer software. A technical scuba diver will typically prepare more than one decompression schedule to plan for contingencies such as going deeper than planned or spending longer at depth than planned. Recreational divers often rely on a personal dive computer to allow them to avoid obligatory decompression, while allowing considerable flexibility of dive profile. A surface supplied diver will normally have a diving supervisor at the control point who monitors the dive profile and can adjust the schedule to suit any contingencies as they occur.\n\nA diver missing a required decompression stop increases the risk of developing decompression sickness. The risk is related to the depth and duration of the missed stops. The usual causes for missing stops are: not having enough breathing gas to complete the stops, or accidentally losing control of buoyancy. An aim of most basic diver training is to prevent these two faults. There are also less predictable causes of missing decompression stops. Diving suit failure in cold water may force the diver to choose between hypothermia and decompression sickness. Diver injury or marine animal attack may also limit the duration of stops the diver is willing to carry out.\nA procedure for dealing with omitted decompression stops is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. In principle the procedure allows a diver who is not yet presenting symptoms of decompression sickness, to go back down and complete the omitted decompression, with some extra added to deal with the bubbles which are assumed to have formed during the period where the decompression ceiling was violated. Divers who become symptomatic before they can be returned to depth are treated for decompression sickness, and do not attempt the omitted decompression procedure as the risk is considered unacceptable under normal operational circumstances.\n\nIf a decompression chamber is available, omitted decompression may be managed by chamber recompression to an appropriate pressure, and decompression following either a surface decompression schedule or a treatment table. If the diver develops symptoms in the chamber, treatment can be started without further delay.\n\nDecompression can be accelerated by the use of breathing gases during ascent with lowered inert gas fractions (as a result of increased oxygen fraction). This will result in a greater diffusion gradient for a given ambient pressure, and consequently accelerated decompression for a relatively low risk of bubble formation. Nitrox mixtures and oxygen are the most commonly used gases for this purpose, but oxygen rich trimix blends can also be used after a trimix dive, and oxygen rich heliox blends after a heliox dive, and these may reduce risk of isobaric counterdiffusion complications. Doolette and Mitchell showed that when a switch is made to a gas with a different proportion of inert gas components, it is possible for an inert component previously absent, or present as a lower fraction, to in-gas faster than the other inert components are eliminated (inert gas counterdiffusion), sometimes resulting in raising the total tissue tension of inert gases in a tissue to exceed the ambient pressure sufficiently to cause bubble formation, even if the ambient pressure has not been reduced at the time of the gas switch. They conclude that \"breathing-gas switches should be scheduled deep or shallow to avoid the period of maximum supersaturation resulting from decompression\".\n\nThe use of pure oxygen for accelerated decompression is limited by oxygen toxicity. In open circuit scuba the upper limit for oxygen partial pressure is generally accepted as 1.6 bar, equivalent to a depth of 6 msw (metres of sea water), but in-water and surface decompression at higher partial pressures is routinely used in surface supplied diving operation, both by the military and civilian contractors, as the consequences of CNS oxygen toxicity are considerably reduced when the diver has a secure breathing gas supply.\nUS Navy tables (Revision 6) start in-water oxygen decompression at 30 fsw (9 msw), equivalent to a partial pressure of 1.9 bar, and chamber oxygen decompression at 50 fsw (15 msw), equivalent to 2.5 bar.\n\nAny dive which is started while the tissues retain residual inert gas in excess of the surface equilibrium condition is considered a repetitive dive. This means that the decompression required for the dive is influenced by the divers decompression history. Allowance must be made for inert gas preloading of the tissues which will result in them containing more dissolved gas than would have been the case if the diver had fully equilibrated before the dive. The diver will need to decompress longer to eliminate this increased gas loading.\n\nThe surface interval (SI) or surface interval time (SIT) is the time spent by a diver at surface pressure after a dive during which inert gas which was still present at the end of the dive is further eliminated from the tissues. This continues until the tissues are at equilibrium with the surface pressures. This may take several hours. In the case of the US Navy 1956 Air tables, it is considered complete after 12 hours, The US Navy 2008 Air tables specify up to 16 hours for normal exposure. but other algorithms may require more than 24 hours to assume full equilibrium.\n\nFor the planned depth of the repetitive dive, a bottom time can be calculated using the relevant algorithm which will provide an equivalent gas loading to the residual gas after the surface interval. This is called \"residual nitrogen time\" (RNT) when the gas is nitrogen. The RNT is added to the planned \"actual bottom time\" (ABT) to give an equivalent \"total bottom time\" (TBT) which is used to derive the appropriate decompression schedule for the planned dive.\n\nEquivalent residual times can be derived for other inert gases. These calculations are done automatically in personal diving computers, based on the diver's recent diving history, which is the reason why personal diving computers should not be shared by divers, and why a diver should not switch computers without a sufficient surface interval (more than 24 hours in most cases, up to 4 days, depending on the tissue model and recent diving history of the user).\n\nResidual inert gas can be computed for all modeled tissues, but repetitive group designations in decompression tables are generally based on only the one tissue, considered by the table designers to be the most limiting tissue for likely applications. In the case of the US Navy Air Tables (1956) this is the 120 minute tissue, while the Bühlmann tables use the 80 minute tissue.\n\nThe atmospheric pressure decreases with altitude, and this has an effect on the absolute pressure of the diving environment. The most important effect is that the diver must decompress to a lower surface pressure, and this requires longer decompression for the same dive profile.\nA second effect is that a diver ascending to altitude, will be decompressing en route, and will have residual nitrogen until all tissues have equilibrated to the local pressures. This means that the diver should consider any dive done before equilibration as a repetitive dive, even if it is the first dive in several days.\nThe US Navy diving manual provides repetitive group designations for listed altitude changes. These will change over time with the surface interval according to the relevant table.\n\nAltitude corrections (Cross corrections) are described in the US Navy diving manual. This procedure is based on the assumption that the decompression model will produce equivalent predictions for the same pressure ratio. The \"Sea Level Equivalent Depth\" (SLED) for the planned dive depth, which is always deeper than the actual dive at altitude, is calculated in inverse proportion to the ratio of surface pressure at the dive site to sea level atmospheric pressure.\nDecompression stop depths are also corrected, using the ratio of surface pressures, and will produce actual stop depths which are shallower than the sea level stop depths.\nThese values can be used with standard open circuit decompression tables, but are not applicable with constant oxygen partial pressure as provided by closed circuit rebreathers. Tables are used with the sea level equivalent depth and stops are done at the altitude stop depth.\n\nThe decompression algorithms can be adjusted to compensate for altitude. This was first done by Bühlmann for deriving altitude corrected tables, and is now common on diving computers, where an altitude setting can be selected by the user.\n\nExposure to reduced atmospheric pressure during the period after a dive when the residual gas levels have not yet stabilized at atmospheric saturation levels can incur a risk of decompression sickness. Rules for safe ascent are based on extension of the decompression model calculations to the desired altitude, but are generally simplified to a few fixed periods for a range of exposures. For the extreme case of an exceptional exposure dive, the US Navy requires a surface interval of 48 hours before ascent to altitude. A surface interval of 24 hours for a Heliox decompression dive and 12 hours for Heliox no-decompression dive are also specified. More detailed surface interval requirements based on the highest repetitive group designator obtained in the preceding 24‑hour period are given on the US Navy Diving Manual Table 9.6, both for ascents to specified altitudes, and for commercial flights in aircraft nominally pressurized to 8000 ft.\n\nThe first DAN flying after diving workshop in 1989 consensus guidelines recommended:\n\nDAN later proposed a simpler 24-hour wait after any and all recreational diving, but there were objections on the grounds that such a long delay would result in lost business for island diving resorts and the risks of DCS when flying after diving were too low to warrant this blanket restraint.\n\nThe DAN Flying after Diving workshop of 2002 made the following recommendations for flying after recreational diving:\nThese recommendations apply to flying at an altitude greater than, or cabin pressure less than, an altitude equivalent of 2,000 feet (610 meters).\n\nNASA astronauts train underwater to simulate the weightlessness and occasionally need to fly afterwards at cabin altitudes not exceeding 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Training dives use 46% Nitrox and can exceed six hours at a maximum depth of 40 ffw (12 mfw) for a maximum equivalent air depth (EAD) of 24 fsw (7 msw). NASA guidelines for EADs of 20–50 fsw (6–15 msw) with maximum dive durations of 100–400 minutes allow either air or oxygen to be breathed in the preflight surface intervals. Oxygen breathing during surface intervals reduces the time to fly by a factor of seven to nine times compared with air. A study by another military organization, the Special Operations Command also indicated that preflight oxygen might be an effective means for reducing DCS risk.\n\nSome places, (for example, the Altiplano in Peru and Bolivia, or the plateau around Asmara (where the airport is) in Eritrea, and some mountain passes), are many thousand feet above sea level and travelling to such places after diving at lower altitude should be treated as flying at the equivalent altitude after diving.\n\nTechnical diving includes profiles that are relatively short and deep, and which are inefficient in terms of decompression time for a given bottom time. They also often lie outside the range of profiles with validated decompression schedules, and tend to use algorithms developed for other types of diving, often extrapolated to depths for which no formal testing has been done. Often modifications are made to produce shorter or safer decompression schedules, but the evidence relevant to these modifications is often difficult to locate when it exists. The widespread belief that bubble algorithms and other modifications which produce deeper stops are more efficient than the dissolved phase models is not borne out by formal experimental data, which suggest that the the incidence of decompression symptoms may be higher for same duration schedules using deeper stops, due to greater saturation of slower tissues over the deeper profile. It also appears that gas switching from helium bases to nitrox during ascent does not accelerate decompression in comparison with heliox only dives, but there is some evidence that the type of symptoms is skewed towards neurological in heliox only dives. There is also some evidence that heliox to nitrox switches are implicated in inner ear decompression sickness symptoms which occur during decompression. Suggested strategies to minimise risk of vestibular DCS is to ensure adequate initial decompression, and to make the switch to nitrox at a relatively shallow depth (less than 30m), while using the highest acceptably safe oxygen fraction during decompression at the switch.\n\nSurface decompression is a procedure in which some or all of the staged decompression obligation is done in a decompression chamber instead of in the water. This reduces the time that the diver spends in the water, exposed to environmental hazards such as cold water or currents, which will enhance diver safety. The decompression in the chamber is more controlled, in a more comfortable environment, and oxygen can be used at greater partial pressure as there is no risk of drowning and a lower risk of oxygen toxicity convulsions. A further operational advantage is that once the divers are in the chamber, new divers can be supplied from the diving panel, and the operations can continue with less delay.\n\nA typical surface decompression procedure is described in the US Navy Diving Manual. If there is no in-water 40 ft stop required the diver is surfaced directly. Otherwise, all required decompression up to and including the 40 ft (12 m) stop is completed in-water. The diver is then surfaced and pressurised in a chamber to 50 fsw (15 msw) within 5 minutes of leaving 40 ft depth in the water. If this \"surface interval\" from 40 ft in the water to 50 fsw in the chamber exceeds 5 minutes, a penalty is incurred, as this indicates a higher risk of DCS symptoms developing, so longer decompression is required.\n\nIn the case where the diver is successfully recompressed within the nominal interval, he will be decompressed according to the schedule in the air decompression tables for surface decompression, preferably on oxygen, which is used from 50 fsw (15 msw), a partial pressure of 2.5 bar. The duration of the 50 fsw stop is 15 minutes for the Revision 6 tables. The chamber is then decompressed to 40 fsw (12 msw) for the next stage of up to 4 periods on oxygen. A stop may also be done at 30 fsw (9 msw), for further periods on oxygen according to the schedule. Air breaks of 5 minutes are taken at the end of each 30 minutes of oxygen breathing.\n\nSurface decompression procedures have been described as \"semi-controlled accidents\".\n\nData collected in the North Sea have shown that the overall incidence of decompression sickness for in-water and surface decompression is similar, but surface decompression tends to produce ten times more type II (neurological) DCS than in-water decompression. A possible explanation is that during the final stage of ascent, bubbles are produced that are stopped in the lung capillaries. During recompression of the diver in the deck chamber, the diameter of some of these bubbles is reduced sufficiently that they pass through the pulmonary capillaries and reach the systemic circulation on the arterial side, later lodging in systemic capillaries and causing neurological symptoms. The same scenario was proposed for type II DCS recorded after sawtooth profile diving or multiple repetitive diving.\n\n\"Dry\", or \"Closed\" diving bells are pressure vessels for human occupation which can be deployed from the surface to transport divers to the underwater workplace at pressures greater than ambient. They are equalized to ambient pressure at the depth where the divers will get out and back in after the dive, and are then re-sealed for transport back to the surface, which also generally takes place with controlled internal pressure greater than ambient. During and/or after the recovery from depth, the divers may be decompressed in the same way as if they were in a decompression chamber, so in effect, the dry bell is a mobile decompression chamber. Another option, used in saturation diving, is to decompress to storage pressure (pressure in the habitat part of the saturation spread) and then transfer the divers to the saturation habitat under pressure (transfer under pressure – TUP), where they will stay until the next shift, or until decompressed at the end of the saturation period.\n\nOnce all the tissue compartments have reached saturation for a given pressure and breathing mixture, continued exposure will not increase the gas loading of the tissues. From this point onwards the required decompression remains the same. If divers work and live at pressure for a long period, and are decompressed only at the end of the period, the risks associated with decompression are limited to this single exposure. This principle has led to the practice of saturation diving, and as there is only one decompression, and it is done in the relative safety and comfort of a saturation habitat, the decompression is done on a very conservative profile, minimising the risk of bubble formation, growth and the consequent injury to tissues. A consequence of these procedures is that saturation divers are more likely to suffer decompression sickness symptoms in the slowest tissues, whereas bounce divers are more likely to develop bubbles in faster tissues.\n\nDecompression from a saturation dive is a slow process. The rate of decompression typically ranges between 3 and 6 fsw (0.9 and 1.8 msw) per hour.\n\nThe US Navy Heliox saturation decompression rates require a partial pressure of oxygen to be maintained at between 0.44 and 0.48  atm when possible, but not to exceed 23% by volume, to restrict the risk of fire. For practicality the decompression is done in increments of 1 fsw at a rate not exceeding 1 fsw per minute, followed by a stop, with the average complying with the table ascent rate. Decompression is done for 16 hours in 24, with the remaining 8 hours split into two rest periods. A further adaptation generally made to the schedule is to stop at 4 fsw for the time that is would theoretically take to complete the decompression at the specified rate, i.e. 80 minutes, and then complete the decompression to surface at 1 fsw per minute. This is done to avoid the possibility of losing the door seal at a low pressure differential and losing the last hour or so of slow decompression.\n\nThe Norwegian saturation decompression tables are similar, but specifically do not allow decompression to start with an upward excursion. Partial pressure of oxygen is maintained between 0.4 and 0.5 bar, and a rest stop of 6 hours is specified each night starting at midnight.\n\nTherapeutic decompression is a procedure for treating decompression sickness by recompressing the diver, thus reducing bubble size, and allowing the gas bubbles to re-dissolve, then decompressing slowly enough to avoid further formation or growth of bubbles, or eliminating the inert gases by breathing oxygen under pressure.\n\nRecompression on atmospheric air was shown to be an effective treatment for minor DCS symptoms by Keays in 1909.\n\nHistorically, therapeutic decompression was done by recompressing the diver to the depth of relief of pain, or a bit deeper, maintaining that pressure for a while, so that bubbles could be re-dissolved, and performing a slow decompression back to the surface pressure. Later air tables were standardised to specific depths, followed by slow decompression. This procedure has been superseded almost entirely by hyperbaric oxygen treatment.\n\nEvidence of the effectiveness of recompression therapy utilizing oxygen was first shown by Yarbrough and Behnke, and has since become the standard of care for treatment of DCS.\n\nA typical hyperbaric oxygen treatment schedule is the US Navy Table 6, which provides for a standard treatment of 3 to 5 periods of 20 minutes of oxygen breathing at 60 fsw (18msw) followed by 2 to 4 periods of 60 minutes at 30 fsw (9 msw) before surfacing. Air breaks are taken between oxygen breathing to reduce the risk of oxygen toxicity.\n\nIf a chamber is not available for recompression within a reasonable period, a riskier alternative is in-water recompression at the dive site.\nIn-water recompression (IWR) is the emergency treatment of decompression sickness (DCS) by sending the diver back underwater to allow the gas bubbles in the tissues, which are causing the symptoms, to resolve. It is a risky procedure that should only be used when it is not practicable to travel to the nearest recompression chamber in time to save the victim's life.\n\nThe procedure is high risk as a diver suffering from DCS may become paralysed, unconscious or stop breathing whilst under water. Any one of these events may result in the diver drowning or further injury to the diver during a subsequent rescue to the surface. These risks can be mitigated to some extent by using a helmet or full-face mask with voice communications on the diver, and suspending the diver from the surface so that depth is positively controlled, and by having an in-water standby diver attend the diver undergoing the treatment at all times.\n\nThe principle behind in water recompression treatment is the same as that behind the treatment of DCS in a recompression chamber\n\nAlthough in-water recompression is regarded as risky, and to be avoided, there is increasing evidence that technical divers who surface and demonstrate mild DCS symptoms may often get back into the water and breathe pure oxygen at a depth for a period to seek to alleviate the symptoms. This trend is noted in paragraph 3.6.5 of DAN's 2008 accident report. The report also notes that whilst the reported incidents showed very little success, \"[w]e must recognize that these calls were mostly because the attempted IWR failed. In case the IWR were successful, [the] diver would not have called to report the event. Thus we do not know how often IWR may have been used successfully.\"\n\nHistorically, in-water recompression was the usual method of treating decompression sickness in remote areas. Procedures were often informal and based on operator experience, and used air as the breathing gas as it was all that was available. The divers generally used standard diving gear, which was relatively safe for this procedure, as the diver was at low risk of drowning if he lost consciousness.\n\nThere are several types of equipment used to help divers carry out decompression. Some are used to plan and monitor the decompression and some mark the underwater position of the diver and act as a buoyancy control aid and position reference in low visibility or currents. Decompression may be shortened (or accelerated) by breathing an oxygen-rich \"deco gas\" such as a nitrox with 50% or more oxygen. The high partial pressure of oxygen in such decompression mixes create the effect of the oxygen window. This decompression gas is often carried by scuba divers in side-slung cylinders. Cave divers who can only return by a single route, will often leave decompression gas cylinders attached to the guideline at the points where they will be used. Surface supplied divers will have the composition of the breathing gas controlled at the gas panel. Divers with long decompression obligations may be decompressed inside gas filled chambers in the water or at the surface.\n\nEquipment for planning and monitoring decompression includes decompression tables, surface computer software and personal decompression computers. There is a wide range of choice:\n\nA critical aspect of successful decompression is that the depth and ascent rate of the diver must be monitored and sufficiently accurately controlled. Practical in-water decompression requires a reasonable tolerance for variation in depth and rate of ascent, but unless the decompression is being monitored in real time by a decompression computer, any deviations from the nominal profile will affect the risk. Several items of equipment are used to assist in facilitating accurate adherence to the planned profile, by allowing the diver to more easily control depth and ascent rate, or to transfer this control to specialist personnel at the surface.\n\nReducing the partial pressure of the inert gas component of the breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as the concentration gradient will be greater for a given depth. This is usually achieved by increasing the partial pressure of oxygen in the breathing gas, as substituting a different inert gas may have counter-diffusion complications due to differing rates of diffusion, which can lead to a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue. This can lead to bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. Partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 bar in the chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression.\n\nSpecialised equipment is available to decompress a diver out of the water. This is almost exclusively used with surface supplied diving equipment:\n\n\nBasic decompression theory and use of decompression tables is part of the theory component of training for commercial divers, and dive planning based on decompression tables, and the practice and field management of decompression is a significant part of the work of the diving supervisor.\n\nRecreational divers are trained in the theory and practice of decompression to the extent that the certifying agency specifies in the training standard for each certification. This may vary from a rudimentary overview sufficient to allow the diver to avoid decompression obligation for entry level divers, to competence in the use of several decompression algorithms by way of personal dive computers, decompression software, and tables for advanced technical divers. The detailed understanding of decompression theory is not generally required of either commercial or recreational divers.\n\nThe practice of decompression techniques is another matter altogether. Recreational divers are expected not to do decompression dives by most certification organizations, though CMAS and BSAC allow for short decompression dives in some levels of recreational divers. Technical, commercial, military and scientific divers may all be expected to do decompression dives in the normal course of their sport or occupation, and are specifically trained in appropriate procedures and equipment relevant to their level of certification. A significant part of practical and theoretical training for these divers is on the practice of safe and effective decompression procedures and the selection and use of the appropriate equipment.\n\n\n\n\n"

                "List of Supernatural characters\n\nSupernatural is an American television drama series created by writer and producer Eric Kripke, and was initially broadcast by The WB. After its first season, The WB and UPN merged to form The CW, which is the current broadcaster for the show in the United States.\n\nThe show features two main characters, Jared Padalecki as Sam Winchester and Jensen Ackles as Dean Winchester, brothers who travel across the country in a black 1967 Chevrolet Impala to hunt demons, supernatural creatures, and other paranormal entities, many of them based on folklore, myths, and American urban legends. In addition, \"Supernatural\" chronicles the relationship between the brothers and their father, John Winchester, as they seek to avenge and understand the murder of their mother at the hands of the demon Azazel.\n\n\"Supernatural\" has featured many other recurring guests that take part in story arcs that span a portion of a season. Occasionally, the recurring guest storylines will span multiple seasons. After the death of their father in the second season, the hunter Bobby Singer becomes a father figure to Sam and Dean. As the series progresses, recurring guests appear at various times to help move the overall storyline of the show such as the demon Ruby or the angel Castiel. The series also features recurring appearances from other demons, angels, and hunters.\n\nThe following characters are angels of God, making them extremely powerful spiritual beings. Merely perceiving their true form - even psychically - typically results in blindness, as the appearance of their natural \"visage\" is overwhelming; it is capable of burning an individual's eyes from their sockets, although certain \"special people\" are able to withstand their true appearances and voices. Because their true appearances cannot be safely perceived by humans and because they are spirits with no physical being, they often take on humans as vessels in order to exist in and interact with the physical world, though only with the hosts' consent. Angels require a particular vessel to reach their full potential, people being \"chosen\" to be their hosts or \"true vessels\".\n\nMost angels are portrayed as emotionless authoritarian beings. A number have been shown to have disdain for humanity, whom they believe are flawed and inferior creations, though Lucifer is the only angel who refused to kneel before humans at God's command. All angels, fallen or not, consider themselves family, each being brothers and sisters and referring to God as their Father. However, most angels have not actually met or spoken to God. The highest-ranking angels currently command the lesser-ranking, their former leader God having disappeared and left the angels to protect humanity in His place.\n\nCreator Eric Kripke originally did not want angels to be featured in the series, believing God worked through hunters rather than angels. However, with so many demonic villains, he and the writers changed their minds when they realized that the show needed angels to create a \"cosmic battle\". As Kripke put it, \"We had the empire, but we didn't really have the rebellion.\" They had always wanted to have a storyline with a few central characters but having massive battles in the background, comparable to \"Star Wars\" and \"Lord of the Rings\", and the addition of angels allowed for this. Kripke has found that it has opened up many new storylines.\n\nBalthazar, portrayed by Sebastian Roché, is an angel who had fought alongside Castiel during the last angelic war. Believed dead, this was merely a cover as he left Heaven, taking a number of the weapons with him. Since faking his own death, he has been on Earth enjoying a rather hedonistic lifestyle. In \"The Third Man\", the Winchesters discover that three corrupt cops were murdered by the young brother of one of their victims in possession of The Staff of Moses. Balthazar is revealed to have sold it to the boy in return for his soul. During a conflict with Raphael and his henchmen, Balthazar destroys the archangel's vessel with Lot's Salt. Dean then traps Balthazar in a ring of Holy Fire and forces him to give up the boy's soul. They want to get more from him, but Castiel releases him because he owes him his life. Sam uses an Enochian ritual to summon Balthazar, in \"Appointment in Samarra\". Sam asks him if there is any way to keep a soul out of its body. Balthazar informs him of a ritual that involves him defiling his vessel, his reason for helping Sam being that he would find it useful to have Sam in his debt. He tells Sam that he would need the blood of his father (that needn't come from the \"father of your blood\"), prompting Sam to try to kill Bobby before he is subdued, Dean and Death managing to recover Sam's soul. Balthazar transports Sam and Dean to an alternate universe, in \"The French Mistake\", to evade the angelic hit man Virgil and gives them a key which he claims opens where the weapons he stole from Heaven are stored. This is revealed to have been a ploy by Balthazar and Castiel to allow the latter to retrieve the weapons from their true location while Raphael was distracted. A suspicious alias used by Balthazar in 1912 leads to the brothers summoning Balthazar in \"My Heart Will Go On\". Balthazar claims he had saved the Titanic simply because he detested the movie and subsequent eponymous song. However, upon confrontation with Fate, Atropos reveals she knows Balthazar is working for Castiel; the saving of the Titanic was to provide additional souls to fund their side in the civil war. Castiel pulls out of the plan to kill Atropos once she threatens the Winchesters, stopping Balthazar from killing her. When the Winchesters reveal that Castiel is in league with Crowley, in \"Let It Bleed\", Balthazar agrees to assist the brothers and act as a double agent. He then transports Sam and Dean to where Lisa and Ben are being held captive. In \"The Man Who Knew too Much\", Balthazar begins to have second thoughts about betraying Castiel, but ultimately continues to assist the brothers. He informs Dean and Bobby of where the ritual to open the gate to Purgatory will take place. Castiel summons Balthazar and reveals that he is aware of his actions, Balthazar is then killed by Castiel.\n\nAn angel portrayed by Adam J. Harrington who after the fall of the angels began gathering other angels into a faction to retake and rule Heaven. Bartholomew is described as being a protege of Naomi and in \"I'm No Angel\", uses Internet preacher Reverend Buddy Boyle to find vessels for other angels. Wanting revenge for the expulsion of the angels, Bartholomew sends his followers after Castiel and when he wards himself against angelic detection, rogue Reapers. In \"Holy Terror,\" Bartholomew has shifted to using Buddy Boyle to target select groups rather than the whole world so he can control who will become a vessel, wanting only his followers to gain vessels. After some of Bartholomew's angels are slaughtered by angels under the command of anarchist Malachi, Bartholomew refuses a meeting with him and starts an angelic civil war between his and Malachi's factions. In \"Captives,\" Bartholomew has begun destroying all other factions, including peaceful ones as he sees them threats to his power and his men capture Castiel. Bartholomew is pleased by this, having apparently put aside his previous resentment as he is an old friend and ally of Castiel. Bartholomew invites Castiel to join him, having turned all of his human followers into vessels and using their resources to track Metatron when he appears on Earth. Bartholomew believes with Castiel on his side he can unite all of the angels under his command and retake Heaven, but Castiel refuses to help when he tortures an innocent angel. When Castiel refuses to kill the angel, Bartholomew attacks him, but Castiel overpowers him. Though Castiel has Bartholomew at his mercy, he refuses to kill him as he wants no more angel deaths and lets him go. Bartholomew refuses to stop however and draws a second angel sword and attacks Castiel while his back is turned. With no other choice, Castiel kills Bartholomew in self-defense with his own sword. Afterwards, several of his followers decide to follow Castiel, having seen a different way in Castiel's refusal to kill him and desire for no more bloodshed.\n\nIntroduced in season 11, Billie, portrayed by Lisa Berry, is a reaper who meets Sam inside a hospital whose inhabitants are dying due to the Darkness' infection, with her acting as their reaper; despite Dean having killed Death in the previous season, souls are still required to be collected. Billie tells Sam that she is tired of seeing him and Dean dying and coming back over and over again, promising them that the next time they die, she will put them into the Empty, where no soul can ever escape. Billie is later seen guarding an entrance of Hell in \"The Devil in the Details\", as well as acting as Dean's reaper in \"Red Meat\", where, though he and Sam manage to wake up from their coma, she tells them that even if they are the only solution in preventing the end of the world, she would still not allow them to resurrect if they die. In the season finale, Billie offers help to the Winchesters by drawing souls to create a Soul Bomb for use against the Darkness. In season 13, Billie is resurrected and promoted from reaper to Death; as she was the last reaper to die before the Winchester’s killed Death.\n\nGabriel (also referred to as the Trickster) is an archangel portrayed by Richard Speight, Jr. Having grown tired of watching his brothers fight each other in Heaven, he fled to Earth thousands of years prior to the series, assuming the role of a Pagan trickster. For his first appearance in the second-season episode \"Tall Tales\", the writers decided not to put their own spin on trickster lore—as is usually done with other villains—keeping the \"deadly sense of humor\" and decision to go after the \"high and mighty to bring them down a notch\", with Gabriel causing several violent urban legends to come to life on a college campus and punish those residing there. Sam and Dean Winchester investigate and eventually figure out his identity, though the Trickster is waiting for them and offers a peaceful resolution so long as they let him leave to terrorize another town. Sam and Dean refuse, and attack him with the help of fellow hunter Bobby Singer, and the Trickster fakes his own death.\n\nThe Trickster reappears in \"Mystery Spot\", trapping Sam in a time loop where Dean ends up dying in many different ways. After over a hundred loops, Sam threatens the Trickster with a blood-covered stake, after which he agrees to break the loop. But when Sam considers killing him regardless, the Trickster sends the two to the next day where Dean once again dies, but is unable to be resurrected due to there being no more time loop. Months later, he calls Sam to him, where he tries to drive in a point: the two brothers continually sacrificing themselves for one another would bring no good, and when people die, their survivors just have to learn to accept it and live with it. However the Trickster gives Sam what he wants, lamenting the whole situation had become boring months ago for him anyway.\n\nIn the episode \"Changing Channels\", he traps Sam and Dean in an endless thread of television shows where they must play out their roles to survive, and consequently be willing to accept their roles as vessels for Lucifer and Michael respectively. In one of the scenarios, he is stabbed with a stake, a move that would kill regular trickster spirits, however, he continues to put them in the shows. Dean traps him in a burning circle of holy oil, suspecting he is an angel because he survived the staking, and because of how he and Castiel interacted. He then reveals that he is the archangel Gabriel. He expresses his desire for the Winchesters to say yes to becoming Michael's and Lucifer's vessels since their lives mirror that of the angels. Dean frees Gabriel from his trap and accuses him of giving up because he's simply too afraid to stand up to his own family.\n\nGabriel returns in \"Hammer of the Gods\", attending the summit of pagan gods under the guise of Loki; however, he intends to rescue the brothers as their plan to lure Lucifer would easily fail, and Lucifer would slaughter them all. As he intends to prevent Kali, an old flame, from suffering a bloody fate, he tries to get them out; but he tells them he cannot rescue the pagan's hostages as it would be too difficult. However, later he is forced to comply; the rescue attempt results in the brothers' capture once again. Kali (who is keeping the brothers from leaving as their spilled blood binds them to her) reveals she, along with the other gods, knew of his identity for a while. Kali takes his sword and stabs him with it apparently killing him, but Gabriel appears to Dean and reveals the sword was a fake and suggests Dean should seduce Kali so they can escape. Lucifer shows up at the hotel, slaughtering most of the gods. Gabriel is then forced to step in, allowing Kali and the brothers to leave. Gabriel confronts his brother about loyalties and their past, but ultimately fails and is killed by his own blade. He later reveals, through a modified porn movie, Lucifer can be recaptured in his previous prison, with the four rings of the Horsemen.\n\nGabriel returns in \"Meta Fiction\" where he reveals to Castiel that he has been in Heaven since he 'died'. However, when Heaven kicked all the angels out, Gabriel was forced to go on the run from Metatron. He tells Castiel that Metatron was using the Horn of Gabriel to trap and kill the angels and that he needs Castiel to help him fight. When the two are running, they stop at a gas station where they realize that some of Metatron's loyal subjects were following them. Gabriel offers to fight them off because he still has some of his Archangel mojo left but then Castiel realizes that the whole situation was an illusion. Castiel then asks if Gabriel is really still alive, but all Gabriel does for an answer is raise his eyebrows before disappearing. Metatron says later that Gabriel played out his part well.\n\nIn \"We Happy Few\", God confirms that Gabriel is dead when they discuss how the four archangels were required to help God barely defeat the Darkness the first time. God tells the Winchesters that while they have Lucifer fighting with them, Michael is in no shape to fight and Raphael and Gabriel are dead. When Dean reminds God that he has resurrected Castiel before, God tells him that he can't resurrect the archangels so easily as they are beings of primordial creation. As a result, it will take far too much time to resurrect Gabriel and Raphael to help fight the Darkness.\n\nAn angel portrayed by Tahmoh Penikett and Jared Padalecki, Gadreel was assigned to guard the Garden of Eden but was disgraced when Lucifer got in, which God and angels regarded as his fault. Gadreel was locked up in Heaven's deepest dungeon and heavily tortured for his failure, but was released when Metatron's spell made all angels fall to Earth. Wanting to make up for his past, Gadreel answers Dean's prayers for help, taking on the identity of an angel named Ezekiel, who died in the Fall. When Gadreel's powers cannot heal Sam. he proposes a solution: if he possesses Sam, he could heal him from the inside while recuperating from his own injuries from falling. Dean ultimately agrees and Gadreel invades Sam's mind, assuming Dean's form to manipulate Sam into saying \"yes,\" which Gadreel takes as the permission he needs to possess Sam. Gadreel tells Dean that he will let Sam keep control of his body while he himself works in the background, but that it's best that Sam not know he is there. If Sam doesn't allow Gadreel to remain in his body, Sam could eject him and would die as a result. In the following episodes, Gadreel occasionally takes control of Sam's body in order to kill enemies when they get the better of Sam, to resurrect slain allies of Sam and Dean, and to heal the injuries Sam gets on hunts. He regularly erases Sam's memory of these moments in attempt to keep Sam from getting suspicious. Gadreel is wary of Castiel's presence as he fears being found by the angels looking for Castiel to the point that he would have vacated Sam's body—and in doing so, consigned Sam to die—to flee if Dean hadn't agreed to make Castiel leave the bunker in \"I'm No Angel\".\n\nWhen Castiel turns up on a case in mid-season finale \"Holy Terror,\" Gadreel once more forces Dean to send him away. In the same episode, he crosses paths with Metatron, who reveals his true identity and backstory and offers him a chance to \"redeem\" himself by becoming his lieutenant and helping him usher in a new, better Heaven. After discerning that Dean has learned new information from Castiel that he is not Ezekiel and has turned against him, now attempting to tell Sam the truth and get him to expel him, Gadreel murders Kevin and steals the tablets on Metatron's orders in a show of allegiance to the latter. The following episode, \"Road Trip\", Metatron sends Gadreel to kill his former guard and torturer to please his new follower; when he finds out that Gadreel didn't kill Dean as well as Kevin, however, Gadreel is punished by being forced to kill again, this time his old friend Abner. He is then captured by Dean, Castiel, and Crowley, who learn his true identity when Crowley drives spikes through Gadreel's brain to revert him to his trance-like \"factory settings\" and an enraged Castiel reveals the cause of Gadreel's infamy to Dean. Gadreel then reverts to normal and tells them that he will not leave Sam's body, nor can they reach Sam, whom he has placed in a fantasy world unaware of what is really happening. With Crowley revealing the truth to Sam by possessing him to communicate with him, Gadreel and Sam fight briefly before Sam finally expels him. Gadreel continues working for Metatron, recruiting angels for their side in \"Meta Fiction\" and killing the ones who refuse. Gadreel is captured and interrogated by Sam and Dean, but refuses to give up any information and instead tries to push Dean into killing him, which fails as Dean knows they need Gadreel. Gadreel is saved when Metatron has them trade him Gadreel for Castiel, whom he has captured.\n\nIn \"King of the Damned\", Gadreel meets with Castiel, who tries to persuade Gadreel that he is being used by Metatron and should be working against him, as Castiel's spy. Gadreel declines as he believes that betraying a cause he has dedicated himself to would infringe on his honor; Castiel is sympathetic and leaves his offer open. The next episode, Gadreel discovers that Metatron is having his own angels—ones Gadreel himself had recruited—kill themselves as part of a ploy to discredit Castiel, which proves to be the incentive he needed to turn on the cause. Gadreel offers his assistance to Castiel and the Winchesters; although Dean attacks him, Gadreel is saved by Sam and Castiel, who agree to accept his help. In the finale, \"Do You Believe in Miracles?\", Gadreel and Castiel plot to sneak into Heaven and break Metatron's connection to the angel tablet, so that Metatron will revert to the powers and weaknesses of a normal angel again and Dean can kill him with the First Blade. However, their scheme is already known to Metatron's angels, who trick them into Heaven's dungeon and imprison them. They cannot convince the angels to help them against Metatron, due to Gadreel's negative reputation. Hoping that he will be remembered as an angel who helped saved Heaven instead of the angel who let Lucifer into the Garden, Gadreel sacrifices himself by using the suicide bombers' spell to destroy himself and the dungeon, thus freeing Castiel and in the process convincing one of Metatron's angels (Hannah) of his good intentions.\n\nHannah, portrayed by Erica Carroll and Lee Majdoub in her female and male vessels, respectively, is one of the countless number of angels who fell from Heaven due to Metatron's incantation of the angel banishing spell at the end of \"Sacrifice\". She possesses a married woman named Caroline Johnson as her vessel on Earth. In the episode \"Meta Fiction\", Hannah and several other angels are lured by the Horn of Gabriel Sigil enchanted by Gadreel. She attempts to sneak and kill Castiel, who is also lured by the sigil, but fails and begs for her life. Joining Castiel, the two arrive at the sigil and meet Gadreel, who offers the two and other angels a chance to join Metatron. When Hannah and her friends refuse, Gadreel proceeds to kill nearly all angels in the area, but spares Hannah, who is healed by Castiel; it is later revealed that Metatron deliberately tells Gadreel to spare Hannah so she could inform Castiel about what happened. Hannah then becomes Castiel's second-in-command from then on, helping him building an angel army in the war against Metatron. In \"Stairway To Heaven\", Hannah convinces Dean to approach civilly with Tessa, who has been used by Metatron as a suicide bomber; she becomes furious when Dean apparently killed Tessa with the First Blade (though the latter actually committed suicide), and is further infuriated when she learns from Metatron's broadcast that Castiel had lied about his dwindling grace. Hannah and Castiel's other angel allies join Metatron's army upon Castiel's refusal to kill Dean in retribution for Tessa's death. During Castiel and Gadreel's arrival at Heaven to destroy Metatron's angel tablet in \"Do You Believe In Miracles?\", Hannah catches and locks them up in the Heaven's prison. She refuses to believe that killing Metatron would restore the order, accusing Castiel and Gadreel of their lie and selfishness, respectively. However, she becomes convinced when Gadreel kills himself to prove his fidelity to humans, and joins Castiel in his insurgency against Metatron. Eventually, the two manage to topple Metatron, who is imprisoned, though Hannah warns Castiel at the end that his dwindling grace would result in his death.\n\nAfter Metatron's downfall, Hannah takes charge to return all the fallen angels back to Heaven. She contacts Castiel to help her in returning two rogue angels, Daniel and Adina, who have become content with their life on Earth. Though Hannah fails to return the two with their death, Castiel decides to accompany her for the time being in her task. Throughout their journey, the two develop a romantic relationship, with Hannah becoming protective enough of Castiel that she suggests to kill a rogue angel and feed its grace to Castiel, though he declines. However, when she encounters her vessel, Caroline's husband searching for his wife, Hannah realizes that Caroline deserves more chance to enjoy her mortal life. Deciding that she has enjoyed her time on Earth, Hannah releases Caroline of her grace, but not before kissing Castiel; inspired by her decision, Castiel contacts his vessel, Jimmy Novak's family.\n\nSince leaving her main vessel, Caroline, Hannah has been taking a man as her new vessel. She blocks Sam and Castiel from entering Heaven to free Metatron, and when the two get around with the plan with Bobby's help, she and several other angels corner Bobby afterwards to punish him for his actions. According to Metatron in \"Book of the Damned\", Hannah has been leading Heaven since his downfall and that it is \"the best\" it has ever been since the archangels' disappearances/deaths. In \"Form and Void\", Hannah saves Castiel from being tortured by two angels, but he soon realizes that it is a ruse so she can get information about the Winchesters from him. When the two angels follow, they kill Hannah, but in turn are killed by Castiel.\n\nLucifer, portrayed primarily by Mark Pellegrino, Jared Padalecki, Misha Collins, Rick Springfield and David Chisum, is the second oldest archangel, the first fallen angel, introduced as a recurring character in the fifth season of the series. From his prison in hell, he orchestrated events not only seen in seasons one through four, but decades prior, to eventually lead to his release by breaking the 66 seals. In the episode \"Sin City\", he was described as the 'father' and god of the demons, the one who gave them their form and purpose. Azazel reinforced this by referring to him as \"My Father\" while possessing a priest before slaughtering a convent of nuns. However, in \"Abandon All Hope...\", Crowley remarks that Lucifer views demons with contempt and his cannon fodder and will destroy them once he has eliminated humanity.\n\nIn the episode \"The End\", Lucifer states his fall was the result of refusing God's decree to love humans more than him. As a result, God had Michael cast him into hell. Ruby also reveals in \"When the Levee Breaks\" in defiance to God, he turned Lilith into the first demon. Both Death and Gabriel have compared Lucifer's hatred of humans to \"\"one big temper tantrum!\"\" because God favored humans over him, his most beloved angel. Lucifer does not like how humans have changed the planet from its original state, and hopes to purify it. He is also very critical of humans, mostly in how they blame him for their own mistakes, wrongdoings, flaws and failures. Creator Eric Kripke has jokingly compared him to a \"raging psychotic\" version of environmentalist Ed Begley, Jr., with \"unlimited power\".\n\nDue to his angelic and spiritual nature, Lucifer needs a human vessel in order to interact directly with the physical world. Lucifer seeks out a man named Nick, whose wife and baby had recently been murdered. Tormenting Nick about the tragedy, he casts illusions such as a baby crying and blood pouring from the crib, eventually appearing to Nick in the form of his late wife Sarah. Openly admitting his identity to Nick, he tries to gain sympathy by telling Nick he was punished for loving God too much. He then convinces Nick to be his vessel by promising to get vengeance against God for allowing his family to be murdered. However, Lucifer later reveals to Sam that he is the true intended vessel. By \"Abandon All Hope...\" it is shown Nick's body, being a temporary vessel and not his \"true\" vessel, is incapable of containing Lucifer's immense power and is beginning to wear down; revealed in \"Two Minutes to Midnight\" he has to consume gallons of demon blood to keep his vessel from combusting. He forms a ritual to summon Death and when the Winchesters, Harvelles and Castiel arrive, he traps Castiel in holy oil and sends Meg after the others. After being ambushed by the brothers he is shot with the Colt but survives; he then reveals his status as one of five things in creation immune to the Colt; while the brothers escape with Castiel's help, he manages to summon Death and bind him under his control.\n\nDuring a convention of pagan gods in \"Hammer of the Gods\", Lucifer is made aware of the brothers' location by Mercury, who betrays the rest of them. Slaughtering all the gods, he approaches the brothers and is stalled by Kali until Gabriel arrives. Gabriel provides safe passage for Kali and the brothers, and confronts Lucifer about his ultimate reason for rebellion, claiming that he rebelled not because he recognized that humans were flawed, but because he was no longer their father's favorite son. Lucifer questions Gabriel's loyalties, who states through his experiences with humans, despite their flaws, strive to do their best. Ultimately, Lucifer kills Gabriel with his own sword when Gabriel's attempt to catch Lucifer off-guard with a duplicate fails, but he is clearly distraught over this.\n\nHaving acquired all four rings of the Horseman (which can trap Lucifer back in his prison), Sam and Dean enter Lucifer's hideout, planning to trap him when Sam agrees to be his vessel; this completely fails, as Lucifer is too powerful to fight. Lucifer brings forward four demons, who had been part of Azazel's surveillance of Sam since his youth and kills them all in a way of \"letting off steam\" and acquiring Sam's trust. Following that, he confronts Michael in a graveyard, attempting to convince him not to fight, reasoning there was no real purpose; Michael refuses. Dean interrupts, while Castiel dissipates Michael, an act Lucifer took unkindly to, and kills him. He starts to pummel Dean and when Bobby attempts to use the Colt to stop him he is killed as well. However, Sam then sees a toy army man in an ashtray of the Impala, a remnant from his youth, and regains control. Sam reopens the hole, and jumps in, taking Michael with him.\n\nLucifer returns in season seven as part of Sam's hallucinations, caused by the memories of his time in the cage. Lucifer tells Sam that the world he has been in for the last year is not real and Sam is still in the cage, a new form of torture which Lucifer prides himself on as being his best yet. Sam confronts Lucifer and asks him why he doesn't end this dream world to which Lucifer responds by saying that he will only end it when Sam can't take it anymore. Lucifer later changes into Dean and tricks Sam into leaving Bobby's house. Once at the destination, he reveals himself to prove he can control Sam's \"dream\", although Lucifer is proven to be a hallucination when Dean tells Sam how to figure out what is real. Despite being proven to be a hallucination, he informs Sam that he's not going anywhere. Lucifer tortures Sam by depriving him of sleep by repeatedly waking him up and later making food look like maggots in an attempt to kill him. Although Sam initially manages to ignore the hallucination, it becomes worse when Sam acknowledges Lucifer's advice when trying to get information about Dean's whereabouts, giving the hallucination additional strength. Castiel, found to be alive, tries to rebuild Sam's mental wall, but fails as it's completely gone. In order to save Sam and atone for what he's done, Castiel transfers the problem to himself, leaving him haunted by Lucifer and stuck in a mental hospital. In \"Reading is Fundamental,\" when Castiel comes out of his catatonic state, Sam asks him about seeing Lucifer. Castiel explains that he did at first, but Lucifer eventually disappeared. Castiel believes that Lucifer was simply a projection of Sam's own torment from his time in Hell and that projection disappeared as the torment was no longer in Sam's mind.\n\nIn the season eight episode \"Goodbye Stranger,\" it is revealed that Lucifer had a series of crypts around the United States and possibly the world containing his most precious artifacts. The locations were only known to Lucifer himself and his most trusted followers, such as Azazel. Among the items in his crypts, in an angel-proofed box, was the angel Word of God tablet. Eventually Sam, Dean and Castiel locate the right crypt with the help of Meg who knows from her time with Azazel and get the angel tablet.\n\nIn the season 10 episode \"Brother's Keeper\", Death explains that Lucifer and the other archangels once fought a war with an ancient evil called the Darkness, eventually locking it away. Lucifer was given the Mark of Cain, the lock on the Darkness' prison and the Mark corrupted him into his jealousy towards humanity, leading to his fall into evil. The first mention of Lucifer (and Michael)'s activity since their imprisonment in Hell is mentioned in \"Out of the Darkness, Into the Fire\" when an aide of Crowley informs him that ever since the Darkness broke free of its prison, the two archangels are screaming, trying to tell others about the danger the Darkness will pose to the world.\n\nIn \"Oh Brother Where Art Thou?\" and \"the Devil in the Details\", Sam travels into Hell to speak to Lucifer, directed by what he believes to be visions from God. Manifesting in the form of Nick, Lucifer is summoned into a smaller cage in Hell where he tells Sam he can defeat the Darkness, but needs Sam to be his vessel again. After the warding suddenly fails, Lucifer teleports Sam into the cage and reveals that he sent the visions to Sam after the Darkness' release damaged his cage and is working with Rowena. Lucifer shows Sam several memories, explaining that while Sam once had the strength to do what needed to be done, he lost that after Dean went to Purgatory. Sam accepts that Lucifer is telling the truth, but refuses to agree to possession again as he knows no matter who wins, Lucifer or the Darkness, humanity is doomed. Lucifer engages Sam, Dean and Castiel in battle, proving to be more than a match for all three together. After Lucifer confirms he can defeat the Darkness, Castiel agrees to possession by him. At that same moment, Rowena completes a spell that apparently banishes Lucifer back to his cage. After the Winchesters leave, Lucifer possessing Castiel reveals himself to Rowena and Crowley and kills Rowena so she can't send him back to the cage.\n\nIn \"Into the Mystic\", Dean finds Lucifer looking through the bunker for a way to summon the Darkness and confides in him about his connection to Amara, believing Lucifer to be Castiel. Lucifer consoles Dean on the connection while secretly interested in this development.\n\nIn \"The Vessel\", Lucifer has regained control of Hell and keeps Crowley as his pet. After receiving a call from the Winchesters, he is shocked to discover that one of the Hands of God survived and agrees to transport Dean back to a submarine in 1943 to get it before the sub sinks. Special warding keeps Lucifer out of the sub and he and Sam attempt to find a way to remove the warding. Sam finds a spell, but doesn't believe it will work as it requires the power of an archangel. As Sam offers his soul to help give \"Castiel\" the power he needs, Lucifer reveals himself and attempts to destroy Sam. Castiel regains control temporarily, but is unable to eject Lucifer as its taking all of his strength to keep Lucifer from killing Sam and only Lucifer has the power to rescue Dean. As Delphine Seydoux unleashes the power of the Hand of God, Lucifer pulls Dean back to the present and reveals himself to Dean. Lucifer throws Dean around the bunker and attempts to use the power of the Hand of God, but finds it expended. As Lucifer advances on Dean, Sam uses a blood sigil to banish him from the bunker.\n\nFollowing his banishment, Lucifer attempts to find another Hand of God through Crowley in \"Beyond the Mat.\" To this end, he sets Crowley up to be \"freed\" by Lucifer's loyal demon Simmonds so Crowley will lead him to another Hand of God. Crowley leads Lucifer to the Rod of Aaron, but anticipates Lucifer's double-cross. Crowley attempts to kill Lucifer with the Rod's power, but Simmonds takes the brunt of the blast, saving Lucifer. Realizing the Rod's power is expended, Crowley quickly teleports away before Lucifer can kill him. In \"Hell's Angel\", Lucifer enters Heaven, killing an angel he finds there and intimidates the angels into following him to combat Amara. Amara unleashes a wave of darkness through Heaven, frightening the angels and pushing them closer to following Lucifer. However, the Winchesters, Crowley and the still-alive Rowena team up together to free Castiel and banish Lucifer back to his Cage. To this end, they summon him into warding in a church surrounded by Holy Fire. Once Lucifer is trapped, Dean attempts to use magic to suppress the archangel to restore Castiel, but Lucifer quickly overpowers it. In a desperate attempt, Crowley enters Castiel's vessel where he finds that Lucifer has \"really gotten his hooks in good\" to Castiel who is apathetic to everything around him even as Lucifer appears in the form of Nick and attacks Crowley. Sam exorcises Crowley to save his life and the warding breaks, releasing Lucifer. Lucifer is able to get the Horn of Joshua from the Winchesters, another Hand of God, just before Amara appears. Lucifer blasts Amara with both his own power and the Horn's to no avail. Amara then captures Lucifer and takes him to a grain silo she is using as her base. Believing Lucifer to be the one thing God still cares about, Amara begins torturing him in hopes of drawing God out.\n\nOver the next few weeks, Amara tortures Lucifer mercilessly, trying and failing to draw out God. In \"All in the Family\", Amara notices that Lucifer is in bad shape along with Castiel and contacts Dean to pass on the message to God. Having learned that God intends to sacrifice Himself to Amara to save the universe, the Winchesters, Metatron and Prophet Donatello Redfern team up together to rescue Lucifer, hoping to convince God to use Lucifer in battle against Amara. As Dean distracts Amara, Sam, Metatron and Donatello find the heavily injured Lucifer who agrees to set aside his differences with God and fight Amara with them. They set him free, but he is too weakened to teleport them to safety. As Amara approaches, Metatron sacrifices himself to buy them time to get away, but Amara quickly catches up to them. Before she can kill the group, God teleports them and the Impala into the Bunker. There, for the first time in millennia, God and Lucifer are reunited. After commenting on how much each other has changed, God heals Lucifer's injuries to the fallen archangel's surprise.\n\nIn \"We Happy Few\", Lucifer sulks around the Bunker, displeased to be reunited with God who won't apologize to him. Fed up with the two's issues with each other, the Winchesters get God and Lucifer to have a sit-down in which things are tense at first but the two eventually reconcile. Now fully on their side, Lucifer joins God in explaining that the last time they defeated the Darkness, it had taken the four archangels and God to barely win and this time Michael is in no shape to battle and Gabriel and Raphael are dead and God can't resurrect them. As a result, the Winchesters suggest pulling in the witches, angels and demons to help them. As God refuses to order the angels to help, Lucifer returns to Heaven where the angels refuse to hear him out. In response, Lucifer returns control to Castiel who tells the angels that Lucifer is burning both himself and his vessel out but he feels his role in the battle is to give Lucifer form on Earth to fight. Castiel and Lucifer are able to convince the angels to join them and Sam and Dean are able to convince the witches and demons respectively. After the witches, angels and demons strike Amara, she enters the warehouse where the Winchesters, God and Lucifer are waiting for her and Lucifer strikes Amara through the back with an angelic spear. Due to her weakened state, Lucifer's strike brings Amara down and she and God confront each other. However, God waits too long to transfer the Mark of Cain to Sam and Amara recovers and attacks God with all of her power. Lucifer attempts to save his father, but Amara flings him against a pillar and yanks him out of Castiel, while leaving Castiel unconscious. In \"Alpha and Omega\", Dean goes to check on Lucifer only to find Castiel alone. Castiel tells him that Lucifer is gone from his vessel but he doesn't know what happened to the archangel after Amara pulled him out.\n\nIn \"Keep Calm and Carry On\", a weakened Lucifer searches for a suitable new vessel chased by Crowley, but keeps burning out the people he's possessing. In \"Mamma Mia\", Lucifer settles on aging rock star Vince Vincente (Rick Springfield) and gains permission by posing as Vince's dead lover. With a new permanent vessel, Lucifer meets with Crowley who works with Rowena in an attempt to force Lucifer from Vince and back into the Cage. However, the effort fails and Crowley flees while Lucifer captures Rowena. In \"The Foundry\", Lucifer attempts to have Rowena make Vince a permanent vessel for him, but she betrays Lucifer and casts a spell that speeds up Vince's decay and banishes Lucifer to the bottom of the ocean. In \"Rock Never Dies\", a pair of amateur Satanists attempt to summon Lucifer who appears in the decaying body of Vince. Lucifer was actually summoned by one of his feathers they had and kills the Satanists then uses the feather to repair his vessel temporarily. Posing as Vince, Lucifer organizes a concert to murder a lot of people and is confronted by the Winchesters, Crowley and Castiel who are unable to defeat him. Lucifer explains to them that he feels that God only made up with him to defeat the Darkness and has abandoned him once more. Lucifer no longer has a plan except to destroy everything he wants and vacates Vince as his body burns out. In \"LOTUS\", Lucifer begins possessing people of influence, ultimately possessing President of the United States Jefferson Rooney. As the President, Lucifer sends the Secret Service after the Winchesters and engages in sex with Rooney's mistress Kelly, resulting in her becoming pregnant with his child. Crowley kidnaps Kelly who tricks Lucifer to a motel where the Winchesters, Castiel, Crowley and Rowena are waiting for him. After using a sigil to weaken Lucifer, Sam activates a device created by the British Men of Letters that can exorcise any angel or demon from their vessel. Despite Lucifer's attempts to resist, he is exorcised from Rooney and Rowena casts a spell that returns Lucifer to his cage.\n\nAt SDCC 2016, it was affirmed that all Lucifer wants is a \"vacation\", being tired after ruling both Heaven and Hell, and happy that he finally reconciled with his father.\n\nA homage to John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", Lucifer will be portrayed as \"gentle, almost sympathetic\". Kripke reasoned, \"He was essentially betrayed, so in some ways he can be viewed sympathetically ... if we can make the angels dicks, Lucifer can be sympathetic.\" Kripke further characterized him as a \"Devil who has doubt\" and \"a lot of affection for God and the angels\", and who \"speaks really tenderly and gently and...doesn't lie\".\n\nPellegrino was the second choice to play the angel Castiel, losing the role to Misha Collins.\n\nMetatron (Curtis Armstrong) is the angel who wrote the Word of God tablets. According to the demon tablet, he is an Archangel, but Metatron himself claims to be an angel from the secretarial division who was enlisted by God to write the tablets before he left Heaven. God later claims that there was no special reason He chose Metatron, that Metatron was just the closest angel to the door when He walked in. When God left and the Archangels decided to take over everything, Metatron left Heaven and hid on Earth, cutting himself off completely to protect himself and the tablets as he rightly assumed that the Archangels would need him to fulfil their plans. On Earth, Metatron lived among a Native American tribe known as The Two Rivers who he gave immortality in exchange for stories and books. Metatron became enamored by human stories and even though he read as much as an angel is capable of, he hasn't been able to read every story written during the past few millennia he has spent on Earth.\n\nSam and Dean first learn of Metatron when they uncover the Leviathan Word of God tablet and Castiel reveals Metatron wrote them. At the time, Dean considers looking for him for help with the Leviathans. Later, Kevin Tran finds a personal note Metatron left on the demon tablet revealing that there is a compendium of tablets. While trying to find the third trial to close Hell, Sam and Dean track down Metatron and confront him. Metatron initially refuses to help, but after they reveal the story of Kevin Tran, Metatron rescues him from Crowley and heals him. Metatron now knows what is going on in Heaven and the world and agrees to help and along with Kevin, reveals the third trial: curing a demon. He also suggests to Dean that closing Hell may not be the best idea, telling him he needs to consider the impact it will have on the world. Metatron later approaches Castiel to seek his help in dealing with the problems in Heaven. Heaven has degenerated into all out war between various factions and Metatron wants to seal it up. As the Scribe of God, he knows the three trials without the angel tablet, but wants Castiel to do them. The two set out to complete the first trial which is to kill a Nephilim and cut out their heart. Though Castiel hesitates, when the Nephilim overpowers both himself and Metatron, he kills her from behind while she is distracted with Metatron. In \"Sacrifice,\" Metatron reveals that the second trial is to get the bow of a Cupid and as he works with Castiel to get it, he is captured by Naomi. Metatron recognizes Naomi as the angel that was supposed to \"debrief\" him for the Archangels after God left, in reality to get his secrets from his mind. Suspicious of why Metatron has suddenly come out of hiding, Naomi tortures him for information and is shocked to learn that he actually intends to expel all angels from Heaven except himself as revenge for his own expulsion. Naomi rushes off to warn Dean and Castiel, but while she is gone, Metatron breaks free and kills Naomi when she returns. He captures Castiel and takes his Grace as the final component needed for his spell then sends him to Earth to live a human life after asking Castiel to find him and tell him about it when he one day dies. Metatron's plan works and all angels are expelled from Heaven. Sam and Dean learn in \"Heaven Can't Wait\" that Metatron designed the spell to be irreversible and there is apparently no way to put the angels back in Heaven.\n\nMetatron eventually reappears on Earth in the episode \"Holy Terror\" during the struggle of the various angel factions to wrest control and decide the best course to retake and re-enter Heaven. In that time, he convinces Gadreel to join him in the refashioning of the angels' purpose in existence, resulting in Kevin Tran's death and Gadreel's taking full control of Sam's body. In \"Road Trip,\" he employs Gadreel as his assassin, sending him to kill angel guard Thaddeus and Gadreel's friend Abner, presumably as a further test of his loyalty. He is also annoyed by Gadreel not killing Dean and questioning his orders. Metatron waits for Gadreel to return from killing Abner in a bar for hours with Gadreel's former vessel and is surprised when Gadreel suddenly appears in his natural form and repossesses his old vessel. Realizing that Sam has expelled Gadreel, an amused Metatron asks if Gadreel had Winchester troubles. After getting the tablets, Metatron connects himself to the angel tablet, granting him God-like power. Continuing his efforts with Gadreel's help, Metatron recruits a following and begins writing his own epic \"story\" about how things will go. To this end he captures Castiel during \"Meta Fiction\" and asks him to be the villain in the story in exchange for an unlimited supply of grace as his stolen grace is burning out. Castiel refuses and Metatron is forced to trade Castiel for Gadreel after Sam and Dean capture the latter. With his new powers, Metatron proves immune to their efforts to trap them and lets them go as he doesn't see them as a threat though he is undeterred by this setback. Following this, Castiel gathers his own following to battle Metatron who has Gadreel eliminate other angels who could be a threat to him. As Castiel's following grows stronger than his own, Metatron uses brainwashed suicide bombers in \"Stairway to Heaven\" to convince the other angels that Castiel is not who they should follow. Metatron offers the angels a return to Heaven through a moving portal he has created in return for their fealty to him. After Castiel refuses to kill Dean for supposedly killing the Reaper Tessa, Castiel's followers abandon him for Metatron. However, it also backfires on Metatron in that his methods cause Gadreel to switch sides too. During \"Do You Believe In Miracles?\", after broadcasting to all angels over \"angel radio\", Metatron heads to Earth to convert humanity to following him instead of God by performing various miracles including raising the dead. Dean, armed with the First Blade and powered by the Mark of Cain confronts Metatron as Castiel and Gadreel try to break into Heaven and shatter Metatron's power. With his new power, Metatron proves too powerful for Dean and mortally wounds him. However, before he can finish the job, Gadreel's sacrifice allows Castiel to shatter the angel tablet and Metatron's incredible power, forcing him to flee an attack by Sam. In Heaven, Metatron binds Castiel and taunts him about how the angels are all sheep who will follow him and how he doesn't really care about them. However, Castiel had secretly activated the broadcasting equipment in Metatron's office, causing him to broadcast the truth to all angels. Metatron's own followers turn on and overpower him, but Castiel locks him in Heaven's dungeon rather than kill him. At the same time, his killing of Dean causes him to resurrect as a demon.\n\nIn \"Reichenbach\", Hannah approaches Metatron to see if he has any of Castiel's grace left in hopes of saving him from dying when his stolen grace burns out. Metatron claims there is some left and offers to hand it over in exchange for his freedom, claiming that he will leave the planet if set free. Castiel refuses however and Metatron reveals that he really plans to get revenge once he escapes, though he claims there is some grace left. In \"The Hunter Games\", hoping that Metatron knows of a cure to the Mark, Castiel has him brought to Earth where he and the Winchesters question him for information. Metatron claims there is a cure to the Mark and that it requires the First Blade, but when Dean demands the rest, he reveals that there is a lot of steps and he wants something for each one. Dean tortures Metatron who continues to taunt him into giving in to the Mark's rage, but he is stopped by Castiel and Sam before he can kill him. Castiel returns Metatron to Heaven for safety with Metatron saying that he will choose death over helping again. However, he leaves a possible clue: \"behold, the river shall end at the source.\" In \"Inside Man\", desperate to find a cure for Dean's deteriorating condition, Sam, Castiel and Bobby Singer plot to break Metatron out of prison when the angels refuse to release him to their custody for fear of what he will do if released. On Earth, Metatron taunts them with his leverage over them until Castiel removes his grace, leaving Metatron human and mortal. After Sam shoots him in the leg and Castiel threatens his life, Metatron quickly gives in and admits that he knows of no cure for the Mark, stating that it is God-level or Lucifer-level power and he knows nothing and that not even the tablets contain information on the Mark. Castiel is able to tell that Metatron is telling the truth, but before Sam can kill him, Metatron tells them that he was telling the truth about there being some of Castiel's grace left and offers to lead him to it in exchange for his life. Castiel reluctantly agrees and sets off in search of his grace with Metatron. In \"Book of the Damned\", Metatron and Castiel go on a road trip to find Castiel's grace. Metatron starts to embrace his new humanity, annoying Castiel with his antics and leading to Metatron getting punched. At a diner, they come under attack by an angry Cupid and Metatron kills him to save Castiel, but fails to endear himself to Castiel with his actions. Finally, the two come to a library where Metatron reveals he had another angel hide the grace and leave him clues so no one else could find it or torture the information from him. Searching through the books for one with the title \"what's the most insane thing a man can do?\", Metatron engages Castiel in a conversation, asking him what he will do once he tracks down the remaining rogue angels as Hannah has restored order to Heaven. While Castiel is distracted, Metatron uses his blood to cast a spell that stuns Castiel and retrieves the demon tablet, what he had really come for. However, he discovers that Castiel has found his grace in a copy of \"Don Quixote\" and quickly leaves before he can recover. Castiel gets his grace back and is restored to full power, but he and Sam are left worried by what Metatron can do with the demon tablet despite now being human. They also lie to Dean about how Castiel got his grace back, telling him that Hannah got it out of Metatron and not mentioning his escape. Its later mentioned he got away by stealing Castiel's car.\n\nIn \"Out of the Darkness, Into the Fire\" and \"Into the Void\", the other angels are searching for Metatron to imprison him again while in \"The Bad Seed\", the Winchesters and Castiel reluctantly search for him hoping he has information on The Darkness. To their surprise, they can find no incidents with Castiel's car that indicate that Metatron got in an accident or even got a ticket, surprising Castiel as he didn't expect a former angel and shut-in to be a good driver. In \"Our Little World\", Castiel spots Metatron's reflection in a camera shot of a murder on the news, revealing that Metatron has become a videographer. Castiel tracks Metatron down at the scene of a shooting where Metatron steals the victim's money and bemoans his lack of power which he wouldn't have used to help the man anyway. After healing the man and breaking Metatron's camera, Castiel drags him to an abandoned warehouse where Metatron tells him he has come to see reality as the new literature and himself as the \"author of reality\" in his job as a videographer. Metatron tries to lie about the location of the demon tablet, but Castiel has already found it by simply searching Metatron's apartment where he had it hidden under his mattress. Castiel demands information on the Darkness and while Metatron knows something, he refuses to tell Castiel and taunts him into attacking Metatron. Castiel stops when he realizes that Metatron wants to die and Metatron explains that he can't stand being human. He finally tells Castiel that the Darkness is God's sister who He had to give up to form creation. Castiel lets Metatron go, telling Sam and Dean that he is now a human and a pitiable one at that and is no threat anymore. If Metatron draws any sort of attention to himself, the angels will descend on him and destroy him for his actions.\n\nMonths later in \"Don't Call Me Shurley\", Metatron is living as a homeless vagrant but has gained a more compassionate nature as demonstrated by him feeding a stray dog food he found in a dumpster rather than eating it himself. Metatron and his dog are transported to a bar where Metatron meets with Prophet Chuck Shurley who reveals himself to in fact be God. God doesn't punish Metatron for his rogue actions, though He also refuses to restore Metatron to being an angel, something Metatron admits is probably a good thing. Instead, God asks Metatron to help Him write His autobiography. Metatron helps God work on the autobiography and is stunned by how apathetic God has become to the world and the situation with Amara. After learning that Amara has infected a town with an infection of insanity, Metatron pleads with God to help, now understanding that humanity is God's greatest creation and is better than God because humans have many flaws, but they still try. God apparently refuses to listen, but Metatron reads the end of his autobiography and is shocked by what he reads while God intervenes to stop Amara's infection and to save the Winchesters. In \"All in the Family\", Metatron contacts the Winchesters and warns them that God intends to sacrifice himself to Amara in an attempt to save the universe. Wanting to do whatever he can to save God and humanity, Metatron offers the Winchesters whatever help he can give them and joins Sam and the Prophet Donatello in a rescue mission for Lucifer. As Sam and Lucifer discuss the situation, Metatron casts a spell to release Lucifer from his bindings, but Lucifer is incapable to teleporting them to safety. As Amara approaches, Sam, Lucifer and Donatello flee but Metatron stays behind to hold off Amara and buy them time. Metatron unsuccessfully uses an angel banishing sigil on an amused Amara and asks her to spare the universe as God had only meant well. Telling Metatron \"spare this\", Amara surrounds Metatron in darkness and implodes him into nothingness. After being informed of Metatron's death, Dean admits he's surprised Metatron sacrificed himself for them.\n\nMichael is the oldest and, possibly, most powerful Archangel, featured in the fifth season of \"Supernatural\". In the premiere of the fifth season Zachariah reveals the angels' plan is for Michael to use Dean as his vessel and kill Lucifer once and for all. However, Dean needs to give his consent to be the vessel. Michael refers to Lucifer as his younger brother and when Lucifer refused God's command to bow before humanity, he turned to Michael for support, but was refused. On God's command, Michael cast Lucifer into Hell. Michael first appears when Sam, Dean, and Castiel have traveled back to 1977 to stop Anna from killing John and Mary in order to prevent Sam's birth, and thus his use as Lucifer's vessel. When the angels develop a new plan to lure Dean into consenting in \"Point of No Return\", the angels bring back Adam, John Winchester's third son, under the pretense that he can be Michael's new vessel, but this is merely a ruse to get Dean to say yes. Zachariah tortures Sam and Adam until Dean consents. Zachariah then summons Michael from Heaven, but Dean changes his mind, kills Zachariah and attempts to escape. Adam is inadvertently locked inside while Michael descends, and the room and Adam disappear. In \"Two Minutes to Midnight\", Castiel confirmed that now Michael is taking Adam as his vessel. During the episode \"Swan Song\", Michael appears with Adam as his vessel in order to fight Lucifer, but gets interrupted by Dean, Bobby, and Castiel, who delay him by sending him away with holy fire. In a couple of minutes he returns to see Sam, who has taken control over Lucifer, ready to jump in the pit, and tries to stop him, claiming his destiny is to fight his brother. As Sam denies, Michael makes a final desperate effort to hold him, but is swept along by Sam and they fall into the abyss together. Castiel believes that he and Lucifer tortured Sam's soul in the cage until it was removed by Death one of the horsemen. Michael's first mention of activity since his imprisonment in Hell is mentioned in \"Out of the Darkness, Into the Fire\", in which an aide of Crowley informs him that Michael is wailing, trying to tell others about the danger the Darkness, which recently broke free from its prison, will pose to the world. In \"The Devil in the Details\", Lucifer tells Sam that \"prison life\" hasn't agreed with Michael and indicates that Michael's time in the Cage has driven him insane. When talking about their coming battle with the Darkness, God echoes this, telling the Winchesters that Michael is in no shape to fight a battle.\n\nNaomi, portrayed by Amanda Tapping, is a \"cool\", \"mysterious\", and \"polished\" villain affiliated with a previously unknown faction of angels, eventually revealed to be \"Heaven's intelligence division,\" a group tasked with secretly brainwashing angels and altering their memories to keep them both in-line with Heaven's orders and oblivious to the truth of their actions and goals. When Naomi was being cast, the character was compared to \"The Good Shepherd\"'s antihero Edward Wilson, Sr. (Matt Damon), in that she is \"willing to sacrifice everything for the greater good.\" In his 2014 revision of \"The Essential Supernatural: On the Road with Sam and Dean Winchester\", Nicholas Knight described her as \"a powerful angel...ruthless in her quest to prevent the angel tablet from falling into the wrong hands\". Despite her role as an antagonist, Knight noted that Naomi \"quickly became one of the most enigmatic and popular new characters of the (eighth) season.\"\n\nNaomi first appears at the end of the episode \"A Little Slice of Kevin\", where she claims responsibility for Castiel's mysterious return from Purgatory though he cannot remember her, and demonstrates her complete control over his actions by command. Although she tells him off-screen that she is the current ruler of Heaven, Metatron later claims that she is only one of many faction leaders at war with each other. In \"Torn and Frayed\", Naomi tasks Castiel with rescuing Samandriel after she gets a distress call from the latter when he is under torture from Crowley. Upon learning that Samandriel has revealed the existence of the angel Word of God tablet to Crowley, however, she forces Castiel to kill the other angel, which she justifies by emphasizing the tablet's importance and that any angel would die to protect it, calling Samandriel a traitor for divulging information about it. Prior to his death, Samandriel had been trying to tell Castiel something about Naomi, triggering a memory of Castiel's in which Naomi was approaching his eye with a mysterious instrument resembling a drill while he was restrained and screaming. Noticing Castiel's strange actions and behavior, the Winchesters become suspicious that Castiel is being controlled. \"Goodbye Stranger\" opens with the revelation that Naomi has been working on fully indoctrinating Castiel to her control, and determines him to be \"ready\" once he kills thousands of copies of Dean. She then sends him to get the angel tablet before Crowley can. After he finds the tablet and she orders him to kill Dean, Castiel manages to fight her control and eventually breaks it by touching the tablet. He tells Dean about her before going into hiding to protect the tablet. In an encounter with Crowley, Naomi says that Castiel is doing what he is meant to do: protect the tablet, even if it means protecting it from her. She is later shown to be searching for Castiel to find the tablet.\n\nIn \"Taxi Driver,\" Naomi meets with Dean to try to convince him that she is on his side, claiming that Castiel had misinformed him about her due to his mental instability, and that she wants to help Castiel; Dean doesn't believe her. Nonetheless, Naomi tips him off to the danger Sam is in and later saves Sam and Dean from Crowley, driving the demon off and helping the Winchesters complete the second trial to seal Hell by enabling a trapped Bobby's soul to ascend to Heaven. She reiterates that Dean can trust her and that they all share the goal of sealing Hell. Naomi and her angels eventually slaughter the patrons of a restaurant they know Castiel is passing through, and leave one alive but traumatized in order to make him stop long enough for them to capture him; Naomi kills the survivor afterward, rejecting Castiel's angry reminder that they (angels) are supposed to guard humans. She interrogates Castiel about the location of the tablet, and reveals that she has been altering and erasing his memories for longer than believed, complaining that he has never functioned as he was supposed to. She flees when Crowley attacks her men and fires at her with a gun loaded with melted-down angel blades. In the eighth-season finale, Naomi learns that Metatron is working with Castiel, prompting her to capture the rogue angel and use her drill-like instrument to access his thoughts and learn his plans; when she finds out what they are, she is horrified and immediately warns Dean and Castiel, revealing that Metatron is not trying to close the gates of Heaven, but rather trying to permanently expel all angels in revenge for having himself had to flee to escape her and the archangels, who had ordered her to detain him and take the knowledge he had as the Scribe of God after God left Heaven. Naomi expresses remorse for her actions and that of the other angels, saying that angels are meant to protect humanity and they have lost sight of that somewhere along the way. To begin making amends, she warns Dean that if Sam completes the trials, he will die, and then offers to hear Castiel out if he truly wishes to return to Heaven. As they can't confirm her claims, Castiel refuses to believe her, though Dean does and ultimately stops Sam from completing the trials. Naomi is later found collapsed on her desk in her \"office\" in Heaven, Metatron having gotten free and stabbed her in the head with her own drill off-screen. Metatron taunts Castiel that she had been telling the truth, and then completes his plan. Naomi is confirmed dead through dialogue in the episode \"I'm No Angel\" in the ninth season.\n\nRaphael is the archangel assigned to protecting Chuck Shurley. Raphael appears to protect Chuck twice, in \"The Monster at the End of the Book\", when he is in the presence of Lilith, and in \"Lucifer Rising\", where he kills Castiel as he and Dean attempt to prevent Lucifer's rise. He is summoned and subsequently trapped by Dean and a resurrected Castiel in the fifth-season episode \"Free to Be Me and You\", but refuses to cooperate when they demand to know the location of God, only saying that he believes that God is dead. Dean and Castiel leave Raphael trapped despite his threat to hunt Castiel down when he escapes. In this episode, Raphael appears for the first time in a bodily vessel and is played by actor Demore Barnes, who reprises the role in \"The Third Man\" and \"The Man Who Would Be King\". Following the prevention of the Apocalypse, Raphael and his supporters are at war with Castiel and his followers over Castiel's opposition to Raphael's plan to free Lucifer and Michael to restart the Apocalypse. He makes his second on-screen appearance in the sixth-season episode \"The Third Man\", in which he and his soldiers are in close pursuit of Castiel. Raphael overpowers Castiel and is about to kill him when Balthazar intervenes and irrevocably destroys Raphael's vessel with one of Heaven's weapons, saving Castiel's life. Raphael is forced to search for a new vessel, eventually possessing a woman played by Lanette Ware. In \"The French Mistake\", he sends the angel hitman Virgil after Castiel's allies, including the Winchesters. Balthazar transports the brothers to an alternate universe with a key to where Heaven's weapons are stored and Virgil follows. This is revealed to have been a ploy by Balthazar and Castiel, allowing the latter time to retrieve the weapons. Now equipped with the weapons, Castiel forces Raphael to flee when the latter is poised to kill a returned Sam and Dean. Flashbacks in \"The Man Who Would Be King\" depicts the background to Raphael's war with Castiel; Raphael believed that the Apocalypse was destined to happen and informed Castiel of his intention to release Lucifer and Michael from the cage, giving Castiel the ultimatum to submit or die. Having forged a deal with the demon Crowley, Castiel attacked Raphael and declared war in Heaven. In the season six finale, \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\", Castiel reneges on his deal with Crowley, who turns to Raphael. Crowley agrees to open Purgatory for Raphael in exchange for his safety. However their ritual fails whilst Castiel opens Purgatory for himself. Castiel appears, now more powerful than ever, and obliterates Raphael with a snap of his fingers. In \"We Happy Few\", when discussing how they will defeat the Darkness, God tells the Winchesters that he can't resurrect Raphael or Gabriel as they are beings of primordial creation and will take too long to bring back.\n\nSamandriel, aka \"Alfie\", portrayed by Tyler Johnston, is an angel who seems to hold humanity in higher regard than most angels and appears to hold Castiel in great regard as well. He appears at Plutus' auction in \"What's Up, Tiger Mommy?\" to bid for the demon Word of God tablet, taking the vessel of a young man named Alfie. He asks Dean about Castiel and is noticeably saddened that Castiel didn't make it out of Purgatory. Samandriel indicates that he supports Castiel and tells Dean that he thinks Castiel's problem is he has too much heart. Samandriel bids for the Word of God, but loses. After Mrs. Tran wins by bidding her soul, Samandriel approaches her to offer angelic protection to Kevin, but she refuses which he respects. In \"A Little Slice of Kevin,\" Samandriel has been captured by Crowley who tortures him for the names of all future Prophets with an angel sword. Samandriel breaks under the torture and tells him all the names, but Crowley is not satisfied until Samandriel reveals that the next generation of Prophets haven't been born yet and thus there are no more. Crowley stops the torture without urgency and orders Samandriel put \"on ice\" for future torture, believing he can get more out of him. In \"Torn and Frayed,\" Samandriel manages to push a spike out of his head that is blocking his connection to the other angels and sends a distress signal to Naomi. However, the demon Viggor discovers him and replaces the spike and starts torturing him again using headgear that puts a lot of spikes into Samandriel's head. The spikes cause Samandriel to revert to \"factory settings\" and he starts speaking in Enochian, in his distress speaking through a bush that catches fire. Viggor summons Crowley who tortures Samandriel personally to see what he can get from him when he's at \"factory settings.\" As Sam, Dean and Castiel launch a rescue, Samandriel starts talking about the Word of God tablets and just before they manage to break into the room, Samandriel reveals that there is an angel tablet. As Sam and Dean kill Viggor and another demon, Castiel removes the headgear from Samandriel, returning him to normal and takes him outside. Fearful of what he has revealed, Samandriel begs Castiel not to take him back to Heaven and warns Castiel that \"they\" are controlling them both. Before Samandriel can elaborate, Naomi orders Castiel to kill him for being a traitor. With no other choice, Castiel stabs Samandriel with his angel sword, killing him. Naomi has Castiel take Samandriel's body to Heaven so she can determine just how much he broke and explains that he is a traitor as he revealed the existence of the angel tablet which any angel would die to protect as it could cause great harm if it fell into demon hands.\n\nTessa is a reaper who guides the deceased to the afterlife. She is portrayed by Lindsey McKeon. Following the car accident in the first-season finale, Dean is critically wounded and his soul leaves his body. Dean attempts to save other souls and defends himself from a reaper. The reaper then returns in the form of Tessa, posing as a coma patient. She attempts to convince Dean to move on but, as he considers this, Azazel intervenes as part of his deal with John Winchester and possesses Tessa to restore Dean to life, although Dean remembers none of this. In the season four episode \"Death Takes a Holiday\", she continues the work of a local reaper who has gone missing. After restoring Dean's memories of her with a kiss, she assists the brothers and agrees not to reap the souls for the duration. She is kidnapped by Alastair as part of a ritual to unlock a seal, but Dean and Sam rescue her. After getting Dean to help her have a young boy named Cole move on from being a ghost, she warns Dean that the angels are not looking for his best interest and to trust his own instincts. In \"Appointment in Samarra\", Dean summons Tessa during an out-of-body experience and asks her to call Death. Although she refuses, Death arrives on his own accord. Subsequently, Tessa guides Dean in his role as Death for 24 hours as part of a wager made with the Horseman in order to retrieve Sam's soul. Tessa returns in \"Stairway to Heaven\" where she is a part of Castiel's faction to retake Heaven. She has grown depressed over the fact that she can no longer ferry souls to Heaven due to it being closed and that she can hear their cries for help and is brainwashed by Metatron into acting as a suicide bomber for him, supposedly under Castiel's instruction in order to unite all the angels under his command. Tessa is found and captured by Dean before she can do this and her \"bomb\" is defused. Dean questions Tessa who, under her brainwashing, insists she is doing it for Castiel. When Dean pulls the First Blade on her, Tessa commits suicide by impaling herself on the Blade while Dean is holding it, thanking him at the same time. Her method of suicide makes it appear that Dean murdered her and helps turn Castiel's followers against him.\n\nDemons in the series are generally portrayed as cruel and sadistic, often taking pleasure in causing humans pain. They are also, as series creator Eric Kripke deems them, \"erudite and sophisticated\". While the \"tyrant\" Azazel commanded the demons in the first two seasons, demons as a whole became the villains of the third season. At times their culture has been compared to normal humans, with the third-season episode \"Sin City\" introducing their religious side. They believe in their own higher power—Lucifer. Though many demons came to lose faith, they followed the fallen angel upon his release from Hell in the fifth season.\n\nInspirations for these types of demons have come from numerous sources, such as the devil-on-your-shoulder concept used in the episode \"Sin City\". The writers often try to base the demons off of actual aspects of history, as is done in \"Malleus Maleficarum\" by having the demon Tammi turn a group of women into witches. An encyclopedia on demons is used for research, with \"Binsfield's Classification of Demons\" inspiring \"The Magnificent Seven\"'s storyline of seven demons being the physical embodiment of the Seven Deadly Sins.\n\nThe writers originally intended for demons to not rely on human hosts, but rather exist \"halfway between spirits and corporeal creatures\". However, the demon featured in \"Phantom Traveler\" demonstrated the ability to possess people—this quality and its other characteristics were chosen without foresight solely to fit with the episode's storyline—and the writers opted to maintain it as an element of all demons. Kripke feels this added an interesting aspect to the storylines, as the viewers \"never quite know who the bad guy is\". Another source of debate for the writers stemmed from the demons' eye color, which is based on a demon's place in the hierarchy. The writers prefer to limit unique colors to only the \"big, big, bad guys\". Writer Sera Gamble noted, \"If every time we had a demon that was powerful we gave them a different eye color, pretty soon it'd be like, 'The Chartreuse-Eyed Demon is coming for us!'\" During production of the second season, Kripke viewed the horror film \"I Walked with a Zombie\", and found one of the creatures having all-white eyes to be \"really disturbing\". The writers considered changing the eye color of regular demons to white, but eventually decided against it. However, Kripke later used the idea when Lilith and other high-level demons were introduced.\nThe appearance of demons' true forms have become more complex as the series has progressed. Originally depicted as small, thin streams of black smoke, they now appear as large, thick smoke clouds. When in large groups, the clouds have electricity pulsing throughout them. The visual effects department based the demons' shape off of that of a snake, giving it a \"predatorial\" and \"intelligent\" look. Visual effects supervisor Ivan Hayden finds demon smoke to be one of the hardest visual effects in the series.\nPrimarily portrayed by actress Alaina Huffman, Abaddon is described as the last remaining Knight of Hell, a class of incredibly powerful demons who were among the first of their kind. As such, Abaddon is too strong to be affected by exorcisms or to be killed by Ruby's knife. She is introduced in the eighth-season episode \"As Time Goes By\", in which she is sent to destroy the Men of Letters organization in 1958 and sets off in dogged pursuit of Sam and Dean's grandfather, Henry, who has escaped with the key to the Men of Letters' bunker. Wanting to break into the bunker to gain access to the powerful supernatural spells and artifacts inside, Abaddon follows Henry through time to the present and hunts him and his grandsons throughout the episode. She takes Sam hostage to force Dean to turn over Henry and the key, but reneges on her deal to let Sam and Dean go after Dean trades her Henry and the key. In the confrontation that follows, Abaddon mortally wounds Henry, but not before he shoots her in the head with a bullet engraved with a devil's trap that binds her powers and also binds her to her now-paralyzed host body. Sam and Dean then cut her up and bury her in cement to forever entomb her. In \"Clip Show\", needing a demon to cure to do the third trial to close the gates of Hell, Sam and Dean sew Abaddon back together to use her, but do not reattach her hands or remove the bullet. Abaddon reveals that she had been sent to kill the priest who found a way to cure demons and had found out about the Men of Letters and her host, Josie Sands, from him when torturing him, which ultimately resulted in her possessing Josie and attacking the Men of Letters. While Sam and Dean take a phone call from Crowley outside, Abaddon frees herself and escapes by controlling one of her severed hands and using it to remove the bullet from her skull. In the following episode, the season finale \"Sacrifice\", she arrives in response to Crowley's distress call but attacks him rather than help him, furious that Crowley now rules Hell and declaring her intention of taking over herself, only to be driven away when Sam sets her ablaze in holy fire.\n\nAbaddon returns in the ninth season, her objectives now to kill Crowley in order to become the Queen of Hell and \"turn all of humankind into her demon army.\" With Crowley being largely absent from Hell and having been deeply affected by the incomplete demon cure forced on him by the Winchesters, the intimidating Abaddon ends up winning the nearly unanimous support of other demons. In \"First Born\", Crowley and Dean go to her maker, teacher, and former lover, Cain, to get his Mark and the First Blade from him—the Blade, when wielded by someone bearing the Mark of Cain, is stated to be the only weapon capable of killing Abaddon—and Cain reveals that Abaddon, after failing to persuade him to rejoin her, had tricked him into murdering his beloved human wife Colette; as he is unable to seek revenge directly due to a promise he had made to Colette, he gives Dean the Mark so that Dean can kill Abaddon once Crowley finds the Blade. \"Mother's Little Helper\" reveals that Abaddon's history with the Men of Letters goes back further than previously thought, as Abaddon had been confronted by Henry and Josie when stealing people's souls at a convent sometime before her slaughter of the Men of Letters. She intended to possess Henry to spy on the Men of Letters before destroying them, but accepted Josie's offer and possessed her instead, all without Henry's knowledge. In the present, Abaddon has given the order for her minions to begin stealing souls again in order to build an army of demons loyal only to her. In attempt to eliminate all threats posed to her and her rule, Abaddon concocts a plan to kill Crowley and the Winchesters and to destroy the First Blade, by first bringing Crowley's human son Gavin forward in time and torturing him until Crowley agrees to help her set up a trap for Sam and Dean. She has him send the Winchesters to retrieve the First Blade and then lead them to her so that she can destroy them all at once, though Crowley manages to subtly warn Dean of the trap. Although unaware of the double-cross, Abaddon incapacitates Crowley by shooting him with a devil's trap bullet in order to keep him from interfering in the upcoming fight, planning to kill him and his son once she has killed the Winchesters. She is slain by Dean wielding the First Blade when the Mark grants Dean new powers that enable him to overcome her attacks. Following Abaddon's death, all demons go back to following Crowley. Despite this, some demons remain loyal to her and outraged at Dean killing her, try to ambush him in \"Black\" only to be easily killed themselves.\n\nExecutive producer and series writer Adam Glass revealed on Twitter that his inspiration for Abaddon was Lauren Bacall, an actress whom he admires. Showrunner Jeremy Carver went into the character's motivation, explaining that Abaddon was \"appalled\" to find that Crowley ruled over Hell because she \"loves Hell and what it represents.\" He believed that the contrasts in the two characters's views incited \"a nice conflict to our demon world.\"\n\nCain, (portrayed by Timothy Omundson) was the First Son of Adam and Eve who killed his brother Abel. While everyone believed that Cain had killed Abel because he was talking to God, Cain actually killed him because he was talking to Lucifer. Loving his brother, Cain made a deal with Lucifer: Abel's soul in Heaven in exchange for Cain becoming the first Knight of Hell while wielding the Mark of Cain. However, as part of the deal, Cain had to kill Abel personally. Afterwards, feeling remorse for his actions Cain took his own life, but the Mark resurrected him as a very powerful demon. For thousands of years, Cain was the worst of the worst, gaining the title Father of Murder and training the rest of the Knights of Hell. Eventually, Cain fell in love with a human woman, Colette, and gave up his evil ways for her, suppressing the Mark's influence on him to slaughter people. In 1863, the other Knights kidnapped Colette to force Cain back to his old ways. Cain slaughtered all of the Knights, but when he got to Abaddon, she possessed Colette and tricked Cain into killing his wife. Due to Colette's dying request, Cain didn't go after Abaddon for revenge and threw the First Blade to the bottom of the Marianas Trench as it couldn't be destroyed, eventually settling in Missouri. In \"First Born\", while looking for the First Blade to kill Abaddon, Dean and Crowley tracked down Cain and asked for the First Blade. Cain was uninterested in helping them, wanting to keep his promise to Colette, but watched as Dean fought and killed three demons single-handedly. Impressed, Cain told Dean and Crowley his story, but still refused to help at first. Eventually, after speaking to Colette's grave, Cain chose to help by giving Dean the Mark of Cain so that he could wield the First Blade himself and kill Abaddon. In return, he asked Dean to kill him afterwards before sending Dean and Crowley away and taking on Abaddon's army single-handedly. In \"The Executioner's Song\", its revealed that killing Abaddon's demons caused Cain to fall back under the influence of the Mark of Cain. Giving into its rage, Cain decided that as so many of his descendants were killers and other sorts of criminals, he'd wipe out his bloodline, despite it being \"legion.\" Cain killed many people, eventually being discovered by Sam and Dean when he kidnapped serial killer Tommy Tolliver. Cain confronted Castiel at the site of his victims' graves, but let him go so that Castiel would tell Dean who would bring the First Blade to kill him. Going after Tommy's son, Austin, Cain was lured into a devil's trap by Dean, Sam, Castiel and Crowley, after which Dean confronted him alone. Cain claimed to Dean that there was no cure for the Mark of Cain and it was better to give into its rage. Dean and Cain fought, but Cain proved more powerful and easily beat Dean, eventually getting the First Blade for himself. Before he could kill Dean, Dean managed to get Cain's knife and cut off his hand. Cain refused to give up killing, forcing Dean to kill him. While Dean retained his humanity, Cain's descent into madness left both him and Sam deeply worried.\n\nChristian Campbell, portrayed by Corin Nemec, is a hunter, and a third cousin related to Sam and Dean's mother's side of the family.\nHe is introduced to Dean along with the other Campbells in \"Exile on Main Street\" and helps Samuel trap the female Djinn.\nHe is present in the compound in \"Two and a Half Men\", and it is agreed that he and his wife will raise the baby Shapeshifter despite Dean's objections. However, the Alpha Shapeshifter arrives, overpowers the hunters and takes back the baby. In \"Family Matters\", Christian discovers Dean investigating Samuel and the two exchange threats. Later, his neck is snapped by the Alpha Vampire. It is then revealed that he has been possessed by a demon for some time and he and others overpower and remove the Alpha. Christian is working at Crowley's prison in \"Caged Heat\" and tortures the Lucifer loyalist Meg for information. However, she refuses to divulge and Christian is killed from behind by Dean using Ruby's knife.\n\nA specific crossroads demon recurred throughout the second and third seasons of the series, possessing only young, beautiful women as her host. Actresses Christie Laing and Jeannette Sousa first portray her in \"Crossroad Blues\". Laing plays the demon in flashbacks depicting musician Robert Johnson selling his soul to learn to play the guitar, while Sousa portrays the demon in the present. The latter is summoned by Dean in an attempt to rescue a man from a demonic pact previously made. She rejects Dean's plea, instead taunting him about his father's suffering in Hell. Dean tricks her into walking into a Devil's Trap, and frees her in exchange for releasing the man from his contract. The demon returns again in the second-season finale \"All Hell Breaks Loose, Part 2\", now in possession of a woman portrayed by Ona Grauer. She resurrects Sam in exchange for collecting Dean's soul in one year.\n\nShe makes her final appearance in \"Bedtime Stories\", now portrayed by Sandra McCoy. At the end of the episode, Sam summons her and demands she break her deal with Dean in exchange for her life. She claims to not hold the contract, being just an employee with a boss to answer to. A frustrated Sam kills the demon with the mystical Colt gun. McCoy was dating lead actor Jared Padalecki at that time after having worked with him on the 2005 film \"Cry Wolf\". She previously auditioned for several love interests of the brothers, but believed that production had waited until the \"perfect role\" arrived before casting her due to their relationship.\n\nHunters are women and men who spend their lives hunting supernatural creatures and attempting to save those affected by these creatures. Most appear to have had some kind of negative encounter with the supernatural (for example a relative being killed by demons, a spouse being possessed by a demon, or a sibling being turned by a vampire), which prompts them to become hunters. While hunters, by their nature, operate 'off-the-grid' (typically hunters support themselves via credit card fraud, although some have been shown to have actual jobs, such as the Singer Salvage Yard), there are, nevertheless, hunter communities that meet and interact with each other to exchange information and stories; the Harvelle Roadhouse was one such location until it was burnt down. Typically, hunters find cases by consulting newspapers to track down information about suspicious deaths in certain areas. Some cases come about thanks to contact with people they knew before becoming hunters or contact with people they helped during previous hunts who turn to them for their expertise. Some hunters are shown to have particular targets, such as Sam and Dean's initial hunts in the show's first two seasons focusing on tracking the Yellow Eyed Demon who killed Dean and Sam's parents, or Gordon Walker 'specializing' in hunting vampires.\n\nCharlie (played by Felicia Day) first crosses paths with Sam and Dean when working as an I.T. expert at Richard Roman Enterprises. She is initially reluctant to get involved in the supernatural world by helping the Winchesters, but becomes a more reliable ally in her second episode and has decided to become a hunter herself by her fourth episode. She quickly becomes a friend and even a surrogate little sister to the Winchesters. By the end of \"The Girl with the Dungeons and Dragons Tattoo\", it is revealed that her real name is not Charlie Bradbury but merely one of her aliases, and that she has had to go into hiding before. \"Pac-Man Fever\" delves into her past and it is indicated that \"Charlie's\" true surname is Middleton. \"There's No Place Like Home\" reveals that Charlie's given name is in fact Celeste Middleton. She is the only prominent LGBT character on the show; in her first episode, she informs the brothers she is lesbian when she is asked to flirt with a male guard to gain access to a restricted area.\n\nCharlie's first appearance is in the season seven episode \"The Girl with the Dungeons and Dragons Tattoo\", where Dick Roman asks her to decrypt Frank Devereaux's hard drive. Once she succeeds, she starts reading files describing the Leviathans and their activities, including their connection to Dick Roman. Although she doesn't believe it at first, she realizes the truth when she witnesses a leviathan eat her supervisor and shapeshift to replace him—something Dick explains they cannot do to Charlie, as she possesses a rare \"spark\" that can't be perfectly replicated. Sam and Dean recruit a terrified Charlie to retrieve Frank's hard drive to protect the information there, as well as to break into Dick's office and hack his emails to gain information for their side. She does so, which alerts Sam and Dean to a secret package meant for Dick which they then steal (the package is later revealed to hold the secret to defeating the leviathan). She is nearly killed when Dick realizes her duplicity, but is saved by Bobby's ghost holding the leviathan off—breaking Charlie's arm in the process—whilst Sam and Dean arrive and rescue her. She leaves after telling Sam and Dean not to contact her again.\n\nCharlie reappears in the season eight episode \"LARP and the Real Girl\". Now under a different alias, Carrie Heinlein, she is the queen of one of four kingdoms of the LARPing game of Moondoor. When two of her \"subjects\" are killed, it draws Sam and Dean's attention and they head to Moondoor. Charlie's initial reaction is to flee and start a new life again, fearing that she will once more become a target for monsters. After learning why Sam and Dean are there, she agrees to help them investigate the deaths and other mysterious injuries that have happened. Charlie is eventually captured by a good fairy named Gilda who has kidnapped her on her master's orders. Charlie is instantly smitten with Gilda. Dean, Sam and Gerry eventually find Charlie with help from the \"prisoner\", only to find that she is making out with Gilda. It is revealed that Gerry is Gilda's master; he has unrequited feelings for Charlie and has bought a spellbook with which to control Gilda and force her to kill other players as part of a scheme to make Charlie fall in love with him. Charlie eventually destroys the book to set Gilda free and render Gerry powerless. Afterward, she and Gilda share a goodbye kiss before Gilda returns to her world with Gerry to have Gerry punished. Charlie decides to stop running and changing her identity and to stay and make a life for once. She tells Sam and Dean to call her if they ever need her help again. The three of them participate in a mock battle between their group and the other LARPers, which Charlie's side wins. Charlie's backstory is explored when she returns in \"Pac-Man Fever\" to give Sam and Dean a case. After she proves to be an excellent shot, Dean takes her as his (temporary) partner instead of Sam, who has become increasingly ill from the trials. Charlie is eventually captured by the creature they are hunting, a type of djinn, who poisons Charlie and places her in a nightmare from which she won't wake up from. In her nightmare, she is trapped in a video game she stole as a kid, recreated, and gave out for free, and where she must endlessly protect her hospitalized mother from super-soldier vampires. It is revealed that her parents had been involved in a car accident when driving over to pick Charlie up from a sleepover, resulting in her father dying and her mother rendered brain-dead. Charlie has been paying for the care of her mother, whom she refuses to let go due to her feelings of guilt over the accident. When Dean takes a potion to enter her nightmare himself to save her, he convinces Charlie that she must let her mother go in order to move on. She then wakes up and in the episode's last scene, takes Dean's advice by having her mother taken off of life-support after reading \"The Hobbit\" aloud to her like her mother did to Charlie as a little girl.\n\nCharlie is called in by the Winchesters for help in the ninth-season episode \"Slumber Party\" in order to reconfigure an ancient computer at the Men of Letters' bunker. A childhood fan of L. Frank Baum's Oz books, Charlie is excited when the real Dorothy is found in the bunker. The group works together to try to find a way to defeat The Wicked Witch of the West. Charlie dies to protect Dean from the Witch, but he has Gadreel bring her back to life and tells her that she had only been knocked out, though she learns the truth anyway from Dorothy; Charlie later agrees to keep her death and subsequent resurrection a secret from Sam so long as Dean agrees to one day explain what had really happened. Charlie and Dorothy eventually devise a way to kill the Witch, but are attacked by Sam and Dean, who are both possessed by the Witch. While Dorothy holds the brothers off, Charlie finds and kills the Witch by stabbing in the head with \"Oz's\" famous ruby slippers before the Witch can let her army in through a portal to Oz. When Dorothy extends an offer to Charlie to come with her to Oz, Charlie jumps at the prospect of finally getting the kind of magic and adventure she wants. After bidding their goodbyes to the brothers, Charlie and Dorothy cross over to Oz, leaving Sam and Dean to speculate if and when they will come back.\n\nIn the season 10 episode \"There's No Place Like Home\", Sam and Dean find out that Charlie is back from Oz and is attacking people who helped cover up her parents deaths. To their surprise, they find there are two Charlie's, a good and a dark Charlie. The good Charlie explains that she and Dorothy fought a war in Oz to free it from evil and in order to win, Charlie made a deal with the Wizard of Oz to split herself into her good and dark sides. Charlie's dark side single-handedly won the war and Dorothy and the Wizard now lead Oz. Now, dark Charlie has come to Earth seeking revenge for her parents deaths, good Charlie following to stop her. As dark Charlie broke the Key to Oz so Charlie couldn't return, she and Sam investigate the Key in hopes of finding a way to fix it, and eventually track down a former Man of Letters named Clive Dylan who was trapped in Oz after discovering the Key. Dean meanwhile tries to protect Russell Wellington, the man who killed Charlie's parents, but Dark Charlie tricks Dean, kills Russell, and follows Dean to Clive's house where they fight and he brutally beats her, hurting Good Charlie who is still connected to her. At the same time, Sam and Charlie learn that the Wizard is in fact Clive's dark side, split from him as Charlie's was. Unable to fix the Key and to save Oz, Clive shoots himself to force the Wizard to Earth to heal Clive and save himself. Unable to defeat the Wizard, Clive signals Charlie to shoot him which she hesitantly does, killing Clive and the Wizard. Sam stops Dean from beating Dark Charlie to death and they are able to reverse the Wizard's spell and reunite the two Charlie's. Afterwards, Charlie, unable to return to Oz, decides to dedicate herself to finding a way to save Dean from the Mark of Cain and forgives his actions.\n\nCharlie returns to the brothers several episodes later, having found an ancient book known as the Book of the Damned, which is said to document every curse as well as their cures. Upon acquiring the book, a group of unknown men, all with the same tattoo on their wrist, begin to pursue her. After a violent encounter with them, Charlie is shot but narrowly escapes, and calls the Winchesters from a telephone booth, informing them of her discovery and injury, mentioning she sewed it back together with dental floss, a testament to her resourcefulness. When reunited, Sam and Charlie begin their attempt to decipher the book's text, as it is written in an unknown ancient language, but Dean insists they stop, and destroy the book entirely, worrying that the Mark will cause him to use the its information to do evil. Sam and Charlie decide not to destroy it but to put it away in a curse box, which will prevent anyone from tracking it down. Meanwhile, Dean goes to find Charlie's pursuers, who Sam had determined to be members of the historically-prominent Styne family. When they attack the house Charlie and the Winchesters had been staying at, Dean instructs Sam to destroy the book before the men can take it. Sam throws the book in the fire, and the trio defeats and kills their attackers. However, it is later revealed he threw another book in, and hid the real book in hopes he could still cure Dean, despite his brother's wishes. When Charlie, Sam and Dean return to the bunker, they are greeted by Castiel, and Charlie is excited to meet him for the first time. Upon hugging him, she comments she had expected him to be shorter. At Charlie's joking request, Castiel heals her carpal tunnel and even her bullet wound without being asked, having gotten his full power back. The four then have a dinner, laughing and enjoying each other's company.\n\nDuring \"Dark Dynasty\", Charlie is called in by Sam to work with Rowena on how to translate the Book of the Damned. Charlie is stunned that Sam lied about destroying the Book and reluctantly agrees to work on translating the \"Book\" behind Dean's back. However, Charlie is forced to work with Rowena who annoys her greatly with her disgust at Charlie being a nerd instead of a witch and her insistence that they are similar. Unable to take it anymore, Charlie asks Castiel to let her go cool off for a while and slips out while he ties up Rowena in another room. Going to a motel, Charlie continues her efforts to translate the Book of the Damned and finally manages to crack the code just before Eldon Styne arrives. Charlie contacts Sam and Dean who tell her to give him the Book which she doesn't have or her notes to save her life. However, unwilling to betray her friends or give the Styne Family the power of the Book, Charlie smashes her Surface and is killed by Eldon. A devastated Sam and Dean find her body soon afterwards. However, unknown to them, Charlie's last act was to email Sam her notes on how to translate the Book, giving them the chance to finish what she started.\n\nIn \"The Prisoner\", following her death, Sam and Dean cremate Charlie in hunter's tradition and Dean decides to slaughter the Styne's in revenge, telling Sam to stop the work on the Book. Sam initially does until he receives Charlie's email and decides to continue. Dean brutally slaughters the Styne family for what they did to Charlie and ultimately kills Eldon, avenging her.\n\nSheriff Donna Hanscum (portrayed by Briana Buckmaster) is the sheriff of Stillwater, Minnesota who, while at first oblivious to the supernatural, became a hunter after two encounters with it. She first appears in \"The Purge\" when Sam and Dean investigate mysterious deaths where overweight people are drained of most of their fat. Donna is portrayed as an overweight woman who has recently been granted a divorce from a man who dumped her for her weight. She helps Sam and Dean early in the investigation, but then goes to a health spa where the owner, a pishtaco, feeds on her fat, causing her to lose ten pounds, something she attributes to fire cupping. Donna, slightly stoned from the roofies she was given, inadvertently blows Sam and Dean's cover at the spa and explains her weight loss to them. After the case is over, Sam and Dean attribute it to a psychopathic serial killer, something Donna accepts.\n\nSeveral months later, during \"Hibbing 911\", Donna goes to a sheriff's retreat in Hibbing, Minnesota, her hometown where she meets Sheriff Jody Mills. The two are partnered up during the retreat and Jody tries to keep Donna out of the case where people are completely consumed by an unknown monster except for their bones. In turn, Donna is annoyed when Jody defends her from her husband who is extremely rude to her and unknowingly makes a rude comment about Jody's own lost husband, something Donna immediately regrets when she realizes what she's done. Donna later sees Sam and Dean who Jody called in and is surprised to recognize them while Jody is shocked to realize Donna knows her friends. Donna eventually finds Sheriff Len Cues over another victim and sees that he is a monster, more specifically a vampire, shocking her. She tells Jody about it and they break into Len's room where Donna finds a clue about the location of the vampire's nest. When Sam and Dean arrive, they are forced to tell Donna the truth about what's going on in Hibbing and what happened in Stillwater. Donna insists on going with them and with the support of Jody, she successfully convinces them to let her go along, though she is a bit unsettled at the idea of having to decapitate the vampires to kill them. The group is captured by the vampires and their leader, Starr, explains that Len used to be their leader, having taught them to use all parts of their prey, before growing a conscience and leaving them. The vampires were trying to lure Len back and when he refuses, Starr kills him. Dean breaks free and kills two of the three vampires, but Starr goes after Jody. Donna, who broke one of the lenses of her glasses and used it to cut herself free, decapitates Starr, saving Jody and quipping \"Hakuna Matata, lady.\" Later, Donna discusses the experience with Jody, saying that knowing monsters are out there makes the world seem bigger and darker. Jody, complimenting Donna's actions, offers to train her to be a hunter, something Donna accepts.\n\nDonna later reappears in \"Plush\", calling in the Winchesters after a man in a bunny mask murdered a local man and the mask won't come off. When her deputy, Doug, is forced to kill the young man, Donna is left horrified as the mask appears to be a cursed object, making the young man another innocent victim. Donna burns the mask and it appears to be over, but a young woman in a court jester's outfit attacks the local football coach and the Winchesters learn that they are dealing with an angry ghost, not a cursed object. Dean is able to break the ghost's possession of the young woman and Donna makes up a story and lets her go as she's innocent. As the Winchesters talk to Rita Johnson, the woman who donated all of the possessed costumes, Donna distracts her son Max. Afterwards, the Winchesters inform her it is the ghost of Chester Johnson, a children's performer who committed suicide a couple of months before. When told that they need to locate and burn the costumes, Donna offers to deal with that with Doug. She is later called by Sam after another possessed victim murders the coach who was in a coma. Donna and Doug locate all of the costumes and burn them, but when Donna calls Sam, he learns she never found a deer's head mask. After Chester's spirit is destroyed, Donna visits the Johnson house with Doug and the Winchesters tell her that as she now has three cases under her belt, she is an official hunter to her great joy. After they leave, Donna apologizes to Doug for her treatment of him due to her bad experience with her ex-husband Doug who was also a cop. Doug forgives her, telling Donna he has baggage too and the two are able to joke around with each other comfortably.\n\nGarth Fitzgerald IV, portrayed by DJ Qualls, is a hunter who generally works alone, although he has teamed up with the Winchester brothers on two occasions. Since Bobby's death and Sam and Dean's subsequent year-long absence, he has taken on Bobby's role as hunter coordinator, although he remains mobile where Bobby maintained a 'home base', carrying various cell phones around with him; he has even started wearing Bobby's hat and attempting to imitate Bobby's old phrases, although this has met with variable success. As part of this, he has started to track hunters via the GPS in their cell phones and assign them cases, something that creeps Sam out but Dean says is \"very Bobby.\" Garth eventually disappears sometime after \"Taxi Driver\" and is found by Sam and Dean in \"Sharp Teeth\" where he reveals that he was turned into a werewolf on a hunt two months before his disappearance and hid it. Garth has joined a pack of werewolves that peacefully coexist with humans and married one named Bess. After Sam and Dean find him, he introduces them to the pack and tries to convince them that everything is fine, however, members of the pack worship Fenris and want to rule over humanity. To this end, they kidnap, Garth, Bess and Sam, planning to murder Garth and Bess and frame Sam and Dean to goad the pack into returning to their old beliefs and bring about Ragnarok. Before the plot can be carried out, Dean comes to their rescue and kills the three werewolves involved. In the aftermath, Garth, who is upset to learn of Kevin's death and blames himself as he wasn't there for him, offers to return to hunting using his new powers to help fight. However, Dean recognizes that not all of the werewolves were bad and tells Garth to stay with his new family where he has found happiness.\n\nGordon Walker, portrayed by Sterling K. Brown, is a vampire hunter whose methods often put him at odds with the Winchester brothers. Gordon focuses on eliminating the supernatural simply because it isn't human, where the Winchesters—particularly as the series develops—are more willing to tolerate supernatural entities that are not actively killing humans. Gordon takes pleasure in considering himself a killer who freely resorts to torture, where Sam and Dean regard themselves as Hunters who only kill when they must and do nothing to their enemies that the situation doesn't force upon them.\n\nWhen Gordon was 18 years old, a vampire broke into his house and abducted his sister. Gordon ran away from home, learned how to fight, hunt, and kill vampires, and tracked down the vampire who had taken his sister. He killed the vampire, and his sister, who had been turned, marking the beginning of his hatred for the undead. At some point during his career as a hunter, Gordon met John Winchester and Ellen Harvelle. Ellen described him as a skilled hunter in the sense that Hannibal Lecter is a good psychiatrist, being good at his job but dangerous to everyone else around him.\n\nGordon is introduced in the episode \"Bloodlust\", meeting up with Sam and Dean while hunting a nest of vampires. At first, Dean bonds with Gordon, but Gordon proves himself to be bloodthirsty and sadistic as he tortures one of the captured vampires, even though he knows these particular vampires feed off cattle blood and do not kill humans. After Gordon tries to force one of the vampires to drink Sam's blood while torturing her with dead man's blood, Dean, seeing the vampire resist the urge, ends up beating Gordon in a fight and leaves Gordon tied to a chair while the vampires escape. Later, while performing an exorcism, Gordon learns about the coming demonic war, Azazel's special children, and Sam's powers. In \"Hunted\", he kills Scott Carey- another of the 'special children'- and then tracks Sam down and tries to kill him, convinced that Sam and those like him are 'traitors' to humanity. However, Dean intervenes, and, after a scuffle, Gordon knocks Dean out, ties him up, and uses him as bait to catch Sam in a booby trap of grenades set with trip wires. Sam manages to evade the trap and knocks Gordon out. As the brothers leave the damaged house, Gordon regains consciousness and chases them, firing two pistols in their direction. The police arrive to subdue Gordon, based on an anonymous tip from Sam, and find his cache of weapons in his car.\n\nIn \"Bad Day at Black Rock,\" Gordon is shown to be in prison, where he convinces a visiting fellow hunter to go after Sam Winchester, convinced that Sam was involved in the opening of the Devil's Trap regardless of Bobby's claims that Sam was actually trying to stop it. Gordon eventually escapes from prison and, once again, pursues the Winchester brothers in \"Fresh Blood\". However, he is captured and subsequently turned by a vampire. Gordon, however, turns on his sire, kills two other vampires, and then sets up a trap for the Winchester brothers, still convinced it is his duty as a hunter to rid the world of Sam Winchester. A fight ensues in a warehouse where Gordon holds a girl he has kidnapped—and turned—to use as bait, ending with Sam decapitating him with a garotte improvised out of razor wire.\n\nAccording to series creator Eric Kripke, Gordon was originally going to learn about the hunter Sam killed while possessed and use it to convince more hunters to turn against Sam. This was intended to be a story arc stretching over multiple episodes. However, Sterling K. Brown was contracted for the Lifetime Television series \"Army Wives\", and Lifetime would only allow him to return to \"Supernatural\" for two more episodes.\n\nGwen Campbell, portrayed by Jessica Heafey, is a hunter and third cousin related to Sam and Dean's mother's side of the family. When Sam re-enters Dean's life in \"Exile on Main Street\", he reveals that he has been back for a year and hunting with the Campbells, including Gwen. She and the others assist the brothers in defeating a Djinn. Gwen is present at the compound in \"Two and a Half Men\" when the brothers arrive with a baby Shapeshifter, and is overpowered, along with the others, when the Alpha Shapeshifter arrives. When hunting the Alpha Vampire in \"Family Matters\", she is ordered to stay behind and flush out any stragglers with Dean. She and Dean fight well together, and she covers for Dean when he disobeys orders. However, she sides with Samuel at the end of the episode when she holds the Winchesters at gunpoint, and follows him even when it is revealed that he has been working for Crowley. She is next seen in \"...And Then There Were None\", hunting with Samuel. While investigating a series of murders, they encounter Bobby, Rufus, Sam and Dean. Gwen tells Dean that she did not know that Samuel had betrayed them to Crowley. The creature responsible for the deaths—dubbed the Khan Worm—infects Dean, who kills Gwen.\n\nMary Winchester (née Campbell) regularly portrayed by Samantha Smith but depicted by Amy Gumenick in the time-travel episodes \"In the Beginning\" and \"The Song Remains the Same\", is the wife of John Winchester and mother of Sam and Dean. She was born in 1954 to Samuel and Deanna Campbell, who were hunters, and she was raised into a life of hunting. Dean, sent back in time by the angel Castiel, unknowingly brings Mary to Azazel's attention through his actions. Azazel kills her parents and then-boyfriend John Winchester (a non-hunter unaware of Mary's hunter lifestyle), after which he bargains with Mary for John's life, offering to resurrect John if she allows him to enter her house ten years later. Not knowing Azazel's intentions, she agrees, eventually marrying John and leaving the life of a hunter. Sometime afterward, when she is pregnant with Dean, the adult Dean and Sam visit her again to warn her of Anna Milton, who intends to kill Mary before she could give birth to her sons and thus avert the Apocalypse. She is successfully protected when Michael possesses John to kill Anna, then erases Mary's memories so history remains the same.\n\nIn the pilot episode, six months after Sam's birth in 1983, Mary was awakened by sounds of him crying in his crib. She discovered Azazel there - later revealed to have been feeding Sam his demonic blood - and confronted him, but was pinned to the ceiling by him and slashed across her abdomen, eventually bursting into flames. According to \"The Kids Are Alright\", Azazel then killed all of her remaining friends and acquaintances, presumably so her children would not have any leads as to her death. It is revealed in \"Home\" that Mary has been acting as a guardian spirit of the Winchesters' old home in Lawrence, Kansas. She fights the poltergeist haunting the house and forces both spirits to leave.\n\nAs a thank-you gift for making her and God reconcile in \"Alpha and Omega\", the Darkness brings back Mary as she appeared at the time of her death. She is informed by Dean about the events that transpired in the 33 years since her death; to her dismay, she learns that John is dead and that her efforts to protect her family from the hunter world are futile.\n\nAccording to series creator Eric Kripke, her relation to Azazel was supposed to be addressed in the third season, but was pushed back to the fourth season due to the 2007-08 writer's strike.\n\nRufus Turner, portrayed by Steven Williams, is semi-retired hunter who helped Bobby Singer when his wife, Karen Singer, was possessed by a demon. Rufus exorcised the demon and helped cover up Karen's death. It is Rufus who introduced Bobby to the world of the supernatural, and they hunted together for many years until a hunt went wrong in Omaha, Nebraska, and someone important to Rufus died. They became estranged after this. Fifteen years later, Rufus responds to Bobby's request for information on Bela Talbot and helps Dean locate her in \"Time Is On My Side.\" He returns to active hunting after Lucifer rises and the Apocalypse begins.\n\nRufus is introduced in the third-season episode \"Time Is on My Side\" when Bobby, who has not heard from Rufus in about 15 years, receives a phone call in which Rufus alerts him to the whereabouts of Bela Talbot. Dean visits Rufus, even though Sam opposes the idea of hunting for Bela, as they have only a couple of weeks until Dean's deal runs out. Rufus presents Dean with a manila folder on Bela, which gives Dean new and interesting details from her past.\n\nRufus appears off-screen in \"When the Levee Breaks\", when he calls Bobby with news of more of the 66 Seals being broken.\n\nIn \"Good God Y'All\", Rufus heads to a town he thinks is under attack from demons, based on omens of a polluted river and a falling star. He calls Ellen, Jo, and Bobby for help. When Sam and Dean arrive, he and Jo have been separated from Ellen. Jo and Rufus capture Sam, thinking he is possessed. Later, Ellen and Dean are able to help break the spell War has over them. Bobby talks on the phone to Rufus about omens that may indicate the appearance of Death, in \"The Devil You Know\".\n\nIn \"Weekend at Bobby's\", Rufus arrives at Singer Salvage Yard to dispose of the body of an apparently dead Okami. Bobby assists him and helps him evade capture by the FBI. However, the Okami is revealed to still be alive and is subsequently dispatched by Bobby. Afterward, Rufus uses his contacts to uncover information on Crowley's life as a human and later steals a signet ring from a museum which once belonged to Crowley's son as part of Bobby's attempt to regain his soul from the demon. Rufus investigates the same case as the Winchesters and Bobby, in \"...And Then There Were None\". The group later encounters Samuel and Gwen Campbell, and discover that the monster is a new breed created by Eve, the \"Khan Worm.\" After Gwen and Samuel are killed, Rufus is stabbed by a possessed Bobby. As cremation is not undertaken in the Jewish tradition, Rufus is buried in a Jewish cemetery rather than given a Hunter's funeral pyre. Bobby pours some of Rufus' favorite drink—Johnnie Walker Blue Label—on the grave before taking a drink himself.\n\nAfter becoming comatose from being shot in the head by Dick Roman, Bobby relives various memories of Sam, Dean, Karen, his family, and Rufus. Remembering Rufus has a traumatic effect on Bobby, and he reveals to Rufus that he is just a memory appearing in Bobby's comatose mind. While initially disbelieving, Rufus accompanies Bobby in a quest through the past in which Bobby confronts his worst memories to momentarily recover from his gunshot wound.\n\nIn \"Safe House\", flashbacks show a case Bobby and Rufus worked together during the fourth season where Rufus called Bobby for help on an apparent haunted house. However, the two eventually realized they were dealing with a being known as a Soul Eater rather than a ghost. Unable to kill the Soul Eater, Rufus painted a sigil that would trap it, but the Soul Eater pulled Bobby's soul out of his body and into its \"nest\" outside of time and space, using Bobby to attack Rufus. Rufus subdued the possessed Bobby and finished the sigil, trapping the Soul Eater in its nest. He later leaves Bobby the bottle of Johnny Walker Blue found by Sam and Jody Mills in \"Time After Time\" since Bobby was right about what they were dealing with and brushes off Bobby's concerns about how he escaped the nest.\n\nSamuel Campbell, portrayed by Mitch Pileggi, is the maternal grandfather of Sam and Dean Winchester, and Sam Winchester's namesake. He and his wife Deanna are revealed to be hunters in the fourth-season episode \"In the Beginning\", where Dean is transported back in time. Dean discovers that Samuel is being possessed by Azazel, and Samuel dies when Azazel leaves his body.\n\nSamuel returns as a recurring character in the sixth season, where in the premiere, it is revealed that Samuel was brought down from Heaven at the same time Sam was resurrected from Hell. While he claims to have no idea why he was brought back, he, Sam and the other surviving members of the Campbell family are shown to be capturing dangerous supernatural creatures behind Dean's back, instead of killing them.\n\nSamuel, who knows the cure to vampirism, returns during a string of vampire attacks in Limestone, Illinois, after Dean has been turned into a vampire. Knowing that Sam knew about the cure, as well, he concludes that Sam wanted Dean inside the nest to locate the Alpha Vampire, though Sam denies it.\n\nIt is later revealed that Samuel was resurrected by Crowley, and working with him in an attempt to find the location of Purgatory—the afterlife for monsters—in exchange for his daughter's resurrection. After Samuel betrayed the Winchesters when they attempted to kill Crowley, claiming that Mary was the only family that mattered to him, Dean vows to kill his grandfather the next time they meet.\n\nA case he worked during his year spent hunting with Sam is seen in the episode, \"Unforgiven\", during which Samuel was shown to be disturbed at soulless-Sam's actions, using one of their current allies as bait to trap a monster.\n\nIn \"...And Then There Were None\", Samuel and Gwen encounter Sam, Dean, Rufus, and Bobby as they all investigate the same case. Sam prevents Dean from killing Samuel, feeling that he may be of some use yet. Gwen reveals that she was unaware of Samuel's betrayal but is killed by Dean, who is possessed by the Khan worm. Samuel is unapologetic when confronted by the brothers, and it is subsequently revealed that he was possessed by the Khan worm and is shot dead by Sam. However, the Khan worm is not killed and uses his body to attack the group, but is driven out of Samuel when Bobby throws him against a live wire, electrocuting him and revealing the Khan worm's weakness.\n\nBased on the historical gun maker of the same name, Samuel Colt is a hunter who lived in the 19th century and the creator of the Colt—a gun that can kill almost any supernatural being; Lucifer revealed that he is one of five supernatural beings immune to its powers. Colt also designed the locked door that keeps the portal to Hell known as the Devil's Gate from opening. The Devil's Gate and the Colt gun are linked together—the gun serves as the key to the gate, allowing it to be opened by inserting the Colt's muzzle into the key hole. Colt also built a railroad of iron, in the shape of a pentagram with a church at each of the points, around the devil's gate to further ensure that it was demon-proof. Colt was portrayed by Sam Hennings in the season six episode \"Frontierland\". Sam and Dean, when looking for a method of destroying Eve, come across Colt's journal which reveals that the hunter had killed a phoenix in 1861. As the ashes of a phoenix are needed to kill Eve, Castiel sends Sam and Dean back in time to retrieve them. Although Samuel is initially reluctant to assist Sam, he eventually gives him the Colt which Dean kills the phoenix with. When Sam and Dean are pulled back to the present day without the ashes, it is revealed that Colt sent a courier package 150 years ago containing the ashes, which arrives at Bobby's door. He was able to figure out how to use Sam's cell phone, which he left behind (and which Colt sent back to him), and learned the date and Bobby's address from it.\n\nEileen Leahy, portrayed by Shoshannah Stern, is an Irish hunter and Men of Letters Legacy like the Winchesters.\n\nIn 1985, when Eileen was a baby, a Banshee attacked her house and murdered her parents. Before dying, Eileen's mother managed to banish the Banshee with a spell, saving Eileen's life but leaving her deaf. Eileen was eventually found and raised by a hunter named Lillian O'Grady who died of cancer when Eileen was sixteen.\n\nIn \"Into the Mystic\", Eileen is able to track the Banshee that killed her parents to a retirement home in Kansas where she encounters the Winchesters. Disguised as a maid, Eileen comes to the mistaken impression that the Winchesters are Banshees and attacks Sam before they are able to sort it all out. The Winchesters learn that Eileen's grandfather was a Man of Letters, making her a Legacy like them. With the help of the Winchesters and Mildred Barker, Eileen was finally able to kill the Banshee and get her revenge. However, Eileen decided to remain a hunter rather than return to a normal life.\n\nIn \"The British Invasion\", Eileen's help was enlisted by the Winchesters in finding Kelly Kline. Eileen eventually tracked down a demon working for the Prince of Hell Dagon and got Kelly's phone number from him before killing the demon with an angel blade. Eileen took part in the mission to capture Kelly Kline and attempted to kill Dagon with the Colt. However, Eileen missed and accidentally killed British Men of Letters operative Renny Rawlings. The Winchesters were able to stop Mick Davies from killing a distraught Eileen and she chose to return to Ireland for a while, but not before leaving the Winchesters the Colt.\n\nIn \"There's Something About Mary\", Eileen is killed by a hellhound loyal to British Men of Letters assassin Arthur Ketch in South Carolina. The Winchesters learn of Eileen's death from Jody Mills and are confused and suspicious as Eileen is supposed to be in Ireland. They later receive a letter sent by Eileen four days before her death stating she believed that the British Men of Letters were following her and tapping her computer and phone.

After capturing Lady Toni Bevell, the Winchesters question whether the British operation is responsible for Eileen's death.

Arthur sees Dean as the same as him and the two decide to take down a vampire nest together. At the nest, Arthur initially arms himself with a gun, but decides to use a machete instead like Dean. The two men find only one vampire hiding in the nest and Arthur beats upon her before Dean stops him to try things his way.

When Sam and Dean entered Frank's house, and he was waiting in the dark with a shotgun. He was prepared to shoot them, but because he owes Bobby he agrees to help them. At first, Frank believes that Leviathan Sam and Leviathan Dean are clones created by the government. Frank advises that the boys go into hiding, maybe even move to Cuba, but Dean says they need to go \"further off the grid, but keep us on the board\" so they can hunt down the Leviathans. He tells them that they need to keep a lower profile, avoid security cameras, and to get rid of their rockstar aliases, which are too easy to track. He smashes Sam's laptop, gives him a new one, and demands $5000 for it. He then takes their pictures for new IDs as Tom and John Smith and gives them a map of the towns their Leviathan doppelgängers have hit so far.\n\nIn \"Adventures in Babysitting\", Dean gives to Frank the numbers \"45489\" which Bobby wrote on Sam's hand before he died, and also asked him to research Dick Roman. Having not heard from him over a month, Dean returns to Frank's house to find it deserted. Frank suddenly appears, confronts Dean, and they both have to shed some blood to prove to the other they are not a Leviathan. Frank states that he has moved all his equipment into an R.V., feeling he was being watched after he started investigating Dick Roman.

When Charlie tries to hack it, the defense system uses Frank's voice. After finally hacking it, an automatic e-mail sent to the brothers which states that if they are receiving it, it means that Frank is dead or worse.

Castiel reveals that Kevin is a Prophet and he's able to read the tablet which talks about the Leviathans and when it breaks, he is able to put it back together.\n\nAfter two angels arrive to take him away and are driven away by Dean, they take him to Rufus' Cabin where they set him to work on translating the tablet. The angels return, but after Meg kills one to save Castiel, the others allow Kevin to finish the translation before taking him home. Kevin reunites with his mother, but they discover to their horror that the detective investigating his disappearance is the Leviathan Edgar in disguise. Edgar kills the two angels accompanying Kevin and takes him and his mother prisoner.\n\nDick Roman later uses Kevin's mother to force Kevin to translate the tablet for him. After the Leviathans bring in a girl named Polly, Kevin manages to escape the room he's trapped in and learns of Dick's plan to poison coffee creamers to kill all the skinny people in the world, but is captured by Dick's assistant Susan before he can escape. During Sam, Dean and Castiel's break-in of Sucrocorp, Sam finds and rescues Kevin who reveals Dick's new plan to him and insists they need to blow up Dick's laboratory.\n\nIn the lab, they find Dean and Castiel killing Dick and Kevin is shocked when Dean and Castiel disappear when Dick explodes. Kevin nervously tells Sam they have to leave because more Leviathans will be coming, but Crowley shows up and reveals he has it taken care of and kidnaps Kevin as a prize. It's later revealed that he wants Kevin in order to translate another Word of God tablet so he can learn how to open all the gates of Hell and release every demon in existence upon the world. Kevin tricks Crowley and escapes, going on the run for a year before Sam and Dean catch up to him. Kevin reveals that he has learned that it is possible to seal the gates of Hell forever and banish all demons from the Earth from the tablet and Sam and Dean decide to do so with his help.\n\nHowever, Crowley catches up with them and although they escape thanks to Kevin's quick thinking, Crowley murders his girlfriend in revenge. Kevin later convinces Sam and Dean to take him to see his mom who is surrounded by demons. After they rescue her, Mrs. Tran joins them in closing the gates of Hell, but they find the tablet stolen and being sold at an auction. Kevin's mom wins the auction by bidding her soul, but Crowley possesses her and gets away with the tablet. In the struggle, Dean tries to kill Crowley even though he is possessing Kevin's mother and in doing so, loses Kevin's trust. This along with the fact that Crowley warned him that the Winchesters have a habit of using people up and disposing of them when they no longer need them, causes Kevin to flee with his mother. He spends the next several episodes on the run from both Crowley and the Winchesters, but after his mother hires a witch to get the ingredients needed for the spell he used to kill the demons and escape, Crowley captures and tortures him to force him to translate the tablet. Sam, Dean and Castiel, who are alerted to his situation when Mrs. Tran calls them for help, arrive and rescue Kevin and get half of the tablet, but Crowley gets the other half and Kevin loses a finger, though Castiel is able to regrow it. They then call in Garth to look after the Trans and he takes them to his houseboat where Kevin works on translating the half of the tablet he has to no avail. Dean and Castiel later go to Kevin for help in preparing more demon bombs in order to rescue the angel Samandriel.\n\nKevin is now so focused on translating the tablet that he has somewhat let himself go and has a very disheveled appearance. He has also sent his own mother away so he can work in solitude, explaining to Dean that he can't enjoy the world he is trying to save until it is saved. Though he doesn't believe it is possible to get the ingredients needed for the bomb as they are very rare, he gives them the list and Castiel is able to get them. It is shown in \"Trial and Error\" that Kevin lets himself go completely while he focuses on translating the tablet, believing that closing the gates of Hell will be the only way he can go back to a normal life. Eventually, after weeks of non-stop work, he cracks the instructions and calls Sam and Dean to let them know. Kevin learns that in order to close the gates, someone must complete three trials and recite an Enochian spell after each one. Kevin has only cracked the first trial which is to kill a hellhound and bathe in its blood. Despite Sam's advice to slow down, Kevin begins taking (and its indicated overdoing) stimulants to keep awake and eventually calls Sam and Dean to inform them that he has learned that a hellhound (which is naturally invisible) can be seen through an object scorched with Holy Fire such as a pair of glasses, giving them a way to see the hellhound so they can kill it. In \"Taxi Driver,\" Kevin is under so much stress that he is hallucinating Crowley in his head and that Crowley is mentally torturing him. Panicked, he calls Sam and Dean and hides, but has also deciphered the second trial: Sam must rescue an innocent soul from Hell and release it into Heaven. After Sam leaves to rescue Bobby Singer's soul from Hell, Dean stays with Kevin, trying to calm him down. Kevin is so freaked out he hides in a closet and later hides his half of the tablet somewhere, believing it will take the pressure off of him. After Dean leaves, Kevin demon-proofs Garth's houseboat even more, but Crowley shows up and reveals he killed Kevin's mother and got his location from her smartphone. When Sam and Dean return they find the boat deserted. In \"The Great Escapist,\" Kevin is trapped in an illusion of Garth's houseboat and is tricked into translating Crowley's half of the demon tablet by demons pretending to be Sam and Dean. At the same time, a prerecorded message Kevin prepared is sent to Sam and Dean with his notes on the tablet. While Sam and Dean aren't able to figure out the trial from them, they eventually lead them to Metatron, the angelic scribe who wrote the Word of God. Eventually Kevin realizes the truth as the demons are too polite and sends them into a trap. Crowley confronts him and Kevin refuses to reveal more than the fact that Crowley has no idea the power he could've gotten from his half of the demon tablet and that he won't break. Not caring as he has the angel tablet, Crowley strangles Kevin who is rescued by Metatron. Metatron takes Kevin back to the hotel where he lives and heals him and Kevin reveals that he has Crowley's half of the demon tablet with him. With that half of the tablet, Kevin has learned the third trial: cure a demon. Kevin is left confused as to who Metatron is when Metatron reveals knowledge of the third trial as well. After Sam and Dean pretend to make a deal with Crowley to stop him killing people they've saved, Kevin digs up the first half of the demon tablet and reunites the two halves, giving the tablet to Sam and Dean who send him to the Men of Letters bunker for safety. When Dean and Castiel need to know the third trial to close the gates of Heaven, they take the angel tablet to Kevin who is distraught as he believed that it would be over once he was done with the demon tablet, causing an angry Castiel to yell at him that he is a Prophet until he dies. After completing the second trial, Dean calls Kevin who tells him that while he has found trials on the angel tablet, he doesn't see anything that matches what they have done. When Naomi shows up to tell Dean and Castiel that Metatron is really trying to expel all angels from Heaven, Kevin listens, but is unable to confirm what she has said. He later tries to leave the bunker, but stops when alarms start going off, signaling the fall of all angels to Earth.\n\nAfter the angels fall, Kevin is left trapped in the bunker as it locks down and he panics, nearly shooting Dean with a crossbow when he arrives. Kevin is not happy to see that the Winchesters have Crowley captive and have not killed him. Kevin is put to work trying to find a way to reverse Metatron's spell using the angel tablet. When Dean calls Kevin to get him to confirm their cover at a military base, Kevin is able to succeed by hacking into the person he is talking to's computer and blackmailing them. He later gets a call from Abaddon and passes on her message to Sam and Dean and at their request, looks through the archives for a way to kill a Knight of Hell. Crowley, who is in a dungeon in the next room, taunts Kevin, causing Kevin to beat him with a sledgehammer. Crowley then claims that he never killed Kevin's mother and will lead Kevin to her if he releases him and that the Winchesters are just using him. While Kevin doesn't release Crowley, he decides to leave and look for his mother but is stopped by Dean who convinces him that his mother is as good as dead even if she is still alive. Dean tells him that the Winchesters consider both him and Castiel to be family and would die to protect him if need be. Kevin aids Sam and Dean with finding a spell to communicate with animals and is later asked by Dean to find a way to suppress an angel. Kevin finds a way, but is murdered by Gadreel possessing Sam soon afterwards on Metatron's orders. Dean burns his body in a Hunter's Funeral afterwards and is devastated by and blames himself for Kevin's death. A month after his death, Kevin returns as a ghost, having been stuck in the veil between worlds due to Heaven being closed. Kevin asks Sam and Dean to rescue his mother who he has learned from another ghost named Candy is still alive. With Candy's help, Sam and Dean track down Linda who tearfully reunites with Kevin. Despite the risks, Linda decides to take the ring Kevin is attached to and look after him until he can enter Heaven. Kevin similarly wants to look after his mother now that he has her back. Kevin informs Sam that he doesn't blame him for his death, aware that it was really Gadreel and asks Sam and Dean to put aside their differences and start being brothers again before leaving.\n\nTwo years later in \"All in the Family\", Kevin's ghost is called in by God in the form of Chuck Shurley to reassure the Winchesters that they can trust Him. The Winchesters are shocked to see Kevin who tells them that they can trust Chuck and that whatever He has planned for them, He must believe they can do it. Kevin tells the Winchesters that he's fine for someone who is dead before Chuck tells Kevin that he has been stuck in the veil between life and death for too long. With a wave of His hand, Chuck causes Kevin's soul to ascend to its rightful place in Heaven.\n\nLinda is Kevin's mother and is first heard when she calls him about a test he has to take. When Kevin disappears, Linda grows frantic and calls the police and is relieved when two angels return him to her. However, the detective she called in to help turns out to be the Leviathan Edgar and he kills the angels and captures her and her son. Linda is used as a hostage to force Kevin into translating the Word of God tablet for Dick Roman, but she is let go with a warning not to talk afterwards. A year later she still hasn't heard from Kevin and is unknown to her, surrounded by demons, keeping an eye on her and protecting her. At Kevin's insistence, the Winchesters rescue her and she joins them in their quest to close the gates of Hell forever. Linda proves to be strong-willed, withstanding getting an anti-possession tattoo easily while comforting Kevin (and also indicating to her son's surprise that it is not her first tattoo) and later using her knowledge of tax law to intimidate a pawn shop owner into telling them what they need to know when nothing else works. At the auction, when all else fails, she bids her own soul to save Kevin, though she is warned that she will survive though she will wish she didn't. She refuses the offer of angelic protection for Kevin from Samandriel and is captured by Beau and Crowley who burn off her tattoo and Crowley possesses her to get the tablet. In the struggle that follows, Dean tries to kill her to kill Crowley and he flees her body, getting the tablet. Linda survives, but is left catatonic by the experience, though Sam and Dean believe she will recover due to her strong-willed nature. However, the incident shatters Kevin's faith in the Winchesters and he goes on the run with her. Some time later, Linda has recovered from her catatonia and looks for a way to strike back against Crowley by hiring a witch off of Craigslist to get the ingredients needed for the demon bomb. The witch brings enough ingredients for one bomb instead of all that Linda specified and betrays them to Crowley. Crowley leaves a demon behind to kill Linda as he leaves with Kevin, but Linda overpowers and captures the demon instead and calls Sam and Dean for help to rescue Kevin. She brings them the ingredients, Kevin's notes on how to build the bomb and the demon allowing them to locate Kevin and launch a rescue mission. While Linda wants to help, Sam handcuffs her to her steering wheel to keep her out of the way and out of danger. Kevin is rescued and Sam chides her for calling upon a witch for help. He and Dean call upon Garth to look after Linda and Kevin and he takes them to a houseboat he uses as a safe house. Kevin, wanting to work in solitude to translate the half of the tablet that Castiel retrieved, later sends Linda elsewhere, explaining to Dean that he can't enjoy the world he is trying to save until it is saved. In \"Trial and Error\", Kevin reveals that while he sent Linda away, he still does talk to her on the phone, but all she does is cry. In \"Taxi Driver\", Crowley finds Kevin, claiming that he captured Linda and tortured her for Kevin's location. Crowley states that Linda did not break, so he killed her and got the location off of her smartphone. Later, in \"Devil May Care,\" Crowley claims that he did not actually kill Linda and that she wishes that she was dead and promises to take Kevin to her if he releases him. Unsure whether to believe Crowley or not, Kevin doesn't free him, but decides to look for himself before being stopped by Dean who tells him that even if Linda is still alive, she is as good as dead. In \"Captives,\" the ghost of Kevin returns to ask Sam and Dean to rescue Linda who he has learned is still alive from another ghost named Candy. With Candy's help, Sam and Dean track down Linda in a storage unit in Wichita, Kansas where she and Sam end up trapped together due to the demon Del who has been holding Linda captive and torturing her. Using her knowledge of electronics from helping Kevin with his school projects, Linda is able to get them out of the room they are trapped in and is devastated to learn of Kevin's death. After Del is captured, Sam and Dean let Linda kill him. At Linda's demand, they then take her to the bunker where Linda is reunited with the ghost of her son. Linda finds her husband's old ring, the object Kevin is attached to and decides to take him home with her despite the risks so she can look after him until he can enter Heaven.\n\nLisa Braeden, portrayed by Cindy Sampson, is a woman Dean spent a weekend with circa 1999. In the third season, Dean decides to revisit Lisa while he is investigating some suspicious deaths that took place nearby. He discovers she has an eight-year-old son named Ben, who shares Dean's cocky attitude and love of classic rock. Dean becomes suspicious Ben might be his child, though he is later assured by Lisa he is not. After Ben is kidnapped by a changeling who committed the murders, Lisa becomes aware of Sam and Dean's work. After Sam and Dean rescue Ben, Lisa indicates she'd like Dean to stay for a while, but he regretfully declines. In season five Dean goes to Lisa and tells her, when he is preparing to become Michael's vessel, whenever he pictures himself in a normal happy life, it's with Lisa and Ben. He warns her there will be danger coming but he will make sure she and Ben are protected. Lisa urges him to reconsider doing whatever he's planning on doing, and urges him to stay and have a beer. However, Dean refuses and leaves.\n\nAfter Sam and Dean decide to go and confront Lucifer, Sam tells Dean he cannot try to save him, and he should go and live a normal life with Lisa. After Sam is locked in Lucifer's cage he keeps his promise to Sam arriving at Lisa's house. Sensing something has happened, Lisa comforts Dean as he breaks down in her arms. In the closing moments of the episode, Dean is having dinner with Lisa and Ben as Sam watches from outside. In the sixth season, she is shown living with Dean and takes Ben to stay with Bobby when Dean must go hunting again. After the local threat had passed, Dean moved them again, but had to return once Sam needed help with a string of shapeshifter attacks. Lisa admits that she knows he can no longer be always there for them, and lets him go, as long as he could return now and then to see them. This does not last; when Dean was turned to a vampire, believing he was to be killed, he went to see Lisa and Ben, but could not control his vampiric hunger and fled, but not before striking Ben. Lisa was furious and took off with Ben. Later, she called him while he was under the influence of Veritas, she was forced to admit that she was jealous of Sam because he had returned and she wanted to be the most important person in Dean's life. She is next seen in \"Mannequin 3: The Reckoning\", after Ben tricks Dean into returning. However, they fail to reconcile their differences. Crowley kidnaps Lisa and Ben in an attempt to force Dean to stand down in his pursuit of the demon and Castiel. Lisa is possessed by a demon and fatally wounded during the rescue attempt by Sam and Dean. Castiel heals Lisa and, at Dean's request, wipes her and Ben's memories of Dean. Dean later asks Sam to never mention Lisa or Ben to him again.\n\nMagnus (real name Cuthbert Sinclair), portrayed by Kavan Smith, is a former Man of Letters who has caused Sam and Dean trouble directly and indirectly on two occasions. Magnus was a powerful magician who was so good at spells, he was made the Men of Letters Master of Spells right after he was initiated into the order. He acted as Henry Winchester, Sam and Dean's grandfather's mentor and designed most of the warding for the Men of Letters bunker. However, he felt that the Men of Letters should be more proactive, using their knowledge to fight evil instead of hiding it away and protecting it. Magnus' ideas got so radical that after he created the Werther Box, a vault designed to protect an important decryption codex but with a deadly alarm system, he was kicked out of the Men of Letters on May 16, 1956. As a result, he survived the massacre of the order by Abaddon in 1958. Crowley became aware of his separation from the Men of Letters and attempted to locate him to get into the Men of Letters bunker, but failed to find him. At some point Magnus changed his name from Cuthbert Sinclair to Magnus, the name the Men of Letters use while going incognito, long enough that he hadn't gone by it in a long time by 2014 and built himself a warded impenetrable hideout where he collected important supernatural artifacts and a zoo of various creatures including vampires and shapeshifters. Due to his proficiency with spells, Magnus was able to make himself immortal, looking forever to be in his 30s despite being much older. Several weeks before the events of \"Blade Runners\", Magnus tracked down the mythical First Blade and acquired it for his collection. Searching for the First Blade to kill Abaddon, Sam and Dean tracked down Magnus with the help of the Men of Letters files and Crowley and were able to get him to talk to them by mentioning their grandfather and the Men of Letters. However, upon learning that Dean had the Mark of Cain, Magnus decided to add him to his collection rather than help them and teleported Sam outside. Magnus worked to convince Dean to work with him and then attempted to brainwash him when that failed. Eventually Sam and Crowley managed to break in and while Magnus was distracted with Sam, Crowley freed Dean who decapitated Magnus with the First Blade to save his brother. A year later during \"The Werther Project\", Sam learned of Magnus' connection to the Werther Box while searching for the codex inside. Following the destruction of the Men of Letters, Magnus' creation had caused at least four deaths and Sam and Dean set out to disarm it and get the codex. They eventually discovered that Magnus had designed the box so that only all of the blood of a Man of Letters could disarm the spell and open it, but by combining their blood, the Winchesters were able to safely open it. After getting the codex, Dean destroyed the Werther Box just to be safe.\n\nMichael \"Mick\" Davies is a Man of Letters from British Men of Letters, portrayed by Adam Fergus. When he was a young boy, Mick was orphaned and spent some time living on the streets. In an attempt to get some money, he picked the pocket of a member of the British Men of Letters and accidentally stole a cursed coin. The British Men of Letters saw potential within Mick and sent him to the Kendricks School. At the Kendricks Academy, Mick was best friends with a boy named Timothy. He was also classmates with Arthur Ketch who called them \"survivors\" when describing their experience years later.\n\nOne day in 1987, Mick and Timothy were pulled into the office of Doctor Hess, the Headmistress and one of the British Men of Letters Elders. In order to ensure they would follow the code absolutely, Doctor Hess left them a knife and told them only one of them could leave the room alive. While Timothy wanted to run, Mick reluctantly killed his best friend, per the code. This event would haunt him for the rest of his life.\n\nIn \"Season 12, Mamma Mia\", Mick comes to America to return Toni Bevell to London, where she'll face consequences after establishing that she's gone way off her original mission, which was to identify American hunters and gain their trust.\n\nHe first discovers Ms. Watt's corpse and calls Toni to inform her of his intentions, calling her a \"bad girl\". After Toni has a face off with Mary Winchester, Mick arrives with Castiel at her location. He insists that he and the British Men of Letters wish to work with the Winchesters and he even gives them his number, but they don't trust him.\n\nIn the car, he tells Toni that she must fly back to London, and that Mr. Ketch, whom he's already called, will take it from here.\n\nIn \"LOTUS\", Sam calls Mick for help with Lucifer but hangs up when he gets Mick's voicemail. Realizing that the Winchesters are likely in trouble, Mick sends Arthur Ketch to help them, resulting in Arthur rescuing them from the Secret Service and supplying them with a device capable of exorcising Lucifer.\n\nIn \"First Blood\", Mick is shown using a typewriter to discuss some of the events that were occurring in the episode. He is writing to his superiors, and he mainly talks about the Winchesters and American hunters in general. He is first shown trying to convince a hunter named Wally to work for the British Men of Letters. Wally's rejection leads Mick to remark that American hunters are \"difficult\". He then talks about Sam and Dean, who managed to escape Site 94, but they left survivors behind. He then remarks that it is Arthur Ketch's purpose to clean up \"loose ends\". He describes how Arthur took over Site 94 before the Government decided to shut it down completely. Lastly, Mick is shown talking to Mary Winchester, offering her the same things he offered Wally, but Mary shows interest instead.\n\nIn \"The Raid\", Mick leads an operation with several American hunters to wipe out all of the vampires in America. Within a month, Mick's operation wipes out two hundred and thirty of the two hundred and forty one vampires in the Midwest. After Mary gets Sam to check out his operation, Mick shows him around and includes him in a briefing of their planned attack on the final vampire nest in the Midwest.\n\nShortly afterwards, the compound comes under attack by vampires and Mick is shocked to learn that the Alpha Vampire is behind it as the British Men of Letters intel places him in Morocco for at least a decade. Mick is further shocked when Sam admits to having seen the Alpha Vampire in Hoople, North Dakota five years before. When Mary calls for everyone to show any weapons they possess, Mick has nothing useful and admits to having never taken a life before. While discussing options for taking down the Alpha Vampire, Mary has Mick show Sam the Colt, the one weapon the British Men of Letters possess capable of harming the Alpha. Sam is able to provide Mick with a ritual created by Bobby Singer to make more bullets for the Colt and Mick performs it moments before the Alpha Vampire breaks in and kills two hunters.\n\nAfter killing the two hunters, the Alpha Vampire announces his intention to force Mick to contact his superiors and tell them the mission failed before draining Mick on camera. Before he can follow through on his threat, Sam and Mary return and Sam arms himself with the empty Colt. As Sam negotiates with the Alpha Vampire, Mick discreetly shows him the bullet for the Colt he has palmed and then attacks Sam in apparent anger after Sam offers Mick up to the Alpha Vampire in exchange for the safety of himself and his family. In reality, Mick slips Sam the Colt bullet which he is able to load thanks to a distraction from Mary. As Mick and Mary watch, Sam kills the Alpha Vampire with the Colt.\n\nFollowing the battle, Mick berates Arthur Ketch who had been trying to recruit Dean in his own way and was thus away during the battle. Sam tells Mick that he is now in as despite everything that went wrong, they were able to kill the Alpha Vampire and Mick's operation is making the world a better place.\n\nIn \"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell\", Mick sends Sam text messages with cases for the Winchesters to take. As Mick calls him at the end of the episode, Sam admits the truth to Dean who decides to give Mick a chance.\n\nIn \"Ladies Drink Free\", Mick brings the Winchesters a werewolf case and asks to accompany them to get actual experience in the field. Though reluctant, Dean agrees to take Mick along. While the Winchesters talk to victim Hayden Foster's mother, Mick disguises himself as a doctor and examines her wounds, discovering that she has been bitten. Mick lies to the Winchesters about it and returns that night to kill Hayden with a silver nitrate injection as per British Men of Letters protocol, something he is visibly reluctant to do. After Hayden awakens and attacks him, clawing open Mick's shoulder, Mick uses the silver nitrate injection to kill her.\n\nThe next day, Mick joins the Winchesters in investigating Hayden's \"mysterious\" death, seeming conflicted by his actions. He later accompanies Dean to a bar to interrogate Hayden's boyfriend with his behavior drawing Dean's suspicions. Dean realizes that Mick murdered Hayden and is enraged by his actions since Hayden was an innocent sixteen-year-old girl and as a pureblood werewolf, could've controlled herself.\n\nAfter Claire Novak is bitten, Mick advocates killing her while Sam wants to try a cure the British Men of Letters invented involving injecting the newly turned werewolf with the blood of their sire. As the Winchesters go to track down Claire's sire, they leave Mick with Claire, warning him that if he kills her, they will kill Mick. As Claire starts to turn, she begs Mick to kill her, believing that she will not be able to control herself. However, while Mick admits that all of his instincts are telling him to do it, he's starting to understand that his instincts are wrong and instead plans to tie up and sedate Claire. They are then attacked by Claire's sire, Justin, who kidnaps Claire and knocks Mick unconscious.\n\nThe Winchesters return to find Claire gone and Mick waking up. Mick tells them that they can track Claire as he slipped a tracking device into her coat. Finding Justin's home through Mick's tracking device, Mick and Sam attack Justin with Mick jabbing Justin in the back with a syringe in order to get his live blood. However, they are both quickly thrown off and Justin attacks Dean. Before Justin can kill Dean, Mick kills Justin with a silver bullet to the heart from behind. Mick is then able to remove the vial of blood from Justin's back use it to painfully cure Claire.\n\nThe next morning, the Winchesters thank Mick for giving them a win and give him a second chance as a result. Mick is amazed by Claire's survival and curing and calls her a miracle to which Dean agrees with him.\n\nIn \"The British Invasion\", Mick is haunted by memories of murdering his best friend Timothy as a child and visits the Men of Letters bunker where he spends all night drinking with the Winchesters after learning about Lucifer's child. The next morning, Mick receives word from Doctor Hess that they don't have time to convince the American hunters to join them and orders Mick to \"assimilate or eliminate\" them and sends her lackey Renny Rawlings to keep an eye on him.\n\nMick and Renny join the Winchesters attempt to capture Kelly Kline. While initially successful, Dagon shows up, shrugs off all of their attacks and escapes. Eileen Leahy tries to kill Dagon with the Colt, but she teleports away, causing the bullet to kill Renny. Mick initially tries to kill Eileen per the British Men of Letters code, but Sam convinces Mick to follow his own code instead and he orders them to go. Later, Mick returns to his headquarters to find Arthur Ketch and Doctor Hess. Having learned his lesson from working with the Winchesters, Mick defends the Winchesters way of doing things as opposed to the British Men of Letters code. Mick tells Doctor Hess that their code would have a young boy murder his best friend but he's no longer a boy, he's a man now. In response, Doctor Hess signals Arthur who shoots Mick in the back of the head at point-blank range with a silenced pistol, killing him. Standing over Mick's body, Doctor Hess announces that the experiment with the American hunters is a failure and they are going to kill the Winchesters now.\n\nIn \"The Memory Remains\", Arthur sends the Winchesters an email posing as Mick to send them on a case to get them out of the bunker. He poses as Mick again later in a text message to check that they are in fact gone. When the Winchesters call Mick to check in, Arthur answers and claims that Mick was recalled to London and \"has a lot to answer for\" after what happened with Dagon so they will now report to him.\n\nIn \"Twigs & Twine & Tasha Banes\", Mary starts to get suspicious about Mick's disappearance as he hasn't responded to her phone calls or emails for weeks. Afterwards, Mary gets an email from \"Mick\" claiming that he is to remain in London for a few more weeks. Hearing Arthur talking about a package in the armory, Mary checks it out and discovers a box containing Mick's body, upsetting Mary. After finding Mick's body and finding information on hunters being chased by the British Men of Letters, Mary confronts Arthur who claims he was killed by a werewolf. However, Mary quickly realizes that Arthur is lying and in fact killed Mick himself since he was shot in the head which a werewolf is unlikely to do.\n\nMissouri Moseley, portrayed by Loretta Devine, is a very talented psychic residing in Lawrence, Kansas. She was a long-time friend of John Winchester. Missouri first met John on December 17, 1983, when he came to her for a reading. She said it was 'a few days after' Mary was murdered. Missouri said she was the one who opened his eyes to 'what was in the dark.' John took Missouri to his house, hoping she could tell him what killed Mary. Unfortunately, Missouri could not tell what it was, just that it was \"real evil\".\n\nPamela Barnes, portrayed by Traci Dinwiddie, is a friend of Bobby Singer. A skilled psychic, she is bold and aggressive. Bobby calls upon her assistance in discovering what pulled Dean Winchester out of Hell. She holds a seance and discovers it is a being named Castiel. In attempting to get a glimpse of Castiel, her eyes are burnt out and she becomes permanently blind. However, her psychic abilities appear to enable her to perceive her surroundings. The Winchesters again seek her assistance in finding out why Anna Milton is able to hear angels speak. She expresses an interest in \"dicking over\" angels because one caused the loss of her sight. She places Anna under hypnosis, which restores to Anna her memories of being an angel. She is called upon one more time by the Winchesters, to help them perform astral projections of themselves. While doing so, she is mortally wounded by a demon, but as her dying act, whispers a warning to Sam to stop using the demonic forces within him. In \"Dark Side of the Moon\", the Winchester brothers encounter Pamela in Heaven, who is happy residing in her own private paradise.\n\nRowena, portrayed by Ruth Connell, is an immortal and powerful witch and the mother of Fergus Rodrick MacLeod, better known as Crowley (alternately known as king of the crossroad demons/king of hell). She conceived him during a winter orgy, abused, attempted to sell, and eventually abandoned him when he was a boy. Originating from Scotland, she claims herself to be one of the few natural-born users of magic. She was once a part of the Grand Coven, but was expelled due to her violent and forceful tendencies.\n\nIn season 10, Rowena attempts to restore her power base by recruiting women into becoming witches of her own coven, having to face the Winchesters along the way. She joins up with Crowley, intending to exert her influence on her son, though with Dean’s advice, Crowley eventually banishes her. Mother and son play a game of cat-and-mouse as they try to hunt each other down, but are forced to work together to release Dean from the Mark of Cain, a task only Rowena can accomplish. In the process, Rowena has to kill a Polish man named Oskar, the only person she truly cares for. After releasing the mark and unwittingly freeing The Darkness, Rowena escapes by turning Castiel against her son.\n\nIn season 11, still in the process of creating her coven, Rowena is asked by the Winchesters about a way to enter Lucifer’s Cage in Hell, so they may find a way to stop the Darkness; while it is successful, Lucifer uses the opening to escape from the Cage. Enamored with the archangel, Rowena offers herself to join him, only to get herself killed once Lucifer confirms that she is the only one capable of sealing the Cage. Thanks to a spell she placed on her body, she is resurrected and vows to take revenge against Lucifer by teaming up with the Darkness, whose vessel she restores. Fearing for her power, Rowena bows out of the deal soon after and joins the Winchesters, Lucifer, Crowley and God in combating the Darkness.\nIn season 12, Rowena is asked by Crowley for help in finding Lucifer, who was incapacitated by the Darkness earlier and now possesses a rockstar’s body. In \"LOTUS\", Rowena helps exorcise Lucifer out of the President of the United States and apparently send him back to the Cage.\n\nIn \"Regarding Dean\", Rowena is contacted by the Winchesters after Dean gets hit by a curse. Rowena recognizes the curse as one belonging to a family of druidic witches with whom she has a bad history and had believed she had wiped out. Rowena aids the Winchesters in killing the witches and breaks the curse on Dean, saving his life. While the Winchesters refuse to give Rowena the \"Black Grimorie\", the family's spellbook, they promise they owe her \"a little one.\" During the time Dean has no memory, Rowena tells him that she has had a change in perspective after witnessing the feud between God and The Darkness.\n\nIn \"Family Feud\", the Winchesters contact Rowena for help with finding her grandson, Gavin MacLeod who had been displaced to the present years before by Abaddon. Rowena aids the Winchesters in dealing with the situation by sending Gavin back to his own time to die against Crowley's wishes to set the timeline right. Rowena later tells Crowley that her actions were done to spite him for forcing her to kill Oskar in \"Brother's Keeper\".\n\nIn \"All Along the Watchtower\", the Winchesters attempt to contact Rowena for help in sealing Lucifer away once again only to learn that Lucifer has killed Rowena and burned her body to prevent resurrection. Both Lucifer and the Winchesters express a belief that Rowena is truly dead this time.\n\nLady Antonia \"Toni\" Bevell, portrayed by Elizabeth Blackmore, is a Woman of Letters from British Men of Letters.\n\nIn \"Season 11, Alpha and Omega\", Toni returns to her home in London only to get a call that something bad is happening. She heads to her basement where she observes a corkboard decorated with information on the Winchester family.\n\nShe bids her sleeping son goodbye and prepares to head out. Her servant gives her a few weapons before she leaves.\n\nWhen Sam and Castiel return to the Bunker after the sun was restored to normal, she uses the angel banishing sigil on Castiel and tells Sam that she is a member of the British Men of Letters. When she asks about Dean, Sam tells her he's dead.\n\nToni tells Sam that she has come to take him to see the Boss at the London Chapter of the Men of Letters. She accuses him of playing with things - Archangels, Leviathans, the Darkness - bigger than he can handle. She soon fires a gun at him, leaving Sam's fate uncertain.\n\nIn \"Season 12, Keep Calm and Carry On\", Toni brings Sam, who she shot in the leg, to Dr. Marion to have his injuries treated, paying him with $100,000 to not ask questions. Taking him to a farmhouse, Toni explains that the British Men of Letters have kept Britain safe from monsters for forty years and want to do the same with America. To this end, she demands information on all of the hunters in America, their leadership and how to contact them. When Sam refuses to tell her, Toni has Ms. Watt torture him for the information, but he continues to refuse. Though Ms. Watt suggests bringing in Mr. Ketch, Toni refuses as she doesn't like the man and instead decides to resort to mental torture, causing Sam to have hallucinations of dead people in an attempt to break his mind. However, when Dean calls her and threatens Toni if she doesn't turn over Sam, she sends Ms. Watt to kill him. Eventually, Sam apparently commits suicide as a result of his hallucinations, but in actuality tricks Toni and briefly overpowers her. Sam nearly escapes, but Toni manages to lock him in the basement once again.\n\nIn \"Mamma Mia\", Toni uses a spell and potion to create a hallucination where she seduces Sam to get information from him. She is unable to get much before Sam sees through it and Toni resumes her physical torture. As she tortures Sam, Toni gets a call from Mick informing her that Ms. Watt is dead and he has come to bring her in as she's gone too far. Toni refuses to stop and captures Dean when he locates the farmhouse with help from Ms. Watt's cell phone and Castiel. Toni threatens to torture Dean instead but before she can begin, a resurrected Mary Winchester threatens her at gunpoint. Toni and Mary engage in a fight that ends with Toni cutting open her hand and mentally strangling Mary while Dean threatens her with Mary's gun. Toni demands the gun, stating Mary will die if she is killed and Dean pretends to comply. As Dean hands over the gun, he punches Toni unconscious, having recognized that she was using a Chinese mind control technique and that knocking her out would end its effects.\n\nThe group is then interrupted by Mick who explains that Toni's orders were to make contact with the Winchesters but she went too far out of her belief of their being a malfeasance in the American hunters. Mick promises that Toni will be punished in London for her actions and departs with her. Toni remains steadfast in her desire to get answers, but Mick refuses though he tells her if necessary, he will do what he has to do to deal with the situation. To that end, he has called for Mr. Ketch, something that leaves Toni visibly uneasy.\n\nIn \"The Raid\", Arthur Ketch has a drink with Dean and tells him that Toni's rogue actions were unforeseen by all but Arthur who \"had a sneak peak at what a neurotic, overreaching time bomb she was.\" Arthur then explains that he and Toni used to date which Dean is not surprised by.\n\nIn \"Twigs & Twine & Tasha Banes\" and \"There's Something About Mary\", Toni returns to brainwash Mary into being a remorseless killer for the British Men of Letters. Toni succeeds, but is lured into a trap and captured by the Winchesters. Toni informs them of Mick Davies' murder and confirms that her organization is likely responsible for the death of American hunters. At the bunker, the Winchesters are ambushed by Arthur Ketch and three operatives. After killing Arthur's men, a brainwashed Mary forces them to let Arthur go. Arthur then locks the Winchesters in the bunker, initiating a lockdown that cuts off all power, water and air which will result in their suffocation in two to three days. As Toni is a rival for heading the American operation, Arthur locks her in the bunker to die with the Winchesters.\n\nIn \"Who We Are\" Toni claims that she is the only person that can undo Mary's brainwashing to get the Winchesters to spare her. For two days, the Winchesters and Toni work together to find a way out with a magical solution ultimately failing. As the three are on the verge of dying, Dean uses a grenade launcher to blast a hole into the sewers, a plan that Toni feels is insane. Dean is then able to hit the bunker's manual override and save Sam and Toni.\n\nAfter learning that Jody Mills has captured Mary, the Winchesters demand that Toni break the brainwashing and she finally admits to lying to them about being able to do it. Toni suggests the Winchesters run and watches Sam's rallying speech to the American hunters with apparent interest. Toni agrees to help Dean enter Mary's mind using equipment at the bunker and asks in return that Dean give her a head start before killing Toni so that she can have a chance to see her son one last time. With Toni's help, Dean is able to break Mary's brainwashing, but awakens to find that Arthur Ketch has murdered Toni while he was unconscious.\n\nDoctor Hess, portrayed by Gillian Barber, is a British Men of Letters Elder and the Headmistress of the Kendricks Academy.\n\nIn 1987, Doctor Hess forced Kendricks student Mick Davies to murder his best friend Timothy as a test of Mick's loyalty to the British Men of Letters code.\n\nIn \"The British Invasion\", Doctor Hess contacts Mick and orders him to \"assimilate or eliminate\" the American hunters. To ensure Mick's compliance, Doctor Hess sends her lackey Renny Rawlings to watch over him. Following the accidental death of Renny at the hands of Eileen Leahy and the Colt, Doctor Hess personally comes to the British Men of Letters compound, leaving Britain for apparently the first time. After determining that Mick has become too much like the American hunters, Doctor Hess has Arthur Ketch murder him and announces that they will now wipe out the American hunters, particularly the Winchesters.\n\nIn \"There's Something About Mary\" and \"Who We Are\", Doctor Hess personally coordinates an operation to wipe out the American hunters. She suggests to both Arthur Ketch and Lady Toni Bevell that once it is over, she will place each of them in charge.\n\nAs her operatives prepare to strike against the hunters, their families and any bystanders, an assault team of American hunters led by Sam Winchester attacks the British compound. Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned, the American hunters slaughter the British operatives, taking some casualties of their own. Desperate, Doctor Hess kills a hunter and retreats to the control room to call for extraction, but the people in Britain can't get her out. She is then confronted at gunpoint by Sam, Jody Mills and another hunter named Roy. Doctor Hess attempts to convince Sam that they still need each other as Lucifer has escaped and Crowley is dead. After a moment of consideration, Sam refuses Doctor Hess' offer and pointedly destroys the computer she was using to communicate with Britain. Enraged, Doctor Hess attempts to shoot Sam only to be shot through the head herself by Jody Mills. The American hunters then destroy the British compound, ending their operation and threat in America.\n\nVictor Henriksen, played by Charles Malik Whitfield, is an FBI agent who pursues the Winchesters since the bank \"robbery\" in the season two episode \"Nightshifter\". He believes the Winchesters are serial killers responsible for the deaths that have occurred in various towns. He continues to pursue them when, in the season three episode \"Jus in Bello\", he finally captures them and holds them in a small town jail while waiting for a FBI helicopter to arrive. However, demons arrive and destroy the helicopter; one of them possesses Henriksen but is exorcised. Finally believing in the supernatural, he agrees to help the Winchesters as they fight off the demon horde. Afterwards, he agrees to tell the FBI that they were in the helicopter when it crashed. However, after the Winchesters leave, he is killed by Lilith. Henriksen makes another appearance in season four's \"Are You There, God? It's Me...Dean Winchester\". Lilith is breaking the 66 Seals to free Lucifer, and one of them is the Rising of the Witnesses. Sam, Dean, and Bobby meet the ghosts of people they could not save, including Henriksen, who tells them what happened after they left the jail at the end of \"Jus in Bello\". The ghosts terrorize the trio until they are put to rest.\n\nThe Alpha Vampire, portrayed by Rick Worthy is the very first member of the vampire species. He was created by Eve and spread vampirism afterwards. When Crowley starts a hunt for Alphas to locate Purgatory, he starts sending telepathic messages to his \"children\" to create as many new vampires as they can. Dean sees this message when he's briefly infected with vampirism and the Campbells are able to use it to track him down and capture him. The Alpha is tortured, but eventually breaks free, killing Christian Campbell. After a fight, Christian, who is revealed to be possessed by a demon, gets up and injects him with dead man's blood, incapacitating him. Afterwards, Crowley arrives and takes him away. The Alpha is held with all the other captured monsters in Crowley's prison, but escapes before Castiel can kill him like he does the other Alphas and monsters in the prison. The Alpha makes a deal with the Leviathans to share humanity among both species with the Leviathan substance that makes humans more docile making it easier for vampires to feed. After several of his vampires die after feeding on infected humans, the Alpha flees to his retreat at an old monastery where Sam and Dean track him down. However, Emily, a young woman he'd held prisoner for twelve years, calls him to warn him that they're coming. The Alpha captures Sam and Dean who ask for his blood, explaining that the Leviathan substance was what killed his vampires and that he'd been betrayed. The Alpha refuses to listen and after hearing that Edgar has arrived, orders the hunters locked up. The Alpha confronts Edgar who confirms Sam and Dean's story, telling him that the Leviathans intend to use the fact that so many monsters feed on humans to wipe them out. When Edgar insults Eve, the Alpha attacks him, throwing Borax in his face, but Edgar overpowers him. Before Edgar can kill the Alpha, Sam and Dean, who broke free, attack and Sam decapitates Edgar. Grateful for their actions and understanding that they have a common enemy, the Alpha gives Sam and Dean his blood without a fight and allows them to take a young boy named Alan he has captured. As they leave, warning him not to keep Edgar's head too close to his body, the Alpha taunts them that they truly want to kill him instead of leaving it for another time and promises to \"see you next season.\"\n\nThe Alpha Vampire returns in \"The Raid\" when the British Men of Letters begin systematically wiping out all of the vampires in America. The Alpha Vampire leads an assault on the British compound where he faces off with Sam who arms himself with the Colt, the only weapon the British possess capable of harming the Alpha Vampire. Sam offers the Alpha Vampire a deal where he can have the British if he will leave the Winchesters alone to resume the old way of hunting. Sam is then attacked by Mick Davies and the Alpha Vampire by Mary Winchester before both are defeated. Sam then reveals to the Alpha Vampire it was all a distraction so he could get and load a bullet for the Colt. Impressed, the Alpha Vampire calls Sam a \"clever, clever boy\" before Sam shoots him through the head with the Colt. As the legendary gun's power works on him, the Alpha Vampire briefly laughs and smiles before dropping to the ground, dead.\n\nPortrayed by Emma Grabinsky as an adolescent and by Jewel Staite as an adult. Amy was a Kitsune who grew up traveling around with her mother. In 1998, they crossed paths with Sam Winchester in Lincoln, Nebraska. Amy killed her mother to protect Sam, with whom she had grown close. Amy re-encountered Sam years later. Sam tracked her down after she committed a series of murders. Amy then reveals that she had only committed the murders to strengthen her sick son Jacob. Given the circumstances, and their history, Sam agrees to let her go and makes Dean promise to do the same. However, Dean later returns and kills Amy. He spares her son, who vows revenge. Dean lies to Sam about Amy's fate but is plagued by guilt. The truth is eventually revealed and is a source of conflict between the brothers for a time.\n\nAmy's name is a nod to the \"Doctor Who\" character of the same name.\n\nBenjamin \"Benny\" Lafitte (Ty Olsson) is a vampire who was a vampire pirate during his first lifetime until he met Andrea Kormos and fell in love with her, leaving his nest and stopping feeding on humans. He was eventually tracked down and killed by his nest mates and went to Purgatory where he spent around fifty years before Dean ended up there after killing Dick Roman. Benny saves Dean from another vampire and makes a deal with him: in exchange for Dean taking him with him, Benny will show him a portal out of Purgatory. Benny helps Dean find Castiel, warning him that traveling with an angel will get them killed, but Dean is insistent on all of them getting out. After Benny saves Castiel from Leviathans, he earns Dean's full trust and Dean carries him out of Purgatory in his arm. On Earth, Dean travels to Benny's grave and resurrects him. The two remain in touch, but stay separate until Benny goes after his nest for revenge and to protect himself from further attempts on his life. After Benny is injured, he calls Dean for help and together they take down the nest, with Benny killing his maker. However, Benny is reunited with Andrea who he learns was turned into a vampire instead of being killed. She helps him out, but to Benny's heartbreak, he learns that she has changed and wants to take over the pirating operation herself and Dean is forced to kill her to save Benny. Needing something to keep him on the straight and narrow, Benny moves to his hometown of Carencro, Louisiana where he meets and secretly looks out for his great-granddaughter Elizabeth. Rogue vampire Desmond tries to get Benny to join him, but Benny refuses and Desmond leaves a trail of bodies to try to get Benny to agree, drawing the attention of insane hunter Martin Creaser and Sam and Dean. Dean and Benny hunt down and kill Desmond, but Martin tries to kill Benny, using Elizabeth as a hostage. Benny is forced to kill him in self-defense and is left in a deteriorating situation worsened by the fact that Dean soon afterwards cuts off all contact. When Sam gets trapped in Purgatory, Dean goes to Benny for help, knowing he can get Sam out. Benny agrees, telling Dean he feels he no longer fits in on Earth. Dean kills Benny who saves Sam and Bobby Singer from vampires and leads them to the portal out. However Benny, who never intended to return to Earth, stays behind to hold off a group of vampires and allow Sam to escape. Benny is last seen fighting the vampires. Benny finally gains Sam's acceptance with this self-sacrifice and Dean buries his body instead of burning it in hopes of bringing him back one day.\n\nChet (played by Sean Owen Roberts) is a Leviathan stationed at a credit card company. When a flagged alias that was registered by the Winchesters was used, Chet begins to hunt the Winchesters down, tracking them to their hotel room in Prosperity, Indiana. While he easily dominated the brothers, a witch that the Winchesters helped disabled Chet and allowed them to escape. Using copious amounts of chains, the brothers took Chet to Bobby Singers to determine his weakness.\n\nWhile the brothers attempted to stop a pair of Leviathan doppelgangers, Bobby attempted to find a way to kill or hurt Chet. Nothing worked, until a Borax cleaning product used by Sheriff Jody Mills upstairs dripped from the ceiling; the chemical was significantly more painful and corrosive than anything else used, which Bobby affirmed to be the most effective countermeasure to Leviathans, in tandem with decapitation as long as the head was kept away from the body. Ultimately Bobby decapitated Chet who had at that time assumed Bobby's own form to taunt him and had Sheriff Jody Mills drop his head into a river while he encased Chet's body in concrete.\n\nChuck Shurley, also known by the pseudonym Carver Edlund, and portrayed by Rob Benedict, is an author of a marginalized book series \"Supernatural\", which recounts everything the Winchester brothers have experienced during the show's run. After confronting him about his seemingly omniscient knowledge of their escapades, it is revealed by the angel Castiel that he is a Prophet of the Lord, and his works will become new gospels. He is also protected by an archangel powerful enough to force even Lilith to flee from its presence. Between the fourth-season finale \"Lucifer Rising\" and the fifth-season premiere \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" he witnesses the death of Castiel at the hands of the archangel Raphael. Being the author of the \"Supernatural\" series, he attends the first \"Supernatural\" convention Sam and Dean were tricked into attending; when it turns out the hotel is actually haunted, he is forced to occupy the guests and the hotel staff while the Winchesters and a pair of cosplayers destroys the ghosts. When the hotel manager leaves and breaks the salt line, he dissipates the ghost with an iron post, while unintentionally gaining the affections of Becky.\n\nPeriodically during \"Swan Song,\" Chuck is narrating about the history of the Impala, his script having the same name as the episode. He informs Dean of the final battlefield between Michael and Lucifer, despite the angels wishing him not to know. At its conclusion, while ending the narration, Chuck smiles and disappears into thin air, leading some to question whether he is merely a prophet that is no longer needed or is actually God. Castiel later states that while he doesn't know what happened to Chuck, he must be dead as a new Prophet was chosen in the form of Kevin Tran and that only happens when the old Prophet dies.\n\nIn \"Fan Fiction\" Chuck reappears at the end of a play based off his books and comments that it was \"not bad\" when asked his opinion by the play's writer, Marie.\n\nIn \"Don't Call Me Shurley\", Metatron is transported to a bar that he recognizes as one of God's constructs where he meets with Chuck. After Metatron criticizes his writing, Chuck reveals that he is in fact God, having taken on the form of Chuck Shurley to have a more hands-on role. God explains that after the Apocalypse was averted, He traveled the world but has grown tired of everything and intends to let Amara destroy the world while He works on His autobiography with Metatron's help. God gives Metatron several insights into His actions, confirming He resurrected Castiel several times to aid the Winchesters and revealing he \"turned off\" Dean's amulet's ability to detect him. He also shows sympathy for Lucifer, stating that Lucifer is not a villain. God is generally apathetic to what's going on on Earth, but Metatron gives Him an impassioned speech about how humanity is better than Him because for all their flaws, they still try. After finishing his autobiography, God has Metatron read it while he plays \"Dink's Song\" on his guitar. On Earth, God stops Amara's insanity infection and resurrects those who died as a result of it. After finding Dean's old amulet glowing in Sam's pocket, the brothers follow it to the middle of the street where God, in the form of Chuck, is helping those affected by Amara. The Winchesters are shocked to realize that Chuck was God the whole time and God tells them they should talk. In \"All in the Family\", God proves who he is by calling upon the spirit of Kevin Tran to confirm his story. However, the Winchesters learn from Metatron that God intends to sacrifice himself to the Darkness to save the universe rather than fight her. After the Winchesters rescue Lucifer, God greets his rebellious son for the first time in millennia and heals his numerous injuries from Amara's torture. In \"We Happy Few\" there is great tension between God and Lucifer, but the Winchesters get them to have a sit-down in which God admits Lucifer was always his favorite and he feels he failed him by giving him the Mark. Lucifer and God reconcile and gather the witches, angels and demons to aid them in battling Amara since Raphael and Gabriel are dead and God can't bring them back and Michael is insane. Together, they defeat the Darkness and God goes to transfer the Mark to Sam to imprison his sister once more, but the Darkness retaliates, leaving God mortally wounded. In \"Alpha and Omega\", God reluctantly aids the Winchesters in formulating a plan to kill the Darkness in order to balance the scales once he's dead. As God grows weaker and the universe dies with him, the Darkness teleports him to her location where Dean has convinced her to find another way. The Darkness admits she was jealous of no longer being everything to God and asks to have her brother back. The siblings reconcile and the Darkness heals the injuries she inflicted upon God, reversing the end of the universe. The two siblings then depart the Earth together for a \"family meeting.\"\n\nThe Darkness, often called by her other name Amara, and portrayed primarily by Emily Swallow, is a supremely powerful primordial entity who has existed since before the beginning of time, predating both God and Death, who were of similar age. Sometime later, after her brother God came into being, he created the Archangels to fight a terrible war against her. Through the combined power of God and the Archangels, God sealed her away, not wanting to kill her, by using the Mark of Cain as both a lock and key. God revealed that he chose not to kill her in her weakened state as she needed to exist with himself so reality wouldn't be destroyed. Whilst the Archangels battled her and thus knew of her existence, she is so ancient and mysterious that the Demons and even the Angels, except for Metatron, didn't believe she existed or was locked away. However, Metatron knew about her and who she was, as he was God's scribe. Both Heaven and Hell thought it to be a \"myth\" or \"scary bedtime story\", told to keep others in line.\n\nDeath, portrayed by Julian Richings, is an immensely powerful entity also called The Grim Reaper or the Pale Horseman. He is neither demon nor angel, and states no one is \"as old as God.\"\n\nIn the climax of \"Abandon All Hope\", Lucifer performs a bloody ritual to raise Death, and to bind him to Lucifer's apocalyptic bidding. In \"Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid\", Death goes to Bobby's hometown of Sioux Falls and resurrects many deceased locals as undead; this include Bobby's wife. The revived at first appear and act normal, but soon take on feral states; this forces others to kill them in self-preservation. These events were an attempt to break Bobby, one of the few remaining influences keeping Sam from agreeing to be Lucifer's vessel. In \"The Devil You Know\", Bobby temporarily sells his soul to Crowley in order to locate Death. In \"Two Minutes to Midnight\" — Death's first corporeal appearance — Death arrives in Chicago to precipitate a storm which would kill 3 million. His vehicle is a pale white 1959 Cadillac. In a lengthy conversation with Dean, he reveals that this and other actions is the influence of Lucifer's binding spell, which Death wishes to break. He presents Dean with his ring, the final piece allowing the Winchesters to open Lucifer's cage and re-imprison Lucifer. \"Two Minutes to Midnight\" also introduces Death's taste for the typical, renowned, and often unhealthy local restaurant foods of the places he visits, which becomes something of a running gag.\n\nDeath appears again in \"Appointment in Samarra\", in which Dean attempts to convince him to retrieve Sam's soul from Lucifer's cage. Death agrees to do so if Dean performs Death's duties for an uninterrupted 24 hours. Although Dean fails, the Horseman still restores Sam's soul, regarding the Winchesters as \"useful\". He also forms a wall between Sam's active consciousness and the debilitating memories of his time in Lucifer's cage.\n\nIn season seven when Castiel proclaims himself God, the Winchesters summon and bind Death as part of a plan to stop Castiel; Death takes an instant dislike to him. He informs the angel that he is not God and that he is harboring something else within him, the Leviathans, that will soon break free. Castiel removes the Winchesters' bind and leaves. Death, of his own free will, creates another eclipse, giving the Winchesters and Castiel a chance to return the souls to Purgatory before they destroy his vessel. Castiel succeeds in sending the souls back, but the Leviathans manage to hold on and escape into the world.\n\nIn \"I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here,\" when Sam is dying, Death comes to reap him personally, intimating he considers it an honor. He also states that, he usually doesn't pass judgment, all Sam's actions were \"well-played.\" Sam requests, and Death agrees, to make it so that Sam dies permanently, that no one and nothing can bring him back to life. Ezekiel, in Dean's form, interrupts them, however, and Death allows them to talk, saying that it's Sam's choice if he lives or dies. Sam chooses to live, ultimately, and Ezekiel possesses him in order to heal the damage the trials inflicted.\n\nIn \"Brother's Keeper\", Dean summons Death to kill him as he feels the Mark of Cain is corrupting him too much and he can't fight it anymore. Death is unable to kill Dean because of the Mark's power and explains that the Mark is the lock on the prison of a primordial evil called the Darkness and removing it without passing it on will release the Darkness. Death will only remove the Mark if Dean passes it on and when Dean refuses to do that, offers to transport Dean so far away he's no threat to anyone. However, he demands Sam's death in return as he fears Sam will try to rescue Dean and won't give up until he succeeds. Believing it to be for the greater good, Dean agrees and calls Sam to their location. Death tells Sam his reasons for wanting him dead, including Sam escaping him earlier. Death watches as Sam and Dean argue and fight and then Sam agrees to sacrifice himself to stop the threat of the Mark and the Darkness. Death gives Dean his scythe to do the job and tells him that if Dean doesn't kill Sam, he will. However, after being reminded of how good he really is and his love for his family, Dean instead impales Death with the scythe, killing him. Death can only stare at Dean in shock before crumbling to ash, leaving Dean stunned that he actually killed Death.\n\nIn \"Form and Void\", a Reaper named Billie confirms to Sam that while Dean did kill Death, a new Death has taken his place. While the old Death was amused by Sam and Dean's constant dying and returning, this new Death is not and will have them thrown in the Empty upon dying so that they can never return.\n\nDick Roman (played by James Patrick Stuart) is a billionaire businessman whose secret identity is that of the nameless leader of the leviathans. Shortly after they were unknowingly released by Castiel (Misha Collins), the leviathans infiltrated human society, with their leader murdering and impersonating the real Dick Roman. Dick is shown to have a hatred of demons that exceeds even his feelings about humanity, rejecting the demon Crowley's (Mark Sheppard) offer to join forces with him and telling the current leader of Hell that he might very well wipe his kind from the Earth. In \"How to Make Friends and Influence Monsters\", Dick visits an experimental facility run by a leviathan impersonation of one Dr. Gaines (Cameron Bancroft), disappointed by the newspaper articles stemming from the drugs used, and makes him eat himself. When his henchmen capture Bobby (Jim Beaver), Dick attempts to stop the Winchesters' rescue attempt, fatally wounding Bobby on their escape. Dick is later revealed to be after something from archaeological digs, and assigns Charlie (Felicia Day) to break Frank's (Kevin McNally) hard drive. Unknown to him, she cracks it, learns the truth about him and the rest of the Leviathans, and then teams up with the Winchesters to erase the drive and find out his plans. The Winchesters switch the item he was looking for with a Borax bomb that explodes in Dick's face. Realizing that Charlie betrayed him, he orders the building locked down and goes after her, but the Winchesters break in with the help of Bobby's ghost and Bobby holds Dick off long enough for Charlie and the Winchesters to escape. Dick has Edgar kidnap Kevin at the end of \"Reading is Fundamental\" and threatens Linda to get Kevin to translate the Word of God tablet in \"There Will Be Blood\". Dick correctly predicts that the Winchester brothers are planning to get the blood of the Alpha Vampire and of Crowley for the leviathan-killing bone described by the tablet; after sending Edgar on an ill-fated mission to kill the Alpha Vampire before the Winchesters can attain the alpha's blood, Dick summons and traps Crowley. Rather than kill the demon, however, Dick makes a deal with Crowley: in exchange for Crowley giving the Winchesters the wrong blood as part of a trap, the demons will get a free rein with humans in the world, excluding America, which is the place where the leviathans are currently targeting for its abundant food source. Foreseeing Crowley's betrayal, Dick also arranges for several decoys of himself positioned in Sucrocorp to fool the Winchesters into wasting the bone on a fake. However, Dean and Castiel ultimately find and confront Dick, whom Castiel is able to identify due to the brief time that the leviathans used him as their host. When the bone seemingly fails to work, Dick initially believes that he has won, only to find out that he himself has been tricked when Dean kills him with the real bone, sending him back to Purgatory. As an unintended consequence of using the bone, however, Dean and Castiel are pulled into Purgatory with him.\n\nEdgar (played by Benito Martinez) is the first Leviathan introduced in the series, taking the form of a demolitions expert and working under orders from \"the Leader\" - which will be later revealed to be Dick Roman - sent to lead in those feeding indiscriminately and to kill Sam, Dean and Bobby when they interfered on his plans. After observing the new system for feeding developed at Sioux Falls General, he torches Bobby's house and confronts the Winchesters, breaking Dean's leg and knocking Sam unconscious. Dean crushes him with a car from Bobby's scrapyard, but he is later revealed to have been unharmed and continues to pursue the Winchesters and Bobby.\n\nAfter that, Edgar still worked underground under Dick's order, supervising Sucrocorp project. When the clay tablet that contained the Word of God was stolen by the Winchesters. Dick ordered Edgar to stop them, so he took the form of the detective Collins (played by Eric Floyd) and searched for Kevin Tran, the teenager prophet destined to keep the word. After two Angels return Kevin to his mother's house, Edgar easily kills the two. He later helps Dick force Kevin Tran to translate the Word of God for them and tries to kill the Alpha Vampire. However, Sam decapitates him while he's distracted and as a result of his betrayal, the Alpha gives Sam and Dean his blood for the weapon they are creating. Edgar is left to the Alpha with a warning to keep his head away from the rest of his body.\n\nPortrayed by Kim Johnston Ulrich, Eleanor Visyak is a creature from Purgatory who is over 900 years old. She who was released from there on March 10, 1937 by a spell performed by H.P. Lovecraft. She possessed the body of his maid, Eleanor. She has been living as a professor of medieval studies at San Francisco University. She has a romantic past with Bobby Singer. In \"Like a Virgin\", at Bobby's suggestion, Dean visits Dr. Visyak to gain information about dragons and how to kill them. She has a dragon killing sword - the Sword of Brunswick (or Braunschweig) - in her basement, which is stuck in a large rock. Dean extracts it using plastic explosives, breaking the sword in the process. While visiting Westborough, the son of Eleanor, who saw his mother possessed by a creature from Purgatory in 1937, Bobby sees a photo of the woman and realizes that it is the woman he knows as Eleanor Visyak. He finds her in a cabin - one of her 'safe houses' - and tells her he knows who she really is. She confirms his suspicions, but denies that she killed H.P. Lovecraft. Bobby warns her that Castiel is looking for her. He asks for the information about how to open a door to Purgatory, but she refuses to tell him, and also rejects his offer of protection. As she leaves the cabin at the end of the episode, Castiel appears and takes her. A flashback of Sam's in the finale \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\" reveals that he, Bobby, and Dean found her, fatally wounded, in an alley. She recounts her tortured at the hands of Crowley and Castiel, and admits that she eventually gave in and revealed the spell to access to Purgatory, which involves the blood of a virgin and the blood of a creature from Purgatory. Eleanor dies before she can reveal where Crowley and Castiel are.\n\nEve, portrayed by Julia Maxwell and Samantha Smith, is also known as the \"Mother of All\". Eve was last on Earth 10,000 years ago. She is the original propagator of the majority of supernatural beings. She has been trapped in Purgatory, where the souls of the supernatural go. Eve is released from Purgatory in \"Like a Virgin\" by a sacrificial ritual. In \"...And Then There Were None\", Eve creates a being - referred to colloquially as the Khan Worm - that can enter a person's body through the ear and control their actions. She plants it inside a trucker, who goes on to kill his family. It then passes to one of his co-workers who kills 12 people. While investigating the murders, it infects Dean who kills his cousin Gwen, and then infects Samuel, and finally Bobby who kills Rufus while possessed. While possessing Bobby, it tells Dean and Sam that it was created by Eve, who intends for supernatural beings to take over the world. After acquiring the ashes of a Phoenix, said to be lethal to Eve, Sam, Dean, Bobby and Castiel take the fight to her in \"Mommy Dearest\". Eve reveals that her actions are purely a response to Crowley, still alive, and his capture and torture of her children. She speculates that he is after the souls in Purgatory, and claims that she was satisfied with the natural order of humans and monsters coexisting (with occasional bloodshed on both sides) until Crowley forced her hand. Eve dies after biting Dean, who had Phoenix ash in his blood, to which Crowley takes her body for autopsy. In \"There Will Be Blood!,\" when the Leviathan Edgar is very dismissive towards the Alpha Vampire, he calls himself a \"son of Eve,\" but Edgar calls the Alpha a \"mutt\" and Eve was \"barely worth being called one of us.\" When Edgar calls Eve a whore, the Alpha Vampire is enraged and attacks him.\n\nDr. J. Gaines (played by Cameron Bancroft) is a Leviathan using the surgeon's form, although his original form was taken from a young girl named Annie. Under orders from Edgar, he killed the real Dr. Gaines and took his identity. Gaines is responsible setting up a system of feeding on patients at Sioux Falls General, thereby reining in the Leviathans' indiscriminate feeding. Gaines also appears to be the one responsible for conducting the experiments on Sucrocorp, modifying food to make humans docile, dumb and hungry. Gaines is \"bibbed\", a form of punishment where he was forced to eat himself alive in a bib under Richard Roman's orders, since his experiments attracted the attention of the media.\n\nGhosts are one of the most recurring monsters of the week on \"Supernatural\", appearing at least once a season. During season 7, hunter Bobby Singer became a ghost for a time after his death to look after the Winchesters and help stop the Leviathan threat. When he started turning into a vengeful spirit, the Winchesters were forced to put him to rest. In the show, there are several different types of ghosts that appear including Woman in White, Spectre, the ghosts of people who were evil in life, Death Echoes, Death Omens and most commonly, Vengeful Spirits, the ghosts of people who want revenge for a wrong committed to them in life. During the show, a number of ways are employed to put the various ghosts to rest, but the most commonly used is salting and burning their human remains. Generally when a spirit's remains are salted and burned, they go up in flames. However, sometimes this is not possible due to cremation and they are attached to an object that must be salted and burned too, sometimes an object that was a part of them like hair or a bracelet with their blood on it, or at other times something that was just important to them in life. Sam and Dean regularly use iron objects and rock salt shotgun pellets to battle ghosts as iron and salt repel them for a while. While it was initially unknown where ghosts go after they are destroyed, hunters generally believed it to be oblivion. However, its revealed in season 8's \"Taxi Driver\" that Reapers take the spirit to where they belong once the ghost has been forced from this plane of existence.\n\nLeviathans were first introduced as another primary \"creation\" of God—already including humans, angels, and demons—during the season premiere of Season 7. According to Death, the Leviathans were among God's earliest creations but were sealed in Purgatory because they were a threat to His other creations. Castiel accidentally absorbs them, along with the souls in Purgatory, during his attempted apotheosis, and the Leviathans free themselves. Once free, they organize a hierarchy with the Leviathan possessing the businessman Richard \"Dick\" Roman as the leader, though Crowley claims that this being has always been their leader.\n\nThe Leviathans are portrayed as virtually indestructible, voracious, and stronger than demons and low-level angels. They can shape-shift into humans, but to do so, they must use traces of their DNA. Leviathans not only replicate the corporeal form of a human, but also their memories and skills. They also have the ability to punch into an angel, killing it. Leviathans' weaknesses include magic, borax, and decapitation, though none of these are lethal. One way for a Leviathan to die is for it to be eaten by a Leviathan. They can commit suicide by eating themselves. Late in season seven, the characters find a tablet containing the \"Word of God\" that reveals a Leviathan can be killed by using \"a bone of a righteous mortal washed in the blood of the three fallen.\" When this happens, the Leviathan liquefies and explodes.\n\nIn season seven, the Leviathans, led by Roman, plan to turn humankind into a farmed, Leviathan food source. They intend to do so through chemically decreasing their intelligence via food adulterants and curing their diseases, including cancer. The Winchesters put a stop to this during the season finale, with Dean and Castiel killing Roman, which, as a side consequence, sends them to Purgatory. Killing Roman, the only Leviathan leader that there has ever been, severely weakens the Leviathans, as they are now directionless. According to Crowley, they will now be regular monsters, albeit ones that are much harder to kill. The remaining Leviathans heavily involved in the plan for humanity are slaughtered by Crowley and his army in the confusion, but Crowley indicates that there are more. By season 8, all the Leviathans' influence appears to have disappeared from the Earth though there are apparently some still out there as it is suggested in \"Pac-Man Fever\" that they are responsible for mysterious deaths.\n\nNot all Leviathans may have escaped from Purgatory through Castiel, as four were seen there during Dean and Castiel's time in the realm, attacking them. Castiel indicates that there are even more and states that they are relentlessly hunting him. One of his last memories before escaping Purgatory is of Leviathans chasing him.\n\nPestilence, portrayed by Matt Frewer, is one of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, along with War, Famine and Death. He equates to the Green Horsemen, and wears an emerald-embedded ring. He can create and manipulate infestations, plagues, diseases and other sicknesses.\nUpon Lucifer's rise, Pestilence spreads Swine Flu on Earth. It is later revealed that the flu was spread in order to distribute the Croatoan Virus in the form of a 'vaccine'. Dean witnesses the effects of this when transported to the future by Zachariah- approximately 90% of the planet's population is infected. When the Winchesters track Pestilence, he is revealed to be vengeful for the defeat of War and Famine. Castiel defeats the Horseman by removing his ring and, with assistance from Crowley, the spread of the Croatoan Virus is prevented. The eventual fate of Pestilence is unknown, but it can be assumed that he survived his defeat, albeit much weakened.\n",
                "List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters\n\n\"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" is an American television series created for ABC by Joss Whedon, Jed Whedon, and Maurissa Tancharoen, based on the Marvel Comics organization S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement and Logistics Division), a fictional peacekeeping and spy agency in a world of superheroes. It is set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), sharing continuity with the feature and short films of the franchise.\n\nThe series stars Clark Gregg, reprising his role of Phil Coulson from the films, as well as Ming-Na Wen, Brett Dalton, Chloe Bennet, Iain De Caestecker, and Elizabeth Henstridge. Nick Blood and Adrianne Palicki joined the cast for the second and third seasons, while Henry Simmons and Luke Mitchell had recurring roles in the second season before being promoted to the main cast for the third. John Hannah, who recurred in the third season, joined the main cast in the fourth, while Natalia Cordova-Buckley, who recurred in both the third and fourth seasons, was promoted to the main cast for the series' fifth season. Additionally, several other characters from Marvel Cinematic Universe films and Marvel One-Shots also appear throughout the series, along with other characters based on various Marvel Comics properties. Several characters from the series also appear in the supplemental digital series \"\".\n\nThis list includes the series' main cast, all guest stars deemed to have had recurring roles throughout the series, and any other guest who is otherwise notable.\n\nPhillip \"Phil\" Coulson (portrayed by Clark Gregg) was the S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in charge of Project T.A.H.I.T.I., meant to bring a potential dead Avenger back to life using a drug derived from an ancient alien corpse. Following his death in \"The Avengers\", Fury resurrected Coulson using T.A.H.I.T.I., and had his memories of the project replaced. Coulson puts together a team of agents, and they travel the world dealing with strange new cases. During this time, Hydra infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D., leading to the latter's demise. Fury makes Coulson the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., and tasks him with rebuilding the agency \"the right way\". Coulson becomes romantically involved with Rosalind Price, the leader of an anti-Inhuman government taskforce, until her death at the hands of Grant Ward, one of Coulson's former agents. He gets revenge by crushing Ward's chest with his prosthetic hand. Following the Sokovia Accords, S.H.I.E.L.D. is re-legitimized, with the still officially dead Coulson replaced as director. In the Framework virtual reality, Coulson teaches about the dangers of Inhumans.\nPhil Coulson was created for \"Iron Man\"; he was the first S.H.I.E.L.D. agent introduced in the MCU, and was portrayed by Gregg, who went on to play the character in several other MCU films and Marvel One-Shots. At the 2012 New York Comic Con, Gregg was announced to be starring as Coulson in \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\", despite the character dying in \"The Avengers\".\" In April 2013, Gregg said that he had found creator Joss Whedon's explanation for Coulson's resurrection \"fascinating\" and \"true to the world of the comics and mythology in general\". On whether the resurrected Coulson would be the same as before he died, Gregg said \"I think if he hadn’t gone through some kind of change, it wouldn’t be any good.\" After Coulson was promoted to Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., Gregg said \"He kind of got his dream job that I don’t even think he would have ever dreamed he would be given ... it’s going to require him to move a little bit in the direction of a more pragmatic figure like Nick Fury\". Discussing Coulson's character progression through three seasons, executive producer Jeffrey Bell said, \"First season Coulson would have beat Ward up and then thrown him over his shoulder and brought him back to Earth and locked him away. Season two Coulson would have defeated him and left him there on the other planet to fend for himself,\" while season three Coulson paused while a portal to Earth was closing to take the time to kill Ward.\n\nMelinda Qiaolian May (portrayed by Ming-Na Wen) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. ace pilot and weapons expert who is called \"the Cavalry\", against her wishes, after a mission to Bahrain where she saved an entire S.H.I.E.L.D. team from a rogue gifted—unbeknownst to S.H.I.E.L.D., she did this by killing a young girl named Katya Belyakov. Still struggling to move past this event years later, May agrees to watch her old friend and partner Coulson for Fury, reporting to the latter and looking for potential side-effects of Project T.A.H.I.T.I. in the former. When Coulson becomes the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., May acts as his second-in-command, and over time begins to move past the events of Bahrain and even develop familial relationships with characters such as Skye. In the Framework, May did not kill Belyakov and becomes a top operative within Hydra.\nWen was cast as May in October 2012. Whedon had the character, who was originally listed with the name Agent Althea Rice on casting sheets, \"rolling around in his head\" for a long time. In preparation for the role, Wen was \"given a couple of background stories\" about May, but found it challenging to play a character who is respected by those around her when the audience doesn't know why, stating \"It's a challenge in different ways...I use some of my own personal experience where we've been scarred or we've been greatly disappointed\". When May's past was revealed in \"Melinda\", Wen called it \"devastating\", explaining \"She was married, she was in love with Andrew, she had a job that she excelled at and loved and believed in—so her world was pretty perfect...To have learned what she had to do, for the good of the many...I can understand why it would traumatize her so much and cause her to retreat.\" May's shirt is the same blue as many S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in \"The Avengers\" such as Maria Hill, so as to have some continuity between her uniform and those established in the films. The rest of her costume is inspired by military flight suits, including a leather vest, and pants with stretch panels to aid with fighting.\n\nFollowing the series premiere, Wen teased the character, saying \"She's very much the observer, and whenever she wants to put in her two cents, it's something that you want to listen to and kind of pay attention to...She's slow in getting acclimated to part of the group and being in the field again.\" Talking about May's reasons for staying with S.H.I.E.L.D., Wen explained \"May’s friendship and...loyalty and her love for Coulson [keeps her there]. Maybe not romantic [love], it’s just really—it’s hard to describe—it’s a bond, it’s unbreakable, and she will watch over Coulson and take care of him and help him through whatever he needs to at this point in his life... She wants to be there for him, and if it serves S.H.I.E.L.D., that’s just more or less a side effect, really.\" Wen admitted that May develops a relationship with Skye over the course of the series, going from thinking of Skye as \"someone that she didn’t want as part of the team and didn’t understand why Coulson wanted her\" to wanting Skye \"to be the best agent that she can be.\" After discovering that Skye is an Inhuman, Wen stated that \"it’s like when you have your child or your daughter losing control or getting involved with situations or people that you’re not sure about. You don’t have the control anymore. It’s very frightening. For Skye to be an unknown entity, May still holds out hope. She hopes that her training with her will help her be able to control her new powers, but you never know. Sometimes the power overtakes everything else.\"\n\nOn how May deals with her ex-husband Andrew becoming the Inhuman killer Lash, Wen said, \"She's come to the understanding that it was something he had no control over. The betrayal might be not sharing that information of what happened to him with her. I think she understands that, in a way, he was scared and trying to be protective of their relationship and doing it all for the wrong reasons. I think, ultimately, Agent May is kind of shut down when it comes to Lash and Andrew at this point. That's why she's re-focusing all her energy back into S.H.I.E.L.D., back being by Coulson's side. That's where she's most comfortable.\" Wen went on to describe May as \"unconventionally maternal...she's taking care of Simmons and really believing that she needs to be able to protect herself, she's very, very concerned about the family's well being.\"\n\nWen received nominations for 'Favorite Actress in a New TV Series' at the 40th People's Choice Awards and 'Favorite Female TV Star – Family Show' at the 29th Kids' Choice Awards. Wen was also named TVLine's \"Performer of the Week\" for the week of April 12, 2015, for her performance in \"Melinda\", specifically her portrayal of May in the flashback sequences.\n\nGrant Douglas Ward (portrayed by Brett Dalton), the son of politicians, was abused by his parents and older brother Christian growing up. After attempting to kill Christian by burning their house down, Grant meets John Garrett, a Hydra double agent within S.H.I.E.L.D., who trains Grant to be a skilled agent. Later being assigned to Coulson's team, Grant is outed as Hydra when that organisation is revealed to the world, and, after the death of Garrett, becomes a prisoner of S.H.I.E.L.D. In love with his former teammate Skye, Grant escapes custody, apparently kills Christian and their parents, and infiltrates Hydra so Skye can meet her father. Despite this, Skye turns on Ward and shoots him, and he escapes only with the help of former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Kara Palamas, with whom he develops a romantic relationship. He accidentally kills Palamas while she is in disguise as May, and blaming S.H.I.E.L.D., decides to take over the now leader-less Hydra. Joining forces with one of Hydra's previous leaders, Gideon Malick, Ward travels through a portal to an alien planet in search of the ancient Inhuman Hive, but is killed there by Coulson. This allows Hive to use Ward's body as a host. Ward returns in the Framework created by Holden Radcliffe as Johnson's boyfriend and a double agent working for the Inhuman resistance.\nDalton was cast in November 2012. From the conception of the series it was decided that Grant Ward would be a traitor, with executive producer Jed Whedon saying \"since [the events of \"\" are] an infiltration based on betrayal on a massive scale, we wanted to have it on the small scale, and have it be a really personal dagger to the heart.\" Ward's initial costumes were inspired by Jason Bourne and Ethan Hunt, with his look based purely in function and with a muted color palette to reflect his serious attitude. After Ward was outed as Hydra and became a prisoner of S.H.I.E.L.D., Dalton grew a beard for the character, explaining that S.H.I.E.L.D. would not provide a prisoner with a razor, \"so it just happens to work out that I have a beard and beards can have a sort of evil connotation.\" Austin Lyon portrays a young Ward.\nDalton has described Ward as he first appeared in the series as \"a guy who is very trustworthy and rolled up his sleeves and did all the heavy lifting and didn’t really question authority. You know, a by-the-book risk assessor\". Although it was eventually revealed that Ward was a Hydra imposter, Dalton noted that that doesn't necessarily mean the relationships the character built with his S.H.I.E.L.D. team weren't genuine, since going undercover meant letting his guard down to make the other characters trust him, opening himself up to those relationships despite his ulterior motives.\n\nFollowing the death of Garrett, the question was asked, \"Who is [Grant Ward] without someone telling him what to do?\" Dalton answered that \"he can follow commands really well. He can do and make tough choices and he can sometimes do unpleasant things in the name of something that he feels he believes in. But...I don’t think that Ward knows the answer to that question himself.\" Dalton called the character a 'wildcard', since he was loyal to Garrett as a father figure rather than Hydra, \"and he was more about his teammates rather than the team\", later elaborating that \"It’s not quite good guy, it’s not quite bad guy. It’s not trying to get in with S.H.I.E.L.D. again, it’s not trying to get in with Hydra. He’s really on his own path. He’s living by his code at this particular point in life.\" Explaining Ward's relationship with Palamas, Dalton stated When they first started this relationship, I thought they’re two people who have experienced something similar by following orders and then finding themselves not knowing who they are when someone’s not telling them what to do...But it really [has] developed into something that’s much more complicated than that. There’s a teacher-student relationship there as well as what seems like a genuinely romantic relationship. You see us really lovey-dovey in the cockpit and it’s making everybody around us sick. In some ways, we have the most healthy relationship out of all of the other dynamics on the show, which is saying something because Ward is not a lovey-dovey kind of guy. That’s interesting that he’s now in probably the most stable relationship there is. When Ward accidentally kills Palamas in the season two finale, Dalton said that \"This affects him in a way that is deep and lasting. There was a shred of humanity in there, and always the possibility and the thought that he could be redeemed...After Kara’s death—that is actually at my hands—after all the time and effort and energy that’s been invested in this relationship, it turns him. You see it in his eyes...This whole thing of closure keeps coming up over and over again. There is so much closure out there in the world that needs to be achieved. There’s a lot of unfairness that he wants to fix, so we see somebody who is determined, who knows who he is, and is like, 'Fine, if you want to call me the bad guy, I’m the bad guy.'\"\n\nSpeaking about the monologue Ward gives in \"Maveth\", Dalton noted that some viewers thought Ward sounded like \"a born-again, devout, off-my-rocker person at that point\", but Dalton felt that it was \"a real moment for Ward where he actually gets a sense of there's something greater than revenge and all of these smaller emotions; there's actually something that's bigger out there that he's a part of.\" Following Ward's death later in the episode, Bell discussed whether the writers ever considered redeeming the character, saying, \"No character is too high to fall or too low to be redeemed, theoretically...but for someone to be redeemed, they need to ask forgiveness, or want to be redeemed...[Ward] never felt like he needed to apologize for what he did.\" Dalton returned to the series in the fourth season to portray Ward in the Framework. Dalton felt returning to the character in this capacity allowed him to \"finally get to have the hero arc that Grant Ward deserves.\"\n\nDalton won for 'Male Breakout Star' at the 2014 Teen Choice Awards. The character of Grant Ward garnered a fan following, with a group known as the \"Ward Warriors\" often using the hashtag \"StandWithWard\" on social media. Dalton was surprised that people \"seem to be standing with Ward no matter what he does...there are people out there who just seem to be following this character wherever he goes. I think that’s brilliant...There isn’t any character like him on the show, and I would say even within the Marvel canon.\" As a \"shoutout\" to these fans, Palamas says, \"I will always stand with Ward\" in the second-season finale, which Dalton called \"a testament to the fans, this incredibly loyal fanbase that has now influenced the script of our show.\"\n\nHive (from ) is one of the first Inhumans, a parasite who can connect with and control the minds of other Inhumans and feed off of or possess humans. Created by the Kree from a Mayan hunter (portrayed by Jason Glover) to lead their Inhuman army against mankind, Hive ultimately incited a rebellion, uniting humans and Inhumans to drive the Kree from Earth. Soon, a faction of Hive's followers who feared his power banished him through a portal to the planet Maveth, where he destroyed an entire civilization over centuries. He eventually only survived on human sacrifices sent through the portal by followers, and their descendants, still loyal to him—Hydra. Hive escapes back through the portal in modern times by possessing the body of Grant Ward. He retains the memories of all the bodies he has inhabited, including now Hydra leader Gideon Malick's brother Nathaniel, and punishes Gideon for causing Nathaniel's sacrifice by murdering his daughter Stephanie, before taking control of Johnson, who Ward was in love with, and using her to kill Gideon. Hive then takes steps to recreate the original Kree experiment that made him, planning to use a warhead to spread a pathogen around the world and transform all humans into Primitive Inhumans. He is destroyed when S.H.I.E.L.D. traps him in a quinjet with the warhead and detonates it in space.\nBased on the Hive, \"a genetic experiment created by Hydra\" in the \"Secret Warriors\" comic, Hive possesses the corpses of first Will Daniels and then Grant Ward in the show, with Dillon Casey and Brett Dalton portraying the reanimated bodies, respectively. Jason Glover briefly appears as Hive's original human form, while Dalton portrays Hive's true, CGI-created Inhuman form through motion capture. On having Hive possess Ward's body, Whedon explained that Ward has \"been the baddie for a while and I thought it was a nice way to escalate this character...there’s still memories in there. So there’s still an aspect of the man we came to love to hate in there, but we wanted to give it some extra juice and we wanted to give Brett one more challenge where he has to change his character.\"\nDalton aimed to emulate Meryl Streep's character in \"The Devil Wears Prada\", who never spoke above \"a conversational level...She didn't pound on her chest and make sure everybody knew that she's powerful, she just was.\" Dalton also changed his voice to represent the memories of Will Daniels and Nathaniel Malick \"just a little bit. I tried to change my voice in there, I tried to change even my level of expression in there because I was supposed to be channeling somebody else entirely coming through.\" Dalton called the coat that Hive wears later in the third season \"iconic and timeless\", noting that \"fashion wasn't on the forefront of [Ward's] mind\", while Hive is more theatrical, \"colorful without having to do much.\"\n\nHive's ultimate goal is \"connection\", with Dalton saying, \"all these Inhumans have a purpose. Hive finds his purpose has to do with somehow connecting all of the Inhumans. What we see is Hive's attempt to fulfill what he thinks is his destiny...this desperate need to connect. Gregg called Hive \"the perfect villain for this show because he carries with him the memories, desire, hatreds and agendas of Will and of Grant Ward. At the same time, he’s got a much deeper, bigger agenda that’s thousands of years old, and gave birth to Hydra.\" Dalton described him as a \"survivor\" who \"does not think small. This person has been around for way too long to think in anything other than global terms.\" He saw this as a fundamental difference between the character and Ward, who \"just becomes single minded and is hellbent on one thing at a time...Hive is the opposite. He sees every move on the chess board. That's what we're seeing in terms of Hive's thinking. It is about a new world order of sorts.\" On how much influence the memories of those whose bodies Hive inhabits have on the character, Dalton said, \"It's the motivations...you're seeing a flash of it. It's almost like seeing your kid. There are flashes of you in there...but then again, it's not me.\"\n\nDalton realized that Hive would not be on the show for long when he took the part, with \"the big, big bad\" less likely to last as long as an \"anti-hero\" like Ward. On Hive's final scene in the third-season finale, Dalton noted that there would have been no point in the character doing anything other than reflect: \"It's like looking into a fire. Somehow the truth comes out. You're looking at the Earth, man. It's so far away. And you'll get a perspective on things. For Hive, he was trying to change that entire thing and everyone who was on there...I think there's a great deal of remorse [that he was not] able to achieve that connection and do all the things that [he] wanted to do. But there was also an acceptance.\"\n\nDaisy Johnson (portrayed by Chloe Bennet) was born in China to Calvin Johnson and his Inhuman wife Jiaying, but was soon taken by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and raised as an orphan by nuns. Taking the name \"Skye\", she became a skilled hacktivist, opposing organisations like S.H.I.E.L.D. This led to her involvement with Coulson, who decided to recruit her, and have Ward, and then May, train her to be a formidable field agent. After reuniting with her father, Skye chooses to drive him away, knowing him to be a monster and murderer, though his wishes for her to fulfill her destiny—by unlocking her Inhuman abilities—are granted when she unintentionally comes into contact with the Terrigen Mists, which give her earthquake-generating abilities. Skye soon meets Jiaying, who helps Skye control her abilities. Skye's loyalties are tested when Jiaying attempts to start a war with S.H.I.E.L.D., and she ultimately sides with S.H.I.E.L.D. Now using her birth name, Johnson forms a S.H.I.E.L.D. team of Inhumans named the Secret Warriors. After briefly being connected to Hive, and watching Lincoln Campbell, with whom she developed a romantic relationship, sacrifice himself for her, Johnson leaves S.H.I.E.L.D. and becomes known as the powered vigilante \"Quake\" to the public.\nDaisy Johnson was created by Brian Michael Bendis and Gabriele Dell'Otto for \"Secret War\" #2. When the character of Skye was introduced to the series, it was always intended that she would be the MCU version of Johnson, as executive producer Maurissa Tancharoen explained, \"there are always the series of clearances, but we always knew we wanted to evolve Skye into something else. Daisy Johnson was the main character that we wanted to go for. We got confirmation on that very early on, so we’ve been on that track ever since.\" Bennet was cast as Skye in December 2012, out of more than 400 actresses who auditioned for the role. Unlike the comic version, Skye is an Inhuman; Jed Whedon explained that \"We’ve created a different origin for her...we merged those two ideas together also because there are such rabid fans out there that if we stick to original story points from the comics, they will smell story points from miles away. Those two factors led us to coming up with a different notion of how she got her powers.\" During a single-shot fight sequence in \"The Dirty Half Dozen\", Bennet broke her arm and finished the second season without wearing a cast.\n\nSkye's initial costume design was intended to keep her relatable, with inspiration coming from street style blogs, but as she became a more experienced S.H.I.E.L.D. agent in the second season, she received a more tactical outfit. For the third season, Bennet cut her hair to further her character's transformation to Daisy Johnson, as she is portrayed in the comics, though she did not cut her hair as short as her comic counterpart; Bennet explained that \"the comic book version of Daisy Johnson has very short, Miley Cyrus-esque hair. We wanted to stay true to the comic book character fans love; I wanted to please them but also make sure there was still some movement and length and sexiness in the hair.\" Bennet also received a superhero costume for the third season, again bringing the character closer to the version in the comics. Foley felt that \"one of the most important things was that the symbol be incorporated into her costume but especially onto the gauntlets, And it’s also on the back of her suit, which was a fun little touch that we added. As far as the silhouette, we wanted to stay true to the comics and pay tribute to those original designs. I also wanted to incorporate the gold color that I’ve seen in some of the illustrations of her suit throughout the comics, which is why we have the gold lines that we see on the suit. Finally, for me personally, I wanted a nod to her tactical look from last season, so if you look at the style lines around the top of the costume, you will see that they’re similar to her tactical hood from Season 2.\" The suit was \"made out of printed EuroJersey, which works well for these costumes because it’s a four-way stretch that gives Chloe the ability to move and do her stunts... But there is a lot more leather in her suit than in some of the others.\" Legacy Effects created Johnson's iconic gauntlets from the comics, making them \"out of flexible materials painted to look like metal\" so as not to injure anyone during stunts.\n\nBennet, talking about Skye's commitment to S.H.I.E.L.D., stated that \"I think at the beginning she came into S.H.I.E.L.D. thinking it was this government-run, CIA-type thing, where they’re not for the people and their motives were not good ones. But throughout the [first] season, being on the team and seeing what was happening, she really got to know why S.H.I.E.L.D. is there. It really is to protect people, and the intention behind the organization is pure...I think she finds a parallel between S.H.I.E.L.D. and Coulson, and I think that’s why she’s committed to it so deeply.\" Elaborating on this, Bennet said \"she’s always had this unspoken bond with Coulson that’s a very father/daughter relationship where clearly the love they have for each other is evident in a very caring way.\"\n\nGoing into the second season, Bennet noted on the character, \"I think she’s always someone who will wear her heart on her sleeve, but I think she’s much smarter about it now, if that makes any sense. I don’t think she’s the type of person who can halfass anything, and that includes emotions. If she feels something, she feels something. But she knows how to control it more\". Talking about the changes to the character after it was revealed that she was Daisy Johnson and an Inhuman, Tancharoen said \"With this discovery will come some consequences, especially in her relationships with everyone around her, specifically Coulson...Needless to say, it’s going to be a very complex, emotional journey for her. We have the ability on a television show to really explore the emotional journey of that. What does that mean now that she has this ability? Does she even want it?\" Explaining some of these changes in the character, Bennet stated that \"I make sure to try to keep the season one Daisy weaved through the new, badass Daisy...[but] she's changed a lot. She went into S.H.I.E.L.D. hating organizations like S.H.I.E.L.D., and now she's the epitome of S.H.I.E.L.D. She believes in everything that they believe in.\"\n\nDiscussing the character becoming leader of the Secret Warriors, Bennet said, \"What makes her such a good leader is how much she's been through, so she can relate to everyone on the team and she really has so much empathy and that's what I love about playing her. She really genuinely cares about everyone so deeply and it wears heavily on her because she obviously went through this big Inhuman change...And so what I think makes her such a good kind of...unconventional leader is that she's really kind of still learning and I think that's so realistic that leaders are—it's almost like when you grow up and you realize that your parents are just humans, parenting.\" Wen noted how the character \"has evolved from being so anti-establishment into suddenly being someone who wants to create an establishment that would help and enhance the betterment of the world\", to which Bennet said, \"she was lost for a really long time, she was an orphan and she wanted to find her parents and all of a sudden she does and it's not what she expected. You know, when your mom tries to kill you and your dad is Hyde. So she's kind of grown into this.\"\n\nEntering the fourth season, Bennet felt that, after the events of the final episode of season three, Johnson was \"in a darker place. She's mourning. She cares about the team so much that she feels like she is protecting them by kind of pushing them away, because I think she feel like everything bad happens around her and she can't help but cause problems. Her way of taking care of the people she cares about is kind of pushing them away, which... is not the best thing.\" She also added that physically, Johnson would not be in great shape, since she is no longer under S.H.I.E.L.D.'s monitoring \"containing and helping me grow my powers\" so there would be \"repercussions of her kind of using these powers and... abusing her body\".\n\nBennet received nominations for 'Favorite TV Actress' and 'Favorite Female TV Star – Family Show' at the 28th and 29th Kids' Choice Awards, respectively.\n\nLeopold \"Leo\" James Fitz (portrayed by Iain De Caestecker) is brought on to Coulson's team as an engineering and weapons technology specialist, and provides tech support for the team throughout the first season. He has a close bond with Agent Simmons, the two having graduated from the S.H.I.E.L.D. academy together. At the end of the first season he confesses to Simmons that he has romantic feelings towards her, before nearly dying in an attempt to save her. Left with severe brain damage, Fitz struggles with technology and speech, but over time becomes a full member of the team again. When his consciousness is submerged in the Framework, Fitz becomes \"The Doctor\", Hydra's remorseless second-in-command, and has a relationship with Madame Hydra. The experience changes him; retaining his memories of this other life, he is haunted by his past actions.\nDe Caestecker was cast as Fitz in November 2012. Following injuries the character receives at the end of the first season, the series began to deal with brain trauma, as De Caestecker explained \"From the get-go, before I even knew about it, the writers had the idea, and they did a lot of research in it with doctors. When I found out about it, I did my own research and correlated it together. It's just something that should never be trivialized. It's a real and serious thing to a lot of people, brain trauma, so we just have to constantly be respectful towards it. We talk about it all the time. Even if you don't see it or it's not obvious, it's always something that's in our heads that we're keeping going. It's the realization that you never get fully better, it's about embracing the new side of you and making that work in the world that you're in. I suppose the idea of a cure—I don't know if that could happen.\" For Fitz's costume design, Foley tried to have his clothes reflect his personality, without \"getting too cliché...we try and play up his \"heritage style\"...using classic design details on him like paisley & leather elbow patches and mixing them with different plaids.\"\n\nDe Caestecker, in describing the character, said that \"Fitz has got this funny kind of temper. He’s quite passionate about what he does. So those moments where—I don’t think he’s someone that really responds very quickly to emotion; he doesn’t really understand emotions as much\". Fitz has a lot of interaction with Simmons in the series, with De Caestecker explaining \"My character, he’s Engineering, so he’s on the computer and tech side of everything. He’s consumed within that world, and he works very closely with Simmons, who’s Biochem. They’ve got this kind of weird chemistry together, and they just kind of fit each other in a very weird way.\" Regarding the changing dynamic over time between Fitz and Simmons, De Caestecker said \"I suppose what's happened from the start of season two up to midseason is, they've become a lot stronger as individuals, I think. But I think they still care for and need each other a lot, and they also work better together when they are together. But I think there's a lot of things that have still been unsaid and will hopefully come out, certain confrontations that are still bubbling under.\"\n\nDe Caestecker was named TVLine's \"Performer of the Week\" for the week of September 27, 2015, for his performance in \"Laws of Nature\", particularly the episode's final scene.\n\nJemma Simmons (portrayed by Elizabeth Henstridge) is brought on to Coulson's team as a life sciences (both human and alien) specialist, and has a close bond with Agent Fitz, the two having graduated from the S.H.I.E.L.D. academy together. She grows to mistrust all things alien and superhuman, but shows her loyalty to Coulson despite this when they are faced with the rival S.H.I.E.L.D. faction. Following the fight against the Inhumans, Simmons is absorbed by the Kree monolith, a portal to the alien planet Maveth. There she falls in love with Will Daniels, who sacrifices himself so she can return to Earth. Simmons eventually moves on from Daniels and begins a relationship with Fitz.\nHenstridge was also cast in November 2012. She described her character as \"a biochem expert. She’s young and hungry and she’s a great woman to play because she’s intelligent and focused and curious and she doesn’t apologize for it. She’s got a wonderful relationship with Fitz. They kind of bounce off each other.\" After the reveal during the season two premiere that Fitz was just imagining Simmons in the episode, Henstridge explained that the showrunners \"tell you what you need to know to act your scenes, but anything after that, you never know.\" For Simmons' costume design, Foley tried to have her clothes reflect her personality, without \"getting too cliché...we mix the hard with the soft—we combine the feminine elements like peter pan collars, silk blouses and florals with the masculine touches like ties\".\n\nHenstridge talked about the characters of Fitz and Simmons being separated over the course of the series, noting that they have \"never been without each other. When you see them without each other, that brings a whole new dynamic just to them as characters in discovering what it's like to have to be independent\". On Simmons' guilt over Fitz's brain damage, Henstridge said \"She feels a huge amount of guilt. There’s a lot of emotions happening. A lot of it revolves around Fitz and Ward. She feels a lot of anger and resentment at the situation. When something catastrophic happens to someone you love, or a situation arises that affects people you love the most, if that’s the first time you’ve been in that position, you never really know what to do.\" As this relationship developed through the second season, Henstridge said, \"I don't think they fully realize the implication of how far apart they are. There's so much hurt there. I don't think they realize what they're sacrificing by not figuring this out.\" Talking about the harsher side of Simmons seen later in the second season, after the reveal of the Inhumans and the subsequent death of Agent Triplett, Henstridge explained that at the beginning of the series, Simmons was \"very mathematical\" but throughout the first season \"understood that it was more about human relationships and what it means to save someone's life\". Now, \"she's had a traumatic event and she's gone straight back to what she knows of trying to make everything black and white\", and so \"It makes sense [to her] if there are these people—call them what you want; Inhumans—that cause destruction, and you can get rid of them, then they won't be anymore...Of course it isn't\" that simple.\n\nAfter Simmons is trapped on the planet Maveth for six months, she becomes \"profoundly different\", with Henstridge describing her as \"definitely still her essence—she doesn’t just completely change. But she’s been through so much. She’s hardened. She’s had to face things that she never would’ve imagined, also by herself without Fitz, so she’s definitely changed, stronger and kind of damaged.\" Describing the relationship that Simmons develops with Daniels on the planet, and comparing it to that with Fitz, Henstridge said, \"It's very visceral. It's more primal and intense. That just comes from having to survive in a hostile environment, only having each other on the whole planet. The stakes are always so high, so it's more physical than her relationship with Fitz. FitzSimmons is a slow burn that's taken years and years, and they connected over intellect, whereas her and Will, it's an \"us against the world\" kind of thing.\" After Daniels dies and Simmons eventually moves on with Fitz, the latter two are shown consummating their relationship after several seasons worth of build up. \"We imagine they spend the morning after laughing a lot about what just happened,\" said Whedon and Tancharoen, \"We want their relationship to feel like their friendship did, because all the best relationships are just that. So moving forward, while this change in their friendship would hopefully only deepen their connection, it is bound also to make things a bit more complicated.\"\n\nHenstridge was named TVLine's \"Performer of the Week\" for the week of October 25, 2015, for her performance in \"4,722 Hours\", particularly for carrying the episode herself.\n\nLance Hunter (portrayed by Nick Blood), an SAS lieutenant turned mercenary, joins post-Hydra S.H.I.E.L.D. at the request of Coulson following a recommendation from his ex-wife Bobbi Morse. Despite a tumultuous relationship with Morse, Hunter becomes a full-time S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, and risks his life to save her when she is kidnapped. Following an incident in Russia involving the near-assassination of Prime Minister Olshenko, Hunter and Morse decide to disavow themselves from S.H.I.E.L.D. to protect Coulson and the team. Hunter continues doing mercenary work, with Fitz eventually reaching out for Hunter to help him rescue Coulson and the team when they are transported to 2091.\nLance Hunter, created by Gary Friedrich as the British version of Nick Fury for \"Captain Britain Weekly\", was confirmed in September 2014 to be a member of the principal cast for the second season. Blood was announced as cast at the 2014 San Diego Comic Con, where the character was described as not a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, but a mercenary. On his character joining the cast, Blood explained that \"each different character, the original characters, has a different kind of response to [Hunter]. Generally I think they’re slightly wary, a little bit suspicious, [but also] a little bit amused by him. Because the nice thing about him coming into this group is that Lance doesn’t really care that much of what people think of him. So he’s very much himself and very comfortable in it. He doesn’t bow down to the etiquette of the S.H.I.E.L.D. hierarchy.\"\n\nTalking about Hunter's integration into the team following an offer from Coulson to become a full-time agent, Blood said, \"I feel Hunter probably feels very independent, still, so I don't think he would like to admit that he's not an outsider, that he's a part of it...He doesn't have too much respect for authority and titles, particularly in this world, but I think he takes each decision as it comes. If Coulson does something he respects, that's all good. If he doesn't, he's going to say something. But I think he sees that [Coulson is] trying to do the right thing, and he's got a lot of respect for him in that sense\". Also, on Hunter's on-again, off-again relationship with Morse, Blood said, \"I think the dynamic's great. I think it's really good and there is a lot of truth in it of those relationships you have where it's kind of, \"can't live with each other, can't kill each other,\" and that sort of thing.\" After Hunter kills a man in \"A Wanted (Inhu)man\", Blood said, \"I think that’s probably newer for the audience than it is for Hunter. I think Hunter, in his past, has probably done some morally questionable acts...not to say he’s ever been a vicious, vindictive, or immoral person. I think he’s just kind of straddled that line between right and wrong.\"\n\nBlood left the series following the season three episode \"Parting Shot\" to star in the spin-off show \"Marvel's Most Wanted\". As that series was not picked up in May 2016, it was announced in September 2017 that Blood would return to \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D\" during season five. On where Hunter's been when he returns to help Fitz get to 2091 to rescue Coulson and the team, Blood said, \"he’s been up his usual tricks, doing some mercenary work and bickering with Bobbi…. He doesn’t necessarily have access to all the bells-and-whistles and gadgetry that S.H.I.E.L.D. did, so he has to use his charm and his wit to break down doors, and call in a few favors from his dodgy friends\".\n\nBarbara \"Bobbi\" Morse (portrayed by Adrianne Palicki) is Hunter's ex-wife and an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. A founding member of the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" after disobeying Fury's orders to save hundreds of S.H.I.E.L.D. lives, she infiltrates Coulson's group for reconnaissance. Coulson sends her undercover within Hydra, where she gave up the location of Agent 33 rather than risk the lives of many other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents. She later agrees, along with her fellow \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" leaders, to combine their faction with Coulson's. Ward then kidnaps her in an attempt to force her to confess to giving up 33 to Hydra, but when Morse is unrepentant, Ward sets a trap for Hunter which will see him killed in front of her. Morse takes the bullet for Hunter, barely surviving. Following an incident in Russia involving the near-assassination of Prime Minister Olshenko, Morse and Hunter decide to disavow themselves from S.H.I.E.L.D. to protect Coulson and the team.\nAt the 2014 San Diego Comic Con, the character of Bobbi Morse / Mockingbird, who was first introduced in \"Astonishing Tales\" #6 by Gerry Conway, was revealed to be appearing in the second season. That August, Palicki was cast as Morse in a guest role, to appear in the episode \"A Hen in the Wolf House\", but with the potential to return. Palicki, a comic fan, was approached by the showrunners specifically for the part, and at first hesitated to take the role, thinking \"I will never be able to play another Marvel character if I go forward in this role.\" Palicki already had martial arts and gun training, but had to learn to use the character's signature arnis sticks, and noted similarities between Morse's fighting style and that of Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow from the MCU films. Palicki was promoted to series regular with the season two episode \"Aftershocks\".\n\nIn approaching Morse's costume, Foley \"looked at all of her comic appearances and really wanted to try to bring elements of the look from the comics into the costume that we're doing now for the show...but we had to change it, obviously, for practicality, because it had to fit into our world. It had to have a kind of tactical feeling to it too so that it made sense in our universe. She's got rivets that are in the straps across her chest, and those are there as a tribute to the buttons that go down the side of her [most recent comics] costume\". The character's comics costume is traditionally navy blue and white, which was changed to navy blue and grey for the series. Three sets of the costume were produced; two for Palicki to wear, and one for her stunt double. Foley used \"lots of stretch panels\" and leather to ensure freedom of movement in the character's many action sequences.\n\nWith the reveal of Morse's loyalty to the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" faction, Palicki explained that the character was \"not doing anything wrong in her [own] eyes...This was a choice she made. She’s been through hell with these people. She does care about Coulson’s team. She’s torn because of Hunter and she has a soft spot for Coulson. But at the end of it, she really is a true soldier and she feels there has been a compromise and she needs to take care of it.\" Bell, in response to a question on whether Morse had more secrets than those revealed during the second season, stated that \"she and Hunter have been keeping secrets from one another, evidently for years. And one of the things I find interesting about her is she seems to be more of an ideologue—she’s loyal to an idea—and sometimes, the short term of what appears to be betrayal or short term conflict is often because of what she views as the greater good. And that’s an interesting character to have in a world where Coulson is much more \"we need to protect or save that person.\" Are you loyal to a person? Are you loyal to the guy in the bunker next to you? Or are you loyal to the larger concept of what we’re fighting for?\"\n\nWhen asked about her character potentially appearing in an MCU film, Palicki said \"that was one of the things that was discussed when I was coming on for the part, and you know, we’ll see what happens. It’s such a nice world that we live in that crossover can happen so often now which in the past it never really did so, to see these worlds come together on the small screen and the big screen is really cool.\" Palicki left the series following the season three episode \"Parting Shot\" to star in the spin-off show \"Marvel's Most Wanted\".\n\nPalicki was named as an honorable mention for TVLine's \"Performer of the Week\" for the week of March 20, 2016, for her performance in \"Parting Shot\".\n\nAlphonso \"Mack\" MacKenzie (portrayed by Henry Simmons), a S.H.I.E.L.D. mechanic under Robert Gonzales, is a founding member of the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\", and infiltrates Coulson's group with Morse. After being briefly mind-controlled by Kree technology Mack's distrust in alien and the superhuman is deepened, and he decides to leave S.H.I.E.L.D. when his fellow leaders agree to join forces with Coulson. However, following the war with the Inhumans, Coulson convinces Mack to stay, and places him in charge of all alien materials. Coulson makes Mack acting director of S.H.I.E.L.D. when he goes after Ward and Hydra. In the Framework, Mack's daughter Hope is still alive. After being used by Hydra to reveal Johnson is from the real world, he seeks out the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance to help them. When the exit point from the Framework is found, Mack chooses to stay behind, saying that the time he spent with the Framework version of Hope was real enough for him. He later leaves the Framework when Hope disappears amongst the Framework's collapse.\nIn August 2014, Simmons joined the cast as Mack, a recurring character inspired by one that first appeared in \"Nick Fury vs. S.H.I.E.L.D.\" #3. He was promoted to series regular for the third season.\n\nSimmons described Mack as \"a big guy. That is, he has a big heart, but when it comes down to it and business has to get done, there’s another side of him that gets it done...He wants to make a difference, so that’s why he wants to be a part of this team\". On the different dynamic that a mechanic brings to the S.H.I.E.L.D. team, Simmons said \"I think my guy does have a little bit of a different element, [because] the other people have the stress of the everyday life or death danger situations. Mack doesn’t have that quite yet. He has the stress of getting things done because he wants to contribute, but he’s not out there in the field...They might have their quips and everything, but everything is very serious. I see that my guy brings a little bit of a different color to everything. He has a little bit more humor to him, he’s a little bit more laid back.\" On Mack's stance on violence, Simmons confirmed that \"Mack really is a guy that does not like violence at all, but, when pushed, it’s \"by any means necessary.\" He doesn’t enjoy it, but he’ll do what he has to do.\"\n\nAfter Mack's allegiance to the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" faction is revealed, and as his distrust of Coulson grew throughout the second season, Simmons spoke of Mack's feelings towards Coulson: \"He respects Coulson. And I think he genuinely likes Coulson. But I think he just believes that Coulson is not the right man for the job...look, I’m loyal, but if the head is going about doing things that really aren’t in our job description, and he’s using us to do things for personal reasons, and then one of my brothers dies because of it? Yeah, I have a problem. And everyone else should, too...when Coulson is in his most crazed state and on the verge of killing Sebastian Derik, no one has ever seen Coulson like that. Skye witnessed it, but she has a different relationship to him; there’s like a father/daughter thing going. So out of the whole team, I was the only one to see him like that, completely out of control. I tried to explain it to Hunter—if that happened in that instant, what’s going to happen when everything is on the line? How is he going to act?—and Hunter kind of brushed it aside. But that’s another reason why Mack is very, very deeply skeptical.\"\n\nLincoln Campbell (portrayed by Luke Mitchell) is an Inhuman doctor with the ability to control electric charges. He helps Skye adjust to her new life post-terrigenesis, and his later attempt to protect her from S.H.I.E.L.D. and Hydra leads to his capture and experimentation at the hands of Dr. List. Skye saves his life, and when she turns on Jiaying once realizing her true intentions, Campbell is shortly convinced to do the same. Following Jiaying's death, Campbell attempts to live a normal life, convinced that his Inhuman abilities are a curse, but is hunted by the ATCU and becomes a fugitive. He subsequently joins S.H.I.E.L.D. for protection and to be near Skye—now going by Daisy Johnson and with whom Campbell forms a relationship—and becomes a Secret Warrior. Campbell chooses to sacrifice himself to save the team and the world from Hive's plan by taking Hive and a nuclear warhead to space in a quinjet where the weapon can detonate without affecting Earth.\nMitchell was introduced as Lincoln Campbell, a recurring character, in the second season. He was promoted to series regular for the third season. Regarding the character's introduction, Bell stated that \"Meeting Luke’s character in the Inhuman world is just setting up a new dynamic. We’re taking Skye into a group with a whole bunch of different people. So far, we’ve seen that there’s a guy with no eyes, and there’s a woman who now is covered in thorns. And as in the X-Men world, there are a handful of people who look more like them, but a lot of them turn out to be just attractive people with powers. And we thought, \"Hey, let’s have some of those as well!\" We were looking for a new character to come on, and Luke just really impressed us. He was a good actor, had a nice quality, and we felt he might be a good person to sort of usher Skye into this other world.\"\n\nHeading into season three, Mitchell explained that \"the Lincoln that the audience was introduced to in season two was a side of Lincoln, and that side of Lincoln was not necessarily a lie or the truth or whatever, but we all put on different faces in different environments...I think in that environment Lincoln was very much under the spell of the Inhuman Elders. He played his part in the hierarchy there and he believed in the cause, which then was exposed to be evil. Then in season three, it’s like, wow, how is he dealing with the events in season two?\" On seeing Lincoln's darker side in the third season, Mitchell said, \"I think we’re going to see a lot more of Lincoln’s issues with his past pop up, in particular possibly some anger issues that have been unresolved. They pop their heads up from time to time. Certainly in matters of conflict, in pressure situations\".\n\nOn the relationship that Campbell develops with Johnson, the only person who can \"keep him somewhat in check when it comes to his anger\", Mitchell said, \"he wants to make something of his life, but he doesn’t see anything without Daisy in the picture\", and \"if something were to happen to Daisy, I think Lincoln wouldn’t stay in S.H.I.E.L.D. Daisy is his life. He’ll do anything to get her back.\" This is seen when he agrees to wear a \"murder vest\" as a fail safe, and when he disobeys orders to test an experimental antitoxin on himself—\"Once he does that, and it doesn’t work, then they put him in the containment module for his own benefit, because his immune system is done. It becomes incredibly frustrating.\" Mitchell added, \"He makes these decisions, but you still see the fear in him when he does this. It’s not just bravado...There’s a deep well of emotion in him.\"\n\nThe episode \"Bouncing Back\" opens with \"a mysterious flash-forward to three months in the future, showing an unidentified S.H.I.E.L.D. agent seemingly dead in space\", leading to a \"four-episode event\" for the final episodes of the season, marketed as \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Fallen Agent\". A poster created by Greg Land for the event recreated the cover of the \"iconic\" \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #121 that served as the first issue of the story arc \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\", and ahead of the season finale, Marvel released a series of videos that \"memorialized\" each of the potential character who could have been the Fallen Agent. The final episode of the season reveals that it is Campbell who dies, which the executive producers had known going into the season when forming the arcs for Lincoln, Daisy, and Ward. Bell said he \"earned it\", adding that Lincoln comes to a point where he realizes what his purpose is, with Whedon explaining that the decision was based on the fact that the series did not \"want to be a body count show, but it is a real world with real stakes. What we had not done is the heroic death and the full-sacrifice death. This was a conscious decision. We also think that there’s a poetry in the fact that the person doing it doesn’t consider himself a hero. That’s the beauty of the moment—it’s not just for [Daisy], but it is, and it’s not just for him, but it is.\"\n\nHolden Radcliffe (portrayed by John Hannah) is a transhumanist who believes in the improvement of humanity through enhancement. Due to his studies of parasites, Fitz and Simmons seek his help with counteracting Hive's abilities, but he is kidnapped by Hive first to help recreate the original Kree experiment that created the Inhumans. After a S.H.I.E.L.D. raid on Hive's base, Radcliffe escapes and agrees to cooperate with Coulson and Talbot. After being acquitted, Radcliffe transfers his artificial intelligence AIDA into a Life Model Decoy (LMD), an old S.H.I.E.L.D. project, which Radcliffe also names Aida. After seeing pages from the \"Darkhold\", Radcliffe begins using his LMDs, including Aida and a decoy of May, to try and take it for himself in an attempt to learn the secret to eternal life. Fearing for his safety, Radcliffe also creates a decoy of himself, and seeks protection from the Watchdogs. Using the \"Darkhold\" and the resources of the Watchdogs' Superior, Racliffe creates an entire digital world within the Framework. Feeling that Radcliffe may one day jeopardize the Framework himself, Aida slits Radcliffe's wrists and uploads his mind to the Framework as his body dies. Within the Framework, his consciousness resided on Ogygia with Agnes in exchange for not interfering with Aida's work as Madame Hydra. After redeeming himself, Holden is deleted amongst the Framework's collapse.\nHannah recurred as Radcliffe during the end of the third season, before being promoted to the main cast for the fourth season. On Radcliffe transferring his artificial intelligence AIDA into a Life Model Decoy, Whedon said, \"Radcliffe has a good heart, but he's willing to do anything for science. He's excited about the prospect. He said Fitz and Simmons had friends die and maybe they didn't have to. He's clearly opening a box. Whether or not it's Pandora's box, we'll see. He thinks there's something beyond humans.\" Tancharoen added, \"To someone like Radcliffe, he might believe that to be just the next step in human evolution. There are a number of people who are into body modification now, so what does that mean? What's the root of that?\"\n\nHannah felt portray Radcliffe was \"quite interesting\", describing him as \"someone who is not the up-down, white-hearted good guy\" but still is not \"a bad guy\". He also noted the fatherly feelings Radcliffe has towards Aida, stating, \"possibly as [their relationship] develops, as she proves there’s almost a paternal... caring and sympathetic way in which that technology has developed self-awareness and how that self-awareness disappoints. A bit like you would with a child, where a child becomes aware of their own limitations, their own lackings. I would say there’s certainly have a very benign kind of deity sense about it – a benign…not dictatorship about it, but a benign parental way about it.\"\n\nElena Rodriguez (portrayed by Natalia Cordova-Buckley) is a Colombian Inhuman who can move at a super speed for a beat of her heart, before returning to the point she started moving from. She comes into contact with S.H.I.E.L.D. when they investigate her for stealing weapons from the corrupt members of the local police. She grows close to Mack, who nicknames her \"Yo-Yo\", and eventually agrees to join the Secret Warriors. After the signing of the Sokovia Accords, Rodriguez returns to her life with occasional monitoring by S.H.I.E.L.D. Rodriguez later helps Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons to infiltrate the Framework. After Johnson and Simmons are unable to rescue Mack from the Framework, Rodriguez goes in to rescue him.\n\nBy February 2016, Cordova-Buckley was cast as \"Yo-Yo\" Rodriguez, based on the comic Secret Warrior of the same name. Cordova-Buckley learned of the role after she had been cast in the series, and subsequently researched the comics for inspiration. She described the character, as she is initially introduced in the series, as a freedom fighter who \"in a lot of ways she wants to help her people in Colombia and she wants to do good with her powers and she makes sure that she’s very adamant on how she goes about things.\" She also noted the rarity of the character's spirituality, saying that she \"has this whole spiritual connection to her powers which is rare to ever see in a super hero movie...She wants to use [her powers] as what she calls a blessing and a gift from God to help others, so it’s a very unique approach to it all\". When first portraying the character, Cordova-Buckley smiled whenever Rodriguez was about to use her abilities, to show an adrenaline rush and the feeling of having such power. After positive fan responses to this, the actress morphed this trait into a more mischievous personality for the character. Before the start of the fifth season, it was revealed that Cordova-Buckley had been promoted to series regular.\n\nThe following is a list of guest characters that have recurring roles throughout the series. The characters are listed by the MCU media or season in which they first appeared.\n\nGideon Malick (portrayed by Powers Boothe) is a former member of the World Security Council and secret leader of Hydra who ascended to power following the death of his father in 1970. Gideon was joined by his brother Nathaniel, but the two soon learned of a trick their father used to avoid being sacrificed to Hive, and when Gideon followed suit, Nathaniel was sacrificed. Gideon successfully opens the portal to allow Hive to return to Earth, but Hive reveals that he has retained Nathaniel's memories, and punishes Gideon by murdering his daughter Stephanie. After being captured by S.H.I.E.L.D., Gideon cooperates with Coulson against Hive. Gideon is murdered by Johnson while she is controlled by Hive.\n\nIn October 2015, it was announced that Boothe was joining the series as a recurring character early in the third season, reprising his role from \"The Avengers\" (where he was credited only as \"World Security Council\"). On how much the series would use the character later in the third season, following the midseason finale, Whedon stated that \"we’d be fools not to use him more. We couldn’t be bigger fans of [Boothe's] portrayal of the role. We knew going in that we were going to get some bang for our buck, and we’ve been loving writing the character. We love the way he’s attacking the scenes. We plan on keeping him around, because we’d be idiots not to.\" Cameron Palatas portrays a young Gideon Malick.\n\nMike Peterson (portrayed by J. August Richards) is an ordinary man that was artificially enhanced with the Extremis-containing Centipede serum by Project Centipede. Peterson later joins S.H.I.E.L.D, but is caught in an explosion and awakens without his right leg and under the control of the \"Clairvoyant\", who gives him a bionic prosthetic limb as part of \"Project Deathlok\". After the defeat of Centipede and the \"Clairvoyant\", Peterson works for Coulson covertly, and aids in the take down of Hydra leader Dr. List.\n\nRichards appeared in Joss Whedon's \"Angel\" as Charles Gunn before being cast as Peterson, who was revealed to be the MCU version of Deathlok in January 2014. Created by Rich Buckler and Doug Moench in 1974, Deathlok has gone through many different iterations in the comics. Richards called the role \"a dream come true\", and described the character's costume and makeup, which took \"about five departments...two hours to do the makeup and then [about] 15 or 20 minutes to get into the costume\", as \"restrictive. I love the costume and it really helps me to play the character, because it makes me feel part-machine, part-human.\" The costume also had to be enhanced with visual effects, including the addition of a robotic leg and an arm mounted rocket launcher, as well as a half metal plated skull with robotic eye for when Deathlok is seen with x-ray vision. The costume was updated and evolved to be closer to the comic version for Deathlok's appearance in the second season.\n\nRichards found \"the theme of Deathlok [to be] about deep, internal conflict, and that's what we're bringing with this [version].\" After returning late in the second season, Richards looked back, and felt that his initial awkwardness and reluctance with the character and the costume reflected Peterson's own journey becoming Deathlok. He also noted that when the character says \"Mike Peterson is dead\", \"the only way that line could have meaning [is] if it were not true. I always think of Mike Peterson being at the core of this character, and whatever happens as a result of that, is all Mike Petersen.\"\n\nIan Quinn (portrayed by David Conrad) is a wealthy industrialist/philanthropist and the CEO of Quinn Worldwide, who is involved with The Clairvoyant. He acquires Deathlok technology for Mike Peterson, and attempts to sell more Deathlok soldiers to the U.S. military. After Garrett is defeated, Quinn goes into hiding with his gravitonium.\n\nRaina (portrayed by Ruth Negga) was raised by Calvin Johnson, and grew up with stories of her heritage as an Inhuman, and her potential to be more. Becoming the Project Centipede recruiter due to her interest in powered people, Raina works with Hydra in an attempt to replicate the GH-325 serum that was used to resurrect Coulson. She eventually goes through Terrigenesis, gaining the power of precognition, but also a monstrous appearance. Raina comes to accept her new circumstances, and later allows Jiaying to kill her so that Skye can learn of the former's true intent.\n\nNegga was first cast as a guest star in October 2013, with executive producer Jeffrey Bell later explaining that \"Ruth Negga showed up and we just fell in love with her and found ways to use her beyond our initial conception\". Foley was informed of Raina ahead of time, allowing her to flesh out the character with illustrations, as well as print specific fabric. When Raina is introduced in \"Girl in the Flower Dress\", Foley and Negga \"wanted to show a progression in her dresses that reflects where her character might be going\", with her initially unclear intentions paired with \"a softer silhouette\" and a pattern of white with black flowers. For her second appearance in the episode, \"it's becoming clear that she has an agenda\" so the dress is more streamlined, and the colors are flipped to black with white flowers. For her final appearance in the episode, her dress is red with black flowers. Foley concluded, \"By the time you see her again in [\"The Bridge\"] you know she means business\". After Raina is transformed in the second season she hides her hideous appearance with a hooded jacket, which Foley subtly added a flower pattern to, as \"she was always going to be the girl in the flower dress, so I wanted to pay tribute to that\".\n\nRaina's Inhuman look was created by Glenn Hetrick of Optic Nerve Studios. To get to the final look, the writers spent a lot of time discussing what her transformed look would entail, such as if she would have a nose, or a tail, with series writer Drew Greenberg eventually suggesting thorns. With the design idea in hand, Hetrick and his team began compiling potential designs for the character, looking to the Clive Barker film \"Nightbreed\", specifically the character Shuna Sassi, because \"She’s a creature covered in porcupine quills and that image is so strong — it creates such a striking silhouette\". Since Hetrick and his team did not have source material to pull from in the comics, he wanted to \"make her feel like the first real Inhuman\" and give her face a level of symmetry. When creating the prosthetic makeup, which was done in two weeks, the producers wanted to still be able to see Negga's eyes, with Bell saying, \"Ruth Negga has amazingly expressive eyes and eyebrows. And she gets so much of who Raina is through the eyes. We wanted her to still be able to communicate, we still wanted you to feel her expressions through all of [the makeup].\"\n\nVictoria Hand (portrayed by Saffron Burrows) is introduced as the high-ranking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who runs The Hub, a S.H.I.E.L.D. base. After discovering that Hydra exists within S.H.I.E.L.D., Hand turns on Coulson, believing him to be a double agent. However, Garrett soon reveals himself to be the traitor, and Hand works with Coulson to detain him. She is killed by Ward when he reveals himself to be a member of Hydra to save Garrett from imprisonment.\n\nIn November 2013, Burrows was announced as playing Hand, who was created by Brian Michael Bendis and Mike Deodato, and played an integral role in their \"Dark Avengers\" comic book series. The character was intentionally introduced in the first season as a mislead for the true identity of the Clairvoyant. With the introduction of Lucy Lawless as Isabelle Hartley in the second season, the executive producers considered establishing a relationship between Hand and Hartley, since the comic book-counterpart of Hand was in a relationship with a character called Isabelle, but Tancharoen stated that \"it started to be irresponsible if we addressed it to not address it with more weight and time and energy.\" However, this relationship was later hinted at onscreen in \"One Door Closes\".\n\nDavis (portrayed by Maximilian Osinski) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who worked alongside Phil Coulson's group on investigating the explosion at StatiCorp's Particle Accelerator Complex before the Hydra Uprising. He later returned to S.H.I.E.L.D. when Jeffrey Mace became its director. During the LMD infiltration of the S.H.I.E.L.D. base, Davis and a few surviving S.H.I.E.L.D. agents help Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons escape the base. Davis is later killed by Ophelia.\n\nAnne Weaver (portrayed by Christine Adams) is the director of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy of Science and Technology who joins the leadership of the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" following the fall of the original organization, in which she fought one of Hydra's enhanced soldiers, developing a distrust in the superhumans. She takes over command of the S.H.I.E.L.D. warship \"The Iliad\" following the death of Robert Gonzales.\n\nJohn Garrett (portrayed by Bill Paxton) was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who was left for dead by that organization, and only survived by becoming the first Deathlok. Joining Hydra, he became \"The Clairvoyant\", leader of the Centipede group, and was focused on discovering the secret to Coulson's resurrection given the impending failure of his now outdated Deathlok technology. Under the guise of a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent tasked with capturing and interrogating Ian Quinn, Garrett joins in Coulson's efforts to find the GH-325 drug. Based on his findings, Raina is able to synthesize a version of the drug, which does save his life. However, after Hydra is revealed to have infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. and Garret is outed as the Clairvoyant, Coulson kills him by disintegration.\n\nIn December 2013, \"a high-level S.H.I.E.L.D. agent/munitions expert who has past ties to both Coulson and Ward\" was set to be added to the series. The next month, Paxton was cast as Agent John Garrett, \"a rough-and-tumble former cohort of Agent Coulson with a little bit of attitude and cigar-smoking swagger\". Garrett was first introduced by Frank Miller and Bill Sienkiewicz in \"\". Jed Whedon said that \"We actually discussed Bill Paxton in the room, when we were talking about the character ... Then when he came up as an actual possibility, we couldn't believe it.\" Following the revelation that Garrett was The Clairvoyant, Paxton said, \"He’s felt like he’s found a true home in Hydra, which is more of a Darwinian outfit. It’s survival of the fittest. He can relate to that.\"\n\nAntoine Triplett (portrayed by B. J. Britt) worked with Garrett until the Hydra reveal, after which he joins Coulson's team. Trip perishes when he becomes trapped in the chamber Skye and Raina undergo Terrigenesis in and gets hit by a fragment of the Diviner. In the Framework, Antoine Triplett is Jeffrey Mace's inside man who got caught and was incarcerated at a Hydra Cultivation Enlightenment Camp until he was freed by Mace and Phil Coulson.\n\nIn December 2013, \"an African-American agent who specializes in combat/weapons\" was set to be added to the series. In February, Britt was announced as cast in the role of Triplett. Britt's smile and charm were incorporated into the character after he had worked with the writers for several episodes, with Tancharoen saying to Britt \"I love your smile. We have to incorporate the smile of Trip into the show.\" Britt said of the character, \"Trip likes to make sure everything is in order...he’s going make sure that stuff doesn’t go wrong. [But] I still feel like Trip has something to prove. That’s going to cross over to the second season where Trip wants to show Coulson that he can trust him.\" Britt returned in the fourth season to reprise the character within the Framework reality.\n\nGlenn Talbot (portrayed by Adrian Pasdar) is a United States Air Force colonel and later brigadier general who hunts active S.H.I.E.L.D. agents after the organization's disbandment. Coulson earns his trust over time, and the two soon enter an agreement in which S.H.I.E.L.D. provides the government with sensitive assets and helps with the take down of Hydra in exchange for being left alone. He is made head of the Advanced Threat Containment Unit (ATCU) following the death of Rosalind Price, an arrangement which sees him reluctantly working for Coulson. Glenn Talbot is later placed in a coma following a head shot caused by the Daisy Johnson LMD at a government meeting.\n\nCreated by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko for \"Tales to Astonish\" #61, Talbot was a recurring antagonist of the Hulk. Pasdar was cast as Talbot by March 2014, with this version focused on taking down Hydra.\n\nEric, Billy, Sam, and Thurston Koenig (portrayed by Patton Oswalt) are identical brothers. The former three are S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, programmers in the initial S.H.I.E.L.D. LMD program. Eric is stationed at the Providence base and assists Coulson in the wake of Hydra's emergence, but is soon killed by Ward. Coulson and his team meet Billy, the brother of Eric, at the Playground base soon after. Billy and Sam work with Coulson on the mysterious Theta Protocol, the maintenance of a S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier for use by Nick Fury. Later, Coulson entrusts the Darkhold to Billy and Sam, who hide the book in the Labyrinth, a S.H.I.E.L.D. base only accessible by the Koenigs.\n\nOswalt joined the series as Eric Koenig in March 2014. This version of the character is loosely inspired by one that first appeared in \"Sgt. Fury and his Howling Commandos\" #27. Oswalt also portrays Eric's brothers. After previously working on Joss Whedon's \"Dollhouse\" and being a long time fan of Marvel, Oswalt was sought for the part specifically.\n\nCalvin Johnson (portrayed by Kyle MacLachlan), a young doctor, met the Inhuman Jiaying while in China. The two eventually married, and had a daughter, Daisy. After Jiaying was torn apart by Hydra, and Daisy was taken by S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Cal stitched his wife back together, found innocent people whose life-force was used to bring Jiaying back to life, and began searching for his daughter, at some point changing his last name. He also began experimenting on himself in an attempt to be stronger, blaming himself for not protecting his family. Jiaying eventually abandoned the search to live a peaceful life with other Inhumans like her, but Cal continued, eventually meeting Daisy—now going by Skye—and over time forming a bond with her, despite her hatred for his past actions. Coulson later convinces Cal that Jiaying is a monster who has forced him to do terrible things, and when Jiaying starts a war with S.H.I.E.L.D. that leads to a face down with Skye, Cal kills Jiaying. S.H.I.E.L.D. then wipes Cal's memory to allow him to live a peaceful life.\n\nDuring the first-season finale, Skye's father is briefly seen from behind, portrayed by a stand-in. In August 2014, MacLachlan was cast in the role, to recur throughout the second season. Initially referred to as \"The Doctor\", his character was revealed to be Calvin Zabo, also known as Mister Hyde, in December 2014. Zabo was created by Stan Lee and Don Heck for \"Journey into Mystery\" in 1963, and is influenced by Robert Louis Stevenson's \"The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\". MacLachlan's makeup for his transformation into the Mister Hyde persona in the second-season finale took around two and a half hours to apply. Following the conclusion of season two, Bell said on Cal's storyline, \"He got to live a happily ever after in a beautiful way. We would never write off the idea of finding more story for him down the road, but we had a great time with Kyle this year and feel like that was a story that ended nicely.\" Bell elaborated that they \"felt like everything he did came from the right place but that he was just a really horrible, broken man. The idea of [using] the T.A.H.I.T.I. program to reset him as the good person that has always been in there was too good to pass up.\"\n\nWerner Reinhardt (portrayed by Reed Diamond), a high ranking Nazi officer and an elite member of Hydra in 1945, was experimenting on the Diviner when his base was taken by the SSR and he was imprisoned for life. Released by Alexander Pierce in 1988, Reinhardt discovered that a woman unaffected by the Diviner, Jiaying, had apparently not aged in four decades. Dissecting her, Reinhardt discovered the secret to her youthfulness and used it to de-age himself. Taking the name Daniel Whitehall, he became the North American leader of Hydra following Pierce's death, fighting against Coulson's S.H.I.E.L.D. while remaining interested in the Diviner and other alien matters. He is killed by Coulson while trying to unlock the true power of the Diviner.\n\nAt the San Diego Comic Con in July 2014, Diamond was announced as portraying Daniel Whitehall, also known as the Kraken in the comics, where he was introduced by Jonathan Hickman for \"Secret Warriors\" #7. Diamond previously worked with the creators on \"Dollhouse\" and \"Much Ado About Nothing\", and though they had wanted him for parts throughout the first season, he had been unavailable due to commitments to another series. Diamond accepted the role of Whitehall with just 24 hours to prepare, during which he formed the character's German accent to use for flashback sequences. In developing the character, Diamond watched Nazi documentaries, and re-watched Marvel's films, looking at the characters of Loki and Red Skull in particular. From the former, Diamond was inspired by his \"The Avengers\" quote, \"I am burdened with glorious purpose\", as he had never played a super villain, \"someone who really believed that they were the best person to rule the universe, or at least the Earth.\" For Hugo Weaving's portrayal of the Red Skull, Diamond looked at his anger and voice to see \"how [Whitehall] would fit in within that spectrum\", and settled on \"this is TV. I’m the smiling, calm, villain.\" Diamond also sought advice from Malcolm McDowell, who told him to \"Always smile and let the lines do the work.\" The character is often seen cleaning his glasses, an \"identifying quality\" devised by Jed Whedon.\n\nSunil Bakshi (portrayed by Simon Kassianides), the right-hand man to Whitehall, is instrumental in the brainwashing of Hydra's subjects, including S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Kara Palamas, who later gets revenge by brainwashing Bakshi herself. Now loyal to Palamas and Ward, Bakshi sacrifices his life to save the latter when Simmons tries to kill him. In the Framework, Sunil Bakshi is a news presenter who hosts \"The Bakshi Report\" where he reports on Hydra's actions against the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance.\n\nKassianides, a fan of the series and of comic books in general, was cast in the \"major recurring role\" of Bakshi in July 2014. The producers intended for Bakshi to be killed off in the fifth episode of the second season, but changed their minds after Kassianides' early table reads and extended his run on the show through to the nineteenth episode. Speaking of the character's relationship with Whitehall, Kassianides explained, \"Bakshi really feels he can act under the authority of Whitehall on his own, using his own judgment. He has the trust of Whitehall and is acting as he sees fit, the consequences of which will play out.\" On Bakshi's motivations and thought process, Kassianides said \"When you’re that committed to any ideology, I think that it allows for elements of insanity ... whether that’s been trained in him or it’s inherent, it’s not clear, but he’s certainly at that point where hurting people, torturing people, and operating under this ideology is something he quite enjoys.\"\n\nKara Palamas (portrayed by Maya Stojan) was a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent betrayed to Hydra by the then undercover Morse and subjected to brainwashing by Bakshi and Whitehall. The now Hydra-loyal Palamas used a nanomask to take on the appearance of May, and when the latter electrocutes Palamas whilst in this disguise, she is left stuck as May, but deformed. After Coulson kills Whitehall, Palamas works with Ward, the two forming a romantic relationship while the latter does everything in his power to bring Palamas \"closure\". They get her nanomask repaired so that she can become whoever she wishes, brainwash Bakshi, and kidnap Morse in an attempt to force a confession out of her. When May and Hunter come to rescue Morse, Ward accidentally kills Palamas while she is in disguise as May.\n\nWhile Stojan portrays Palamas, the character is also portrayed by other cast members, including Ming-Na Wen and Chloe Bennet, when she takes on the appearance of their characters. Stojan had to balance working on the series with her concurrent recurring role on \"Castle\", but was still able to appear in every episode offered to her. Speaking about portraying Palamas, and the differences between her and May, Wen said, \"not only did she lose her face, she lost her will, really. I mean she is completely controlled by Whitehall and...it’s sort of a sad character for me to portray because she’s so opposite from May. May is so confident and knows exactly what she needs to do and can get the job done based on her own opinions and with Agent 33, not only is she disfigured, not only doesn’t she have her face anymore, she doesn’t have her identity anymore.\" After Palamas breaks free of her brainwashing and joins Ward, Stojan said of the character and their new relationship, \"That love/romance that she has with Ward...she's really, I think, trying to find herself—whether it's good or bad. She truly believes in that one man, and she's going to follow him.\"\n\nJiaying (portrayed by Dichen Lachman) is the Inhuman wife of Calvin Johnson, and Daisy's mother, who does not age and can heal rapidly thanks to an elder of her village giving their life each year. Pieced back together by Calvin after Whitehall dissects her to discover the secret to her abilities, Jiaying is never the same, and goes to great lengths to find her daughter, now willingly taking innocent lives to feed her abilities, having no regard for humans. Eventually Jiaying tries to escape this new persona by founding Afterlife, a haven for Inhumans, and when Daisy (going by Skye) journeys to Afterlife, Jiaying happily becomes her mentor. However, when S.H.I.E.L.D. discovers the location of Afterlife, Jiaying starts a war with them, and attempts to kill all humans with artificial Terrigen crystals. She even tries to drain Skye's life when the former turns on her, but is stopped by Calvin, who kills her.\n\nSpeaking about the levels of violence depicted in the series, Bell admitted that the executive producers and the network did question the graphicness of the sequence where Jiaying is dissected by Whitehall, but that it was ultimately kept as is because they felt that \"it was important for you to understand how horrible that was and what she went through and miraculously survived—that was a big part of our story.\" For Jiaying's costume, Foley \"wanted her to have an other-worldly kind of feeling and then also, at the time, Dichen [Lachman] was pregnant, so we needed to come up with a silhouette that could hide the pregnancy, and kind of grow with her which is why we landed on that tunic. The great thing about it is that it had this really cool Asian feeling to it with the high neck and the buttons down the front.\" Foley chose the fabrics for Jiaying's tunics based on what was going on in the story and how she felt the character was thinking.\n\nIn regards to Jiaying's perceived role as the main villain of the second season due to her actions in the final episodes, Bell said \"In our minds, [Jiaying] wasn’t a villain so much; she was an antagonist, but if you look at why she feels the way she does, Jiaying really earned that position.\" After the character's backstory and motivations were revealed, she was compared by some to the Marvel Comics character Magneto. In response to this, Bell said \"We didn’t consciously mimic [Magneto], but what they both have in common is a valid motive. Jiaying was ripped to shreds...I feel like her motive is really earned in the same way that Magneto’s is fairly earned. We always want our antagonists to have good motives...We tried to make everything she says be true.\"\n\nGordon (portrayed by Jamie Harris) is an eyeless Inhuman with the ability to teleport and emit force fields. His transition to an Inhuman was tended to by Jiaying, and he remained loyal to her in his adult life, ensuring that only a select few could enter and leave Afterlife, and joining with her in her war against S.H.I.E.L.D. While trying to spread Terrigen mist through the ventilation of \"The Iliad\", he is killed by Fitz.\n\nAndrew Garner (portrayed by Blair Underwood) is May's ex-husband and a psychologist at Culver University who assesses gifted people for S.H.I.E.L.D. Following a vacation with May to try and rekindle their relationship, Garner is exposed to Terrigen which unlocks Inhuman abilities within him; he becomes the monstrous Lash (portrayed by Matt Willig), who uses energy abilities to hunt and kill 'unworthy' Inhumans. Garner surrenders himself to S.H.I.E.L.D. before the transformation becomes permanent, and manages to say goodbye to May before completely becoming Lash. S.H.I.E.L.D. then send Lash to fight Hive, hoping that his Inhuman purpose is to destroy the latter. Though this is not the case, Lash is able to purge Daisy Johnson of Hive's control, before being killed by Hellfire.\n\nIn December 2014, Underwood was revealed to be cast as Garner for multiple appearances starting in the second season. In July 2015, the Inhuman Lash, who was created by Charles Soule and Joe Madureira for \"Inhuman\" #1, was announced as appearing in the third season. That August, Willig was revealed to be cast as Lash, with Hetrick again working alongside the series' makeup and visual effects teams to realize the character's \"unique look\" from the comics. Whedon noted that it would be their \"own take on [Lash]. There will be some elements from the comics for sure, but as we always do...we’re changing it up a little bit.\" Bell elaborated that \"it’s hard to have a hidden or magical city\" in the MCU, such as Lash's comic home of Orollan, but \"Lash’s agenda can certainly remain true to what it was in the comics\", with him judging whether Inhumans are worthy. Willig's Lash make-up initially took six hours to apply, but the make-up team was able to reduce the time to four and a half hours.\n\nWhedon noted that the series already has several Inhumans who are \"fairly attractive\" and the producers wanted \"to also show the other side of the change that bad things can happen\", with Tancharoen elaborating that \"on a very basic level, we were interested in putting a monster in the mix, because he is not human and his looks are pretty crazy and scary. We wanted to put our team up against something like that.\" On how the cast and characters react to seeing Lash, Bennet said, \"I like to think that they've seen their fair share of crazy shit and that's just something that's pretty insane but not totally mind-blowing.\" Following the reveal that Lash still had a human form, Bell said that they would spend time exploring different characters as potential candidates, though the human form was revealed to be Garner two episodes later. For the onscreen CGI transformation from Garner to Lash, Underwood and Willig were 3D scanned (the latter while in full prosthetics and make-up), and then Underwood provided motion capture for the sequence, as visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack noted the lack of resemblance between Underwood and the final Lash design, and so wanted to keep as much of Underwood's \"essence\" throughout the transformation process as possible. Underwood portrayed the transformation as \"painful\", \"rigid\", and \"tiring\", though he noted that it would become easier for the character to transform the more it happened.\n\nGoing into the third season, Underwood had only known that the producers wanted to explore more of Garner's personal life, after his appearances in the second season were \"as an appendage to Agent May...a device and a construct to open her up and see more of her life.\" He also did not see the Lash reveal coming, which he did not learn until the table read for \"Devils You Know\", when it is presumed Garner is dead, and the producers approached him afterwards to tell them their plan for the character. Underwood compared the Garner / Lash dynamic to Jekyll and Hyde and Bruce Banner / the Hulk, and compared the new May / Garner dynamic to \"Beauty and the Beast\". On Lash's motivations, Underwood stated that \"Lash sees [the Inhumans] as an exalted society and it's an honor to be an Inhuman. Not everyone is worthy of that moniker. He takes it upon himself to be judge, jury and executioner of who is worthy of being an Inhuman and who is not.\" Elaborating on this and Garner's connection to Lash, Underwood said, \"If you look at his work as a psychologist...in S.H.I.E.L.D., he determines [who] is worthy and is not worthy to be part of the Secret Warriors team...it makes sense that it's kind of that same kind of rationale, but on steroids\".\n\nRobert Gonzales (portrayed by Edward James Olmos) is an elderly S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, tactician, and the commander of \"The Iliad\" during the fall of S.H.I.E.L.D. who is tasked with protecting the Kree monolith. He is convinced not to destroy the ship (to prevent Hydra from claiming the monolith) so that the hundreds of agents on board may live, disobeying Fury's orders, and subsequently becomes a founding member of the \"real S.H.I.E.L.D.\" alongside Anne Weaver, Tomas Calderon, and Agent Oliver. He remains distrustful of secrets and all things alien, even after agreeing to keep Coulson on as Director of a new, unified S.H.I.E.L.D., but still attempts to negotiate with Jiaying and the Inhumans peacefully. However, Jiaying kills Gonzales and shoots herself, claiming that he attacked her, in order to start a war against S.H.I.E.L.D.\n\nIt was announced in January 2015 that Olmos would be joining the series as Robert Gonzales, with Olmos describing joining the MCU one of the high points of his career. Concerning the apparent difference in philosophies between Gonzales and Coulson, Olmos explained that \"the situations that I’ve come across and the situations that he’s come across have changed our ability to work with the same understanding. He’s working like Fury worked and under that understanding. I don’t work under Fury’s understanding...I think that Coulson’s philosophy is the same as mine! We are S.H.I.E.L.D. We are not anything but S.H.I.E.L.D. people. It’s just that our S.H.I.E.L.D., the one that we originally put forth, was very, very transparent. And the S.H.I.E.L.D. that has materialized under Fury—and now Coulson—is much more secretive.\" Olmos also compared the relationship between the two factions of S.H.I.E.L.D. to that between the Democrats and the Republicans.\n\nAlisha Whitley (portrayed by Alicia Vela-Bailey) is a duplicating Inhuman who was loyal to Jiaying until she learned that the latter started the war with S.H.I.E.L.D. After Jiaying's death, Alisha helps S.H.I.E.L.D. until she falls under the influence of Hive. She is later murdered by a Kree reaper.\n\nKebo (portrayed by Daz Crawford) is a member of Hydra, second-in-command to Ward until he is killed by Morse. Crawford only signed on for the second-season finale, but the writers liked him in the character and so brought him back for the third season. Crawford said that Kebo has reservations about Ward as a boss, but \"some people like their bosses, some people don’t.\"\n\nRosalind Price (portrayed by Constance Zimmer) is the head of the ATCU as it crosses paths with S.H.I.E.L.D. in the hunt for Inhumans. After developing a romantic relationship with Coulson, Price is killed by Ward.\n\nIn July 2015, Zimmer was cast as Price, who Gregg described as \"a potent...I wouldn’t say doppelganger, but she’s definitely got a lot in common with Coulson. She represents a character who’s not someone he comes across every day, who has more in common with him than most other people do.\" That September, Bell elaborated, \"Where in the past, Coulson frequently plays sort of a paternal role on the show, because Daisy is kind of a surrogate daughter figure—suddenly there's another adult [in Price], who can banter, who can hold her own, and there's something nice about seeing him in that relationship.\"\n\nLuther Banks (portrayed by Andrew Howard) is an ATCU agent and former Marine loyal to Price. He is killed by Giyera.\n\nJoey Gutierrez (portrayed by Juan Pablo Raba) is an Inhuman and former construction worker with the ability to melt certain metals who is recruited by S.H.I.E.L.D. for Daisy Johnson's Secret Warriors team.\n\nRaba was announced as cast in August 2015. Scott Meslow of Vulture and Oliver Sava of \"The A.V. Club\", reviewing the season three episode \"Laws of Nature\", both indicated their pleasure in seeing Gutierrez, a gay character, appear on the series, which Meslow noted appeared to be the first openly gay character in the MCU.\n\nWerner von Strucker (portrayed by Spencer Treat Clark) is the son of Hydra leader Wolfgang von Strucker, who is recruited to Hydra by Ward after Wolfgang's death. After failing to follow Ward's orders to kill Garner, Werner is left in a vegetative state by Kebo, and is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody.\n\nR. Giyera (portrayed by Mark Dacascos) is a telekinetic Inhuman and head of security for the ATCU, secretly loyal to Malick. He is eventually swayed over to Hive's side, until he is killed by Fitz.\n\nJ.T. James (portrayed by Axle Whitehead) is an Inhuman who was refused the right of Terrigenesis by Jiaying and banished from Afterlife. Johnson subjects James to the transformation while under the influence of Hive, giving James the ability to imbue objects with fire. He is then taken under Hive's influence himself, and chooses the codename Hellfire. After Hive is destroyed, James suffers terrible withdrawal symptoms and comes to hate being an Inhuman as a result. He betrays his kind to the Watchdogs, helping them track and kill other Inhumans, with the promise that they would kill him when they are done.\n\nWhitehead first guest starred as James in \"Paradise Lost\", introduced as someone from Lincoln's past, with Whitehead and Mitchell having previously starred together on \"Home and Away\". With the character recurring through the rest of the third season, he was revealed to be an adaptation of the comic Secret Warrior character Hellfire. Executive producer Tancharoen felt it was \"a no-brainer\" to include Hellfire in the series, despite him not being Inhuman in the comics. Whedon expanded, saying, \"We liked his attitude. He’s a tell-it-like-it-is guy. He’s a little bit of a prick. He does not care if he’s liked, and that’s fun to write.\" The producers were also able to find a way to incorporate Hellfire's signature fire chain into the series. In the fourth season, it is revealed that his full name is J.T. James.\n\nAnderson (portrayed by Alexander Wraith) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and assistant to Coulson.\n\nPiper (portrayed by Briana Venskus) is a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and member of May's strike team.\n\nAida (portrayed by Mallory Jansen) is a Life Model Decoy, an android body based on Radcliffe's former lover and partner Agnes Kitsworth (also portrayed by Jansen) into which he transferred his artificial intelligence AIDA (voiced by Amanda Rea). After the \"Darkhold\" shows Radcliffe the secret to eternal life, Radcliffe programs Aida to go rogue in an attempt to steal the book from S.H.I.E.L.D. She is ultimately beheaded in battle against S.H.I.E.L.D., and Radcliffe builds a new model of the android. Aida later kills Kitsworth, so her consciousness can reside in the Framework reality. Aida enters the Framework where she takes up the name \"Ophelia\" and is also known as Madame Hydra, the leader of Hydra. She also has a relationship with Leo Fitz in his alias of The Doctor. Agnes also resides in the Framework, living with Radcliffe's consciousness on Ogygia before she is deleted by The Doctor. With the help of Project Looking Glass, Aida succeeds in making her organic body, and once again goes by Ophelia. Ophelia also gains the Inhuman abilities of teleportation, electric charge manipulation, and a healing factor. She is later killed by Phil Coulson possessed by Ghost Rider.\n\nThe artificial intelligence AIDA is briefly voiced by Amanda Rea in the third-season finale. By June 2016, casting was underway for a \"very attractive\" actress to portray the robot in a recurring role for the fourth season. The character was described as moving around \"quite naturally\", but speaking \"a bit formally\" like Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S. A.I. in the MCU films. In August, Jansen was cast in the role; she also portrays Agnes Kitsworth, for which she uses her native Australian accent. In April 2017, it was revealed that Aida would appear in the Framework reality as Madame Hydra, also portrayed by Jansen. On having Aida become Madame Hydra, Whedon noted, \"We had what is one of most formidable female villains we’ve ever had [in Aida], and we were bringing back Hydra, so it seemed like a natural pairing. She’s plugged herself into this world and clearly she’s trying to live some other new, unique life. We felt like if you grew up in a world and tried to be as powerful as you could be, and that world was Hydra-dominated, then it would be natural that she would become [Madame Hydra]. We thought it would be a fun way to introduce that character that’s so creepy, odd, weird, and fun.\"\n\nAida's costume was custom made, and inspired by the works of Alexander McQueen. Foley wanted it to be simple to \"not take away from the character at all\", but also \"sort of a 'Where did this outfit come from?' kind of a feeling so that it's specifically hers. It just adds to the mystery of who she is.\" Jansen described \"Aida 2.0\" as being programmed to be more ruthless, with the character's costume a darker shade of gray than that worn by the original Aida to reflect these changes. New costume designer Amanda Riley took Foley's costumes for Aida as the base shape of the Madame Hydra costume, but looked to make it feel \"stronger\" and more military-esque than those costumes by having the shoulders of the costume evoke epaulettes. The costume uses the color green, which is closely tied with the character in the comics.\n\nRoberto \"Robbie\" Reyes (portrayed by Gabriel Luna) is a mechanic who, alongside his brother Gabe, was attacked by gang members who were hired to kill their uncle Eli Morrow. Gabe was paralyzed and Robbie was killed, but his life was saved when a Ghost Rider riding a motorcycle gave Robbie his power, creating a new Ghost Rider. Robbie lives to protect his Gabe, and at night he seeks out \"vengeance\" by hunting the guilty and murdering them. His actions bring him into contact with the vigilante Quake and the agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., through whom he learns of his uncle's interests in the \"Darkhold\". This leads to Robbie taking Morrow through a portal to another dimension. After returning to Earth, Robbie Reyes helps to defeat Aida and uses his new portal-making abilities to take the Darkhold far away.\n\nAdvertisements for \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" ahead of the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con International featuring a flaming chain lead to speculation that the character of Ghost Rider would be joining the series during the season, though it was noted that the image could indicate an increased role for Hellfire after his introduction in the third season. When casting for a Latino character matching the description of Marvel Comics' Robbie Reyes, was revealed to be underway for the series, further speculation pointed to the inclusion of Ghost Rider, a mantle that Reyes took over in the comics. At the series' Comic-Con panel, this speculation was confirmed, and Luna was announced to be cast in the role. Luna had initially been hesitant to sign up for a recurring, rather than starring, role, but changed his mind once he was told that the character would be Ghost Rider, who he was a fan of growing up. He felt it was \"too good to be true\" that Reyes \"was a character who looked like me, acted like me, and had this amazing family dynamic with his brother\", with Luna relating to the latter since his father died before he was born leaving Luna the \"oldest male in [his] immediate family\".\n\nLuna described the Ghost Rider as a \"separate entity\" from Reyes, comparing the dynamic to the Hulk. Reyes was chosen as the Ghost Rider for the series, over other versions of the character, since his is the newest version from the comics, and the executive producers thought \"it would be interesting to bring in someone with [his] background into our dynamic\". Regarding if the character would be possessed by a Satanic serial killer, as in the comics, or by the more traditional Spirit of Vengeance, Tancharoen said, \"We’re staying true to his circumstance. But as always with any property that we use, we’re taking our liberties with it,\" with Whedon adding that they would be \"pulling a little bit from different versions of the Ghost Rider\" with \"a little mixing and matching\". Luna said that due to the character's recent introduction in the comics, \"a lot of the show is going to be expanding the Ghost Rider canon\"; however Luna read all 12 issues of the \"All-New Ghost Rider\" series that introduced Reyes for preparation. The character drives a 1969 Dodge Charger in the show, the \"Hellcharger\" of the comics which Luna nicknamed Lucy, for Lucifer. The production had a hero car and a double for stunts, while the visual effects team used a CG double when needed. Eric Norris serves as Luna's stunt driver, with Morgan Benoit, a frequent collaborator with Luna, as his stunt double.\n\nThe character's signature jacket and flaming head were designed by Marvel Television creative director Joshua Shaw, based on Felipe Smith's design from the comics. The skull design includes exhaust-type jets of flames coming from the temples to mimic the effects on his car. For the CG skull, Luna wore tracking markers on his face to provide performance-reference for these sequences, especially for the animation of Ghost Rider's coal-like eyes. Luna also wears a hood fitted with flickering lights, to create the effect of fire lighting up his costume and surfaces around him. The lights can be adjusted to match different temperature fire for different situations. Whedon noted that the series depicts Reyes' flaming head \"exactly as much as we can afford\", adding, \"We’re hoping that the character has not just a flaming skull but some real heart to him, and some depth.\" Foley paired the character's jacket with jeans and Vans to keep Reyes \"grounded in the reality of where he was brought up in Los Angeles\". Foley also worked with Kolpack to ensure that the costume would not interfere with the visual effects. Since a skeleton does not have a voice box, the Ghost Rider does not speak in the series.\n\nIn August 2016, Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the character \"could venture into other sections of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\", depending on the audience's response to their take on him, saying, \"if we can tell that story in a compelling way, then the thing to do is to then have people want more. And if they want more, the networks say, oh, we want more.\" On this, Luna noted that he \"signed on the line to do all the work necessary ... that's extremely exciting.\" That October, Luna said that there had been \"rumblings\" about a spin-off for the character, but reiterated that it would depend on audience response.\n\nGabriel \"Gabe\" Reyes (portrayed by Lorenzo James Henrie) is Robbie's younger brother, who was paralyzed in the accident that led to Robbie becoming the Ghost Rider.\n\nCasting for a Latino character matching the description of Gabe Reyes, was revealed to be underway for the series at the same time as it was for Robbie. Robbie Reyes was confirmed for the series in September 2016, and Henrie was revealed to be portraying Gabe later that month. The role was one of the first that Henrie auditioned for after he finished filming for \"Fear the Walking Dead\", in which his character is killed off. At his audition, Henrie confirmed that he would be able to dedicate his time to \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" without spoiling the events of \"Fear\" for the \"S.H.I.E.L.D.\" casting team, and was cast in the role the next day. His introduction as Gabe aired only weeks after his \"Fear the Walking Dead\" death aired.\n\nLucy Bauer (portrayed by Lilli Birdsell) was a scientist working at Momentum Labs in a group including her husband Joseph and engineer Eli Morrow. They were experimenting with the mysterious Darkhold until Morrow took steps to gain the book's power for himself by creating a machine that turned Lucy and her co-workers into ghost-like beings. Lucy later attempts to force Morrow to restore her body, but his nephew Robbie Reyes exorcised her first with the power of the Ghost Rider.\n\nJeffrey Mace (portrayed by Jason O'Mara) is the new Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., who was appointed to try and restore the trust of the public following the public outlawing of Steve Rogers and several of the Avengers due to the Sokovia Accords. Originally thought by the public and other members of S.H.I.E.L.D. to be an Inhuman with super-strength and invulnerability, Mace instead received his abilities from the U.S. government's Project Patriot, which used a super-serum derived from Calvin Johnson's formula. Mace received the serum after being heralded for a heroic moment at a ceremony in Vienna, Austria following the signing of the Sokovia Accords. With S.H.I.E.L.D. in need of a new, enhanced director on the recommendation of outgoing director Coulson, Talbot and the U.S. government gave the job to Mace, who they could trust. After it was revealed that Mace's powers were a lie, Coulson decided that Mace should stay on as \"the Patriot\" and the face and political leader of S.H.I.E.L.D., while Coulson takes back command of S.H.I.E.L.D. operations. In the Framework, Mace is the head of the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance. During the raid on the Hydra Cultivation Enlightenment Camp, Mace sacrifices himself to buy everyone time to get out of the collapsing quarantine building, resulting in his death in the real world as well.\n\nA flash-forward at the end of the third-season finale revealed that Coulson would no longer be the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. in the fourth season. The showrunners intentionally avoided giving hints as to who the new director would be in the sequence. After speculation in the media about which previously introduced character could be taking on the role, it was revealed that the new leader would actually be a new character to the series portrayed by O'Mara, described as a character \"whose Marvel roots go back to the 1940s\". The character was always going to be new to the series, as the executive producers felt that replacing Coulson with someone he knows \"wouldn’t [provide] as much tension to mine from\". The character was revealed to be Mace and an Inhuman with super strength with his introduction in \"Meet the New Boss\". O'Mara, a big Marvel fan as a child who has worked a lot with ABC, found out that Marvel was \"really seriously\" interested in him for the part in the same call that his agent told him that his A&E pilot \"The Infamous\" was not getting picked up to series. Within 24 hours, O'Mara had talked to Loeb, watched some of the third season of \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\", and accepted an offer to join the season without reading a script for it. He described the character as \"high status\", saying that \"he comes in and he's the boss, telling the other characters orders. Here I come in after [the other actors] been doing this for four years and I'm telling them what to do. It's a little awkward\".\n\nEllen Nadeer (portrayed by Parminder Nagra) is a senator and leader of the Humans First movement, who hates Inhumans after her mother's death during an alien invasion. Nadeer allies herself with the Watchdogs, but when high-ranking Watchdog Tucker Shockley tests Nadeer's humanity with a Terrigen crystal, it reveals his own explosive Inhuman abilities. Nadeer and those with her die in the ensuing explosion.\n\nBurrows (portrayed by Patrick Cavanaugh) is a member of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s PR division loyal to Mace. In the Framework, Burrows is part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. resistance.\n\nElias \"Eli\" Morrow (portrayed by José Zúñiga) is the uncle of Robbie and Gabe Reyes, and engineer who helped raise his nephews. After his coworkers at Momentum Energy labs began experimenting with the \"Darkhold\", Morrow came to crave its power for himself. He put Joseph Bauer into a coma trying to find the book, and ultimately turned the rest of his coworkers into ghost-like beings. S.H.I.E.L.D. breaks him out of prison believing him to be a victim, but he uses the \"Darkhold\" to create a machine that gives him the power to create matter.\n\nThe comics version of Eli Morrow is a Satanist who, after dying, possesses his nephew Robbie and turns him into the Ghost Rider. In August 2016, Whedon cautioned that the series would not necessarily be directly adapting the comics' storyline, saying, \"We can’t say much about what we’re going to do with [Robbie Reyes’] origin, but we are doing our own spin on it. We don’t want people who have read the comics to know exactly what’s coming.\" In October, Morrow was confirmed to be appearing in the series, with Zúñiga cast. He is changed for the series by introducing him as an apparently innocent man, and then revealing him to be as power hungry as his fellow scientists experimenting on the \"Darkhold\". The abilities he gains from his experiments have been compared to those of the comic character Molecule Man.\n\nAnton Ivanov (portrayed by Zach McGowan) is a reclusive Russian industrialist known as \"The Superior\", who champions traditional values and old-fashioned hardware over modern technology and extraterrestrial entities. He believes that Coulson is the cause of Earth's alien problems, and works with the Watchdogs, Senator Nadeer, and Holden Radcliffe to fight S.H.I.E.L.D. After being crippled by Daisy Johnson, Aida decapitates Ivanov and creates an android body for his mind to control. Ivanov then creates multiple additional bodies for his mind to control.\n\nHope MacKenzie (portrayed by Jordan Rivera) is Mack's daughter. While she has died sometime after birth in real life, she appears alive in the Framework. Hope's Framework counterpart is later deleted when the Framework collapses.\n\nEnoch (portrayed by Joel Stoffer) is a Chronicom anthropologist posing as a human. He abducts and sends Phil Coulson's group, except for Fitz ,through time to the Lighthouse in the year 2091 due to a prophecy uncovered by Robin Hinton. He later helps Fitz to get to the same time to save the rest of his team.\n\nDeke Shaw (portrayed by Jeff Ward) is \"the ultimate survivor\" and a \"roguish scavenger\" on the space station Lighthouse in the year 2091. With a sharp mind and quick wit, he has the ability to acquire items for a price.\n\nWard was cast in August 2017; his role was announced in November 2017.\n\nTess (portrayed by Eve Harlow) is a resourceful, self-sufficient inhabitant of the Lighthouse with a hope for a better future. She was later hanged by the Kree with a message pinned to her demanding that Flint be brought to the Kree. Kasius later had the Kree doctor perform the Kree procedure to revive Tess so that she can carry a message for Mack and Yo-Yo to surrender Flint.\n\nHarlow was announced in the role in November 2017.\n\nKasius (portrayed by Dominic Rains) is a Kree nobleman and perfectionist in the year 2091 who is the overseer of the Lighthouse. Kasius was sent to oversee the Lighthouse by his father after his failure in an earlier battle while his brother Faulnak oversaw the Kree Empire.\n\nRains' makeup takes 4 hours to apply.\n\nSinara (portrayed by Florence Faivre) is a female Kree in the year 2091 that serves as Kasius' second-in-command, enforcer, and head of the Kree Watch. She wields floating spheres which she uses to either attack her enemies or kill anyone that has offended Kasius. After most of Phil Coulson's group fled to the remains of Earth, Kasius sent Sinara to dispose of them. During the gravity storm fight with Daisy Johnson aboard the modified Zephyr-One, Sinara was killed when Daisy Johnson impaled her with a pipe.\n\nFaivre's makeup takes 3.5 hours to apply.\n\nGrill (portrayed by Pruitt Taylor Vince) is a \"gruff taskmaster\" of the Lighthouse's junkyard with an unforgiving temperament, who does not have illusions about the world he lives in. When Grill finds out about Yo-Yo, Flint's Inhuman ability manifests where he kills Grill with assembled rocks in self-defense.\n\nVince was announced in the role in November 2017.\n\nFlint (portrayed by Coy Stewart) is a young man and inhabitant of the Lighthouse looking to make something of himself, and to prove that he is capable of big things. He later underwent Terrigenesis where he developed geokinesis which he first used to kill Grill in self-defense. Flint later helps Mack and Yo-Yo into getting rid of the attacking Vrellnexians that were unleashed on Kasius' orders as part of his retribution on Phil Coulson's group. Before dying, an elderly Robin Hinton tells Melinda May about a vision that involves Flint which she had when she was still a child.\n\nStewart was announced in the role in November 2017. The role is based on a character of the same name from the \"Inhumans\" comics.\n\nThe following is a supplementary list of guest stars that appear in lesser roles, make significant cameo appearances or who receive co-starring credit over multiple appearances.

In Sri Lanka Monday to Friday at 10.00 pm on Shakthi TV. It is edited by National award winner Srikanth.N.B and his long time associate C. M. Selvakumar.\n\nGanga is a housemaid residing at a house outside a rich family palace by serving the family. Rajashekar, the owner of the palace, an esteemed man in his early sixties, who lives in a small town with his sister and only son. His family is highly respected among the residents of the town. Despite having many relatives, they like serenity and lead a secluded life in the palatial home.\n\nGanga is very passionate about the snake mound outside the palace. She worships the snake residing in it as ‘Nagamma’; unaware of the fact that the snake is actually an \"Ichchadhaari Nagam\", (Avenging Shapeshifting snake) which has been waiting since many years to avenge the elder’s family and is under the control of a magical bond of a Malayali Nambhoodhiri.\n\nIn case, a drop of blood from a virgin girl’s body, who is the worshiper of the snake, is secreted on the snake’s body, it would regain all its powers. Thereafter, no one could save Rajashekar’s family from the vengeance of the snake.\n\nRajashekar’s health suddenly deteriorates. So he decides to get his son Arun, who is a widower, remarried. His relatives are summoned, who, on arrival don’t care about the family’s welfare but eye the wealth of the family. However, mysterious events take place after the relatives arrive. The Namboodhiri is summoned, and it is revealed that Arun’s first wife Janaki’s spirit causes all the confusion.\n\nIt is also revealed that Janaki’s spirit plays all the tricks to stop the asset-hungry relatives who were trying to cheat her husband Arun. The Nambhoodhiri understands from the spirit of Janaki,that her romantic life with Arun which was like all roses was ended by her death due to childbirth complications was actually killed by Arun’s uncle Dharmaraj, his son Moorthy & Arun's friend Balaji. Meanwhile, Arun learns that Devasena, his child through Janaki, is alive and brings her to the Palace. Janaki kills Arun's friend Balaji as a vengeance of her death.\n\nThe relatives who are already panicked by Janaki’s spirit are further discouraged by Devasena’s arrival, and get away from the marriage arrangements. The Nambhoodhiri advises the family to marry Ganga, who has the divine blessings, to Arun.One day, Ganga's blood accidentally falls onto the snake’s body in the snake mound breaking the supernatural curse which kept the \"Icchaadhaari Nagam\" sealed in the snake mound.\n\nAfter this incident, the snake is now free from its curse and is getting ready to avenge Rajasekar’s family. The Ichchadhari snake mentions to Ganga that it requires a human body to exact its revenge without any suspicions from anyone in the family and while revealing her identity as an individual in the name of Nandini, even though Ganga refuses to accept and allow Nandini (Icchaadhaari Nagam) to continue her vengeance and kill the whole family, Nandini vehemently continues its sole purpose by transmigrating herself into Ganga's body, therefore successfully possessing Ganga.\n\nThe next day was Ganga's and Arun's marriage, which happened while Nandini was in Ganga's body. Therefore, Arun married both Nandini (who became Arun's unsuspecting official third wife) and Ganga (who became Arun's official second wife but she wasn't aware of the marriage until Nandini told her).\n\nNandini learns that her snake form could be attained only for 5 minutes on New Moon night (Amavasya). She has to wait until Chitra Pournami day that comes after 10 months to get her own powers (Shiva Shakti Naga Yogam) that'll let her transform into a human. Janaki enters Devasena's body to save her family and finish the evil Nandini's tricks. After many incidents, Nandini fails to kill Arun and Devasena because of Janaki. Rajashekar and his family try many ways to find out the evil spirit in their house but which were failed by Nandini. \nLater, it is revealed that Rajasekhar and two of his friends (business partners) had stolen three Kalachakram (A powerful yantra that is said to grant unparalleled wealth and powers if an individual comes in control of it) each for themselves which was originally under the idol of snake -goddess by killing Sivanagam/Parvathi & Munisamy's wife. Namboothiri trapped the little snake, Nandini in a snake mound.\n\nMuniappa's biological daughter Gayathri somehow survived this incident and was brought to an orphanage whereby she was later on adopted by her adopted parents and is currently residing in a foreign country. Now, Janaki vows to save her family from Nandini and Bhairavi.\nRemembering her vow that Nandini had given to her mother which is to get back the 3 Kalachakram safely, Nandhini executed her plan by disguising herself as Rajashekar and calling his friend to come to Rajasekhar's home with the Kalachakram.\n\nDuring the journey of Rajashekar's friend she tried to kill him to get one of the Kalachakram, but due to the fear of getting caught by the police officers she couldn't kill him at that moment but managed to injure him. The Police officers took him to the hospital. However she kills Rajasekhar's friend at the hospital and threw the whole blame on innocent Ganga by getting out of her body.\n\nGanga made Nandhini to promise her that the latter would not hurt her husband, child and family to exact her revenge by possessing any other woman's body other than Ganga's own body to which Nandini agrees knowingly that this restriction given by Ganga to her is temporary and after Chitra Pournami, Nandini will acquire her own powers (Shiva Shakti Naga Yogam) that'll transform her into a human.\n\nAfter this the police arrested Ganga who then goes to the jail for the crime that Nandini committed. Arun and Devasena told Ganga to say the truth but she was not ready. Later,Janaki came in front of Ganga while she was inside Devasena's body to convince her about the evil works and plans of Nandini but Ganga still refused to admit the truth and decides to go to jail for the good future of the palace and the residential members of the palace.\n\nAn evil dwarf woman whose name is Chamundi comes as a maid to work in the palace but her ulterior motives was to obtain the Kalachakram but the evil was unable to continue her plans because of Janaki's spirit that is currently protecting the palace and its members. So Chamundi acted out her plan by becoming friends with Devasena and cheated Janaki by capturing and restricting Janaki with her power into Janaki's own photo. Thus Janaki can't come out from it.\n\nAfter this, Maya, Dharmaraj's daughter got discharged from the hospital after recovering from her (amnesia and mental disorder), she come to know that Arun and Ganga got married and currently Ganga is in jail serving the punishment that she never did.\n\nUsing this ill-fated incident as a chance, therefore, she tries to convince the whole family into letting her marry Arun when they went to Nagadevi temple for prayers only after she, Arun and Devasena are the ones chosen by Nagadevi Amman to uplift the ill fate that has fallen on the family. Arun agrees to her condition. When Devasena inquires her father with the decision he has taken, he tells her that it's the only way that he could do to make sure Ganga agrees to speaks the truth and bails her out of the jail.\n\nAt this time Devi decides to kill Ganga in the jail but she fails to do so. During her time in jail Ganga comes to know about Bhairavi (whose intentions is to kill Arun). During this period of time a Thirunangai in the name of Sena Nayagi (Riyaz Khan) comes to the palace to warn the family about something important but the family members that is Dharmaraja, Leela and Manju disregards her as a beggar and insults her which makes the Thirunangai to leave the family without informing the important information that she was about to say.\n\nChamundi was also successful in capturing Nandhini whom she traps her into a giant chameleon's body before the former (Nandini) was captured by the Namboothiri (who already knew about Nandhini's escape from the snake mound) and was currently enacting a poojai to capture Nandhini. Since Chamundi emerged successful in capturing Nandhini, The Namboothiri added some strength to Chamundi's power.\n\nLater on it is revealed that he has some ulterior motive that is to discover the main culprit (Chamundi) whom captured Nandini and make sure he will get his hand and control over Nandhini overtime. The Namboothiri told Rajashekar that he would be continuing the Amavasya Poojai and warned Ganga to refrain herself from having any kind of relationship (sexually) with Arun to prevent Nandhini from escaping once again.\n\nChamundi exacted her plan the following night to acquire the Kalachakram but fails to it in the palace even though she was successful in discovering the exact place where the Kalachakram was hidden. After some severe penance she did she discovered the exact reason why she couldn't get the Kalachakram was because of the curse she obtained after killing her master known as (Guru Dosham). To get rid of this curse Chamundi ask her Goddess known as Kugai Natchiyar for vimorchanam (a solution to get rid of the curse) by which Chamundi has to offer Devasena as a sacrifice before her holy goddess.\n\nAt this tremendous situation, here a new twist arises in the form of Seeta (a woman with the exact facial features of Janaki) who will be making an intro again in Arun's, Ganga and Devasena's life. Sena Nayagi gets a clairvoyance of something very bad that is going to happen to Ganga that will cost her life and Sena Nayagi predicts that the bad is not coming from Ganga's common enemy (Nandini) but from the people who cares about her wellbeing (Namboothiri) and her relatives (Devi and Dharmaraj) which will make it difficult for Karuppanasamy to protect Ganga and after that Seeta will be a challenge for Ganga who will take over Ganga's place as Arun's wife.\n\nAfter this Arun and Ganga leaves to Kerala to celebrate their Honeymoon and they stayed in a Hotel arranged by Unnikrishnan. Unnikrishnan also arranged the same Hotel for Dharmaraj and his son to stay. He also arranged Devi and Bhairavi to stay in the same hotel with the former (Dharmaraj and his son) knowing the presence of the later (Devi and Bhairavi).\n\nDharmaraj and his son pre-planned without the knowledge of Arun and Ganga to stay in the same Hotel was to make sure that they both get to keep their eyes on Ganga so they can kill her. Their first plan was to drown Ganga while she and Arun was on their trip on a boat house but their plans failed as Ganga was rescued by her husband. On that same day Arun discovers someone who looks like his first wife Janaki but before he can confront her she disappears. Dharmaraj son executes his plan which was to film Arun and Ganga's nuptial night but fails. Both of them are not ready to give up as they're finding for the slightest chance to execute their plan which is to murder Ganga.\n\nWhereas Devi is completely relying on Bhairavi to kill Ganga, but Bhairavi has her own ulterior motive that is to kill Arun. During Bhairavi's first try she fails to kill Arun because her powers was prevented by the Kalachakram that is currently with Venu who came to visit Bhairavi. Later on Bhairavi discovers from her assistant Neelakanthan that Venu is having the Kalachakram which prevented her powers and so she's vying to get her hands on the Kalachakram.\n\nBack at the palace in Chennai, Sena Nayagi have come to the house to eat and stay as ordered by Karuppanasamy so that Karuppanasamy can protect the family from any evil powers. Rajashekar has already enrolled Devasena to school. On a weekend, Sena Nayagi came to know about Chamundi's evil intentions and she successfully prevented her evil powers of transforming Devasena into a rose flower and offering her as a sacrifice to Kugai Natchi Amman by reflecting Chamundi's powers back to herself and transformed Chamundi into a rose flower. Devasena then placed the rose flower given to her by Sena Nayagi in front of her mother's portrait. On seeing what happened to Chamundi, Janaki laughed and mocked Chamundi for having a similar fate as her.\n\nArun comes across four men's who was finding for the girl name Seeta and when they inquire him about that girl, Arun tells them that he will inform them about her whereabouts when he sees her once again (without knowing anything about the girls background and the four men's ulterior motive that is to catch and murder her).\n\nThe following day Bhairavi's second attempt to murder Arun by hypnotising a Hotel worker into killing him also fails as Arun was lucky enough (sheer luck) to prevent that from happening. On that same night, Amavasya and Ganga insisted Arun who also agreed to follow her to the Bhagavathy Amman Temple in Kerala to perform prayers.\n\nGanga never tells Arun the main purpose on why she insisted Arun to go to the temple, but it was revealed later on that Rajashekar have told Ganga to perform a Pariharam Poojai as ordered by the Namboothiri in that temple by immersing some flowers and a statue of a snake goddess made of soil in the temple's pond to get rid of Nandini and her curse. By successfully doing so Nandini will be powerless permanently.\n\nEven though the Namboothiri is successful in doing the Amavasyai Poojai to prevent Nandini from escaping her trap, Ganga somehow subsequently fails to perform the Pariharam Poojai for the Amman in the Bhagavathy Amman Temple due to a heavy thunderstorm. This was observed by Viswanathan aka Vichu (Rajashekar's friend) who then informs this incident to the Namboothiri.\n\nAt that moment Rajashekar calls the Namboothiri and asks him if there is any other way to permanently stop Nandini from seeking her vengeance, to which the Namboothiri says that they need to wait for the next Amavasyai to repeat what they failed to do.\n\nAfter the Namboothiri informs Rajashekar about that, Vichu asks the Namboothiri whether is it possible for them to prevent Nandini from exacting her revenge by doing anything before the next Amavasyai and the Namboothiri says that it is possible and the only way is to murder Ganga.\n\nThis fact shocks Vichu but he agrees to help the Namboothiri without the knowledge of Rajashekar because they know that Rajashekar will not agree with this as he cares for the life of his son Arun who in turn loves his second wife Ganga.\n\nOn that night Arun discovers the presence of Seeta in the Bhagavathy Amman Temple, and he informs the four men's about her whereabouts. Arun confronts Seeta and he comes to know about her exact life flashback and decides to help her out from the four bad guys by running away from them.\n\nLater Arun, Seeta and the four henchmen are confronted by Kerala Police whereby the policewoman questions the four henchmens about why they were chasing both Arun and Seeta, the four henchman confuses the policewoman who then questions Seeta and she says that the four guys were chasing her and her husband Arun came to her rescue (a likeable story Seeta adds to save herself).\n\nThe policewoman then asks for the prove to a confused Arun, who shows Janaki's photo and says that she (Seeta) is his wife. The Kerala policewoman was not convinced because she saw that there wasn't a thali on Seeta's neck which Arun later said that he has it with him and because of a misunderstanding she removed the thali from her neck (a likable story Arun creates to save Seeta from the four goons).\n\nAt this juncture, one of the goons challenges Arun by saying that he (Arun) might be lying, and so the policewoman decides that Arun ties the thali on Seeta's neck which Arun (reluctantly) does it. This shocks the goons and they leave the place once and for all. Before Arun can ask back for his first wife thali from Seeta, he comes to know that Seeta has also left the place and he decided to return to the hotel he currently is residing in.\n\nThe next day Ganga decided to go for shopping to get clothes and souvenirs for Devasena on the way she was confronted by the goons set up to murder her by Vichu. She tells Arun about what is happening to her and also manages to escape from the goons who in return failed to kill her. Vichu comes to know about this and he informs the Namboothiri who tells him to return to Chennai as fast as possible, so that he doesn't get caught by the police officers in Kerala.\n\nOn that day, Arun receives a call while he was in the hotel with his wife that a policewoman wanted to meet him and on seeing the policewoman, she returned Seeta back to him who was in her custody of protection. Arun then brings Seeta back to his room and surprises Ganga who was astonished to see someone who looks exactly like Janaki and also she comes to know about her background and decided to help her out.\n\nBack at the palace Sena Nayagi manages to heal Rajashekar's sister and assures him that his sister will recover back to normal in a few days time. On that night, Chamundi jinxes Devasena's slippers that almost brought Devasena to Chamundi's location but was prevented by the timely intervention of Sena Nayagi with the help of Karuppanasamy.\n\nAn enraged Chamundi summons her chameleon which takes a giant form to attack Sena Nayagi but Sena Nayagi crushed the chameleon to death with her feet. When Sena Nayagi was about to finish off Chamundi, Janaki manages to breakout of her photo (which she was tied into by Chamundi) and captures Chamundi. This shocks Sena Nayagi, who then warns Janaki of her gravely mistake and tells her to hold Chamundi for 1 mandalam (48 days) without letting her go to totally destroy Chamundi or if she fails to do so then Chamundi will seek her revenge on the whole family. After saying that Sena Nayagi captures both of them in a container and save guards it.\n\nOn the next day they (Arun, Ganga and Seeta) vacated their room and they lodge a police report in Coimbatore to arrest Thuraipaandi for ill treating the orphan girls who was staying in the orphanage. The police arrest Thuraipaandi who warned Arun that he would definitely have his revenge on him. After this Arun, transfers all the orphans to Janaki's Orphanage Home, whereby Ganga expresses her interest in having Seeta brought back to the palace which at first Seeta refuses but later on agrees to accompany.\n\nBefore Arun, Ganga and Seeta arrived at the palace Sena Nayagi predicted the arrival of the third person (Seeta) along with Arun and Ganga and told Rajashekar, Manju and Ganga's father about her prediction before she left the palace. \n\nAfter Arun and Ganga arrived, Rajashekar, Manju and Ganga's father were astonished by the arrival of Seeta who is an exact doppelgänger of Janaki. While Rajashekar and Manju was happy with her arrival, Ganga's father wasn't very happy because he feared that she might be a threat to his daughter's place as the wife of Arun.\n\nThe family decided to give Seeta a place to stay in the palace but Arun decided that she stays in the house near the palace which Seeta openly agrees to. Later in the afternoon, Devasena arrived from school and was very pleased and excited to see Seeta (thinking that she is her mother, Janaki) was back home. \n\nEventually, Ganga clears Devasena's doubts by explaining to her about Seeta's background story. Nevertheless, Devasena asked Seeta's permission if she can call her \"Amma\" (mother) as (Seeta resembles exactly like Janaki), to which Seeta and the whole family agrees.\n\nOn the next day, Devi and Neelakanthan (both who have stolen the Kalachakram from Bhairavi) arrived at the palace. Devi introduces Neelakanthan to the family as Kasi Swamiyar a powerful Maharishi from Kasi. Most of the family members cannot remember Neelakanthan who was in his new disguise except for Arun who suspected him but decided to remain quiet and catch him at the right moment. \n\nThe family brought Neelakanthan aka Kasi Swamiyar to Rajashekar's sister's room to cure her whereby Neelakanthan puts the Kalachakram powers into a test and decides that it will take time and money for him to cure Rajashekar's sister \nand Rajashekar agrees to pay a huge some of money to Neelakanthan aka Kasi Swamiyar. \n\nDevi and Neelakanthan received a threatening call from Bhairavi that she will have her revenge on them which both of them scoffed at sighting that they have the Kalachakram which is powerful enough to protect them both.\n\nThe following day, while Seeta was mopping the house Arun discovered that she is still wearing his first wife Janaki's Thali. Before he can confront Seeta, his father Rajashekar, both his aunt Manju and Devi and also his wife Ganga was walking into the hall at different timing. \n\nArun somehow manages to divert them one by one from Seeta before they notice the Thali on her neck by telling them that he has something important to inform them while buying time for Seeta to hide the Thali. He tells them that they should be doing the Sumangali Poojai on the next day for Ganga which everyone agreed to carry out.\n\nAt Arun's bedroom, Ganga asks Arun for Janaki's Thali for the Sumangali Poojai, whereby Arun lies to Ganga by telling her that he might have lost it in Kerala during the boathouse incident. Ganga decided to find the Thali in the room while Arun goes into the house near the palace where Seeta is currently living in to ask her back for the Thali. Seeta gives an appropriate reason to Arun. Later, Arun said to Seeta that if his respect for Janaki is higher than her's he should get back Janaki's Thali. \n\nThe next day, the whole family commenced the Sumangali Poojai for Ganga. Before they could begin, Ganga trips and fall while injuring her hand. Somehow she manages to complete the Sumangali Poojai with the help of Seeta. At the final stage of the poojai when they were getting the blessings of the goddess the \"Aarthi\" suddenly extinguishes by itself. \n\nOn seeing this the woman who was conducting the poojai asked for the Amman if she was missing to provide the respective procedure for any \"Sumangali\" (married woman) to which the Amman signaled as a \"Yes\" by dropping a flower. After this the poosari woman told Ganga and Arun to provide the new saree and thali to Seeta which both of them gave happily unsuspectingly.\n\nThe following day Dharmaraj, Moorthy and his daughter Maya arrived to the palace with their own plans and ulterior motives. They apologies to Rajashekar for misbehaving with him on their last argument which Rajashekar forgived after much pesters from the three of them.\n\nWhen Dharmaraj, Moorthy and Maya was about to enter their own room they was really shocked to see Seeta as she's Janaki's doppelgänger. They was frightened by the very sight of her thinking that she was Janaki to which Arun came and cleared their doubts by introducing herself to them. After introducing herself, Moorthy initially took a great liking for her (which is confirmed that he is in love with Seeta) whereby he is unaware that she's already secretly married to Arun.\n\nAfter this, Devi received a archanai from a poosari from a temple telling that this belongs to Arun. She came and hands over the archanai to Arun and tells him the truth. When Arun was puzzled about knowing who had did an \"Archanai\" in his name, he was even surprised that this mysterious someone had did it in a few temples and is currently in a temple near his place. The curious Arun decided to uncover who is this person by going to the temple with Ganga accompanying him.\n\nTo his surprise he discovered that this person was none other than Bhairavi and so he confronted her and she said that she had recovered and have no longer the intentions to kill him after which he said that he was not the cause of her sister's death. Since she was from Janaki's village, he decided to give her a place to stay in his palace.\n\nIt is then revealed that Bhairavi's main plan is to arrive at the palace to regain the \"Kalachakram\" that was stolen by the duo Devi and Neelakanthan. Arun and Ganga arranged Bhairavi to stay in the next room of Devi. Bhairavi's arrival shocks Devi and also Neelakanthan. \n\nWhile Bhairavi was being brought to her room by Ganga she comes across Seeta and is really shocked to see her appearance which is akin to Janaki she was introduced to Seeta by Ganga after which she arrived at her room where Seeta helps Bhairavi by putting some medication ointment on the soles of Bhairavi's feet. \n\nSeeta brings Bhairavi to Devi's room where Neelakanthan aka Kasi Swamiyar is also residing to provide Bhairavi with some medications which he agrees to give and after that she leaves the three of them in Devi's room. After Seeta left the room Bhairavi demands Devi and Neelakanthan to return the Kalachakram back to her but they arrogantly refused. \n\nThis act enrages Bhairavi and she uses her siddhis (supernatural powers) on Neelakanthan but it backfires to Bhairavi. Devi and Bhairavi both of them challenges one another that they will succeed their own self purpose motives without the help of one another.\n\nBoth Arun and Ganga are now at peace seeing that Bhairavi has no more intentions to kill Arun. At this moment, when Arun was about to make his move with Ganga, Ganga tells Arun that she has to go and collect the clothes outside as it was raining heavily. \n\nWhen she was collecting the clothes she discovers Nandini's adopted father calling out to her thinking that Nandini is still residing in her body. Ganga screams and runs into the palace while informing Arun about Muniswamy's appearance. \n\nArun decided to catch the old man but misses to catch him this time also. After this incident, Muniswamy correctly deduces the fact that Nandini is not in Ganga's body but she is trapped somewhere else without knowing the true original place that is in (Chamundi's chameleons body in Kugai Natchiyar cave).\n\nIn the latest episodes, it's revealed that Bhairavi has managed to get her hands on one of the Kalachakram (which was in the possession of Devi and Neelakanthan) and also she have come to know more information of the Kalachakram from Muniappa and now currently is seeking for the other two Kalachakram: one is with Rajashekar and the other one is with Vichu. \n\nIn addition, there's another new person in the name of Bala who is threatening Arun to give him money so that he would not reveal the photos he had taken during Arun's secret marriage with Seeta in Kerala to his family members whereby Arun decided to give Bala the amount of money he is asking for.\n\nThe next day Rajashekar and everyone in the family has decided to arrange a marriage for Seeta and also Rajashekar personally has decided to give half of his property for Seeta which made Devi and Dharmaraj to plot and enact a plan in order to obtain that property. \n\nOn the same day, Chamundi's disciples tried to contact Chamundi with their Kagapujandar Guru Mantra but they discovered that she's in a danger and that they can only bring her out on an Amavasya day (New moon day) which also indicates the same day as to when Nandini will gain her full power to escape her trap. \n\nIn the recent episodes, it has been revealed that Siva Nagam/Parvati has survived her death by entering the samadhi state and she is back to have her revenge on Rajashekar, his friends and his family. She secretly meets Ganga and mentions to Ganga about all the injustices committed by Rajashekar and his friends to herself and the Kattu Amman which is why Nandini possesses a vengeful character in person. She also mentions that in two days time when the new moon and solar eclipse is bound to happen naturally, Nandini will be successful in breaking the trap and will come to seek revenge. \n\nAfter mentioning this, she disappears. Ganga became very worried about her family's safety and decided to tell what had happened to Rajashekar who became very shocked but obediently listens and agrees to Ganga to return the Kalachakram to the Kattu Amman not before telling her that he will inform his friends and decide the proper circumstances and time to return it. \n\nOn the next day Devasena invited her teacher Parameshwari to her house and once she arrived Ganga was literally shocked to notice that Parvati and Parameshwari look identical (which is confirmed later that both are the same person). Before Parvati aka Parameshwari leaves the house she already knows what happened to Nandini and also she promises Rajashekar that she will return to seek her vengeance.\n\nOn the following day, early in the morning hours before the Surya Graghanam and Amavasai begin Parvati visits Seiyanayagi and gifts Karuppan her Nagamani/Nagarathinam (King Cobra Pearl) which Karuppan accepts for keeping Chamundi in her control. But later on, Seiyanayagi says that Chamundi is no longer in her control after Janaki was forced to leave her and rescue her daughter by bringing back Seeta who is been kidnapped but Thuraipaandi and his goons. This fact surprises Parvati and she begins to tell her flashback about how she came to know Chamundi/Selvi who wanted to take the Kalachakram for herself but failed to take and was instead diminished in size by the wrath and powers of Parvati.\n\nSeiyanayagi uses her powers and Karuppan's blessings to inform her about Nandini's exact place where she's trap. After revealing to Parvati about the place Seiyanayagi comes to know the exact reason why Parvati is seeking to release Nandini (that's to exact her revenge for what had happened). Even-though Seiyanayagi tried to reason out with Parvati not to harm Ganga and her life (family) but Parvati was really headstrong in her decision which makes Seiyanayagi to challenge Parvati that she will protect Ganga and her family from Parvati, after which Parvati disappears. \n\nAfter that Seiyanayagi comes to know through a premonition that something very bad is going to happen to Ganga and her family. At the same time, Devasena succeeds in getting her fathers permission to go to school so that she and her friends can witness the solar eclipse. While on her journey to school, Chamundi sabotages and kidnaps Devasena to her place. Janaki somehow comes to know about this and tries to save her daughter but alas she again gets herself trapped by Chamundi at Kugai Natchiyar cave. \n\nThrough a phone call Arun comes to know about what had happened to Devasena and he arrived at the place but is shocked to discover that Devasena is no where to be found. Suspecting that this has got to do something with her school teacher Parameshwari (yes, Arun suspects accurately that Parvati and Parameshwari is the same person after he inquired about her in school whereby he comes to know that the Parvati is using the identity of Parameshwari teacher from Devasena school), he rushes to meet his father and informs him that he will soon find out the real problem in between Parvati and Rajashekar even if Rajashekar refuses to tell him the truth. \n\nNow the story focuses onto the poojai conducted by Chamundi, just before she is about to sacrifice Devasena for Kugai Natchiyar Amman, Parvati comes and stops Chamundi from committing such a heinous crime act. This incident shocks Chamundi aka Selvi who challenges Parvati into a duel (a fight involving supernatural magic powers). After both of them displaying their supernatural powers Parvati was able to defeat Chamundi and with the help of Janaki, Chamundi was temporarily tied to the banyan tree (Aalamaram).\n\nAfter this intense battle between good and bad, Parvati tried to bring Nandini out of her trap but then only she comes to know that Namboothiri has also set Nandini in his fire curse trap (Sarpa Agni Sabham). With the blessings of Kattu Amman, Parvati summoned a thirusoola and chops off the chameleon's head thereafter releasing Nandini from her trap. Parvati then instructs Nandini to destroy Chamundi which results in the death of Chamundi aka Selvi. \n\nLater on Janaki thanked Parvati for saving her daughter whereby Parvati says that she came mainly to save her own daughter but also in return saved Devasena. She instructed Janaki to return to her palace because she knows that everyone are anxiously waiting for Devasena's arrival. Janaki arrived home with Devasena and told her to tell the family that she was walking back to home after the accident which Devasena does ending the worries of the family.\n\nSince after this Surya Grahanam Amavasai had happened and Nandini was successful in coming out of the trap with Parvati's help, Namboothiri came to know what had happened (when he noticed that his yagna was a failure), he immediately informs Vichu and Rajashekar about this, which worries the two of them. Namboothiri pacifies them to not worry because Nandini had not yet succeeded in her mission. When Rajashekar and Vichu inquires further about this, Namboothiri informs both of them that Nandini can only fulfill her revenge if she completely takes the form of a human on the next pournami and it's their mission to stop and trap her back before the next pournami. If they are successful in catching her off guard then Nandini will lose all her powers and she will be put to sleep forever. Rajashekar then informs Namboothiri about how Ganga discovered about the Kalachakram from Parvati and asks Namboothiri's help to which the Namboothiri tells him that he will ready three fake Kalachakram to be given to Ganga.\n\nAt the same time, Parvati who successfully managed to save Nandini mentions to Muniappa that Nandini must be safeguarded for the next 10 days until the arrival of Margazhi Pournami whereby according to the prophecy involved, if Nandini is successfully safeguarded until this day (Margazhi Pournami) she would gain her full powers, and then only can she fulfill the stated prophecy or not she will fail forever. After saying this, she passes the duty of safeguarding Nandini to Muniappa and tells him to contact her through prayers if there is any serious problems.\n\nThe next day, Muniappa discovers a reckless Nandini leaving the house to seek revenge whereby he made sure that she promises to him not to leave again until she gains her full powers and potential on the Margazhi Pournami. At first she was hesitant but later she obliged to his orders and promises to wait for the right time and right moment. On the same night Rajashekar invited Namboothiri and Vichu to his house and after entering his room, Namboothiri passes him the fake Kalachakram that looks and warns him to not allow Ganga to enter the Kattu Amman temple as that will reveal the Kalachakram is fake. After this, both of them leaves the house, and Rajashekar passes the Kalachakram to Ganga. Ganga asked about the place but Rajashekar lied to her that he can't really remember but assumes that it is somewhere\nnear Nagore. Ganga then takes the Kalachakram and secretly hides it in her cupboard.\n\nThe next following day, Ganga asks her father about Parvatipuram but her father says that he has heard about it but doesn't know the exact place. After this, Ganga brings Serra to the temple for prayers, during which a new conflict arises for Seeta whereby a woman and her husband claims that Seeta is their sister in law married to the woman's brother. No matter how much Seeta tells them that they have been mistaken her for the wrong person they still refuse to back down on their decision. That's when Ganga comes to her rescue defending Seeta and bringing her back to the palace. \n\nAfter arriving at the palace, Ganga meets Arun and asks him about Parvatipuram and he tells her that it's 20km to 40km away from Chengalpattu and advises her not to go to any temples at that area because earlier when Arun sets a detective to investigate the mystery case about his father's past life, the detective ended up dead. After coming to know about this Ganga decided to execute her plan in a safe by discovering more of the mysterious secrets before taking actions (going to Parvatipuram Kattu Amman temple). \n\nThe unnamed woman, her husband, and her brother came to the palace to bring back Seeta but with the combined efforts of Ganga, Arun and Manju they managed to send the group of family back to where they came from while deciding to investigate even deeper about Seeta's secret husband. On the same night, Arun secretly visits Seeta and tells her that he will investigate about who have sent them here (his prime suspect is No.1. Devi and No.2. Dharmaraj) and while he is investigating he tells her not to take any abrupt decision that will end up with her being in danger. She agrees to that condition but she says some of her suggestions like Bala and Thuraipaandi to which Arun says that both of them will not be the ones as he has given them a strict warning. Seeta then tells her decision to Arun after which he agrees and leaves (we will know in the next few episodes what are her decisions that she have taken). Don't forget to take a note that the possible suspect that is currently trying to discover Seeta's husband, might be Ganga as she has told Seeta that she will find out who her husband is even if she doesn't want to say it in the previous episodes.\n\nThe next day, Ganga wakes up Devasena and tells her to take a bath and get ready to go to school. Devasena pretends to take a bath because she is allergic to cold water but her plans failed when her mother Janaki splashes the water from the shower on Devasena. \n\nAfter sending Devasena to school, Ganga visited the family that confronted Seeta earlier in the temple (the woman and her family are Ganga's friends) and it's revealed that Ganga had planned all this along as a way to find out who is Seeta's husband. \n\nJust as she was about to leave the house she was surprised to see her husband Arun and Seeta entering the house. Before they find out about her presence at the house she decided to hide and also find the purpose why both of them are here. \n\nArun then reveals himself as the legitimate husband of Seeta and shows the photo taken in Kerala as a prove. Alas Ganga was surprised by the shocking revelation told by her husband. She didn't confront them at her friends house because she was in a great dilemma and depression.\n\nAfter Arun has left the house, he arrived at the palace and warned all of his family members (Manju, Dharmaraj, Moorthy and Devi) not to interfere in Seeta's life anymore. After this Seeta returned to the outhouse just to discover Ganga waiting for her arrival. Seeta then confronted a tearful Ganga and asked her why is she tearing to which Ganga said it was nothing important. Seeta then decided to tell the truth about who is her real husband to Ganga. At first, Ganga refused to listen telling to Seeta that some truths are better not to be known.\n\nThe next day, Seeta persuades Ganga to know who her husband is, but indirectly lies to Ganga by telling her that she is going to go to London not only for her further studies but mainly because her husband Annamalai is working there. Ganga who really knows who is Seeta's husband (that's Arun) quietly listens to Seeta's lies and made sure that Seeta doesn't suspect that she (Ganga) already learned the truth about Seeta's secret marriage and her husband.\n\nOn the same day, Ganga decided to go to Parvatipuram to return the Kalachakram to the Kattu Amman but before she can leave the palace, Devasena was about to enter the room to spend some time with Ganga. On discovering Devasena's presence, Ganga quickly hides the bag containing the 3 Kalachakram before Devasena enters the room. Devasena then meets Ganga and tells her about her wishes. \n\nAt the same time, Seeta enters the room and when Ganga sees her she told Seeta to dress up Devasena in a wedding saree while she waits outside of the room. The whole family who discovered Ganga waiting outside asked her what's the reason but Ganga remains tight-lipped and tells them all to wait for the surprise. After Seeta has completed the makeup for Devasena the whole family was astonished to discover Devasena in her saree. \n\nWhen everyone asks Arun how did Devasena looked, he describes her as similar to Seeta (which he corrected it by mentioning the similarity between Seeta and Janaki appearance wise) much to Ganga's disappointment. When the family was busy in taking photos with Devasena, Ganga made her move by taking the bag containing 3 Kalachakram and leaving the house. Just as she was about to go her father asked her to where she is going and she said that she is going to a temple and she gets her fathers blessings. \n\nJust before she leaves the house front gate she was confronted by Janaki who told her that she (Ganga) is not the one who should leave the palace but Seeta. Ganga still refused to listen to Janaki but before she left Janaki told her that she might return to the palace because of her love for Devasena. \n\nAfter completing his business meetings, Rajashekar returned home and was at his room reading a newspaper. Just about time, Ganga's father entered the room and gives him the cup of coffee. When he inquired about Ganga, Ganga's father told him that she had when to do her prayers at a temple while taking along a bag with her but he doesn't know the name of the temple. \n\nGanga then pays Seiyanayagi a visit to inform her that she is going to Parvatipuram but is warned by Seiyanayagi not to go. In front of Seiyanayagi she listens to her advise but in reality, she stubbornly goes to Parvatipuram. She asked directions to Parvatipuram from an old woman who warned her about the dangers lurking around that area but still she decided to go even after that warning. \n\nJust then Ganga gives a call and informs Rajashekar that she has found Parvatipuram that is 40 km away from Chengalpattu. Rajashekar who already knows that Ganga is going to Parvatipuram quickly informs Namboothiri. Namboothiri then tells Rajashekar to stop Ganga from going closer towards the Kattu Amman (if she does she will discover that they have given her the fake Kalachakrams) to which Rajashekar agrees with him and takes his actions. Namboothiri then says to himself that Ganga is digging her own grave by going to Parvatipuram.\n\nThe time shown on the clock is 2.30pm, which also is the moment she has already reached Parvatipuram. She is then confronted and stopped by Karuppan's Aruvaal which was sent by Seiyanayagi to stop Ganga from going but Ganga asks for forgiveness to Seiyanayagi saying that it's her duty to make sure that nothing bad will happen to her family even at the cost of her own life and steps forward into Parvatipuram. \n\nSeiyanayagi who comes to know about the impetuous decision taken by Ganga, tells to her disciples that she can no longer save Ganga after this but she can only do her best prayers to Karrupanasamy and be hopeful that nothing bad happens to Ganga for the next 2 hours. \n\nThis is because, the moment Ganga set her foot on the soil of Parvatipuram was on an Ashtami tithi which is prone to bring harm, especially to Ganga because her maranam (death) strongly can happen only in this tithi as the people that she had trusted all this while will turn against her during this time.\n\nOn her way searching for the Kattu Amman temple she comes across two men's (either Rajashekar or Namboothiri or Vichu's gang) who chases after her for the bag she is having while running away from them, Arun calls her only to discover that she cut the line which she will never do whenever he calls her. \n\nArun who discovers that something fishy is happening to Ganga, calls Ganga's father and inquires about the place Ganga had went to which her father tells him that she went to a temple but is unsure of the temples name or the exact place she had gone because he forgot to ask her. \n\nArun says that there isn't any problem when Ganga's father inquired about the reason why Arun called him. Arun then calls his friend in order to track her phone location and in 5 minutes time his friend mentioned that this person is 30 km to 40 km away from Chengalpattu. \n\nWhen Arun asked for the exact location, his friend tells him that this person (Ganga) is in Parvatipuram. He remembers of telling Ganga not to go to Parvatipuram because it's a very dangerous place to visit but she still visits the place by herself. Arun then rushes to Parvatipuram in order to save Ganga from any life-threatening situations.\n\nGanga who managed to escape from the two pursuers (who is not very far behind), discovers the Kattu Amman temple and starts her prayers by cleaning up the place that's filled with many overgrown grasses and start to perform the formal procedures of prayers for the Kattu Amman. \n\nOnce she's done with her prayers she lights up the vilakku (sacred lamp) but the fire goes off because of a strong wind (a symbolism to show that the goddess Kattu Amman is not accepting her prayers). After this she offered the 3 Kalachakrams at the feet of the goddess to which the 3 Kalachakram begins to vibrate in a very unstable manner. Ganga was very shocked after discovering this incident.\n\nKattu Amman exposed that the 3 Kalachakram given by Rajashekar to Ganga are fake ones by burning all the 3 fake Kalachakrams. Ganga who came to know the truth decided to confront Rajashekar about this conspiracy but on her way she was confronted by the two goons who was chasing her earlier. \n\nNandhini who has observed this all along decided to leave her house and rescue Ganga who is about to be in a big danger. Before she can even leave she was stopped by her promise that she made with Muniappa. When Muniappa came into the house, he was shocked to see the condition of the house which was messy and asked Nandhini what had happened. \n\nNandhini told him what was happening to Ganga in Parvatipuram and tells him to take back his promise so that she can save Ganga from her fated doom that is about to happen any minute. Muniappa assumes that Ganga's family member (Rajashekar) will not harm her and tells this fact to Nandhini but Nandhini who knows what is going to happen tells him that she is in a grave danger that could even end up with her own death.\n\nHowever, Muniappa stubbornly refuses to take back his promise saying that no matter what will happen he will not let Nandhini go out and invite trouble to herself until after Margazhi Pournami (the day Nandhini gains her full powers and also the ability to have her own human form) because he has already promised to Parvati (Nandhini's mother) that he will make sure to take good care of Nandhini until the day the prophecy happens.\n\nOn the same time, Ganga runs away but trips and falls in front of Rajashekar. When she asked him for the real Kalachakram he together with Namboothiri and Vichu refuses to give the real ones to her. At this moment, Ganga realizes that she has been cheated all along by the three of them whom she trusted and was led into the trap set by them (Rajashekar, Namboothiri and Vichu). \n\nGanga then threatens Rajashekar by saying that she will inform his son Arun (Arun is already in Parvatipuram searching for Ganga) about their conspiracies. Rajashekar then pleads her not to say a word about this to his son but Ganga stubbornly refuses to listen to his pleas (while silently recording the video in her phone), which in return made Rajashekar to stab her brutally in her belly with a sharp knife provided by Vichu in an effort to silence her.\n\nWith her last burst of energy Ganga pushes away Rajashekar and runs for her life while taking out the knife which was protruding from her stabbed wound (chances of Ganga to survive are even lesser) and throwing it away onto the ground. While she is running away from all of them, she tried to call Arun to inform him about what had transpired, but one of the goons threw a log at her leg making her to trip and fall which makes her phone to slip out of her hands and falls a few distance away from her. \n\nThis bought the three of them enough time to catch-up with Ganga and both the goons managed to capture her (even though she tries to wriggle out of their grasp she fails to do so) while the other three (Rajashekar, Namboothiri and Vichu) surrounded Ganga to settle their scores by killing her. \n\nThe time is shown to be 3.10pm with another 1 hour 20 minutes more time for Ashtami to come to an end. At the same moment, Seiyanayagi who have been observing all that had already happened calls out to Ganga with an opened arms (hinting that she is powerless and cannot do anything to prevent Ganga's predicted death).\n\nIn the latest episode, it is shown that after the goons captured Ganga, they covered her mouth tightly so that she doesn’t make any noise worrying Arun (already inside the Parvatipuram forest looking for Ganga) whom might possibly hear her and comes to her rescue. At the same time, Arun calls out for Ganga whereas Nambothiri tells Rajasekhar to call him now and ask him to leave this place immediately. According to him, he is being a hindrance to them to kill Ganga. \n\nRajasekhar then calls Arun by his phone and acts by telling him lies as if he is going to meet the doctor in the hospital due to cardiac arrest. Arun then says he will come back to him after finding Ganga. Rajasekhar again lied to him saying Ganga have already called and informed him that she had already left Parvatipuram and is on the way coming back to home. By hearing this, Arun is excited and relieved to hear that Ganga is safe and leaves the forest with his vehicle immediately. \n\nMeanwhile, at Muniappan’s house Nandhini is urging him to take back his promise as she needs to save Ganga from being killed by the evil people. Muniappa again refuses to listen by saying Nandhini’s safety is important to him compared to Ganga’s life. While this argument is going on, Ganga is being beaten mercilessly by the goons of Vichu with weapons. It is then revealed that Nambothiri wants the goons to torture and beat Ganga so that Ganga will be in pain which will enrage Nandhini. Therefore, Nandhini will come to rescue Ganga and when she comes Nambothiri can tie up Nandhini forever this time. \n\nHe ordered to beat Ganga even more so that Nandhini must be even more enraged and comes out from her hideout. They tied Ganga to a tree and beat her. Whenever Ganga fell unconscious, they will splash water on Ganga to awake her and beat her again. Rajasekhar leaves the place telling them to bury her body after she dies and not to burn her body as Ganga is like a loving daughter to him and she's unable to withstand the heat from the fire. \n\nAs Rajasekhar is leaving, Ganga shouts at him saying he and his gang will never be spared by Nandhini’s wrath and that Nandhini will come back after Margazhi Pournami to avenge them as a Nagakanni. She also said Nandhini will kill all of them for all the sins they have committed. Ganga also warns Rajasekhar that he will face severe consequences for betraying Ganga as he is the one Ganga believed the most. Rajasekhar just leaves the place silently and speechless. \n\nBy seeing all this, Nandhini, on the other hand, pleading to Muniappa to take back his promise and accuses him for being so inhumane. To appease Nandhini, Parvathi (Sivanagam) appears in front of them and warns Nandhini not to go as it is their trick to lure Nandhini and are using Ganga as bait to trap her forever. Nandhini doesn’t seem to care much about it and keep on insisting to rescue Ganga. Furthermore, she also blames Parvathi for Ganga’s current condition as only because of Parvathi revealed all the truth to Ganga she is going to die. \n\nParvathi disagrees with Nandhini’s accusation and said she only revealed the truth to make Ganga realize Nandhini is innocent and she never wanted Ganga to return the 3 Kalachakrams to Kaatu Amman herself. Finally, Parvathi gives up by Nandhini’s stubborn act and allows Nandhini to go rescue Ganga. She asks Muniappan to take back his promise. Thereafter, Muniappan also takes back his promise and allows Nandhini to go. \n\nAs Nandhini is about to leave to rescue Ganga, Ganga while being beaten ruthlessly by the goons shouts out loud pleading Nandhini not to come here and all these are Nambothiri’s plan to make Nandhini tied up forever. She also warns Nandhini if she comes she will never able to avenge these evil people. Ganga made a promise on herself that Nandhini should never come to rescue her by saying “idhu ye mele sathiyam” which means “I'm swearing upon myself to make sure you should not come to rescue me”. \n\nJust as how Muniappan’s promise forbade Nandhini to rescue Ganga, now Ganga’s swear/promise made Nandhini unable to come near to Ganga or rescue her. At the same time, Nambothiri sits on the ground near Ganga and chants some mantras as an early preparation to imprison Nandhini. \n\nIn the end, Ganga dies from the beatings of the goons. Nambothiri learns that Nandhini will never come after this as Ganga already died and no use of waiting for Nandhini anymore. The goons, Vichu and Nambothiri digs a very deep hole in the ground and buries Ganga’s dead body. \n\nThey left the place after making sure no other evidence of the murder is left out (but they never knew about Ganga's phone which slipped out from Ganga’s hand and inside the phone there is a video recording of Rajasekhar stabbing Ganga with knife). \n\nIn the mean time, Seiyanayagi learns about Ganga’s death and feels very sad and disappointed. Sad because she is unable to save Ganga, disappointed because even her Karuppusamy can’t save Ganga’s life from the danger. She laments about how Ganga could have heeded to her advice and not going to Parvatipuram. \n\nAt the last scene of the episode, Bhairavi comes to the Parvathipuram forest as well to see Kaatu Amman and asks her permission to possess all three Kalachakrams. As she is finding the statue of Kaattu Amman, Bhairavi accidentally trips into Ganga’s phone. Bhairavi opens the phone and finds out that it is Ganga’s phone by seeing the wallpaper of the phone (picture of Ganga and Arun together). \n\nBhairavi suspects what Ganga’s phone is doing in the Parvatipuram forest. Assuming that it is a hint given by Kaatu Amman alias Selli Amman to reveal something, she searches for the files in the phone to find out something interesting. \n\nAs she suspected, she found the video record of Rajasekhar stabbing Ganga with a knife to kill her. The episode ends with a smiling face and a very happy look on Bhairavi hinting that she is going to do something beneficial to her by using the video as an evidence to threaten Rajashekar and get hold of the 3 Kalachakrams.\n\nBhairavi feels very happy that she found the video as now she can possess all three Kalachakras using the video record which will serve as the proof for Rajasekhar murdering Ganga. She plans to blackmail Rajasekhar and obtain all the Three Kalachakras. At the same time, Bhairavi wonders what could have happened in between which caused Rajasekhar to the extent of killing his own daughter in law.\n\nBhairavi later thanks Kaatu Amman alias Selli Amman for showing her the video proof which is going to facilitate the process of her possessing the kalachakras. Bhairavi assumes that maybe Kaatu Amman wants her to visit the Amman only when she has all the Three Kalachakras. She vows to obtain all three Kalachakras and will present them infront of the Goddess. After that, Bhairavi greets the Goddess in an honorable gesture as a sign of gratitude facing North Side (the side Kaattu Amman statue is situated).\n\nMeanwhile, in the palace Ganga’s father, Manickam worries about Ganga and her whereabouts. In the living room, Devi, Dharmaraj and his son Moorthy was enquiring Manickam about some pending houseworks that needs to be sorted out but Manickam stays still deeply thinking about Ganga only. When Devi raised her voice, Manickam realized they were standing beside him and apologised for ignoring them. He said he is very worried about Ganga. Dharmaraj and Devi then persuade him by telling Ganga will be back home and she knows her way home. \n\nRajasekhar enters the palace and sees the crowd. He then knows what has happened after Manickam explained his worry to him. Rajasekhar asks everyone else to leave Manickam alone and persuades Manickam by telling Ganga will be back home by today and not to worry. Rajasekhar climbs upstairs to his room while Manickam in a partially convinced state leaves the hall. \n\nDay turns night, Arun finally arrives at the palace and went to Rajasekhar’s room at once. He was extra worried about his father’s cardiac arrest. Rajasekhar then told him that it was just a mild attack and it is him who unnecessarily exaggerated the matter. Arun then tells Rajasekhar that it is enough of him toiling hard for the company. Now it is Arun’s turn to take care of the company management. Rajasekhar notices the tension face on Arun and asked him why he is so tension. Arun explains his tension to him saying Ganga is still no where to be found and that he is extremely worried about that. \n\nAs Arun about to leave the room, he asked Rajasekhar whether he is the one who sent Ganga to Parvatipuram because during their last conversation she mentioned she is going to visit Kattu Amman in Parvatipuram. Moreover, since Rajasekhar knows the place very well, Arun asks Rajasekhar whether he has anything to do with Ganga’s disappearance or knows about her whereabouts. Rajasekhar said he don’t know anything and maintains silence. When Arun keeps on nagging him, Rajasekhar puts up an act as if he has chest pain in order to end the conversation. Arun then apologies to Rajasekhar for asking him all these questions and should not have nagged him knowing he is unwell. \n\nArun goes downstairs and meets his relatives and Manickam who were anxiously waiting for him. Manickam enquired Arun about Ganga and Arun gives a disappointing answer to Manickam which he did not want to hear. Arun promises Manickam that he will find Ganga very soon and bring her back home in a confident mode as he knows her last known location through his friend which is Parvatipuram forest. Manickam leaves with a hopeful heart. \n\nArun’s aunt, Manju asked Arun that Manickam can be pacified but how to pacify Devasena? Devasena was looking for Ganga the first thing she came back home from school and even refused to change school uniform without Ganga, she added. But somehow Manju managed to convince Devasena and at last put her to sleep. Manju requested Arun to expedite the process of finding Ganga, otherwise it will be very hard to pacify Devasena later on. As all of them disperse, Moorthy is happy that Ganga is lost and he does not want Ganga to come back into the house ever again. \n\nArun leaves and enters his bedroom seeing Devasena sleeping soundly on the bed. He feels very pity for Devasena and worries about what is going to happen to Devasena if he fails to find Ganga. He then walks to Janaki’s photo and pours out all his emotions and sorrows to Janaki’s photo assuming he is conversing with Janaki herself. He prays hard to God that he has to locate Ganga very soon. On the other hand, Janaki’s spirit is hearing all these and she worries about Arun and Devasena. She feels Ganga will never leave Devasena alone at any cost and suspects something fishy must have happened. In a distant, Janaki promises Arun that she will find Ganga too and unite Ganga with Arun. \n\nAll of the sudden, Janaki’s spirit gets a vision related to Ganga’s current condition. (Janaki gets the vision just like how she got a vision about Devasena’s whereabouts after being abducted by Chamundi during the Suriya Grahana Ammavasya Day). In the vision, Janaki sees all the injustice happened to Ganga starting from the moment she left the house until the moment she was buried. She also sees the persons who were involved in this heinous crime. Janaki is shocked to see Rajasekhar is involved too since she could not believe her father in law whom she assumed to be good but is actually evil. She burns in fury and enrages after knowing the truth. \n\nJanaki decides to teach Rajasekhar a lesson for killing his own daughter in law. She furiously starts off to Seetha’s room to possess her body. Seetha was worried too about Ganga’s condition before getting possessed by Janaki’s spirit. Seetha who is now possessed by Janaki’s spirit goes to Rajasekhar’s room and locks the door after her. She shouts at sleeping Rajasekhar to wake him up. \n\nRajasekhar is shocked to see Seetha in his room in the middle of the night. Unknowing Seetha’s body is possessed by Janaki’s spirit he asked her how did she enter his locked room. Janaki confronted Rajasekhar directly without beating around the bush. She asked how Rajasekhar can sleep peacefully after committing a sin. She asked why and how did he had the heart to kill Ganga. Rajasekhar still acts innocent and says he himself is worried about Ganga and how can Seetha blame him unnecessarily for killing Ganga. \n\nJanaki then shouts out loud, exclaiming, “I am not Seetha! I am Janaki!” while breaking a furniture near to her. This shocks Rajasekhar even more. Janaki said she will make Rajasekhar feel the pain of death. She created a barrier made of fire around Rajasekhar’s bed. The blazing fire surrounded Rajasekhar completely, preventing him from escaping from his bed. The episode ends with Rajasekhar crying in fear, trapped inside the fire barrier formed by Janaki.\n\nThe episode continues with Rajasekhar trembling in fear and it is showed he is unable to withstand the heat from the fire. Janaki then pulls Rajasekhar from the firey barrier and throws him to a sofa without Rajasekhar getting hurt. Now from this it is evident that Janaki only wants to make Rajasekhar realise the pain of how it feels like being killed and she has no intention to kill him. Nevertheless, Janaki confronts Rajasekhar again, demanding a valid reason from him for killing Ganga, this time in a more furious grip. Rajasekhar apologies to Janaki and said that he regrets for what he had done. He pleaded to Janaki to not conceal the truth to Arun. \n\nJanaki seems to not buying the lies of Rajasekhar and said she will definitely tell Arun about all Rajasekhar’s wrongdoings. Rajasekhar pleads again, saying rather than Arun comes to know that his father is a murderer it is better for Janaki to kill him herself. Janaki replies that rather than killing him, the deserving punishment for him will be revealing Rajasekhar’s true colors to Arun. Rajasekhar then said to Janaki, if Arun comes to know of the truth, he can’t bear it hence he will die heartbroken. He adds, if Janaki wants Arun to die and Devasena to become an orphan then by all means she can reveal Rajasekhar’s dirty secret. Janaki is startled by hearing this and realizes that what Rajasekhar said has some truth. But still, her reaction seems to be hinting that she thinks Rajasekhar is justifying his crime. \n\nRajasekhar then explains more about so-called his side of justice. According to him, initially he stole the Three Kalachakras from Kaatu Amman is only because for the welfare of his family especially his only son, Arun. And not because he is selfish or greedy. According to him also, the fact that he gave Ganga those fake Kalachakras is not because that he did not want to give the original Kalachakras. But it is because Nambothiri had warned him if he gives out the Kalachakra that he has, Arun and Devasena’s life will be in danger. (Viewers has to note that the words Rajasekhar mentioned about Nambothiri’s warnings has not been showed in any of the previous episodes) \n\nMoreover, Ganga kept threatening Rajasekhar that she will reveal Rajasekhar’s secrets to Arun. He was not able to take it as for 20 years he kept his secret from Arun and now Ganga is going to break it. So he had no choice but to kill Ganga but he swears he did that unwillingly and his conscience did not allow him to do it. Rajasekhar then tells Janaki to punish him and he will take any punishment Janaki gives him for the sin that he has committed. Janaki says she came to live in that house and wishes everyone to live only and not to die. As per Janaki, she will not do anything that will cause death in her in law’s house. (So this scene obviously shows Janaki is not going to reveal anything to Arun for now).\nAfter hearing Rajasekhar’s justification, Janaki’s spirit told him not to tell anyone else about her existence and left Seetha’s body. \n\nSeetha who is now no more possessed is clueless on how she got into Rajasekhar’s room. Rajasekhar manages the situation by telling he had asked Seetha for water and Seetha is the one who brought him water flask to drink. Seetha is still clueless however is sent back to the outhouse by Rajasekhar later on. \n\nThe next day morning, Devasena wakes up from sleep and searches for Ganga thinking Ganga is back home. She wants Ganga to help her on bathing and brushing teeth. By seeing this, Janaki decides to help Devasena herself on behalf of Ganga. She brings toothbrush and towel to Devasena invisibly. Devasena found out that is must be her mother, Janaki’s doing and says she can bath and brush independently. Janaki brings Devasena’s school uniform and packs her school bag for her to get ready to school. Devasena is now ready to go school and Janaki appears before her. Devasena is happy to see her but enquires about Ganga. Janaki lies to her by saying Ganga had gone to temple tour for three days and let her enjoy this time as she only sits at home. \n\nDevasena agreed and she said she will manage just like how she survived when Ganga went to Kerala for honeymoon. On the other hand, Arun is trying hard to find Ganga by contacting his friends and Parvatipuram forest officer. Arun then feels surprised and proud to see Devasena who have gotten ready to school by herself. Devasena tells Arun that since Ganga had gone to temple tour for three days so she has to prepare herself to be independent. Arun assumes maybe Manju aunty is the one who told Devasena this. \n\nArun then sends Devasena into their car while Seetha also joins them. Seetha is also surprised to see how Devasena managed to be calm without Ganga. Arun explains maybe Manju aunty is the one who told Devasena that Ganga had went for three days temple tour. Seetha prays hard to God that Ganga should be found. \n\nMeanwhile, Manickam visits the family which Ganga sought help to put up a drama to find out Seetha’s husband. (It seems the family is Ganga’s relatives and not only friends). Manickam was warmly received by the family and one of the women asked whether Ganga did not come along with him? Manickam began to shed tears in front of them. The husband of the woman asks why he is crying and Manickam told them everything that had happened. He still could not figure out why Ganga went to the deserted forest temple and what made her to go there suddenly. \n\nThe family doubts it has got to do with Arun and Seetha’s illegal relationship so they revealed all the truth to Mancikam as they had no choice. They felt there is no point hiding the truth anymore after what had happened. After knowing Arun is the one who tied Thaali (auspicious marital insignia) on Seetha, Manickam feels disappointed and very angry. The family rendered to help Manickam to ask justice for Ganga but he refused and went to palace to ask justice for himself. \n\nAt the palace, Manickam furiously arrives at the living room where Arun is standing and pulls his shirt. He scolded and cursed Arun with bad words. Arun was shocked to see Manickam’s behaviour. Manickam accuses Arun of destroying Ganga’s life and because of him, Ganga’s life has been ruined. He pulls his shirt again and angrily scolds him again. Moorthy pushes Manickam away by telling how dare he behaves rudely with Arun, the boss of this house. Manju also asks Manickam how can he behave like this to his own son in law. Unknowing Manickam had learned the truth, Arun becomes more worried and is totally clueless on why he is behaving in such a way. \n\nJust as the argument is heating up, Seetha comes to the crowd to make the situation even worse. Moorthy again hits Manickam to chase him from the house but Manickam pushes Moorthy away and shouts, “Yes! Chase me from the house! Chase me like how all of you had chased Ganga from the house!” The episode ends with the shocking faces of Seetha and Arun after hearing Manickam’s statement.\n\nManju is shocked after hearing what Manickam has said. She asked him what happened until it made him to accuse Arun in such a way. Manickam says Arun is the one who planned and chased Ganga out of the house to get rid off her, again pulls his shirt. Rajasekhar enters the scene seeing all the commotion and intervenes. He asks why Manickam is treating Arun like this and Manickam spilled the beans to him. He revealed Arun is the one who married Seetha and that Ganga already knew this. He accuses Arun saying Arun fell in love with Seetha due to her similar looks as Janaki, so Ganga is like an obstacle for him to get Seetha. Hence, Arun sent Ganga to Parvatipuram forest and killed her. \n\nEveryone including Rajasekhar was shocked to hear this especially Rajasekhar who now has mixed feelings of guilt and disappointment, stood there completely speechless. He maintained silence throughout the commotion. Manju then backed up Arun saying Manickam is accusing Arun unnecessarily as Ganga is now absent in the home. But, Arun then admitted he is the one who married Seetha. It gave a double shock to everyone else but Seetha interrupted in telling it is all her fault and please do not blame Arun. Manickam said he won't believe the stories that they are telling, hence he requested Rajasekhar to reprimand Arun for his wrongdoings. But Rajasekhar still stood there silently which angered Manickam even more, and he assumes it is because Arun is his son so that is why he is not reprimanding Arun and supports him. \n\nArun refuses Manickam's accusation and said how will he kill Ganga when he loves her dearly. Manickam keeps saying that Arun is the one who did something bad to Ganga. Meanwhile, Janaki's spirit is watching all this and decided to throw the letter (the letter which Ganga wrote before leaving the house) which she saw falling from Ganga's cupboard into the middle of the crowd. She did this to avoid Arun from being blamed as a murderer and obviously the real murderer is Rajasekhar. Manju picked up the letter and read the content in it, written, \n\"Due to some reasons, I have decided to serve God for a while so I am leaving the house. This is my own decision without of anyone's influence and please do not search for me. Yours Truly, \nGanga\" \n\nManickam did not believe the letter and said Arun could have forced Ganga to write it or created the letter by himself. He curses the family and says from now on he is severing all the ties with the family and leaves the house. Seetha and Arun plead to Manickam to not leave the house but he did not listen. He said one day God will severely punish this family for what they done to Ganga, and angrily leaves the house. Before Manickam left the house, Arun tried to explain his side of justice too by saying he did not marry Seetha vountarily, but was forced to marry her due to circumstances and was afraid to reveal it to Ganga. Again Manickam ignored his so-called explanations. Manickam now left the house. \n\nThe remaining people go to their respective rooms. Arun and Seetha, feels bad for not revealing the truth to Ganga in the first place and regrets. Especially Seetha who thinks she is the one Ganga believed the most and that now she has no rights to stay in the house anymore. She then packs her things to get out from the outhouse just as then Janaki appears before her. \n\nJanaki told Seetha that she should not leave the house yet otherwise there will be no one to explain the truth about what really happened. According to her, Seetha is selfish if she leaves the house just like that after creating problems in the family. It is because of Seetha that Manickam accused Arun as a murderer. She demanded Seetha to stay and sort out the family's problems which caused by her first and wait until Ganga comes back home. (Janaki has a point, because if Seetha leaves the house now then Manickam and others will surely assume that both Arun and her did cheat Ganga, so Seetha escapes from the house as the truth is exposed. Hence, it will be falsely considered that Arun is the one who sent her to Parvatipuram.) \n\nSeetha agreed and Janaki vanished into thin air. Meanwhile, as Rajasekhar is resting in his room he receives a phone call from Bhairavi. When he picked up the call, Bhairavi said that she had sent a video to him and asks him to view it first. Rajasekhar then clicks open the video sent by her and was extremely shocked to see it. He called back Bhairavi and asked how did she got the video. Bhairavi replied that the video is a gift presented by Selli Amman to her. She blackmails Rajasekhar saying he is now in Bhairavi's grip and he is unable to escape from her. \n\nRajasekhar said he will talk to Bhairavi personally about this but Bhairavi has other plans. She told him that tomorrow she will be arriving at his palace herself once again. Bhairavi wants Rajasekhar to welcome her in a very grand manner and give her full respect when she comes to the palace. She wants back the same respect which she lost in the palace previously. Rajasekhar agreed and ended the phone call. Bhairavi is confident that she can obtain all the Three Kalachakras by using the video she has. \n\nIn the meantime, Manickam visits Seiyanayagi and pours out his feelings to her. He said that Ganga is nowhere to be found and seeks help from her to locate Ganga. Seiyanayagi replies Ganga is still alive and will definitely return home. She assured Manickam that even though Ganga went to a place she not supposed to go, she will be back home at the right time. Seiyanayagi told Manickam not to worry about Ganga anymore. Manickam is so pleased to hear this and greets Seiyanayagi before leaving. On the other hand, Seiyanayagi's disciples are confused by what Seiyanayagi has said. One of them asked that Ganga has already died, so did Seiyanayagi lied to Manickam to console him? The episode ends with Seiyanayagi saying, \" No, I did not lied. Ganga is really alive\"\n\nSeiyanayagi also tells her disciples that Ganga will be back at the right time without delaying neither arrive too early. The next scene is showed Arun is driving his car next to him is a police inspector. They are on their mission to find Ganga in Parvatipuram. The police inspector said, with the help of Parvatipuram forest officer they have searched the whole forest but still unable to locate Ganga. He also added that he has lost confidence that Ganga will be found and is not believing that Ganga is still at the forest. He suggested maybe Ganga had already left the forest. But Arun said he believes his intuition which strongly says Ganga is still at the forest. He requested the police officer to search for Ganga again, and the inspector agrees to search again. \n\nAs they arrive at Parvatipuram, they asked whoever that passed by and enquired them whether they have seen Ganga by showing her photo. All of them did not know her at all until Arun and the police inspector came across an old lady. The old lady is the same lady which Ganga had asked for directions to go to Kaattu Amman temple previously. The lady recognized Ganga after Arun showed her the photo and said she saw her, and also showed her the direction to Kaatu Amman temple. Arun said he is Ganga's husband and Ganga have not yet come back home. The old lady said that she had warned Ganga before to not to enter the temple as there are snakes guarding the temple. \n\nArun asked about Parvati too by showing her Parvati's photo. The lady knew Parvati too and begins to narrate the story of Muniappan's family. She recalled all the incident happened 20 years ago including Parvati's speciality in curing illnesses and doing wonders in their village. She said the whole family died bitten by the two snakes guarding the temple. (The Parvatipuram villagers are unaware of the fact that Parvati and Nandhini are the two snakes).\nThe old lady told Arun maybe Ganga has been bitten by the snakes and died. \n\nArun and the inspector left the old lady and went to their vehicle. Arun begins to doubt Rajasekhar whether he has something to do with Parvati's death. He has now learned Parvati is actually dead and not alive but still is unsure of the truth. He also thinks Rajasekhar is the one who imprisoned Nandhini inside the snake mound for 20 years. So, Rajasekhar must have done something evil to Parvati's family and so on. The police inspector saw Arun in a disturbed state and consoles him by saying Ganga can't be bitten by those snakes and the forest temple is only deserted but not dangerous at all. Arun clears his mind and both of them continue their journey. \n\nBack in the palace, Bhairavi arrives and Rajasekhar welcomes her in a very respectful manner by asking Manju to take 'arathi' for Bhairavi. Bhairavi enters the palace as Devi just watches her and wonders how Bhairavi is able enter the palace again but this time with Rajasekhar's special hospitality. She thought to herself maybe Bhairavi used black magic and bound-spelled Rajashekar to dance to her tunes. \"I will definitely find out the truth because there is something fishy as Bhairavi keeps coming back to palace\", she says. \n\nMeanwhile, Rajasekhar and Bhairavi enter his room and he locks the door after him. He requested Bhairavi to give the video record to him in exchange of lump sum money. Bhairavi laughed and said that she is not an ordinary human to desire on money. She only desires incredible powers which is the kalachakras. Rajasekhar takes out a gun and says to Bhairavi that it is better for her to surrender to him. Bhairavi laughed again and she turned the point of the gun to Rajasekhar's chest using the power rays of her eyes. Rajasekhar trembles in fear and Bhairavi tells him not to mess with her because she can do anything by using her eyes only. Rajasekhar becomes afraid and asks some more time frame to Bhairavi to collect the Three Kalchakras. Bhairavi gives him two days grace and after two days she must get the kalachakras. \n\nBhairavi leaves the palace but insults and mocks Devi in the middle. Devi is very angry about this and promises to find the truth. In the next scene, it is showed Nambothiri and his three disciples are gathered in a forest. The disciples are digging three separate holes respectively. Rajasekhar comes to Nambothiri and asked why they are digging the holes. Nambothiri replies these are the special traps to catch Nandhini and prevent her from taking human form during the Margazhi Pournami (December Full Moon Day) and episode ends.\n\nNambothiri assures Rajasekhar he can successfully trap Nandhini and prevent her from taking Nagakanni form (human female form) during the Margazhi Pournami. Rajasekhar said he is very much indebted to Nambothiri as he is striving so hard to save Rajasekhar's family from danger and feels proud of their friendship. He is also very confident that Nandhini will be imprisoned by Nambothiri. \n\nBack in the palace, Devi, Leela, Dharmaraj & Moorthy are fun chatting in the living room while Seetha passes by. Dharmaraj requested Seetha to make him a coffee but turned down by Seetha. She said Devasena will be back home from school anytime now so she needs to make food for her and asks him to approach Lakshmi instead. Devi intervenes, saying that Seetha is now Arun's wife and she is also the lady boss of this house. They should not treat Seetha as a servant anymore in a mocking tone. Dharmaraj agrees and laughs sarcastically. Seetha just leaves silently. \n\nLeela leaves to make coffee instead leaving Devi, Dharmaraj and Moorthy. Three of them plans to disclose the fact that Arun married Seetha to Devasena after she comes back. Devi also plans to create ruckus in the family by telling Devasena that because Arun married Seetha only Ganga left the house and will never come back. Devasena comes home and they tell her what they had planned. Dharmaraj opens up by first saying Arun had married Seetha. To their astonishment, Devasena is happy that Seetha and Arun married as she wished the same to happen. Devasena runs to her room happily before Dharmaraj could tell her that Ganga left the house because of this only. Devi is disappointed and angry with Dharmaraj for not telling her the matter quickly. \n\nDevasena hurries to Arun to thank him for marrying Seetha and it is her wish came true. Arun just listens to her speechlessly. Meanwhile, Manickam is walking alone at the roadside and is spotted by Rajasekhar who asks him to come back home. Manickam said he won't come back to the house whereby the household members (particularly Arun - who have married Seeta) have betrayed his daughter, Ganga. Rajasekhar angrily replies why is he so concerned about Ganga who is not his biological daughter. He then recalls the incident, that many years ago Manickam and his wife did not have any child so he brought an orphan Ganga who was still a baby to Rajasekhar to ask him permission if Manickam can adopt her and raise her as his own child. Rajasekhar also tells that he loves Ganga dearly too. Manickam says even though she is not his own daughter, but he treats Ganga as his own blood. Manickam leaves Rajasekhar and walked away. \n\nIn the mean time, Arun is driving and sees their family doctor. He asks the doctor how is his father's condition after the gastric attack assumed as a cardiac arrest. The family doctor is confused and says he has not met his father since two months. Arun learns that Rajasekhar had lied to him about the cardiac arrest and leaves home to question Rajasekhar. Arun keeps asking why he lied to Arun that Rajasekhar had a heart attack. But Rajasekhar managed the situation by saying he wanted to meet their family doctor but ended up visited another doctor instead. Rajasekhar tells Arun to stop suspecting him as it is breaking his heart. \n\nThe next day, Devasena cries in front of Janaki's photo and laments about Ganga's disappearance. She said Ganga left the house sulking and will never come back. Arun asked her who told her this and she said that it was Manju aunty who said that to her. Arun goes to Manju and asks why he told Devasena Ganga left the house sulking and will not come back. Manju replied that is the truth and she has to know about it one day. Arun asks Manju to persuade Devasena now for making her cry. Manju then consoles Devasena by telling she lied to her about Ganga leaving home. She tells Ganga went to temple tour only. Devasena is pacified and they both goes to the dining hall to eat. \n\nArun is now worrying about Ganga and is started to recall back the memories when Ganga was still living with him in the palace. He recalls back an incident where Ganga and Devasena wants to shave off his beard but Ganga changed her mind by telling the beard is the beauty of her husband. Rajasekhar then comes and sees an extremely worried Arun. He asks him to rest and leaves the house. After Rajasekhar left, Arun goes to Rajasekar's room to find any evidence regarding Parvatipuram. But as he busy searching in the room, Rajasekar enters the room and is shocked by his behaviour. He questions Arun and Arun replies he has to find out the truth by digging up Rajasekhar's past. Rajasekhar said it is his personal matter and unnecessary for Arun to know. This angers Arun and says he is going to Parvatipuram forest now to search for Ganga and he will not return home until she is found. He said he will search the whole forest and every part of it to locate Ganga. Rajasekhar tried to stop him but Arun leaves the house. \n\nMeanwhile, Muniappan and Nandhini are seen sitting under a tree in a jungle. Muniappa says in order to keep Nandhini safe always, they have to keep migrating from one place to another. He said if they stayed at one place then Nambothiri can easily find Nandhini to capture and trap her. Muniappa requests Nandhini to be patient until the Margazhi Pournami where during the eve of full moon day he will keep Nandhini in a more secure place. Nandhini and Muniappa start to walk in the jungle and Muniappa clears any pathway that is blocked with thorns and branches. While they are walking, Nambothiri is seen walking in the same jungle but at a different area. \n\nNambothiri is suddenly stop by a group of tribals. It is then revealed the head of the tribal group is Nambothiri's disciple. His name is Chala. Nambothiri wants a special herb to make a Shakti Nagam fall unconscious. Chala replies he has a very special herb to make any Shakti Nagam(s) to fall unconscious and it will take 10 days for the snake to regain consciousness. Chala askes Nambothiri where is the Shakti Nagam that he needs to trap. The scenes cuts and shows Nandhini and Muniappa travelling in the jungle. \n\nAt the final scene of the episode, Arun is now in Parvatipuram forest finding Ganga while recalling back a lovely scene where Arun helps Ganga to cut vegetables but accidentally cuts his hand. Ganga cries and says she can't stand her husband is hurt. Arun now thinks to himself, but now Ganga had hurt him by leaving the house. The episode ends with Arun tearing and eventually crying in the forest.\n\nArun sees illusions of Ganga in the forest, smiling and calling out to him. Whenever Arun goes near her, the image will disappear. He cries out loud, shouting when will Ganga ever return to him. Meanwhile, Muniappa and Nandhini is tired of walking, feeling thirsty. They stop by a tree, Muniappa then asks Nandhini to stay under the tree while he is going to drink water at rivers nearby. He starts off to search for any water source. \n\nChala and his tribal group are seen searching for Nandhini in the same forest. Chala said to his tribal group that they must get hold of Nandhini as per Nambothiri's order. He concludes that currently Nandhini is definitely inside the same forest that they are in now by tracing Nandhini's trailings on the ground and by sensing her smell (a special snake odour that a Shakti Nagam emits, that can be smelled by powerful magicians like Nambothiri & Chala). Fortunately, Muniappa who passes by overheard the conversations among the tribal group and watches them from distant. \n\nChala takes out from a magic candle and lights it up. A smoke is released and disperses into the atmosphere. Chala said this is a magic smoke specified to spot Nandhini and will make her unconscious by its smell. Then they can easily capture her while she is unconscious. The smoke flows rapidly into the air, searching for Nandhini. The tribals follow the smoke to trace Nandhini. Muniappa learns Nandhini is now in danger and hurries to Nandhini to inform her about the tribals. \n\nBoth of them quickly runs away from the tribals, at the same time making sure that they don't get caught by the tribals. Muniappa and Nandhini find a snake mound and Nandhini gets inside the mound to hide while Muniappa hides behind a tree. Arun, on the other hand, who was looking for Ganga now spotted Muniappa and catches him from behind. Muniappa asks him to be silent and requests him to help him from the tribals. Arun then finds a way to help Muniappa from the tribal group. He then saw a beehive on top of a tree branch. He gets a stone and targets the beehive. Just as the tribals got near to the tree, he hits the beehive causing a swarm of bees flying out from the beehive and attacks the tribals. The tribals got heavily stung by the bees and ran away. \n\nSeeing Muniappa is saved by the tribals, he thanked Arun and tried to escape from him. Arun catches him and angrily asks him where is he going. He assumes Muniappa is the one who did something to Ganga and pulls his shirt. He shouts at Muniappa, asking him what did he do to Ganga. But Muniappa explains that he has nothing to do with Ganga and pleads to let him free. Nandhini comes out from the snake mound and calls out to Muniappa. Muniappa and Arun sees Nandhini. Arun is shocked to meet Nandhini first time personally. The same Nandhini who possessed Ganga long time back. \n\nMuniappa managed to escape from Arun and both Nandhini and he quickly flee. Arun watches them run away from him in dismay. Meanwhile, back in the palace, Nambothri arrives to meet Rajasekhar and is welcomed by Leela. Rajasekhar and Nambothiri go into Rajasekhar's room where inside Devasena is seen sleeping on the bed. Inside the room, Nambothiri asks Rajasekhar to be more patient as he is currently making some complex preparations and arrangements for special rituals. The special rituals will take some time to complete and he needs Rajasekhar to follow him for a while. \n\nNambothiri then sees Devasena on the bed and applies a holy ash on her forehead. After he applied the holy ash on Devasena's forehead, he smiles weirdly, hinting that there is something wrong going to happen. Rajasekhar just thinks Nambothiri applied the holy ash for Devasena's welfare. Both of them leaves the house. After they left, Leela enters the room to wake up Devasena for lunch. But Devasena is not waking up which worries Leela. Devasena seems to be in either a deep sleep or fell unconscious. \n\nLeela phones Rajasekhar to inform him about this. Rajasekhar who is travelling in car together with Nambothiri receives the call by Leela but is stopped by Nambothiri. He said that Rajasekhar should not answer any calls for the time being. Rajasekhar cancels the call but Leela keeps calling him, again cancelled by him. This worries Leela even more and wonders why he is not picking up the phone. She is scared now and worries about Devasena. \n\nThe scene now shows Arun walking inside the forest, still searching for Ganga. At the same time, accompanied by Ganga's sweet memories. As he walks, he comes near to Ganga's burial ground. Scenes of Ganga being buried by the goons are showed as flashback. The episode ends just when Arun steps on the ground where Ganga's dead body is buried beneath it.\n\nJust as Arun steps on the ground, he receives a call from Leela informing about Devasena's condition. Arun rushes home after hearing the news. Arun arrives at the palace where he sees a doctor is checking Devasena. Leela said that she called a doctor to check Devasena and Rajasekhar was not picking up her calls. Arun notices Devasena is perspiring and wipes off the sweat using a cloth. As he wipes the sweat drops, the holy ash on her forehead got wiped off too. Immediately Devasena regained consciousness and opened her eyes. Doctor said Devasena is now alright.\nNambothiri, on the other hand, realized Devasena woke up and Arun is back home. He asked Rajasekhar to go back home because Arun has come back. Nambothiri made Arun come back home from Parvatipuram forest by using Devasena. He intentionally applied the holy ash on the little child to make her fall in a deep sleep. Now that Arun came back home, Rajasekhar goes back to the palace to meet him.\nRajasekhar arrives at the palace seeing his servant Lakshmi. Lakshmi said Devasena just now was not conscious and the doctor had treated her. Rajasekhar rushes upstairs to see Devasena. Arun and Manju is with Devasena, Manju is feeding Devasena food. Rajasekhar inquired about her condition and Manju said that she is now perfectly alright. After Manju and Devasena left, Arun interrogated Rajasekhar. He asked why Rajasekhar did not answer the calls from Leela. Rajasekhar said he was busy and to stop suspecting him. Arun then said he is going back to Parvatipuram forest again to find Ganga. Arun leaves the palace and goes to the forest to find Ganga again.\nRajasekhar phones Nambothiri and tells him that Arun is going back to the forest to find Ganga. Nambothiri asks Rajasekhar to relax as Arun could not find Ganga anyway. He said Bhairavi's issue is bigger than this and they need to settle her issue first. Nambothiri asks Rajasekhar to come with him to meet Bhairavi.\nNambothiri, Vichu and Rajasekhar are now gathered in an old, deserted factory to meet Bhairavi. Bhairavi arrives and meets them. Nambothiri praises Bhairavi for disguising as himself to obtain the Kalachakras. He said a person who can shapeshift is definitely an invincible person and he is happy to meet Bhairavi. Bhairavi also praises Nambothiri for successfully obtaining the Three Kalachakras from Kaatu Amman which is a very difficult and dangerous task. At last they discusses about the main issue.\nBhairavi wants all the Three Kalachakras from them and she blackmails them if she does not get them, she will reveal the video evidence of Rajasekhar killing Ganga to everyone. Nambothiri requests Bhairavi to show him the video first before he can give the Kalachakras. Bhairavi plays the video record from her phone and shows to Vichu too. All of them are shocked until Nambothiri used his powerful firey laser rays from his eyes to burn Bhairavi's phone to ashes. Nambothiri, Rajasekhar and Vichu laugh and suddenly stopped by Bhairavi's laughter. She said she is not fooling – to bring the video evidence only to meet them. She said they can erase the evidence by burning the phone but they can't burn the evidence on her hand.\nBhairavi shows her palm to everyone and on her palm, the exact scenes recorded in Ganga's phone is showed. She said she already magically imprinted the video record on her palm knowing something like this can happen. Bhairavi said she can easily screen the video scenes in front of Rajasekhar's palace in a theatrical mode, for everyone to see. To prevent that, she needs the Kalachakras immediately. Nambothiri asks Bhairavi what is she going to do with the Kalachakras anyway. Bhairavi replies she is definitely not going to keep the Kalachakras uselessly like how Rajasekhar kept his Kalachakra locked in a room for 20 years.\nShe said she is going to extract the powers of Kalachakras and experiment the uses of the powers contained in the Kalachakras. She also asked Nambothiri what he had achieved by obtaining the Kalachakras so far. Nothing! Just nothing! But Nambothiri disagrees with her. He said he does not need to achieve anything in his life as he already attained the position of eternal fulfillment. He had fulfilled all his needs. Since Nambothiri has nothing to achieve, Bhairavi asks him to give her the Kalachakras.\nRajasekhar then tells Bhairavi that initially it is true that they took the Kalachakras due to greed and money. But now they need the Kalachakras to save themselves from Nandhini. The kalachakras are the ones that can save them from Nandhini and if they give them to Bhairavi, they will be killed by Nandhini. So Nambothiri arranges an agreement with Bhairavi. The agreement is if Bhairavi successfully catches Nandhini and bring the snake to Nambothiri, he will give Bhairavi the Kalachakras.\nBhairavi laughs and says that Nambothiri is intentionally making her to fight with Nandhini, so that Nandhini will kill her, and this is a plan to get rid of Bhairavi. Nambothiri said he has no such intention because he knows Bhairavi is invincible and Nandhini's power has less impact on Bhairavi. He challenged Bhairavi to catch Nandhini and bring her to him if Bhairavi is truly a Selli Amman's ubashini and a powerful yogini. He said this is a task for Bhairavi to prove that she is indeed Selli Amman's ubashini and a powerful yogini.\nBhairavi accepts the challenge and agrees to capture Nandhini. But she asks Nambothiri to swear upon his 'Manthira Sastra' (sacred Spiritual Scriptures of Nambothiri/ Bible of Magics) that he will give the Kalachakras to her after she give Nandhini to him. The 'Manthira Sastra' suddenly shows up in the hands of Bhairavi which shocks Namboothiri.\n\nNambothiri swears upon his 'Manthira Sastra' that he will handover the Three Kalachakras to Bhairavi after she brings Nandhini to him. Bhairavi leaves them saying she will come back with Nandhini. Vichu and Rajasekhar question Nambothiri on why did he make such promise to Bhairavi as they might lose the Kalachakras to her. Nambothiri says he has a valid reason on why he made such promise and that they will understand it when the time comes. \n\nIt is now the day time of Margazhi Pournami. Muniappan and Nandhini rests under a tree for a while after a long distance of walking. Muniappa asks Nandhini to be patient until night falls and then she can get her human form. Nandhini replies she will abide by Muniappa's words until she gets her human form. \n\nMeanwhile, Bhairavi arrives at Chellamma's (Her Master/Guru) house. Chellamma greets Bhairavi and is glad to meet her after a long time. Bhairavi asks Chellamma for a way to capture Nandhini but Chellamma refuses to tell. According to Chellama, Nandhini is also an element derives from Kaatu Amman's divine powers just like the Kalachakras and being a Selli Amman's ubashini, she can't betray Nandhini. She advises Bhairavi to stop this whole idea and change her mind. But Bhairavi is not listening to her advice and threatens her if she is not going to disclose the way to catch Nandhini, Bhairavi will kill herself by making her own head burst using the Kundalini chakra in her body. Bhairavi then sits down and brings up the Kundalini chakra to her head to make it burst but is stopped by Chellamma. \n\nChellamma said she will disclose the secret as she had no choice. Bhairavi stops and stands up. Chellamma said she do not know the direct way to catch Nandhini but she knows a person who can tell how to catch Nandhini. Bhairavi tells that the details are sufficient for her. Chellamma says the person is Nagavanchiyan who resides in Naga Kugai (Divine Snake Cave) and he is the only one who knows the way to catch Shakti Nagam(s). Bhairavi thanks Chellamma and leaves to meet Nagavanchiyan. Chellamma and one of her other disciple are worried and Chellamma asks forgiveness from Nandhini as she had betrayed her. \n\nBhairavi arrives at the Naga Kugai and demands the way to catch Nandhini. Nagavanchiyan refuses to tell as he learns that Bhairavi is an evil person and she will harm that poor snake. Bhairavi said to him that if he do not disclose the way to catch Nandhini, she will stand naked in front of him. Bhairavi knows sitthars like Nagavanchiyan respect women and would not want to see a nude woman. Bhairavi then starts to disrobe her saree but stopped by Nagavanchiyan. \n\nHe was forced by Bhairavi to tell her the way. Nagavanchiyan gives Bhairavi his magic flute and says if she plays this flute, the music produces by it will reach Nandhini and mesmerize her, bringing her to Bhairavi no matter where she is. Bhairavi leaves with the magic flute but before that Nagavanchiyan said that he had made a big blunder and he does not deserve to live anymore. He said the sin of him dying will belong to Bhairavi only, before taking a sharp wooden stick and pierces himself on his chest. Nagavanchiyan dies and Bhairavi leaves the place with a smile.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Rajasekhar's palace, Rajasekhar sees Arun is sleeping on the living room's sofa and tried to wake him up. But was taken back by the thoughts if he wakes him up, Arun might unnecessarily question Rajasekhar and just leaves him alone. After Rajasekhar leaves, Seetha comes and wakes Arun up. Seetha said that Arun should be strong and move on. Arun hears her preach angrily. Seetha added that it is he who has to be an example for Devasena but if he continues to be like this, Devasena will be sad and broken too. Arun then shouts at Seetha, \"Shut up! It is because of you Ganga left the house! If only I had not married you, if only I did not bring you to this house, Ganga would have stayed here along with me. \" \nSeetha goes away crying while Janaki's spirit is sad watching the argument by Arun. \n\nNight of Margazhi Pournami falls, Bhairavi arrives at the forest where Nandhini is estimated to be hiding. She plays the magic flute and the music coming from the flute lures Nandhini to Bhairavi's pathway. Muniappa tried to stop Nandhini but Nandhini just could not control herself. She was totally bounded by the magic sound played by the flute. Muniappa calls out to Parvathi, asking her for help. Parvathi appears and produces a very loud bell sound to counter-attack the flute sound. Nandhini can't hear the flute music anymore due to the extremely loud music of the bells' sound. Nandhini realizes herself and goes back to Muniappa immediately. \n\nParvathi breaks the magic flute in Bhairavi's hands and laughs. Bhairavi recognises the Sivanagam for the first time and says all the Three Kalachakras belong to her only. Parvati replies that in just few hours, Nandhini is going to get her human form and after that, Bhairavi, Vichu, Rajasekhar, and Nambothiri will not be alive anymore. Parvati laughs and vanishes into thin air. \n\nThe scene cuts and shows the scene whereby Nambothiri and his other disciples are doing the Vishwalingam Rudra Pooja to prevent Nandhini from getting her human form, hence make her a normal snake forever. There is a big Shivalinga statue situated in the middle of their pooja. Back in the forest, Muniappa and Nandhini say they should leave to a hill named Nagamalai, where the Snake Goddess resides. Inside the Nagamalai, there will be an optimum environment for Nandhini to take her human form easily under the lights of the full moon. But at a point of walking, Muniappa says he is very tired and asks Nandhini to continue to Nagamalai by herself. Nandhini agrees and continues her journey to Nagamalai by herself. Muniappa says he will wait for Nandhini at their usual meeting place. \n\nNambothiri on the other hand successfully completed the pooja and by the help of full moon's lights, the Shivalinga statue transforms into a cage full of thousands of mongooses. Nambothiri said these mongooses have been instilled in Nambothiri's special powers. Nambothriri opens the cage and demands the mongooses to kill Nandhini by tearing her into pieces. The mongooses run to Nandhini furiously and Nandhini runs as quickly as she can to save herself from the mongooses.\n\nNandhini runs from the mongooses but gets hurts by them in the way. The mongooses bite Nandhini's tail until she bleeds. But Nandhini did not give up and rushed to the Snake Goddess Temple. After she entered the temple, the mongooses are now unable to enter the temple's boundaries due to the temple's divinity. Inside the temple itself, there were a few sitthars shown chanting some mantras surrounding the Snake Goddess statue. A few fire homams were also seen, brightening up the temple. Nandhini then stands under the lights of the full moon to begin her transformation. After the lights has fully covered her body, she quickly hides behind the statue of Snake Goddess. \n\nNandhini then slowly takes the human form of a female body. In just few minutes, Nandhini transformed into a human completely. The female form that she took is of Ganga's form. Ganga's face and body is given to Nandhini by the Snake Goddess. There was a special orange-colored silk saree beside the statue which then worn by Nandhini. The sitthars worshipped Nandhini and poured flowers on her. Nandhini took a Trisoolam which was in front of the temple and dug into the fire homams. Then she took out the Trisoolam and aimed at the mongooses standing outside the temple. Fire blazes out from the Trisoolam and burns the mongooses. The burning mongooses runs to Nambothiri for help. \n\nNambothiri, Rajasekhar and Vichu on the other hand are happy that by now Nandhini would have been killed by the mongooses sent by Nambothiri. But as the burning mongooses arrive at Nambothiri, all of them are shocked. All the mongooses that have been sent by Nambothiri are now dead. Nambothiri learns that Nandhini already succeeded in transforming into human. All of them are extremely worried plus shocked. Nambothiri said he is helpless now and cannot do anything else to save them. Right now, the Three Kalachakras are the only ones that can save them from Nandhini. \n\nNambothiri asked Rajasekhar to give him one of the Kalachakras that he has to safeguard his life. Now all three of them must possess a Kalachakra each to safeguard their life from Nandhini otherwise even Nambothiri might get killed by Nandhini since Nandhini has now acquired mighty powers and became invincible. Rajasekhar then asked Nambothiri which form that Nandhini took and how will the human form of Nandhini look like. Nambothiri does not even know about Nandhini's human appearance and they must be extra careful if they see any new faced girl. (Nambothiri is unaware that Nandhini took Ganga's human form). They disperse immediately to their houses from the forest. \n\nThe next day morning, Nandhini arrives at Muniappa's house. Muniappa was praying to God that Nandhini should succeed in her human transformation. After seeing Nandhini, Muniappa asked her why she came to his place, thinking it is Ganga. Nandhini replied she is not Ganga but Nandhini. Muniappa said to Nandhini she looks exactly like Ganga. Then he brings her a mirror for Nandhini to look at herself. Nandhini was surprised to see herself as Ganga on the mirror. She feels very happy and proud to take Ganga's form as her human form because Ganga is a true devotee of Snake Goddess. Nandhini plans on how to avenge their enemies and retrieve those 3 Kalachakras. \n\nMeanwhile at Rajasekhar's palace, Devasena wakes up from sleep and begins to cry thinking about Ganga. It has been very long time since Ganga had gone and Devasena wants to see Ganga at once. She cries non stop and even Arun and Manju are unable to pacify her. Janaki's spirit is so devastated to see Devasena's current state. Janaki decides that she has no choice left but to do 'this'. She must do 'this' for Devasena's welfare. Janaki rushes to the outhouse to possess Seetha again. Seetha gets possessed by Janaki and the episode ends.\n\nAfter Janaki possessed Seetha, she calls the landline number of the palace using Seetha's phone and speaks to Devasena and Manju in Ganga's voice. She did this to avoid Devasena to yearn for Ganga. In Ganga's voice, Janaki residing in Seetha's body, says that she will come back home very soon and she needs to visit more temples. After visiting the temples, she will come back home. Janaki also said that she (Ganga) is not angry at anyone and she did not leave home sulking. Devasena is very happy after listening to Janaki's lies and is pacified. She starts to believe Ganga is the one who spoke to her. Janaki disconnects the phone and leaves Seetha's body. \n\nDevasena rushes to Arun and told her that Ganga had called and she will be back home soon. Arun is happy and tries to trace Ganga's location from the phone number that she called. When he dialled the number and traced the phone call location, he found out that it was called from Seetha's phone. Arun rushes to the outhouse to meet Seetha thinking Seetha is the one who called the palace number. Arun angrily asked Seetha that why she had did such a thing, and cheated Devasena. Seetha denies the act but Arun did not believe her. Arun gives warning to Seetha that she should not do such things and cheat Devasena. Seetha assumes that Arun is deliberately accusing her to chase her out from the house. Seetha then decides to go out from the house forever. \n\nMeanwhile, Nambothiri and Vichu arrive at Rajasekhar's palace. Three of them goes the secret room where the two Kalachakras is placed. Rajasekhar asks Nambothiri to take any one of the Kalachakras. Nambothiri changes his own form to another form of a man. Rajasekhar asked the reason. Nambothiri answered he only changed his appearance into another man's face but inside he still the same Nambothiri. The reason was to prevent Nandhini from killing him. According to him, Nandhini will first kill Nambothiri as he is the one who imprisoned her. To avoid Nandhini from identifying Nambothiri, he had to take this new form. Moreover, Nandhini won't able to recognize him in this new form. In addition, it is even easier for Nambothiri to find out Nandhini's human form by this. \n\nNambothiri took the Kalachakra of their late friend, Kumar's from Rajasekhar. All three of them leaves the place. Meanwhile, Seetha who plans to leave the house, goes to her cupboard to pack her things. But surprisingly, her clothes and bags are missing from the cupboard. She wonders who may have took it and goes to the palace to ask Lakshmi about it. Inside the palace, seeing Seetha's worried look, he asks her whether she is finding her belongings. Seetha asks him how did he knew about that and Rajasekhar said he is the one who took her things and put it inside Arun's room. He said Seetha should stay in Arun's room from now. Seetha disagrees. \n\nRajasekhar said that since Seetha and Arun are married, she might as well stay with Arun. Seetha said to Rajashekar that you are talking as if Ganga is not going to come back to palace anymore Rajasekhar just stands speechless. Seetha assures Rajasekhar that Ganga will definitely come back and her place is always the outhouse, not the palace. Seetha also adds that she is carrying the 'Thali' tied by Arun due to the respect she gives to the family and not because she wants to become Arun's wife. Seetha then goes to Arun's room to take back all her belongings. \n\nMeanwhile in Arun's room, Arun is crying in front of Janaki's photo. It is Devasena's birthday as well as Janaki's death anniversary. It has been seven years since Janaki had died. He cries thinking of Ganga and wants her to come back soon. Janaki's spirit watches Arun's cries and apologizes to Arun from distant. Even though, she knows the truth that Ganga had died, but she could not reveal it to Arun and Devasena. She does not have the courage to reveal Ganga's death news to her loved ones. But instead, Janaki plans to do something useful to make the family members happy by using Devasena's birthday occasion.\n\nArun wished happy birthday to Devasena and asked his aunts and uncles to purchase dresses for Devasena. Arun then leaves the house. Janaki again possessed Seetha in the outhouse and spoke to Devsena in Ganga's voice. Devasena was very happy and Janaki said that she (Ganga's voice) will be back soon. She also spoke to Manju told her to celebrate Devasena's birthday grandly without worrying about Ganga's whereabouts. Manju asks her to come back home soon as everyone is missing her. She told Janaki in the phone that she cried a lot thinking about Ganga. Devi who is listening besides Manju, thinks to herself that when did ever Manju cried. Devi wants to speak to Ganga also but the line got disconnected by Janaki. Devi sarcastically provoked Manju that she is deliberately preventing Devi from speaking to Ganga. Manju denies it. Janaki leaves Seetha's body. \n\nSeetha enters the palace and learns about the birthday celebration. The elders of the house, including Manju, Devi and Dharmaraj are leaving to a shopping mall to purchase dresses for Devasena and asks Seetha to look after Devasena. Seetha wants to do something special for Devasena as well. She recalls the incident whereby she received a beautiful saree from Arun and Ganga during the Sumangali pooja long time ago. She decides to gift Devasena something using the saree. \n\nMeanwhile, in Parvatipuram forest, Nandhini is doing some special pooja to Kaatu Amman. Nandini asked Kaatu Amman in her prayers, that why did she receive the form of Ganga instead of a new face. Kaattu Amman silently replies within herself that the answer to this question can be only given by Nandhini's mother, Parvati. Nandhini then realises from her prayers and swears in front of the blindfolded Kaatu Amman statue, that she will get that Nambothiri to untie the same fold which he tied to Kaatu Amman's eyes 20 years back. She said tomorrow itself she will make that Nambothiri come to the Kaatu Amman temple and untie the blindfold from the Goddess's eyes by his own hands. Nandhini leaves the temple to execute her promise to the Goddess. \n\nIn the mean time, Rajasekhar, the new faced Nambothiri and Vichu arrive at a forest called Thiruvallan Forest. Inside the Thiruvallan forest, Nambothiri's sister, Madhavi is conducting a special penance towards Lord Shiva for years in order to attain the position as a Shivaganam. Shivaganam is a position held by someone who has magnificent powers and invincibility which equals to Lord Shiva. Nambothiri finds Madhavi doing her penance in a snake mound surrounding her and chanting Lord Shiva's mantras. Nambothiri asks Madhavi for help to save them from Nandhini. He said he had lost all his powers during the Vishwalinga pooja the moment Nandhini burned all the mongooses sent by him. \n\nWhile chanting the mantras, Madhavi's shadow appeared and it is her shadow that will help Madhavi to speak for her while she is in the penance. The shadow said she can't oppose a divine power like Nandhini until Sivarathiri comes as it will affect her process in becoming a Shivaganam. After Sivarathiri, she can definitely destroy Nandhini as she will become a Shivaganam only after Sivarathiri. She asks three of them to be patient and wait until Sivarathiri. Till then, the Kalachakras will serve as life guardians for them and protect them like a barrier. All three of them believe in Madhavi and leave the forest. Madhavi thinks to herself that she will be rejoicing after she destroys Nandhini in a few days time.\n\nAll three of them go to Rajasekhar's car to get back to palace. Nambothiri then tells the other two that he needs to go back to Madhavi again and talk to her personally. He goes back to Madhavi and says he is guilty after seeing the snake mound surrounded Madhavi and he wants to gift her the Kalachakra that he possesses. Madhavi's shadow appears and says to Nambothiri that she is going to obtain more incredible powers than Kalachakra which is the position of Shivaganam. She does not need the Kalachakra at all and adds that Nambothiri is the one who needs the Kalachakra to protect his life from Nandhini. Nambothiri forces Madhavi to take it but unconditionally refused by Madhavi until Nambothiri gave up and left the place. \n\nNambothiri goes to Rajasekhar and Vichu and three of them start to get into their car, just then the wind starts to blow strongly. Bhairavi appears and demands the 3 Kalachakras again otherwise she will send three of them to jail using the video evidence she has. Nambothiri says Bhairavi already lost in their agreement due to the inability of Bhairavi to capture Nandhini on the Margazhi Pournamj night. He also said she had lost the right to possess the Kalachakras too after losing the agreement. Bhairavi denies and said Nandhini escaped because of Parvati. She challenges them again that she will find Nandhini again and kill her. Other three of them just laughs at her. Nambothiri said Nandhini has now taken human form and none of them knows in which form Nandhini is in. Bhairavi can't face Nandhini as Nandhini has now achieved invincible powers and became Maha Shakti Nagam. \n\nBhairavi says she will definitely succeed in killing Nandhini and will prove that she is a true ubashini and yogini of Selli Amman. Three of them laughs again and left the place with their car. Bhairavi wonders what they are doing in the Thiruvallan forest and decides to find the reason they came to the forest. After thorough searching, she found Madhavi. She touched Madhavi's snake mound but she got electrocuted and was thrown away from her. Bhairavi falls on the ground and shouts at Madhavi that she is going to face the consequences for this. Madhavi's shadow appears. Bhairavi asks her to stop chanting Lord Shiva mantras and start chanting Goddess Shakti mantras. The shadow said she will not chant any mantra other than of Lord Shiva's. Bhairavi gets angry and says she must chant Shakti's mantras instead of Shiva's mantras and gives her some time. She said she will go for a while and when she comes back Madhavi must chant Shakti mantras. Bhairavi leaves the place. \n\nMeanwhile, in the palace, Seetha stitches a special dress from the saree she got from Sumangali pooja. Then she puts the beautiful blue dress on Devasena. Seetha asked her to play while she is going to make milk payasam for her at the kitchen. Devasena goes to Rajasekhar's room to play. Devasena accidentally saw the main switch for the secret basement room where the Kalachakra is kept. She twists the switch and a door is opened. Devasena enters the door and goes down to the basement. The door closes behind her. She sees a Goddess statue and the Kalachakra too. Meanwhile, Manju, Devi, Dharmaraj, and Moorthy comes back to palace after purchasing dresses for Devasena. \n\nThey realize Devasena is missing and start to blame Seetha. Seetha said she is not aware of Devasena went missing as she was making milk payasam in the kitchen. They start to search the whole house for Devasena. Meanwhile, Arun arrives at the detective agency which he assigned a detective agent to investigate Rajasekhar's past. He managed to get the file which contains all the details collected by the late detective agent regarding Parvathi and Rajasekhar's past life. He takes the file and leaves to the palace after getting phone call from the palace that Devasena is missing. \n\nWhen Arun arrives at the palace, Devi plans to blame Seetha in front of Arun for Devasena's disappearance. Devi did exactly what she planned and Arun gets angry on Seetha. Now all of them starts to search for Devasena without knowing that Devasena is now trapped inside the secret basement room. At the basement, Devasena feels thirsty and dizzy and tried to open the door to get out from there but the door does not open. Devasena eventually faints in front of the statue. Janaki's spirit tries hard to find out Devasena's location by using her supernatural powers but fails due to the power of Kalachakra beside Devasena which is blocking Janaki's supernatural powers. Janaki is very worried now.\n\nMeanwhile, Rajasekhar, Vichu and Nambothiri are on their way to palace. Nambothiri said Madhavi's husband is killed by a snake a few years back. That is why she started to hate snakes and sworn to eliminate the whole snake species from the world. That brought her to this state. According to him, Madhavi assumed that because they killed Parvathi, the snake avenged Madhavi by killing her husband.\n\nBack in the palace, Devi decided to complain to the police and make the police come to the palace to investigate after Devasena is unable to be found. The family including Arun suspected Seetha and told police Seetha has something to do with Devasena’s disappearance. The police inspector interrogated Seetha but Seetha denied their accusation and explain her side of justice. She started to cry as the police kept forcing Seetha to tell the truth. Rajasekhar enters the palace and was told what had happened. Manju also added that in the morning Ganga had phone them and wished Devasena happy birthday. \n\nRajasekhar was shocked to hear this and wonders how can Ganga speak as she already died. He asked Manju whether Ganga did reveal her whereabouts. But apparently she did not reveal anything, says Manju. The shocked state of Rajasekhar upon hearing Ganga’s existence gave Arun suspicion. He is confused and suspects Rajasekhar again even more for Ganga’s disappearance. Rajasekhar quietly entered his room and thinks deeply on how this could have happened. \n\nMeanwhile, at the basement, Devasena regain consciousness but feels dizzy and thirsty. She moves her hand slightly at the same time saying “I’m thirsty and feeling dizzy! Help me someone, I need to go out!” As her hand touched the Kalachakra beside her, she was generated with new energy. Thirst and dizziness left from her, surprising Devasena. The door also opened. She thinks the Goddess statue is the one who helped her and thanked it. She finally gotten out from the room and rushed to Rajasekhar. She told Rajasekhar whatever she saw and happened. He, in turn, told Devasena that she should keep this matter as secret and lied to her as if the basement room should be kept as secret or else the Goddess statue will lose its powers, hence the family will be in trouble. Devasena agreed and promised to Rajasekhar under Janaki’s name that she will not reveal the secret to anyone. \n\nRajasekhar brought Devasena to the living room where other family members are. The police inspector stopped interrogating Seetha after he saw Devasena. Arun is pleased and relieved to see Devasena. Rajasekhar lies to them that Devasena was locked inside his bathroom all this while. The police scolded the family for unnecessarily blaming Seetha whilst the child is still inside the house. The police leaves and Seetha looks sadly at Arun. Arun feels guilty for making Seetha cry and blaming her. Seetha goes away from the incident even though Arun tried to stop her to pacify her but fails. \n\nMeanwhile, Rajasekhar phone calls Nambothiri and told him Ganga had called the palace and wished everyone to be happy. Nambothiri said it could not be Ganga because if it is really Ganga she will reveal the truth about them first to the family members, but she didn’t. He believes that it must be someone else who had impersonated as Ganga and spoke like her on the phone. He strongly believes this because the moment they started to kill Ganga, she already hated them to the core and swore that Nandhini will come to avenge them, In such a case, Ganga will first reveal the truth about their dirty act first instead of wishing happy birthday to Devasena. Rajasekhar still wants to meet Nambothiri at least to make him clear his mind. Nambothiri asks Rajasekhar to come to his house. \n\nAt Nambothiri’s house, he decides to clear his part of doubts too regarding Ganga. He required his deity, Goddess Ammey Bhagavathiyamma to help him resolve any mysteries related to Ganga’s death. Nambothiri rolls some magic dices to see Ganga’s existence. He does it repetitively and was shocked at the final result. The invisible pattern drew by the magic dices indicates that Ganga is still alive. Nambothiri checks Ganga’s horoscope to double confirm it again. But Ganga’s horoscope strongly shows that Ganga is already dead and no chance of being alive as her longevity in her horoscope is very weak. \n\nTo clear his confusion, Nambothiri decides to go to Ganga’s burial ground in Parvatipuram forest and dig it out for himself. Nambothiri arrives at the Parvatipuram forest and heads to Ganga’s burial ground with a hope to dig the ground. \n\nNambothiri starts to dig the ground where Ganga is buried. After he finishes digging, he found that Ganga’s dead body is not there anymore. He was shocked to see this and doubts whether Ganga is really alive. He then decides to return home and takes off with his car. As he was driving, a young woman cladd in a pink saree was walking in front of his car, blocking his path. He hones the woman but she keeps walking away. Finally, Nambothiri gets down from his car to ask the woman to move away. But then he suspects whether she is Ganga. He follows that woman and she stopped walking. As she turns to face Nambothiri, it turns out to be Ganga (actually it’s Nandhini). Nandhini lured him to kill him. \n\nAt first, Nandhini pretends to Nambothiri that she lost her memory and could not recall who is she. Nambothiri assumes that maybe Ganga was saved by someone but lost her memory due to heavy beatings to her head that day. Nambothiri feels relieved that Ganga does not remember anything from the past and told her (Nandhini) that she is Ganga and he knows her very well. Nandhini said she is very thirsty and hungry. Nambothiri brought Nandhini to his car to buy Nandhini some food. When they are at his car, Nambothiri saw the reflection of Nandhini, who was behind him, on the car’s glass window which showed a snake. After seeing the snake reflection, Nambothiri learns that that Ganga is actually Nandhini and confronts her. \n\nNandhini finally admits that she is Nandhini and she wanted to kill him. Nandhini changed to her snake form and tried to kill Nambothiri but she got blocked by a special band tied on his wrist. Nandhini changed back to human form and wonders why she can’t get near to Nambothiri. Nambothiri said the magic band that he has tied on his wrist is a Pathalamuni’s band. Since,\nNambothiri has lost all his powers at the Vishvalingam pooja and has chances of being easily attacked by Nandhini, he tied the Pathalamuni band to this wrist beforehand as a protective shield for him. Nambothiri said now Nandhini can’t do anything to him but he will destroy Nandhini using the power given to him by the magic band. Nandhini quickly thinks of a plan to escape from him. \n\nNandhini quickly runs back to a forest nearby and Nambothiri chases after her. Nandhini arrives at the middle of the forest and Nambothiri is still chasing her. There are a group of Indian army soldiers having their training in the middle of the forest. Nandhini then tore her blouse and saree to make her look like a molest victim. She ran to the soldiers and told them that Nambothiri is chasing after her to rape her. The soldiers saw Nambothiri coming to them and stopped him. Nambothiri said she is lying and she is dangerous if left alone. The soldiers fights with Nambothiri and the fight between them becomes intense. \n\nNandhini shouts to the soldiers in the middle of the fight to take off the magic band on Nambothiri’s wrist and throw it away, as if then only Nambothiri can be controlled. The soldiers snatched the magic band form his wrist and threw it away. Now, Nambothiri is powerless again. Nambothiri and Nandhini disappears from the place after this which surprises the soldiers but they continued their training afterwards. \n\nNambothiri managed to get into his car and go back to his house. On his way, he saw a letter box at a pavement beside the road. He thinks that maybe sooner or later he will surely get killed by Nandhini, so Rajasekhar and the others needs to know that Nandhini is now in Ganga’s form. Fearing he might die before telling others the truth, he wrote a letter to Rajasekhar stating that Nandhini has taken Ganga’s form to avenge them and asked him and Vichu to be careful with her. He stated Madhavi will protect them after him. He also stated that he had kept his Kalachakra in a secret place which no one knows. \n\nTo help Rajasekhar locate the Kalachakra that he kept, he writes a clue in the same letter. The clue is “ 4 Shadows” and below the words he drew four different figures adjoined together. First is mountain, second is a snake, third and fourth is like a curved end figure. These are the clues to the hidden location of the third Kalachakra that Nambothiri kept. He also wrote in the letter that Madhavi is the one who can resolve the clue and asked Rajasekhar to seek help form her. After finishing writing the letter, he wrote Rajasekhar’s palace address on the cover and posted it into the letterbox. \n\nNambothiri goes back to his house and planned to get himself another Pathalamuni band. In order to obtain that, he needs to shower first and conduct a special meditation. So he removed all his protective talismans and Rudhartcha chains from his neck and placed them on his table. This indicates that he is totally defenceless and can easily be victim to Nandhini. Soon after he removed the talismans, some girl’s shadow is seen to be loitering around Nambothiri’s house continuously, while laughing loudly. Nambothiri seem to be afraid but still embraced himself with courage. \n\nAt last, Nambothiri goes to the backyard of his house to take shower from the bathtub. While he is showering, Nandhini is watching him from the water inside the bathtub. After finishing shower, he takes a towel to rub his face. As he finished rubbing his body and face, he removed the towel from his face. To his astonishment, Nandhini is standing right in front of him. Nambothiri gave a shocked look.\n\nNambothiri pleads to Nandhini to let him go but Nandhini again says that she is Ganga and showed the stab wound on her stomach as proof (the site where Rajasekhar stabbed her). Nambothiri believes that she is Ganga and also said that Goddess Bhagavathiyamma’s dices did indicate Ganga is alive. Nandhini now claims that she remembers everything but has forgiven them for their wrongdoings. Nandhini said she wants to speak to Rajasekhar and asks Nambothiri to phone call him. Nambothiri believes Nandhini that she is indeed Ganga and brought her to the landline phone to make a call. \n\nThere is a mirror placed right beside the phone and again Nandhini’s snake reflection on the mirror is seen by Nambothiri and learns it is Nandhini and not Ganga. Nambothiri lies to Nandhini that he can’t get signal here and is going upstairs to make phone call. Nambothiri goes upstairs and straight away went to his pooja room. He took a small Trisoolam from his deity’s chamber and requested the Trisoolam to kill Nandhini. Nandhini started to know about this and made the Trisoolam to stab Nambothiri instead. The small Trisoolam stabbed Nambothiri at his back creating small wound. \n\nNambothiri shouts in pain and decides to take back the magic talismans which he removed from his neck previously to save him. When he went back downstairs to take his talismans and Rudratcha chains, Nandhini stopped him and transformed the talismans into snakes. Nambothiri becomes even more afraid and clueless about what to do. Finally he plans to take his Kalachakra which is the only weapon he has to protect his life from Nambothiri. But again Nandhini stopped him and threw him on the ground floor. Nandhini wants Nambothiri to go to Parvatipuram forest to untie the blindfold on Kaatu Amman’s eyes which he tied 20 years ago. \n\nNambothiri ran away from Nandhini but Nandhini chases after him until he reached Parvatipuram forest. Both of them are now in Parvatipuram forest, where Nambothiri is running away from Nandhini while Nandhini is chasing after him (to lead him to Kaatu Amman’s statue ). While running, Nandhini uses her power to change Nambothiri back to his old form again. Now Nambothiri changes back to his old form. Nandhini wants him to get punished by Kaatu Amman in the same form he tied the Goddess’s eyes 20 years ago. \n\nNambothiri shouts Madhavi’s name for help but in vain because Madhavi is only concentrating in her intense penance and doesn’t seem to care about the occurrences of her surroundings. Nambothiri finally arrives in front of Kaatu Amman’s temple and pleads to Nandhini to let him go. Nandhini said he need to get punished by Kaatu Amman herself for all his sins he had committed. Flashback scenes of 20 years ago is shown including the scenes of Rajasekhar’s gang killing Parvati and burning her alive. Scenes of Nambothiri tying Kaatu Amman’s eyes with leaves and Rudratcha chain, and scenes of Parvathi making promise to Nandhini to get all the 3 Kalachakras before she died, are shown in the episode. \n\nAt the last scene of the episode, Nandhini says to Nambothiri that the time for him to face God (his punishment) and the time for Kaatu Amman to open her eyes had finally arrived.\n\nNambothiri is now totally helpless and does not have even slight chance to escape from Nandhini. Nandhini asks Nambothiri to untie the fold on the Goddess’s eyes. Nambothiri untied the blindfold and Kaatu Amman is back to her eyesight again. Nandhini asks Kaatu Amman to punish him. Nambothiri pleads to Kaatu Amman to let him go but then Nandhini recalls back an incident many years ago. The incident where Parvathi controlled Kaatu Amman’s anger and demanded her to preserve patience (Shanta Swaroopani) all the times and never get angry or punish humans. So Kaatu Amman just kept silent and did nothing to Nambothiri. \n\nNandhini knows that Kaatu Amman won’t do anything to Nambothiri so she decides to kill him herself. As Nambothiri pleads to Kaatu Amman to let him go, a heavy rain pours. Nandhini laughed and said this rain brings the meaning Kaatu Amman did not forgive Nambothiri and wants him to be punished. Nambothiri runs and takes a big Soolam in-front of Kaatu Amman and tried to stab Nandhini but Nandhini smartly moved away from his attack. And the Soolam accidentally stabbed Kaatu Amman. \n\nSuddenly a thunder hit on Nambothiri’s eyes and he went blind. Nambothiri cries that he went blind and could not see while trying to walk away from Nandhini. Nandhini creates a quicksand in front of the walking Nambothiri and Nambothiri stepped on the quicksand. \n\nThe quicksand immediately drowned the whole body of Nambothiri and tightened his body, leaving only his head on the surface. Nandhini explained to him that this sand is the same sand from the snake mound which Nandhini was imprisoned in by Nambothiri. He must drown and die in the sand of the snake mound which he created to torture Nandhini for 20 years, she added. \n\nThe quicksand tightened Nambothiri’s body really hard until his nerves and blood vessels began to burst. Nambothiri cried out for Parvathi’s name now for help. Nandhini said her mother Parvathi won’t come unless he calls her name 108 times. But before Nambothiri could utter Parvathi’s name 108 times, his vocal chords were tightened also and blood started to ooze out from his mouth. \n\nFinally, Nambothiri died after his entire blood vessels and nerves inside his body burst out. His head also drowned in the quicksand and now Nambothiri is completely drowned and died. Nandhini laughs and happily said to Kaatu Amman that she had killed their first enemy. She said she will get Nambothiri’s Kalachakra next. \n\nNandhini goes to Nambothiri’s house to search for the Kalachakra but could not be found. She searches the pooja room first but she could not find it. Rajasekhar also enters Nambothiri’s house and looks for him. But Nandhini is unaware of Rajasekhar’s arrival and is busy searching. She entered Nambothiri’s bedroom and closed the door behind her. Rajasekhar then comes to pooja room to find Nambothiri but in vain. He confirms that Nambothiri is not in the house after searching some places and starts to leave the house. \n\nMeanwhile Nandhini is searching for the Kalachakra inside Nambothiri’s bedroom by messing up the place but she could not find it anywhere. Rajasekhar leaves the house and Nandhini saw him leaving the house. Nandhini follows him behind his car to kill him too but stopped by Muniappan. Muniappan said Nandhini should first locate the 3 Kalachakras first before killing Rajasekhar and killing him will make it even difficult to find the Kalachakra that he kept. Muniappa also said within 3 Full Moon Days, Nandhini must produce all the 3 Kalachakras before Kaattu Amman otherwise she will lose her powers slowly and the status of Maha Shakti Nagam.\n\nNandhini told Muniappa that she tried to find Nambothiri's Kalachakra but it is not in his house. Muniappa says the Kalachakra must be kept in Rajasekhar's house also and ask Nandhini to go to his palace as Ganga. He asked her to impersonate as Ganga to enter the palace and find the Kalachakras. Nandhini agreed. \n\nMeanwhile back in the palace, Seetha is heartbroken due to Arun's behavior towards her. Janaki's spirit appears before her to console her. Seetha said after all the embarrassment and humiliation she faced because of Arun in the house, she should have left the house. But only because of Ganga she is staying in the house as a sign of gratitude. Janaki thought to herself, that she knows Ganga is dead and will never come back. If she tell the truth to Seetha, then Seetha will definitely leave the house. If Seetha leaves the house, Devasena will suffer without a mother to take care of her. As a loving person for Devasena and Seetha, Janaki made Seetha promise that she will never leave the house before Ganga comes to the house. \n\nMeanwhile in Thiruvallan forest, Bhairavi arrives again to Madhavi's penance place. Bhairavi noticed Madhavi is still chanting Lord Shiva's mantras and gets angry. She tries to abort Madhavi's penance by creating strong hurricanes and heavy rain but failed. None of them nullified Madhavi's penance. Bhairavi got even more enraged.\n\nBhairavi tried to attack her again with earthquake and giant fire ball but failed again. None of her powers affected Madhavi’s penance. At last, Madhavi’s shadow appeared and said all the 5 elements (Fire, Earth, Water, Wind, Sky) are under her mantra’s control and Bhairavi can do nothing to destroy her. Madhavi demanded Bhairavi to leave the place, but Bhairavi was adamant on aborting her penance which caused Madhavi to take away all the powers possessed by Bhairavi. Bhairavi is now totally powerless and only a normal human being. She is no longer a yogini and Selli Amman’s ubashini. Madhavi said this is her punishment for trying to abort her penance. \n\nBhairavi left Thiruvallan forest and searched for her mentor, Chellamma at her place. Chellamma said it is her karma for all the sins she had committed which includes trying to capture Nandhini and forced Nagavanchiyan to kill himself. Nagavanchiyan’s pet snakes are still crying for him and it is their wrath which made Bhairavi powerless, according to Chellamma. Bhairavi apologised to her and asked Chellamma to make her a yogini again by giving her ‘deeksha’. Chellamma refused to give her ‘deeksha’ and said Bhairavi has lost the rights to become a Selli Amman’s ubashini. Chellamma left her alone while Bhairavi leaves with a disappointing face. \n\nMeanwhile, back in the palace, Arun looks through the file which he obtained from detective agency, which was prepared by the late detective agent, Ravi. He finds out some truth from the file. He comes to know that 20 years ago, Rajasekhar and his gang went to Parvatipuram and visited Parvathi and Muniappa’s family at Muniappa’s house. Also he found out that Rajasekhar complained to a forest officer and asked him to inspect Muniappa’s house saying there’s a snake (baby Nandhini) in their house. The very next day, all of the family members died (Parvathi and Muniappa’s wife only) but somehow their little daughter, Gayathri escaped from the tragedy. According to the villagers, they died due to snake bite but in the file Ravi wrote Rajasekhar has a strong connection with Parvathi’s death. \n\nArun begins to connect all the clues that he got and finally concluded that Rajasekhar must have did something bad to the family and has taken something which belongs to Kaatu Amman’s temple. So that is why Ganga went to the temple to return whatever thing which Rajasekhar took. Arun suspects if that’s the case then Rajasekhar and Ganga must have been in the Parvatipuram forest together. He called his friend to trace the phone call log history of Rajasekhar and Ganga on the same day where Ganga went to the temple. His friend met Arun and gave him the phone call log history list. To his astonishment, he found out that Ganga had called Rajasekhar first then Rajasekhar arrived at Parvatipuram forest to meet Ganga. \n\nAnother shocking information to Arun is that Rajasekhar’s location when he called Arun saying he had cardiac arrest was Parvatipuram forest. Now Arun is convinced that Rajasekhar lied to him about the cardiac arrest, only to make him get out from the forest and prevent him from seeing Ganga. Arun got very angry and confronted Rajasekhar himself. He asked what Rajasekhar did to Ganga. Rajasekhar lied that he don’t know anything. But Arun showed him the phone call log history list as his evidence and proved Rajasekhar is lying. Arun said if Rajasekhar does not spit out the truth, he will make a police complaint against Rajasekhar and arrest him.\n\nRajasekhar lied to Arun that he is the one who sent Ganga to Parvatipuram forest to do an atonement pooja for Kaatu Amman using the excuse of the disappearance of Devasena during the Grahana Ammayasya Day (solar eclipse full moon day). He said to Arun that he did not told Arun about it and made him to leave the forest because he was afraid that Arun will not agree to it and spoil the atonement pooja. \n\nRajasekhar claims that he did asked Ganga to come back after the pooja, but Ganga said she will go to Kasi (Hindu pilgrimage) first to be at peace after knowing Arun cheated her by marrying Seetha. Arun feels guilty but still unable to believe Rajasekhar's story. Arun demanded Rajasekhar to bring Ganga back to the house himself if what he narrated all is true. Otherwise, he will lodge a police complaint against Rajasekhar. Rajasekhar is confused on what to do next and calls Nambothiri to seek help from him but his phone is always switched off. Nambothiri has been killed by Nandhini and Rajasekhar is still unaware about this. He calls Vichu to ask him if whether Nambothiri has other contact numbers, but apparently Nambothiri has only one contactable phone number. \n\nSince Rajasekhar is in an emergency situation, and unable to seek help from Nambothiri, he decides to seek help from Bhairavi instead. He took his Kalachakra to Bhairavi (called her personally to meet up) and requested her to use her shapeshifting power to help him. Rajasekhar asks Bhairavi to shapeshift into Ganga's form and enter the palace as Ganga to make Arun believe her as real Ganga. Bhairavi agrees but with the condition he needs to handover all the 3 Kalachakras to her. Otherwise, she will give the video record of Rajasekhar murdering Ganga to the police. Rajasekhar agrees and Bhairavi asks Rajasekhar for the Kalachakra that he brought so that she can shapeshift successfully with the help of Kalachakra's powers. \n\nRajasekhar handed over the Kalachakra to Bhairavi. Bhairavi on the other hand uses this opportunity to regain back all her lost powers through the Kalachakra. As per her plan, she regains back all her lost powers and changed her form into Ganga's appearance. Rajasekhar took back the Kalachakra saying he will give back all 3 Kalachakras to Bhairavi after she completes impersonating as Ganga. Bhairavi made Rajasekhar to swear upon Arun's name so that he will not cheat Bhairavi by breaking his promise. Rajasekhar swears. Bhairavi told Rajasekhar that now he swore upon Arun's name, he has no choice but to give her the Kalachakras. \n\nRajasekhar assured Bhairavi that he will certainly keep up his promise. Meanwhile, Muniappa is eavesdropping their conversation from distant. He learns that Rajasekhar is going to make Bhairavi to impersonate as Ganga which is going to interfere in Nandhin's plan to enter the palace as well. He is about to warn Nandhini regarding this matter. \n\nIn the mean time, Nandhini calls the palace and says she is Ganga and will come home soon. Leela picks up the phone and is excited to hear about her. She gave the receiver to Arun for him to speak. Initially, Arun thought it is Seetha again who is speaking as Ganga, but later he sees Seetha in the living room of the house and got shocked. He then assumes that it is the real Ganga who is speaking to him on the phone and apologises to her. Arun requested her to forgive him for concealing the truth of him married Seetha. Nandhini is clueless and does not understand what Arun is talking about. Arun asked her to come home right away and misses her badly.\n\nNandhini disconnects the call. Leela consoles Arun and tells him to be cheerful as Ganga is coming home soon. Seetha thinks to herself that now Ganga is going to come back home, and it is the time for her to leave the house. While Janaki wonders who had called in the name of Ganga since the real Ganga is already dead. Devasena all set for school, comes to Arun and Arun tells her that Ganga will be back home soon. Devasena said she will attend school first otherwise Ganga will scold her for playing truant. Rajasekhar on the hand feels contented and misinterprets that Bhairavi is the one who called as Ganga as per their plan. He asked Arun to at least realize the truth now and that Rajasekhar is innocent. \n\nArun asked forgiveness from his father and both of them reconcile again. Meanwhile, Nandhini feels guilty for using Ganga's name under pretext of obtaining Kalachakras. Muniappa advised her not to feel guilty and the atrocities done to Kaatu Amman and Parvathi are even bigger. He also tells him about Bhairavi's plan to enter the palace as Ganga for the Kalachakras. Bhairavi (in Ganga's form) is picked up by Rajasekhar's driver and the car broke down in the way. The driver went off to get a mechanic. \n\nAfter he went, Nandhini enters the car and sits beside Bhairavi. Nandhini revealed herself as the Nagakanni Nandhini and has taken Ganga's female form. Bhairavi also reveals her true form and mocks Nandhini for getting trapped by her. Nandhini wants Bhairavi to forget the idea of possessing Kalachakras and also she should not enter the palace. It is because Nandhini is going to enter the palace as Ganga to obtain the Kalachakras. Bhairavi refuses to listen and said she will go to the palace and disguise as Ganga, only then Rajasekhar will give the Kalachakras to her willingly. \n\nNandhini made the car to drive on its own with extreme high speed to scare Bhairavi. Bhairavi shouts at Nandhini to stop the car. The car arrives at a beach and swirls around with high speed. Bhairavi inside the car couldn't bear the speed and asked Nandhini to stop. During this incident, Ganga's phone slipped away from Bhairavi's hands and fell on the car's floor. Bhairavi did not notice this. In the mean time, Arun managed to find Ganga's location by tracking her phone's location through his friend again. He drives the car to the beach area where Ganga's phone is (inside the car), as informed by his friend. \n\nOutside the car, Bhairavi and Nandhini start to fight. Bhairavi is adamant on possessing the Kalachakras and asks Nandhini, who is she to stop her from obtaining them. Nandhini said the Kalachakras belong to her only.\n\nNandhini changes into her giant snake form to attack Bhairavi but Bhairavi trapped her instead within her magic barrier. But Kaatu Amman saved Nandhini from Bhairavi's barrier. Nandhini tried to kill Bhairavi but was stopped by Muniappa who came running towards them. Muniappa said Bhairavi is Yogini element of Kaatu Amman alias Selli Amman, while Nandhini is Nagakanni element of Selli Amman. Bhairavi is also a part of Kaatu Amman's powers and all of them belong to the same class, so Nandhini should refrain from killing Bhairavi. \n\nNandhini then leaves Bhairavi but instead, traps Bhairavi with her magic threads. Bhairavi is now trapped in magic threads of Nandhini and under Muniappa's supervision. Nandhini drives the car to the previous spot where the car stopped in the first place. While she was driving away from the beach, Bhairavi shouts at her to release her from the magic threads, but Nandhini turns deaf on it. As Nandhini arrived at the spot, Arun's car coincidentally arrived at the same place too. Arun saw Nandhini as Ganga and begged her for forgiveness. He told her to give him any punishment and he will accept it. Nandhini said Arun should take her to the palace.\n\nArun happily brings Nandhini to the palace where all the family members and relatives of the palace was eagerly waiting for Ganga's arrival. Rajasekhar particularly waiting for Bhairavi's arrival. Ganga's father, Manickam was present too. When Arun and Nandhini arrived at the palace, they were warmly welcomed by them, especially Devasena who was very happy to see Ganga after a long time. Rajasekhar assuming that she is Bhairavi, welcomes her too. Nandhini enters the palace with the determination of getting the Kalachakras.\n\nManickam apologises to Arun for mistaking him and abusing him regarding Ganga’s disappearance previously. Arun said he didn’t take it to heart and they reconcile again. Seetha decides to go away from the house since Ganga has already came. She writes a “goodbye letter” and puts it on the table in the outhouse. Seetha then takes her belongings and leaves the house. Inside the house Nandhini sees Janaki’s spirit and thinks to herself that Janaki can never identify Nandhini’s true self but she knows that she is indeed Janaki’s spirit. It is because Janaki’s supernatural powers are weak compared to Nandhini’s divine powers. \n\nRajasekhar thanked Nandhini thinking her as Bhairavi for making everyone believe that she is Ganga. Rajasekhar then continues to tell his plan. He asks Bhairavi (Nandhini) to intentionally fight with Arun and make Arun to chase her out of the house by himself. Then only others will believe that Ganga left the house forever sulking and the fact that Rajasekhar murdered Ganga will be forever unknown. After Bhairavi succeeds to execute his plan, he will give all the Kalachakras to Bhairavi. Nandhini thinks to herself that she knows how to get the Kalachakras on her own and she does not need Rajasekhar’s alms. Nandhini verbally agreed to his plan but doesn’t want to do it actually. \n\nOn the other side, Janaki is trying to figure out who is the person who came to the house impersonating as Ganga. Rajasekhar killed Ganga and she is dead, so this new person could never be Ganga at all. Meanwhile, all the family members including Nandhini are gathered at the living room, chatting happily. Except for the two faced, Dharmaraj, Moorthy and Devi of course. Arun goes to his room to freshen up while Manikcam goes to the outhouse to look for Seetha. At the outhouse, he finds out Seetha’s goodbye letter and realises she left the house. \n\nManickam decides to conceal the truth of Seetha left the house because according to him Ganga’s life is now free of troubles and hindrances after Seetha’s departure. If the family members knows about this, they will start finding Seetha again, troubling all of them. He teared apart the letter and threw it into rubbish. Manickam goes back to the palace to join in the crowd. \n\nMeanwhile, at Muniappan’s house, Bhairavi is seen lying on the bed, trying to escape from the clutches of the magic thread, which have surrounded her body. Muniappan said she can never be released from the thread unless Nandhini herself removes it. He asked Bhairavi to be patient and wait until Nandhini comes back to release her, after finishing avenge their enemies and obtain the Kalachakras. \nBhairavi keeps on saying she will use her powers to break free from the magic thread. Muniappa said it is impossible and goes into kitchen to prepare food for Bhairavi. \n\nBack in the palace, Leela and Maya asks Nandhini on how was the temple tour and the experience. Nandhini didn’t know anything about it and managed them by saying she needs some time to relax first, hence will reply them after some time. To create ruckus in the family, Devi starts to provoke the people in the house. Devi says Manickam should feel sorry for accusing Arun for making Ganga to leave the house. Then Devasena intervenes by saying to Nandhini, that Seetha should remain in the house and Ganga should agree to it. \n\nNandhini didn’t understand what Devasena is talking about. She asked them who is Seetha. Everyone is shocked to hear the question. Devi pretends to support Ganga by telling it is fair for Ganga to ask such question, after the betrayal Seetha had done to Ganga by marrying Arun. Nandhini now learns that Arun had married a girl named Seetha before this. She feels pity for Ganga’s unfortunate life and the betrayal Ganga had endured. Rajasekhar seeing all this, asks Devi to keep quiet (worried that Bhairavi might be exposed if further questions are imposed to her). \n\nJanaki confirms the person who had came as Ganga is definitely not Ganga, but a stranger. She wants to find out who is this person and considers her (Nandhini) as a threat to the family. Janaki wants to separate Devasena from the newcomer to protect her child, as she can get into danger any time. While Devasena goes to the outhouse to invite Seetha to the palace (unknowing that Seetha had already left the house). Nandhini is eager to meet Seetha whom Arun had married by betraying Ganga.\n\nDevasena discovers Seetha is not inside the outhouse and runs back to Nandhini saying, Seetha is not in and maybe she went out for shopping. Rajasekhar doubts whether Seetha left the house forever assuming Ganga had came back. Janaki learns Seetha had left the house and feels that Seetha made a mistake in a hurry by leaving the house unnecessarily. Nandhini and Devasena goes back to their room and the crowd disperses. \n\nRajasekhar secretly met Nandhini. Assuming her as Bhairavi, he asked her to start argument with Arun as soon as possible and make Arun to chase her out. Nandhini just agreed to whatever Rajasekhar was saying. Night sky falls, Nandhini and Devasena is inside Arun's room. Nandhini asks Devasena what happened in the house in absence of her (Ganga). At a point of time, Devasena revealed to Nandhini that she got trapped in a secret place (Kalachakra's basement room) during her birthday but Rajasekhar asked her to keep the matter as secret. Nandhini found out that the secret place is none other than the place where Rajasekhar had kept his Kalachakra. \n\nNandhini asked Devasena where is the secret place but before Devasena could answer, Arun entered the room and asked Devasena to sleep with Seetha in outhouse. Devasena left to be with Seetha. Arun tries to make a romantic move with Nandhini and Nandhini feels it is sometimes difficult to act as Ganga. Next time, whenever Arun tries to get near to Nandhini, Nandhini decides to use the Arun - Seetha marriage as an excuse to stay away from him. Arun explains to Nandhini that soon Seetha will be sent off to London and flight tickets has been booked. \n\nDevasena comes back to the room saying Seetha is not at the outhouse and sleeps with them. After a few hours, Nandhini wakes up to see the snake mound outside the palace. She seems to be missing the snake mound a lot and considers it as her womb. Arun wakes up and finds Ganga is not around and begins to search for her. He saw Nandhini standing infront of the snake mound and asks her to go back to bed. He holds her hand but is taken back by Nandhini indicating she doesn't like Arun touching her hands. \n\nThe next day morning, Devasena is preparing to go to school and sees Janaki. She hugs her mother. Janaki said to Devasena that she is doubtful with the person who came as Ganga and asked Devasena to test the newcomer whether she is really Ganga. Devasena gets angry with Janaki for unnecessarily suspecting Ganga and goes to school. Janaki is now sad and clueless on what to do next. \n\nMeanwhile, at Vichu’s company, he is interviewing his candidates for his company’s job position. A lady comes to attend the interview held by Vichu and enters his office room. The lady says that her name is Nandhini. It seems the lady is actually Nandhini who came to seek revenge on Vichu. Vichu is shocked to see the lady transforming into a snake in front of him.\n\nBut it was all Vichu’s imagination after all. He immediately chased away all the ladies who came to interview and told his manager to only appoint male staffs. Vichu remembered Nambothiri’s words to be extra careful with any new females they encounter. He quickly drives off to Rajasekhar’s palace. \n\nMeanwhile Manickam met Seiyanayagi at her place and thanked her for Ganga’s arrival. Seiyanayagi already knew that it is Nandhini who is the one impersonating as Ganga but hides the truth from Manickam. According to her, she had stopped worshiping Karuppusamy due to her failure to protect Ganga when she was in danger. She said she is unable to face Karuppan due to her failed task, nevertheless her powers given by Karuppan will still be retained in her body. Manickam invites Seiyanayagi to their palace and Seiyanayagi replies she will come at the right time. \n\nBack in the palace, everyone is gathered at Devi’s room because Devi’s husband, Eshwar fell sick due to food poisoning. Rajasekhar tried to call doctor but doctor seems to be busy. Nandhini said she will try to check Eshwar’s fever. Once Nandhini’s hands touched Eshwar’s forehead, Eshwar’s sickness was cured immediately. Everyone was surprised including Nandhini herself. But others assumed that Nandhini got this positive energy as a result from her temple tour. But in reality Nandhini naturally possesses healing power inherited from her mother, Parvathi. Rajasekhar again silently warns Nandhini to not to do such things again. \n\nVichu comes to the palace and sees Nandhini. Thinking her as Ganga, he runs to Rajasekhar’s bedroom and told him about it. Rajasekhar convinced him by saying it is actually Bhairavi who is in the disguise of Ganga. He made this arrangement to make Arun to believe him and escape from police. Vichu was relieved and explained that he is now afraid of Nandhini as they don’t know her human form. Vichu wants to stay at Rajasekhar’s palace for the time being for his safety. \n\nSince Nambothiri is not available at the moment to help them, both of them plans to catch Muniappan as they know Muniappan would definitely aware of Nandhini’s human form. According to Rajasekhar and Vichu, if they managed to catch Muniappan, they can get the details about Nandhini’s whereabouts. In the mean times, Seiyanayagi arrives at the palace and meets the family members. All the family members including Rajasekhar and Vichu greet her and seek blessings from her. \n\nManju called out for Ganga (Nandhini) to seek blessings from Seiyanayagi too. Seiyanayagi is already aware that she is Nandhini. Nandhini comes to them and greets Seiyanayagi. Dharmaraj asks Nandhini to seek blessings from her as well but Nandhini doesn’t want to. Seiyanayagi said, “I know why Nandhini doesn’t want to do it. It is because she is not Ganga at all.”\n\nEveryone was shocked by hearing this. But Seiyanayagi managed the situation by saying, “Ganga is not the cheerful and positive girl as before. She is now a new girl with grief and depression”. Seiyanayagi asked permission from Rajasekhar to talk privately with Nandhini. Both Seiyanayagi and Nandhini goes to the outhouse to talk. \n\nSeiyanayagi told Nandhini to stop her disguise and knows that she is Nandhini. She asked Nandhini to stop seeking revenge and hurting Ganga’s family. She also emphasised the divine purpose of Ganga’s form given to Nandhini. It is none other than to serve Kaatu Amman and do good deeds only, instead of seeking revenge and murdering people. Seiyanayagi added, it is already enough number of people killed by Nandhini (Eshwar Tambooran, Kumar, Chamundi & Nambothiri). Nandhini refused to listen, and said it is her lifetime goal and responsibility to avenge their enemies for their sins. \n\nSeiyanayagi confronts her by saying it is God’s decision to give punishment for them and it is not Nandhini’s business. Nandhini said she intends to seek vengeance on behalf of Ganga as well for Rajasekhar’s heinous crimes. It was Ganga’s last wish before she died . Seiyanayagi exclaimed, that Ganga is still alive and will definitely come back. Before she left, her last words, “ Ganga will come back. You will know the reason why you have got Ganga’s form as your human form from your mother, Parvathi” kept disturbing Nandhini’s mind. \n\nRajasekhar confirmed with Nandhini that Seiyanayagi is unaware that she is Bhairavi or else things will get worse. Nandhini gave favourable answer to him to shut his mouth. At the dining hall, Arun tries to impress Nandhini thinking her as Ganga, by showing all his love and concern towards her. Nandhini just ignores him. After seeing all this, Rajasekhar told Nandhini (assuming as Bhairavi) to be patient and endure Arun’s attitude for the time being. He requested her to never reveal herself as Bhairavi to Arun, if she gets angry at any situation. \n\nMeanwhile, Janaki’s spirit met Devasena outside Arun’s bedroom and said that she is still doubtful with the newcomer (Nandhini). Janaki asked Devasena to test her whether she is really Ganga or an imposter. Devasena agreed at last but this time, Janaki asked Devasena to unite Arun with Ganga. According to Janaki’s plan, if the newcomer is really an imposter, she wouldn’t want to be with Arun. Devasena tried some mischievous ways to unite Ganga (Nandhini) with Arun. Obviously Arun liked it, but not Nandhini. Nandhini tries to escape from the situation and thinks of a way to exit the room.\n\nNandhini managed to escape from the situation. Night sky falls, Nandhini goes to Vichu's room to take his Kalachakra from him. Vichu kept the Kalachakra under his pillow. Nandhini made Vichu to fall in a deep sleep using her magic powers. She searched the whole room but after she couldn't find the Kalachakra, she decided to find it under Vichu's pillow. The Kalachakra slides into the other side of the bed when she lifted up the pillow, hence Nandhini could not see it. Just then, the Kalachakra made Vichu to wake up and save him from Nandhini. \n\nWhen Vichu woke up, Nandhini transformed into a snake form and attacked him. (Vichu did not saw her human form). Vichu shouted loud in fear which made the whole family members came to his room. Rajasekhar said he will take care of Vichu and asked others to go back to sleep. Inside the room, Vichu said Nandhini is still in snake form and have not attained human form. Rajasekhar said to Vichu, it is just a normal snake not Nandhini. After Rajasekhar left, Vichu still strongly believes it was Nandhini and she is still in snake form. In the mean time, Nandhini plans to attempt again next time. \n\nThe next day morning, Vichu meets Rajasekhar again and told him he indeed saw Nandhini and it was her snake form, but Rajasekhar still refuses to beileve him. Meanwhile, Nandhini arrives at the snake mound seeing it is all cleaned up and well decorated with flowers. Arun came to her and said he is the one who did all this for Ganga's sake. Nandhini continues to do pooja for the snake mound after Arun left. \n\nMuniappa silently watches Nandhini and shows up infront of her. Nandhini is shocked to see Muniappa and asked him to go away. Nandhini is worried that Rajasekhar might spot Muniappa. Vichu saw Muniappa talking to Nandhini and showed to Rajasekhar to catch him. Rajasekhar sees both of them talking and are about to catch Muniappan.\n\nRajasekhar and Vichu gets down to the snake mound to catch Muniappan. Muniappan escapes from them. Rajasekhar asked Nandhini whatever things Muniappan had said to her. Nandhini uses Rajasekhar’s assumption of her as Bhairavi as a bait to trick him, by saying she was about to ask Muniappan regarding Nandhini’s whereabouts but both of you spoiled it. Rajasekhar apologises to Nandhini and pleads to help them. Nandhini then falsely regards her as Bhairavi, asks them to come to a special place to do special pooja to trap Nandhini. Vichu and Rajasekhar believed her lies and prepares for the pooja. \n\nMeanwhile, Devasena coming back from school asks other family members to unite Ganga (Nandhini) and Arun. Dharmaraj gives an idea to Arun to make Ganga fall for him again. Arun goes to Ganga’s room and tries Dharmaraj’s idea. The idea is, Arun should hold Ganga’s hip and hug her from behind, so that Ganga will be smitten by him. Arun fantasises for a while, imagining Ganga kissing and hugging him. But afterwards he realises it was just an imagination. \n\nArun, in reality, approaches Ganga (Nandhini) and tries to hug her from behind. Nandhini turned back quickly, disallowing Arun to touch her. Arun managed the situation by saying he was just going to help her tidy up the bed. Nandhini angrily said she will do it by herself. Arun left her alone knowing she is still angry. \n\nSun is about to set, Nandhini is conducting a pooja as Bhairavi to trap Vichu and Rajasekhar to kill them. But Rajasekhar arrives by wearing “Ayyappa’s garland”. He said Seiyanayagi is the one who gave Rajasekhar the idea to wear “Ayyappan Garland” to prevent Arun from getting near to Bhairavi (Nandhini). Nandhini learns Seiyanayagi deliberately did this to prevent her from killing Rajasekhar. Nandhini thought at least she can kill Vichu but he went off with Rajasekhar. Nandhini’s plan to kill them fails. \n\nBack in the palace, Rajasekhar conducts a special Ayyappan pooja and invites some of the Ayyapan’s devotee of Sabarimala to the palace. They began to chant Ayyappan’s holy mantra, which caused Janaki’s spirit to be expelled from the house. Nandhini plans to make Rajasekhar remove his garland so that she can kill him. She plans to kill a family member from the house, so that Rajasekhar will have to remove the garland if a death occurs at the house. \n\nDevasena comes to Nandhini to talk to her. Initially, Nandhini plans to kill Devasena but later she refrained from it, because previously Parvathi had saved her once. Devasena pleads to Nandhini to talk to Arun and unite with him again. Nandhini recalls the incident where Devasena spilled out the beans regarding the secret basement room, in which she got trapped during her birthday. Nandhini said to Devasena, that she will talk to Arun again but Devasena has to take her to the secret place.\n\nDevasena brings Nandhini to the secret place but Vichu saw both of them entering the basement room. He quickly went to tell Rajasekhar about it. Inside the secret room, there Kalachakra was no more. Disappointed, Nandhini and Devasena went up to Rajasekhar's room. Rajasekhar and Vichu arrives at the room and discovers them. Devasena left the room while Vichu and Rajasekhar interrogated Nandhini. \n\nRajasekhar said he had kept the Kalachakra in another place knowing something like this will happen. He said he will definitely give the Kalachakras to Bhairavi (Nandhini) after solving their problems. Nandhini assured them something like this will not happen again. Janaki's spirit came back to house after the Ayyapan pooja ended. She told Devasena to test the newcomer (Nandhini) one last time. Devasena agreed and asked Nandhini questions regarding Janaki's first meeting with Ganga and her initial marital status. \n\nNandhini answered the questions correctly, knowing Janaki is the one who instigated Devasena to ask such questions. Nandhini already read Ganga's mind fully, when she possessed Ganga previously. Devasena finally concludes it is indeed Ganga and Janaki is the one who is unnecessarily suspecting her. Janaki is still not convinced and wants to dig out some more truth. Nandhini learns Janaki has started to suspect her and begins to be more cautious. In the mean time, Arun brought some Kanchipuram silk sarees to Nandhini saying it is her's (Ganga's) favourite sarees. Nandhini said she didn't like any of those sarees.\n\n\n\n\nIn the table below, the blue numbers represent the lowest ratings and the red numbers represent the highest ratings.\nThe Series was released on 23 January 2017 on Sun TV, the series also airs on Sun TV HD.

                "Imagine Dragons\n\nImagine Dragons is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, consisting of lead vocalist Dan Reynolds, lead guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist and keyboardist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. The band first gained exposure with the release of single \"It's Time\", followed by their award-winning debut studio album \"Night Visions\" (2012), which resulted in the chart topping singles \"Radioactive\" and \"Demons\". \"Billboard\" placed them at the top of their \"Year In Rock\" rankings for 2013 and 2017 and named them their \"Breakthrough Band of 2013\". and \"Biggest Band of 2017.\" \"Rolling Stone\" named their single \"Radioactive\", which holds the record for most weeks on the Hot 100, from \"Night Visions\" the \"biggest rock hit of the year\", and MTV called them \"the year's biggest breakout band\". The band's second studio album \"Smoke + Mirrors\" (2015) reached number one in the US, Canada and the UK. After a brief hiatus, the band released their third studio album, \"Evolve\" (2017) which resulted in the chart-topping singles, \"Believer\" and \"Thunder\". While all three albums were commercially successful, critical reception was mixed.\n\nImagine Dragons has won three American Music Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, one Grammy Award, and one World Music Award. In May 2014, the band was nominated for fourteen Billboard Music Awards, including Top Artist of the Year and a Milestone Award, which recognizes innovation and creativity of artists across different genres. Imagine Dragons have sold 12 million albums and 35 million singles worldwide.\n\nIn 2008, lead singer Dan Reynolds met drummer Andrew Tolman at Brigham Young University where they were both students. Reynolds and Tolman added Andrew Beck, Dave Lemke, and Aurora Florence to play guitar, bass, and piano respectively for their band. Their name is an anagram for a phrase only known to members of the group, that Reynolds stated each member approved of. The five-piece released an extended play titled \"Speak to Me\" that same year. Beck and Florence would also depart from the band's lineup that year. In 2009, Tolman recruited longtime high school friend Wayne Sermon, who had graduated from Berklee College of Music to play guitar. Tolman later recruited his wife, Brittany Tolman, to sing backup and play keys, and the band began to play shows together again. Lemke left the band later on, leading Sermon to recruit another Berklee music student, Ben McKee, to join the band as their bassist and complete the lineup. The band garnered a large following in their hometown of Provo, Utah, before the members moved to Las Vegas, the hometown of Dan Reynolds, where the band recorded and released their first three EPs.\n\nThe band released EPs titled \"Imagine Dragons\" and \"Hell and Silence\" in 2010, both recorded at Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas. They returned to the studio in 2011. The third EP, \"It's Time\", was made before they signed a record deal.\n\nThey got their first big break when Train's frontman Pat Monahan fell sick just prior to the Bite of Las Vegas Festival 2009. Imagine Dragons were called to fill in and performed to a crowd of more than 26,000 people. Local accolades including \"Best CD of 2011\" (\"Vegas SEVEN\"), \"Best Local Indie Band 2010\" (\"Las Vegas Weekly\"), \"Las Vegas' Newest Must See Live Act\" (\"Las Vegas CityLife\"), Vegas Music Summit Headliner 2010, and more sent the band on a positive trajectory. In November 2011 they signed with Interscope Records and began working with English Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid. Eventually the Tolmans would leave the group and Daniel Platzman would be recruited in August 2011 by invitation from Ben McKee, prior to the signing of band's label deal in November 2011, alongside keyboardist Theresa Flaminio.\n\nTheresa Flaminio departed from Imagine Dragons in early 2012, leaving them as a four-piece. The band worked closely with Alex da Kid, with whom they recorded their first major label release at Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California.

Pollstar listed the band in their Top 20 Concert Tours list by average box office gross despite their average ticket price being the third lowest on the list.\n\nThe band released a live album, \"Live at Independent Records\", in April 2013.\n\nAt Lollapalooza in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the last date on the Into the Night Tour, the band announced a rest, and complemented saying, \"This is our last show for a while, and had no better place to end this tour\". The conclusion of the Into the Night Tour signaled the end of the \"Night Visions\" album cycle. Lead singer Dan Reynolds joked about the end of the \"Night Visions\" cycle, saying that \"We're always writing on the road, [so] that second album will come, unless we die at the age of 27 next year. Hopefully we don't die and there will be a second album. I don't know when it will be, but it may come\".\n\nThe idea behind the second studio album, dubbed as their \"New Year's resolution\", was to create music and finish it when the band feels that their work is done. Reynolds told MTV in 2014 that the band wanted to \"put out an album that we're really happy with\". He further said that \"we tend to be perfectionists, too hard on ourselves at times, and we don't want to rush anything because we know how we are with things. We don't want to put a record out until we really feel good about it, you know, and who knows how long that will take\". Since the beginning of the Night Visions Tour, the band had been writing new material for an upcoming album, and, even as early as the start of the tour, had been recording demos for the album, before entering the studio. By the time that they entered the studio to work on the album, they had amassed 50 demos to work from. The demos had been described by Reynolds as \"definitely different\", but added that \"it’s still Imagine Dragons, but we’ve got a lot of growth and maturing to do as a band. I think the new material is going to hopefully be a step in the right direction. We’re just trying to create and do what comes out and what feels right\". Drummer Daniel Platzman added that the band are critical of themselves, with \"no room for external pressure\".\n\nInspired greatly by the band's travels on both their previous tours and the Night Visions Tour, the album will explore world culture as a musical item and overall motif in the album. Dan Reynolds told New Orleans-based newspaper \"The Times-Picayune\" that there was \"a lot of inspiration to be drawn from [the world tour]. You kind of realize that you’re a lot smaller than you think\". In addition, Reynolds stated to music magazine \"Rolling Stone\" that the next album will be \"different\" from \"Night Visions\", and that the band intends the album to be \"stripped back quite a bit\". He added that \"we embraced a lot of hip-hop influences with \"Night Visions\", but I think the next record will be more rock-driven. It’s too early to say, but there is some weird stuff going on in these songs\".\n\nPrior to the album's release, Imagine Dragons released a number of singles for other projects including a song for the film \"\", called \"Battle Cry\" (June 2014) and song \"Warriors\" for the 2014 League of Legends World Championship (September 2014).\n\nOn October 24, they revealed the lead single to the upcoming album, \"I Bet My Life\" via several visual snippets on Facebook and Instagram.

                "Imagine Dragons\n\nImagine Dragons is an American rock band from Las Vegas, Nevada, consisting of lead vocalist Dan Reynolds, lead guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist and keyboardist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. The band first gained exposure with the release of single \"It's Time\", followed by their award-winning debut studio album \"Night Visions\" (2012), which resulted in the chart topping singles \"Radioactive\" and \"Demons\". \"Billboard\" placed them at the top of their \"Year In Rock\" rankings for 2013 and 2017 and named them their \"Breakthrough Band of 2013\". and \"Biggest Band of 2017.\" \"Rolling Stone\" named their single \"Radioactive\", which holds the record for most weeks on the Hot 100, from \"Night Visions\" the \"biggest rock hit of the year\", and MTV called them \"the year's biggest breakout band\". The band's second studio album \"Smoke + Mirrors\" (2015) reached number one in the US, Canada and the UK. After a brief hiatus, the band released their third studio album, \"Evolve\" (2017) which resulted in the chart-topping singles, \"Believer\" and \"Thunder\". While all three albums were commercially successful, critical reception was mixed.\n\nImagine Dragons has won three American Music Awards, five Billboard Music Awards, one Grammy Award, and one World Music Award. In May 2014, the band was nominated for fourteen Billboard Music Awards, including Top Artist of the Year and a Milestone Award, which recognizes innovation and creativity of artists across different genres. Imagine Dragons have sold 12 million albums and 35 million singles worldwide.\n\nIn 2008, lead singer Dan Reynolds met drummer Andrew Tolman at Brigham Young University where they were both students. Reynolds and Tolman added Andrew Beck, Dave Lemke, and Aurora Florence to play guitar, bass, and piano respectively for their band. Their name is an anagram for a phrase only known to members of the group, that Reynolds stated each member approved of. The five-piece released an extended play titled \"Speak to Me\" that same year. Beck and Florence would also depart from the band's lineup that year. In 2009, Tolman recruited longtime high school friend Wayne Sermon, who had graduated from Berklee College of Music to play guitar. Tolman later recruited his wife, Brittany Tolman, to sing backup and play keys, and the band began to play shows together again. Lemke left the band later on, leading Sermon to recruit another Berklee music student, Ben McKee, to join the band as their bassist and complete the lineup. The band garnered a large following in their hometown of Provo, Utah, before the members moved to Las Vegas, the hometown of Dan Reynolds, where the band recorded and released their first three EPs.\n\nThe band released EPs titled \"Imagine Dragons\" and \"Hell and Silence\" in 2010, both recorded at Battle Born Studios, in Las Vegas. They returned to the studio in 2011. The third EP, \"It's Time\", was made before they signed a record deal.\n\nThey got their first big break when Train's frontman Pat Monahan fell sick just prior to the Bite of Las Vegas Festival 2009. Imagine Dragons were called to fill in and performed to a crowd of more than 26,000 people. Local accolades including \"Best CD of 2011\" (\"Vegas SEVEN\"), \"Best Local Indie Band 2010\" (\"Las Vegas Weekly\"), \"Las Vegas' Newest Must See Live Act\" (\"Las Vegas CityLife\"), Vegas Music Summit Headliner 2010, and more sent the band on a positive trajectory. In November 2011 they signed with Interscope Records and began working with English Grammy winning producer Alex da Kid. Eventually the Tolmans would leave the group and Daniel Platzman would be recruited in August 2011 by invitation from Ben McKee, prior to the signing of band's label deal in November 2011, alongside keyboardist Theresa Flaminio.\n\nTheresa Flaminio departed from Imagine Dragons in early 2012, leaving them as a four-piece. The band worked closely with Alex da Kid, with whom they recorded their first major label release at Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California. An EP entitled \"Continued Silence\" was released on Valentine's Day (February 14, 2012) digitally and peaked at number 40 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The band also released an EP titled \"Hear Me\" in 2012.\n\nShortly after, \"It's Time\" was released as a single and peaked at number 15 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The music video debuted on April 17, 2012 on all MTV affiliates and was subsequently nominated for an MTV Video Music Award in the \"Best Rock Video\" category. \"It's Time\" was certified a double platinum single by the RIAA.\n\nThe band finished recording their debut album \"Night Visions\" in the summer of 2012 at Studio X inside Palms Casino Resort and released the album in the United States on the day after Labor Day (September 4, 2012). It peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart with first week sales in excess of 83,000 copies, the highest charting for a debut rock album since 2006. The album also reached No. 1 on the Billboard Alternative and Rock Album charts as well as the top ten on the Australian, Austrian, Canadian, Dutch, German, Irish, Norwegian, Portuguese, Scottish, Spanish, and United Kingdom Albums charts. It won a Billboard Music Award for Top Rock Album and was nominated for the Juno Award for International Album of the Year. \"Night Visions\" is certified platinum by the RIAA as well as in Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. The album produced three tracks that reached the \"Billboard\" Top 40, four tracks in the ARIA Top 40, and five tracks charting in the UK Top 40.\n\nThe album's second single \"Radioactive\" reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Alternative Songs, \"Billboard\" Rock Songs, and Swedish singles chart and has sold more than seven million singles in the United States, smashing a record by spending 87 weeks on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Radioactive\" stayed at No. 1 on the Hot Rock Songs chart for a record-breaking 23 weeks and ultimately became the genre's biggest hit of 2013. It peaked at No. 3, becoming their first top ten single in the United States and broke the record for the longest run into the top five. It is the best-selling rock song on the Nielsen SoundScan running list of best-selling rock songs in digital history. By the end of 2013, \"Radioactive\" had already sold over 3 million copies. \"Rolling Stone\" called it \"the biggest rock hit of the year\". It was also the most streamed song of 2013 on Spotify in the United States. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Record of the Year and the Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, winning the latter of the two. In 2015, it was certified diamond by the RIAA for sales in excess of 10 million copies in the United States.\n\nThird single \"Demons\" reached No. 1 on the \"Billboard\" Pop Songs and No. 6 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and has sold more than 5 million copies in the United States to date.\n\n\"Billboard\" listed them as one of \"2012's Brightest New Stars\" and later \"The Breakout Band of 2013\". Imagine Dragons won the 2014 Billboard Music Awards for Top Duo/Group, Top Hot 100 Artist, and Top Rock Artist. Amazon.com called the band their \"Favorite Rock artist of 2012\".\n\nIn 2013, Imagine Dragons returned to Europe and North America with the Night Visions Tour. The band announced 13 additional US summer tour dates which also sold out. The band then announced a North America Amphitheatre tour. The band also confirmed that they were unable to fulfill the request of acting as support for Muse. Pollstar listed the band in their Top 20 Concert Tours list by average box office gross despite their average ticket price being the third lowest on the list.\n\nThe band released a live album, \"Live at Independent Records\", in April 2013.\n\nAt Lollapalooza in Sao Paulo, Brazil, the last date on the Into the Night Tour, the band announced a rest, and complemented saying, \"This is our last show for a while, and had no better place to end this tour\". The conclusion of the Into the Night Tour signaled the end of the \"Night Visions\" album cycle. Lead singer Dan Reynolds joked about the end of the \"Night Visions\" cycle, saying that \"We're always writing on the road, [so] that second album will come, unless we die at the age of 27 next year. Hopefully we don't die and there will be a second album. I don't know when it will be, but it may come\".\n\nThe idea behind the second studio album, dubbed as their \"New Year's resolution\", was to create music and finish it when the band feels that their work is done. Reynolds told MTV in 2014 that the band wanted to \"put out an album that we're really happy with\". He further said that \"we tend to be perfectionists, too hard on ourselves at times, and we don't want to rush anything because we know how we are with things. We don't want to put a record out until we really feel good about it, you know, and who knows how long that will take\". Since the beginning of the Night Visions Tour, the band had been writing new material for an upcoming album, and, even as early as the start of the tour, had been recording demos for the album, before entering the studio. By the time that they entered the studio to work on the album, they had amassed 50 demos to work from. The demos had been described by Reynolds as \"definitely different\", but added that \"it’s still Imagine Dragons, but we’ve got a lot of growth and maturing to do as a band. I think the new material is going to hopefully be a step in the right direction. We’re just trying to create and do what comes out and what feels right\". Drummer Daniel Platzman added that the band are critical of themselves, with \"no room for external pressure\".\n\nInspired greatly by the band's travels on both their previous tours and the Night Visions Tour, the album will explore world culture as a musical item and overall motif in the album. Dan Reynolds told New Orleans-based newspaper \"The Times-Picayune\" that there was \"a lot of inspiration to be drawn from [the world tour]. You kind of realize that you’re a lot smaller than you think\". In addition, Reynolds stated to music magazine \"Rolling Stone\" that the next album will be \"different\" from \"Night Visions\", and that the band intends the album to be \"stripped back quite a bit\". He added that \"we embraced a lot of hip-hop influences with \"Night Visions\", but I think the next record will be more rock-driven. It’s too early to say, but there is some weird stuff going on in these songs\".\n\nPrior to the album's release, Imagine Dragons released a number of singles for other projects including a song for the film \"\", called \"Battle Cry\" (June 2014) and song \"Warriors\" for the 2014 League of Legends World Championship (September 2014).\n\nOn October 24, they revealed the lead single to the upcoming album, \"I Bet My Life\" via several visual snippets on Facebook and Instagram. It was released on October 27. It will be sent to US Alternative radio for adds on November 3.\n\nImagine Dragons performed in Seoul World Cup Stadium, South Korea, at the 2014 League of Legends World Championship and the halftime show at the 102nd Grey Cup in Vancouver, British Columbia.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Imagine Dragons posted on social media a request that fans in the US look around their city for some surprises and post their findings. They also hinted about two locations in Las Vegas. Shortly, billboards featuring artwork, the band's name, a hashtag (\"#smoke+mirrors\"), and an additional titles, presumed to be the track names were discovered. The following titles were revealed \"Summer\", \"Shots\", \"Polaroid\", \"I'm So Sorry\", and \"Gold\". Next, the band direct messaged various fans puzzle pieces of the artwork for the album (each file numbered, at least 13 in total). When combined, the puzzle pieces appear to reveal the cover art and album title. The title, cover art, and release date were revealed on social media two days later.\n\nWorking with Metric, which did a three-song acoustic set, Imagine Dragons played at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles on February 5, 2015. The half-hour set included the breakthrough songs \"It's Time\" and \"Radioactive\" from \"Night Visions\". The performance was the live debut for \"Summer\" and \"I'm So Sorry\", along with \"Gold\" and \"I Bet My Life\" from the album \"Smoke + Mirrors\", which was released on February 17, 2015. The band's 2015 North American summer tour began in Portland, Oregon on June 3.\n\nDuring the band's tour, Imagine Dragons released two non-album singles. \"Roots\" was released on August 26, 2015 and \"I Was Me\" on October 12, 2015 via iTunes. The band also released a cover of \"I Love You All the Time\" by Eagles of Death Metal on December 18, 2015, in support of the victims of the November 2015 Paris attacks. The \"Smoke + Mirrors Tour\" ended on February 5, 2016 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.\n\nIn an interview, Dan Reynolds told \"Billboard\" that the band would be taking a hiatus for the remainder of 2016, stating that \"This is the year we're going to actually take time off. We haven't stopped in, like, six years, so we've forced ourselves to at least take a year off.\" The band released a one night only concert film, \"Imagine Dragons In Concert: Smoke + Mirrors\", in select theaters on March 2, 2016.

The single was first released in North America on the American September 4, 2012 release date, and again in European countries on the European February 7, 2013 release date of the album.\n\nBefore the release of \"Night Visions\", Imagine Dragons made appearances on American radio and television to promote their extended play, \"Continued Silence\" and debut single It's Time.

During the tour, the band appeared on the September 4, 2012 airing of ABC late-night talk show \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\". They also made a historical appearance on the October 29, 2012 airing of NBC late-night talk show \"Late Night with Jimmy Fallon\" performing \"It's Time\" to an empty audience during Hurricane Sandy's passage through the New York / New Jersey metropolitan area during that weekend.\n\nIn 2013, a world tour, entitled the Night Visions Tour, was executed in promotion of the worldwide release of \"Night Visions\".

The band made another television appearance in the United States, performing \"Radioactive\", \"Demons\" and \"On Top of the World\" on the July 4, 2013 airing of ABC morning television show \"Good Morning America\".\n\"Night Visions\" received mixed reviews from music critics. Brian Mansfield from \"USA Today\" gave \"Night Visions\" a favorable review, writing: \"For all the group's musical mastery, it's the flourishes courtesy of producer Alex da Kid that make individual tracks stand out.\" Mansfield praised individual elements such as \"the mandolin hook of 'It's Time', the jaunty whistle of 'On Top of the World', [and] the burbling guitar in 'Demons.'\" and said that \"those creative touches may seem like small details, but it's that imagination that gives these Dragons teeth.\" Gregory Heaney of AllMusic remarked that the album \"sometimes feels as though it lacks depth\", but nonetheless called it \"an album that, at least for a few minutes at a time, will make everyday life seem just a little bit bigger\".\n\nAnnie Zaleski of \"Las Vegas Weekly\" praised \"Night Visions\" for being \"well-crafted and wildly creative, and boasts solid songwriting—three things that are sorely missing on albums by so many younger bands.\" Lisa Kwon of Consequence of Sound gave the album a mixed review and felt that \"Night Visions\" \"fails to match the fresh adrenaline rush that the band's first single had promised us when we first heard it on the radio or in commercials earlier this year.\" Johan Wippsson from \"Melodic\" magazine called \"Night Visions\" \"somewhat shattered, but as a whole this is a very charming and well-crafted album.\" Chris Saunders of musicOMH panned the album as \"so safe and middle of the road that it leaves you with the same hollow feeling that Las Vegas can, without the dizzying high and sensual assault that got you there in the first place.\"\n\nThe album debuted at number two on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the United States, selling more than 83,000 copies within its first week. It also peaked at the summit of the \"Billboard\" Alternative Albums chart and Rock Albums chart.

As of February 2015, it has sold a total of 2.5 million copies in the US and earned double Platinum status. It was also the third best-selling album in Canada with 179,000 copies sold.\n\nTo date, three singles from the album charted in the \"Billboard\" Top 20, and five have charted on the UK Top 40.

                "Smoke + Mirrors\n\nSmoke + Mirrors is the second studio album by American rock band Imagine Dragons. The album was recorded during 2014 at the band's home studio in Las Vegas, Nevada. Self-produced by members of the band along with English hip-hop producer Alexander Grant, known by his moniker Alex da Kid, the album was released by Interscope Records and Grant's KIDinaKORNER label on February 17, 2015, in the United States.\n\nThe album received generally mixed reviews from music critics upon release. However, it debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 in the United States, moving more than 172,000 units, and also debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart and the Canadian Albums Chart. It has since been certified gold in the United States, United Kingdom, Mexico, and Brazil. Three official singles have been released from the album: \"I Bet My Life\", \"Gold\" and \"Shots\". As of July 2017 the album has sold over 1,000,000 copies in the US.\n\nIn 2012, Imagine Dragons released their debut studio album \"Night Visions\". The album, produced by the band along with Alexander Grant and Brandon Darner, launched the band into international mainstream commercial success, charting within the top ten of 14 national record charts, in addition to charting on eight others. Certified Platinum by seven national music associations, including 2x Platinum in the United States by the RIAA and 3x Platinum in Canada by Music Canada, the album was initially met with first week sales in excess of 83,000 copies, the highest charting for a debut rock album since 2006. The album was also nominated for the 2014 Juno Award for International Album of the Year.\n\nThe band released six singles during the \"Night Visions\" album cycle in 2012 and 2013, five of which charted on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Radioactive,\" a 2013 single, sold more than nine million singles in the United States, spending more than 1 year consecutively on the Billboard Hot 100. Peaking at no. 3 on the chart, it also broke the record for the longest run into the top five and is the best-selling rock single on the Nielsen SoundScan running list of best-selling rock tracks in digital history. \"Billboard\" listed the band as one of \"2012's Brightest New Stars\" and later \"The Breakout Band of 2013.\"\n\nTo further promote the already-successful \"Night Visions\", the band set out on a year-long concert tour beginning in early 2013 and ending in mid-2014, dubbed the \"Night Visions Tour.\" The tour spanned for over 170 dates, and visited North America, South America, Europe and Oceania. An additional tour of North America, dubbed the \"Into the Night Tour,\" was also executed. The conclusion of the Into the Night Tour signaled the end of the \"Night Visions\" album cycle, with \"Night Visions Live\", a live album, serving as the last release in the cycle. Lead singer Dan Reynolds joked about the end of the \"Night Visions\" cycle, saying that \"We're always writing on the road, [so] that second album will come, unless we die at the age of 27 next year. Hopefully we don't die and there will be a second album. I don't know when it will be, but it may come.\" The band were also inspired greatly by their experiences on the Night Visions Tour. Dan Reynolds told New Orleans-based newspaper \"The Times-Picayune\" that the world tour had \"a lot of inspiration to be drawn,\" and further stating, \"You kind of realize that you’re a lot smaller than you think.\"\n\nThe idea behind the second studio album, dubbed as their \"new year's resolution,\" was to create music and finish it when the band feels that their work is done. Reynolds told MTV in 2014 that the band wanted to \"put out an album that [they're] really happy with\". He further said that \"we tend to be perfectionists, too hard on ourselves at times, and we don't want to rush anything because we know how we are with things. We don't want to put a record out until we really feel good about it, you know, and who knows how long that will take.\"\n\nReynolds stated to music magazine \"Rolling Stone\" that the next album will be \"different\" from \"Night Visions\", and that the band intends the album to be \"stripped back quite a bit.\" He added that \"we embraced a lot of hip-hop influences with \"Night Visions\", but I think the next record will be more rock-driven. It’s too early to say, but there is some weird stuff going on in these songs.\"\n\nThe creative process for the album began long before the conclusion of the \"Night Visions\" cycle. Since the beginning of the Night Visions Tour in 2012, the band had been writing new material for an upcoming album, and, even as early as the start of the tour, had been recording demos for the album, before entering the studio. By the time that they entered the studio to work on the album, they had amassed 50 demos to work from. The demos had been described by Reynolds as \"definitely different,\" but added that \"it’s still Imagine Dragons, but we’ve got a lot of growth and maturing to do as a band. I think [the new material] is going to hopefully be a step in the right direction. We’re just trying to create and do what comes out and what feels right.\" The band also were self-critical throughout the sessions, with Drummer Daniel Platzman stating that there was \"no room for external pressure\" during the recording of the album.\n\nThe band announced a rest at the end of the Night Visions Tour at Lollapalooza in Sao Paulo, Brazil.\n\nThe \"Smoke and Mirrors\" album cycle has so far featured three singles and two promotional singles. Regional releases from the album feature different track listings. Target has made available an exclusive deluxe version of the album featuring four bonus tracks, available online internationally.\n\nTarget teamed with the band to air the first ever live commercial performance during the Grammy Awards. On February 8, 2015 the band performed \"Shots\" from Las Vegas' Freemont Street under the direction of Jonas Åkerlund. \"Billboard\" estimated the commercial cost $8 million in airtime.\n\nHard Rock Cafe teamed with the band, granting them the first ever full access to take control of Hard Rock Cafe's internal video system (more than 20,000 screens at all 151 locations worldwide) on February 17, 2014. Also, autographed T-shirts will be hidden throughout the Hard Rock Cafe shops supporting the Tyler Robinson Foundation, benefiting the families of children with cancer.\n\nPreceding the release of lead single \"I Bet My Life,\" Imagine Dragons posted on social media segments of the single's artwork imposed by lyrics from the song and mirrored letters that spelled the song's title in reverse.\n\nOn December 12, 2014, Imagine Dragons posted on social media a request that fans look around Las Vegas Valley for hidden clues to upcoming songs. The band gave 13 fans puzzle pieces of the artwork for the album. When combined, the puzzle pieces revealed the cover art and album title. On December 15, 2014, \"Gold\" was released as a single with a video being released later. On the cover art for the album were a set of numbers that provided specific coordinates to prizes hidden in the Nevada desert, including an autographed guitar, drumsticks, Polaroid pictures, and a master pass for free concert tickets for the entire tour.\n\nOn January 24, 2015, the band flew in 200 prize winning fans from around the world to attend a special listening event at the P3 Studio Art Gallery in the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas. The event included an art exhibition of Tim Cantor's work for the album and attendees were allowed to listen to the full album through Beats headphones. Then the band arrived for an interview and private performance.\n\nFebruary 20 through February 26, 2015, the band, partnering with Southwest Airlines, flew over 30 winners from all over the U.S. from coast to coast on what they called the \"Destination Dragons\" Tour. The Destination Dragons tour consisted of all the winners being flown from their hometowns, to small clubs in Los Angeles, Provo, Las Vegas, and Atlanta. This tour was a promotion for \"Smoke and Mirrors\", and a chance for the band to road test their new music live, in preparation for their \"Smoke and Mirrors\" World Tour. They paid homage to the clubs they got their start in by playing small, private shows for the Destination Dragons winners, as well as local winners in each city. They played The Troubadour in Los Angeles, Velour in Provo, Utah, Vinyl in Las Vegas, and wrapped up the tour at Terminal West in Atlanta, Georgia. During the Southwest flight from Las Vegas to Atlanta, fans were treated to an acoustic concert in what the airline calls \"Live at 35\" where artists play for airplane passengers after the airplane reaches 35,000 feet. All winners flew to all 4 cities, were given tickets to all 4 private shows, were able to attend the \"Live at 35\" event, and were given a meet and greet.\n\n\"I Bet My Life\" was released as the lead single from \"Smoke and Mirrors\" and debuted at number 15 on the Canadian Hot 100, number 27 on the UK Singles Chart, and 28 on the Billboard Hot 100. It also topped the Billboard Adult Alternative Songs, a first for the band. The band performed the song live on \"American Music Awards\" (2014), \"Good Morning America\" (2015), \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" (2015), VH1's \"Big Morning Buzz Live\" (2015).\n\n\"Gold\" was released as the second single from \"Smoke and Mirrors\" on December 16, 2014 and peaked at number 12 on the \"Billboard\" Hot Rock Songs chart.\n\n\"Shots\" was released as the third single from \"Smoke and Mirrors\" and charted on the Billboard Hot 100 as well as reaching No. 3 on the Norway Singles chart. The band performed the song live during the \"Grammy Awards\" (2015), a first ever live commercial performance, directed by Jonas Åkerlund. They also performed the song live on \"Good Morning America\" (2015), \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon\" (2015), \"The Howard Stern Show\" (2015), \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", \"The Ellen DeGeneres Show\" (2015), and \"Today\" (2015).\n\nOn February 5, 2015, the band played a live streaming concert for Live Nation and Yahoo! during which they announced the North American leg of the arena tour. The band embarked on a world tour, Smoke and Mirrors Tour, in promotion of the worldwide release of \"Smoke and Mirrors\". The tour began on began April 12, 2015 and concluded on February 5, 2016.\n\nThe album overall received mixed reviews from critics with a score of 60/100 on Metacritic. \"Q\" published a positive review of the album, calling it \"[a] modern pop-rock gem\" and also noting it as an improvement upon their debut album \"Night Visions\".\" \"Entertainment Weekly\" published a positive review stating, \"the group's sophomore effort scales back on the electronic frippery, revealing the tightly focused rock juggernaut they are on stage.\" \"Illinois Entertainer\" published an interview with Reynolds on February 2, 2015, saying the album is \"an ambitious, rock-solid effort, with potential hits galore.\" \"The Daily Telegraph\" published a highly positive review of the album, calling it \"thunderous\" and saying its \"songs are peppered with bright ideas and odd collisions, world music sounds percolating through R&B grooves, stuttering digital breaks interrupting solid rhythms. Lyrics and delivery suggest Imagine Dragons adhere to old-fashioned rock band idealism, but nothing is allowed to get in the way of a sparkling hook.\"\n\nAllison Stewart of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that the band \"is very good at what it does, even if what it does isn't very good,\" having \"effortlessly achieved\" the album's one purpose, \"to cram as many popular styles as possible into a mainstream rock album to appeal to as many people as it can.\" Dave DiMartino of Yahoo! Music wrote that \"it is the band’s music, and not their faces, or personalities, that resonates with the mass audiences. And this is good. . . This is a pretty solid, surprisingly diverse sounding rock album—not a tuneless screech-fest by any means—and a record the band should be proud of. . . This could have been a shambles, and it's anything but.\" Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described the album as \"overblown\" arena rock, with more style than substance, and an overemphasis on reverberation effects such that \"the reverb nearly functions as a fifth instrument in the band\".\n\nThe album's lyrics were nominated for an AML Award.\n\n\"Smoke + Mirrors\" debuted at number one on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart with 195,000 album-equivalent units (172,000 of which were pure album sales). It more than doubled its the group's previous best sales week. The album remained in the chart's top twenty for the next several weeks, as of July 2017, the album has sold over 1,000,000 copies in the United States. In the United Kingdom, it became the final album to reach number one on sales alone as streaming became incorporated into the UK Albums Chart the following week.\n\nAll songs written and produced by Imagine Dragons (Ben McKee, Daniel Platzman, Dan Reynolds and Wayne Sermon), except where noted.\n\nAll bonus tracks on a separate disc on physical versions.\n\nImagine Dragons\n\n\n"

                "Reception history of Jane Austen\n\nThe reception history of Jane Austen follows a path from modest fame to wild popularity. Jane Austen (1775–1817), the author of such works as \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813) and \"Emma\" (1815), has become one of the best-known and most widely read novelists in the English language. Her novels are the subject of intense scholarly study and the centre of a diverse fan culture.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Austen's novels brought her little personal fame. Like many women writers, she chose to publish anonymously, but her authorship was an open secret. At the time they were published, Austen's works were considered fashionable but received only a few reviews, albeit positive. By the mid-19th century, her novels were admired by members of the literary elite who viewed their appreciation of her works as a mark of cultivation, but they were also being recommended in the popular education movement and on school reading lists as early as 1838. The first illustrated edition of her works appeared in 1833, in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, which put her titles before thousands of readers across the Victorian period.\n\nThe publication in 1870 of her nephew's \"Memoir of Jane Austen\" introduced her to a wider public as an appealing personality—dear aunt Jane—and her works were republished in popular editions. By the start of the 20th century, competing groups had sprung up—some to worship her and some to defend her from the \"teeming masses\"—but all claiming to be the true Janeites, or those who properly appreciated Austen. The \"teeming masses,\" meanwhile, were creating their own ways of honoring Austen, including in amateur theatricals in drawing rooms, schools, and community groups.\n\nIn 1923, the publisher and scholar R. W. Chapman prepared a carefully edited collection of her works—which some have claimed is the first serious scholarly treatment given to any British novelist. By mid-century, Austen was widely accepted in academia as a great English novelist. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship, which explored numerous aspects of her works: artistic, ideological, and historical.\n\nWith the growing professionalisation of university English departments in the second half of the 20th century, criticism of Austen became more theoretical and specialized, as did literary studies in general. As a result, commentary on Austen sometimes seemed to imagine itself as divided into high culture and popular culture branches. In the mid- to late 20th century, fans founded Jane Austen societies and clubs to celebrate the author, her time, and her works.\n\nAs of the early 21st century, Austen fandom supports an industry of printed sequels and prequels as well as television and film adaptations, which started with the 1940 \"Pride and Prejudice\" and evolved to include the 2004 Bollywood-style production \"Bride and Prejudice\".\n\nJane Austen lived her entire life as part of a large and close-knit family on the lower fringes of the English gentry. Her family's steadfast support was critical to Austen's development as a professional writer. Austen read draft versions of all of her novels to her family, receiving feedback and encouragement, and it was her father who sent out her first publication bid. Austen's artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. With the release of \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1811), \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813), \"Mansfield Park\" (1814) and \"Emma\" (1815), she achieved success as a published writer.\n\nNovel-writing was a suspect occupation for women in the early 19th century, because it imperiled their social reputation by bringing them publicity, viewed as unfeminine. Therefore, like many other female writers, Austen published anonymously. Eventually, though, her novels' authorship became an open secret among the aristocracy. During one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her, through his librarian, James Stanier Clarke, to view his library at Carlton House; his librarian mentioned that the Regent admired her novels and that \"if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to dedicate it to the Prince\". Austen, who disapproved of the prince's extravagant lifestyle, did not want to follow this suggestion, but her friends convinced her otherwise: in short order, \"Emma\" was dedicated to him. Austen turned down the librarian's further hint to write a historical romance in honour of the prince's daughter's marriage.\n\nIn the last year of her life, Austen revised \"Northanger Abbey\" (1817), wrote \"Persuasion\" (1817), and began another novel, eventually titled \"Sanditon\", which was left unfinished at her death. Austen did not have time to see \"Northanger Abbey\" or \"Persuasion\" through the press, but her family published them as one volume after her death and her brother Henry included a \"Biographical Notice of the Author\". This short biography sowed the seeds for the myth of Austen as a quiet, retiring aunt who wrote during her spare time: \"Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives ... [S]o much did she shrink from notoriety, that no accumulation of fame would have induced her, had she lived, to affix her name to any productions of her public she turned away from any allusion to the character of an authoress.\" However, this description is in direct contrast to the excitement Austen shows in her letters regarding publication and profit: Austen was a professional writer.\n\nAusten's works are noted for their realism, biting social commentary, and masterful use of free indirect speech, burlesque and irony. They critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. As Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert explain, Austen makes fun of \"such novelistic clichés as love at first sight, the primacy of passion over all other emotions and/or duties, the chivalric exploits of the hero, the vulnerable sensitivity of the heroine, the lovers' proclaimed indifference to financial considerations, and the cruel crudity of parents\". Austen's plots, though comic, highlight the way women of the gentry depended on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Like the writings of Samuel Johnson, a strong influence on her, her works are fundamentally concerned with moral issues.\n\nAusten's novels quickly became fashionable among opinion-makers, namely, those aristocrats who often dictated fashion and taste. Lady Bessborough, sister to the notorious Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, commented on \"Sense and Sensibility\" in a letter to a friend: \"it is a clever novel.  ... tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it.\" The fifteen-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, Princess Charlotte Augusta, compared herself to one of the book's heroines: \"I think Marianne & me are very like in \"disposition\", that certainly I am not so good, the same imprudence, &tc\".\n\nAfter reading \"Pride and Prejudice\", playwright Richard Sheridan advised a friend to \"[b]uy it immediately\" for it \"was one of the cleverest things\" he had ever read. Anne Milbanke, future wife of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, wrote that \"I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice, which I think a very superior work.\" She commented that the novel \"is the most \"probable\" fiction I have ever read\" and had become \"at present the fashionable novel\". The Dowager Lady Vernon told a friend that \"Mansfield Park\" was \"[n]ot much of a novel, more the history of a family party in the country, very natural\"—as if, comments one Austen scholar, \"Lady Vernon's parties mostly featured adultery.\" Lady Anne Romilly told her friend, the novelist Maria Edgeworth, that \"[\"Mansfield Park\"] has been pretty generally admired here\" and Edgeworth commented later that \"we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park\".\n\nDespite these positive reactions from the elite, Austen's novels received relatively few reviews during her lifetime: two for \"Sense and Sensibility\", three for \"Pride and Prejudice\", none for \"Mansfield Park\", and seven for \"Emma\". Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels. Moreover, as Brian Southam, who has edited the definitive volumes on Austen's reception, writes in his description of these reviewers, \"their job was merely to provide brief notices, extended with quotations, for the benefit of women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral\". This was not atypical critical treatment for novels in Austen's day.\n\nAsked by publisher John Murray to review \"Emma\", famed historical novelist Walter Scott wrote the longest and most thoughtful of these reviews, which was published anonymously in the March 1816 issue of the \"Quarterly Review\". Using the review as a platform from which to defend the then disreputable genre of the novel, Scott praised Austen's works, celebrating her ability to copy \"from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\". Modern Austen scholar William Galperin has noted that \"unlike some of Austen's lay readers, who recognized her divergence from realistic practice as it had been prescribed and defined at the time, Walter Scott may well have been the first to install Austen as the realist par excellence\". Scott wrote in his private journal in 1826, in what later became a widely quoted comparison:\n\n\"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", published together posthumously in December 1817, were reviewed in the \"British Critic\" in March 1818 and in the \"Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany\" in May 1818. The reviewer for the \"British Critic\" felt that Austen's exclusive dependence on realism was evidence of a deficient imagination. The reviewer for the \"Edinburgh Review\" disagreed, praising Austen for her \"exhaustless invention\" and the combination of the familiar and the surprising in her plots. Overall, Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her novels—for example, they misunderstood her use of irony. Reviewers reduced \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\" to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice.\n\nIn the \"Quarterly Review\" in 1821, the English writer and theologian Richard Whately published the most serious and enthusiastic early posthumous review of Austen's work. Whately drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, praising the dramatic qualities of her narrative. He also affirmed the respectability and legitimacy of the novel as a genre, arguing that imaginative literature, especially narrative, was more valuable than history or biography. When it was properly done, as in Austen, Whately said, imaginative literature concerned itself with generalised human experience from which the reader could gain important insights into human nature; in other words, it was moral. Whately also addressed Austen's position as a female writer, writing: \"we suspect one of Miss Austin's great merits in our eyes to be, the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female heroines are what one knows women must be, though one never can get them to acknowledge it.\" No more significant, original Austen criticism was published until the late 19th century: Whately and Scott had set the tone for the Victorian era's view of Austen.\n\nAusten had many admiring readers during the 19th century, who, according to critic Ian Watt, appreciated her \" to ordinary social experience\". However, Austen's novels did not conform to certain strong Romantic and Victorian British preferences, which required that \"powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing\". Victorian critics and audiences were drawn to the work of authors such as Charles Dickens and George Eliot; by comparison, Austen's novels seemed provincial and quiet. Although Austen's works were republished beginning in late 1832 or early 1833 by Richard Bentley in the \"Standard Novels\" series, and remained in print continuously thereafter, they were not best-sellers. Southam describes her \"reading public between 1821 and 1870\" as \"minute beside the known audience for Dickens and his contemporaries\".\n\nThose who did read Austen saw themselves as discriminating readers—they were a cultured few. This became a common theme of Austen criticism during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes articulated this theme in a series of enthusiastic articles in the 1840s and 1850s. In \"The Novels of Jane Austen\", published anonymously in \"Blackwood's Magazine\" in 1859, Lewes praised Austen's novels for \"the economy of easy adaptation of means to ends, with no aid from superfluous elements\" and compared her to Shakespeare. Arguing that Austen lacked the ability to construct a plot, he still celebrated her dramatisations: \"The reader's pulse never throbs, his curiosity is never intense; but his interest never wanes for a moment. The action begins; the people speak, feel, and act; everything that is said, felt, or done tends towards the entanglement or disentanglement of the plot; and we are almost made actors as well as spectators of the little drama.\"\n\nReacting against Lewes's essays and his personal communications with her, novelist Charlotte Brontë admired Austen's fidelity to everyday life but described her as \"only shrewd and observant\" and criticised the absence of visible passion in her work. To Brontë, Austen's work appeared formal and constrained, \"a carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but no glance of bright vivid physiognomy, no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck\".\n\nAusten's novels appeared in some European countries soon after their publication in Britain, beginning in 1813 with a French translation of \"Pride and Prejudice\", quickly followed by German, Danish, and Swedish editions. Their availability in Europe was not universal. Austen was not well known in Russia and the first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967. Despite the fact that Austen's novels were translated into many European languages, Europeans did not recognise her works as part of the English novel tradition. This perception was reinforced by the changes made by translators who injected sentimentalism into Austen's novels and eliminated their humour and irony. European readers therefore more readily associated Walter Scott's style with the English novel.\n\nBecause of the significant changes made by her translators, Austen was received as a different kind of novelist in continental Europe than in Britain. For example, the French novelist Isabelle de Montolieu translated several of Austen's novels into a genre in which Montolieu herself wrote: the French sentimental novel. In Montolieu's \"Pride and Prejudice\", for example, vivacious conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy were replaced by decorous ones. Elizabeth's claim that she has \"always seen a great similarity in the turn of [their] minds\" (her and Darcy's) because they are \"unwilling to speak, unless [they] expect to say something that will amaze the whole room\" becomes \"Moi, je garde le silence, parce que je ne sais que dire, et vous, parce que vous aiguisez vos traits pour parler avec effet.\" (\"Me, I keep silent, because I don't know what to say, and you, because you excite your features for effect when speaking.\") As Cossy and Saglia explain in their essay on Austen translations, \"the equality of mind which Elizabeth takes for granted is denied and gender distinction introduced\". Because Austen's works were seen in France as part of a sentimental tradition, they were overshadowed by the works of French realists such as Stendhal, Balzac, and Flaubert. German translations and reviews of those translations also placed Austen in a line of sentimental writers, particularly late Romantic women writers.\n\nA study of other important dimensions of the French translations, such as free indirect discourse (FID) do much to nuance our understanding of Austen's initial \"aesthetic\" reception with her first French readership. Austen uses a narrative technique known as free indirect discourse (FID) to represent Anne Elliot's consciousness in \"Persuasion\". Indeed, the portrayal of the heroine's subjective experience is central to its narration. The frequent use of FID imbues \"Perusasion\"'s narrative discourse with a high degree of subtlety, placing a huge burden of interpretation on Austen's first translators. Recent studies demonstrate that FID from \"Persuasion\" was translated extensively in Montolieu's \"La Famille Elliot\". Indeed, Montolieu was aware of the propensity of Austen's narrator to delve into the heroine's psychology in \"Persuasion\" as she comments on this in the preface to \"La Famille Elliot\". She characterises it as \"almost imperceptible, delicate nuances that come from the heart\": \"des nuances délicates presque imperceptibles qui partent du fond du cœur, et dont miss JANE AUSTEN avait le secret plus qu'aucun autre romancier\". Montolieu's extensive translations of Austen's FID demonstrate that she was in fact one of Austen's first critical readers, whose own finely nuanced reading of Austen's narrative technique meant that her first French readers could also share in Anne Elliot's psychological drama in much the same way that her English readership could.\n\nFor decades, Scott's and Whately's opinions dominated the reception of Austen's works and few people read her novels. In 1869, this changed with the publication of the first significant Austen biography, \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\", which was written by Jane Austen's nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh. With its release, Austen's popularity and critical standing increased dramatically. Readers of the \"Memoir\" were presented with the myth of the amateur novelist who wrote masterpieces: the \"Memoir\" fixed in the public mind a sentimental picture of Austen as a quiet, middle-aged maiden aunt and reassured them that her work was suitable for a respectable Victorian family. James Edward Austen-Leigh had a portrait of Jane Austen painted, based on the earlier watercolour, softening her image and making her presentable to the Victorian public. The engraving by Bentley which formed the frontispiece of \"Memoir\" is based on the idealised image.\n\nThe publication of the \"Memoir\" spurred a major reissue of Austen's novels. The first popular editions were released in 1883—a cheap sixpenny series published by Routledge. This was followed by a proliferation of elaborate illustrated editions, collectors' sets, and scholarly editions. However, contemporary critics continued to assert that her works were sophisticated and only appropriate for those who could truly plumb their depths. Yet, after the publication of the \"Memoir\", more criticism was published on Austen's novels in two years than had appeared in the previous fifty.\n\nIn 1913, William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, descendants of the Austen family, published the definitive family biography, \"Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters—A Family Record\". Based primarily on family papers and letters, it is described by Austen biographer Park Honan as \"accurate, staid, reliable, and at times vivid and suggestive\". Although the authors moved away from the sentimental tone of the \"Memoir\", they made little effort to go beyond the family records and traditions immediately available to them. Their book therefore offers bare facts and little in the way of interpretation.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century, the first books of critical analysis regarding Austen's works were published. In 1890 Godwin Smith published the \"Life of Jane Austen\", initiating a \"fresh phase in the critical heritage\", in which Austen reviewers became critics. This launched the beginning of \"formal criticism\", that is, a focus on Austen as a writer and an analysis of the techniques that made her writing unique. According to Southam, while Austen criticism increased in amount and, to some degree, in quality after 1870, \"a certain uniformity\" pervaded it:\n\nAmong the most astute of these critics were Richard Simpson, Margaret Oliphant, and Leslie Stephen. In a review of the \"Memoir\", Simpson described Austen as a serious yet ironic critic of English society. He introduced two interpretative themes which later became the basis for modern literary criticism of Austen's works: humour as social critique and irony as a means of moral evaluation. Continuing Lewes's comparison to Shakespeare, Simpson wrote that Austen:\n\nSimpson's essay was not well known and did not become influential until Lionel Trilling quoted it in 1957. Another prominent writer whose Austen criticism was ignored, novelist Margaret Oliphant, described Austen in almost proto-feminist terms, as \"armed with a 'fine vein of feminine cynicism,' 'full of subtle power, keenness, finesse, and self-restraint,' blessed with an 'exquisite sense' of the 'ridiculous,' 'a fine stinging yet soft-voiced contempt,' whose novels are 'so calm and cold and keen'\". This line of criticism would not be fully explored until the 1970s with the rise of feminist literary criticism.\n\nAlthough Austen's novels had been published in the United States since 1832, albeit in bowdlerised editions, it was not until after 1870 that there was a distinctive American response to Austen. As Southam explains, \"for American literary nationalists Jane Austen's cultivated scene was too pallid, too constrained, too refined, too downright unheroic\". Austen was not democratic enough for American tastes and her canvas did not extend to the frontier themes that had come to define American literature. By the start of the 20th century, the American response was represented by the debate between the American novelist and critic William Dean Howells and the writer and humourist Mark Twain. In a series of essays, Howells helped make Austen into a canonical figure for the populace whereas Twain used Austen to argue against the Anglophile tradition in America. That is, Twain argued for the distinctiveness of American literature by attacking English literature. In his book \"Following the Equator\", Twain described the library on his ship: \"Jane Austen's absent from this library. Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn't a book in it.\"\n\nThe \"Encyclopædia Britannica's\" changing entries on Austen illustrate her increasing popularity and status. The eighth edition (1854) described her as \"an elegant novelist\" while the ninth edition (1875) lauded her as \"one of the most distinguished modern British novelists\". Around the start of the 20th century, Austen novels began to be studied at universities and appear in histories of the English novel. The image of her that dominated the popular imagination was still that first presented in the \"Memoir\" and made famous by Howells in his series of essays in \"Harper's Magazine\", that of \"dear aunt Jane\". Author and critic Leslie Stephen described a mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\"—it was only after the publication of the \"Memoir\" that readers developed a personal connection with Austen. However, around 1900, members of the literary elite, who had claimed an appreciation of Austen as a mark of culture, reacted against this popularisation of her work. They referred to themselves as \"Janeites\" to distinguish themselves from the masses who, in their view, did not properly understand Austen.\n\nAmerican novelist Henry James, one member of this literary elite, referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as among \"the fine painters of life\". But, James thought Austen an \"unconscious\" artist whom he described as \"instinctive and charming\". In 1905, James responded frustratingly to what he described as \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's \"intrinsic merit and interest\". James attributed this rise principally to \"the stiff breeze of the special bookselling body of publishers, editors, illustrators, producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines; who have found their 'dear,' our dear, everybody's dear, Jane so infinitely to their material purpose, so amenable to pretty reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful, and in what seemingly proves to be salable, form.\"\n\nIn an effort to avoid the sentimental image of the \"Aunt Jane\" tradition and approach Austen's fiction from a fresh perspective, in 1917 British intellectual and travel writer Reginald Farrer published a lengthy essay in the \"Quarterly Review\" which Austen scholar A. Walton Litz calls the best single introduction to her fiction. Southam describes it as a \"Janeite\" piece without the worship. Farrer denied that Austen's artistry was unconscious (contradicting James) and described her as a writer of intense concentration and a severe critic of her society, \"radiant and remorseless\", \"dispassionate yet pitiless\", with \"the steely quality, the incurable rigor of her judgment\". Farrer was one of the first critics who viewed Austen as a subversive writer.\n\nSeveral important early works—glimmers of brilliant Austen scholarship—paved the way for Austen to become solidly entrenched within the academy. The first was Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley's 1911 essay, \"generally regarded as the starting-point for the serious academic approach to Jane Austen\". Bradley emphasised Austen's ties to 18th-century critic and writer Samuel Johnson, arguing that she was a moralist as well as humourist; in this he was \"totally original\", according to Southam. Bradley divided Austen's works into \"early\" and \"late\" novels, categories still used by scholars. The second path-breaking early-20th-century critic of Austen was R. W. Chapman, whose magisterial edition of Austen's collected works was the first scholarly edition of the works of any English novelist. The Chapman texts have remained the basis for all subsequent editions of Austen's works.\n\nIn the wake of Bradley and Chapman's contributions, the 1920s saw a boom in Austen scholarship, and the novelist E. M. Forster primarily illustrated his concept of the \"round\" character by citing Austen's works. It was with the 1939 publication of Mary Lascelles' \"Jane Austen and Her Art\"—\"the first full-scale historical and scholarly study\" of Austen—that the academic study of her works matured. Lascelles included a short biographical essay; an innovative analysis of the books Austen read and their effect on her writing; and an extended analysis of Austen's style and her \"narrative art\". Lascelles felt that prior critics had all worked on a scale \"so small that the reader does not see how they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them\". She wished to examine all Austen's works together and to subject her style and techniques to methodical analysis. Lascelles praised Austen for her \"shallow modelling\" of her characters, giving them distinctive voices yet making certain it was clear they all belonged to the same class. Subsequent critics agree that she succeeded. Like Bradley earlier, she emphasised Austen's connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction. However, at the time some fans of Austen worried that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric—a debate that continued into the 21st century.\nIn an outpouring of mid-century revisionist views, scholars approached Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, following and expanding upon Farrer, argued in his essay \"Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen\" that Austen's novels did not support the \"status quo\" but rather subverted it. Her irony was not humorous but caustic and intended to undermine the assumptions of the society she portrayed. Through her use of irony, Austen attempted to protect her integrity as an artist and a person in the face of attitudes and practices she rejected. In his 1940 essay, Harding argued that Austen had to be rescued from the Janites, charging \"her books are, as she meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people she disliked...\". Harding argued the Janites regarded Regency England as \"expressing the gentler virtue of a civilised social order\" that was an escape from the waking nightmare of a world at war, but he argued that its own sort of way that the world of Austen's novels was nightmarish, where the government maintained a system of spies to crush any sympathy with the French Revolution, where friends take delight in causing others pain, where the polite language is usually a facade, and where intelligence in single woman is seen as a problem. Harding maintained that the problem with the Janites was that they could not grasp these aspects of Austen's works. Almost simultaneously, influential critic Q. D. Leavis argued in \"Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing\", published in \"Scrutiny\" in the early 1940s, that Austen was a professional, not an amateur, writer. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by another revisionist treatment by Marvin Mudrick in \"Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery\" (1952). Mudrick portrayed Austen as isolated, defensive, and critical of her society, and described in detail the relationship he saw between Austen's attitude toward contemporary literature and her use of irony as a technique to contrast the realities of her society with what she felt they should be. These revisionist views, together with prominent critic F. R. Leavis's pronouncement in \"The Great Tradition\" (1948) that Austen was one of the great writers of English fiction, a view shared by Ian Watt, who helped shape the scholarly debate regarding the genre of the novel, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics. They agreed that she \"combined <nowiki>[</nowiki>Henry Fielding's and Samuel Richardson's<nowiki>]</nowiki> qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".\n\nThe period after the Second World War saw a flowering of scholarship on Austen as well as a diversity of critical approaches. One school that emerged in the United States was the New Criticism, which saw literary texts in only aesthetic terms, an object of beauty to be appreciated in and of itself without no study of the individual that had produced it or the society that she lived in. The New Critics tended to praise Austen for her literacy skills at combining irony and paradox, but other critics argued that the New Criticism by only focusing on the aesthetic qualities of the books ignored the message of the books and Austen herself, who was reduced down to merely being the mere scribe who produced these books that they admired so much. More typical of the post-1945 scholarship Marvin Mudrick's 1952 book \"Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery\", where he argued that Austen used irony as a way of deflating conventions and to gently challenge the reader's beliefs.\n\nIn 1951, Arnold Kettle in his \"Introduction to the English Novel\" praised Austen for her \"fineness of feeling\", but complained about the \"relevance\" of her work to the 20th century, charging that the values of Austen's novels were too much those of Regency England to be acceptable for the 20th century, writing a modern audience could not accept the rigidly hierarchical society of her time where the vast majority of people were denied the right to vote. About the question of the \"relevance\" of Austen to the modern world, the American critic Lionel Trilling in his 1955 essay on \"Mansfield Park\" wrote about the problem of existing in the modern world, of \"the terrible strain it imposes on us...the exhausting effort which the concept of personality requires us to make\", and praised Austen for her refusal to dignify the \"uncertainty and difficulty\" of modern life, praising her irony as the \"engaging manner by which she masks society's crude coercive power\", and uses irony in a \"generosity of spirit\". In his 1957 essay \"\"Emma\" and the Legend of Jane Austen\", Trilling argued that Austen was the first novelist to handle the very modern problem of the \"deep psychological change which accompanied the establishment of democratic society\" which imposed a \"psychological burden\" on a individual which the \"new necessity of conscious self-definition and self-criticism\" as \"there is no reality about which the modern person is more uncertain and more anxious than the reality of himself\". Trilling argued that in modern society, where people existed only as \"atoms\" uncertain about how they really were, Austen offers us a \"rare hope\" of a world where people could define themselves on their own terms.\n\nIan Watt in his 1957 book \"The Rise of the Novel\" argued that 18th century British literature was characterized by a dichotomy between either novels that were told from the first person and novels from the third person; the significance of Austen rested according to Watt in her ability to combine both subjective and objective tendencies in her books though her use of free indirect discourse. Another influential work was Wayne Booth's 1961 book \"The Rhetoric of Fiction\", in which offered a detailed study of \"Emma\", which he argued was told from three points of view; Emma's, Mr. Knightley's and the unnamed narrator. Booth argued Austen adopted this three-fold narration because Emma is in many ways an unlikable character, a spoiled and immature busybody, and Austen had to find a way to make her likable and engaging to the reader. Booth's book was widely praised for the way in which he highlighted how a moral problem (Emma's character) was turned into an aesthetic problem (how to tell the story while keeping its protagonist likable enough to engage the reader's sympathy), and has been the basis of much Austen scholarship since. Critics like Graham Hough have pointed out that the morality of the characters in \"Emma\" is related to their diction of the characters with those closest to the narrator having the best character, and in this reading Mr. Knightley has the best character. A. Walton Ktiz argued the aspect of the novel of \"Knightley as the standard\" prevents the irony of \"Emma\" from becoming a cynical celebration of feminine manipulation that see it, writing that Austen's use of free indirect discourse allowed the reader to understand's Emma mind without becoming limited by it.\n\nAnother major theme of Austen scholarship has concerned the question of the \"Bildungsroman\" (novel of education). D.D Devlin in \"Jane Austen and Education\" (1975) argued that Austen's novels were all in varying ways \"Bildungsroman\", where Austen put into practice Enlightenment theories about how the character of young people can develop and change. The Italian literary critic Franco Moretti in his 1987 book \"The Way of the World\" called \"Pride and Prejudice\" a \"classic\" \"Bildungsroman\", where Elizabeth Bennet's \"prejudice\" against Mr. Darcy is really \"distrust\" and that she \"shes does not err due to a lack-but due to an \"excess of criticism\", as Bennet rejects anything that she is told to trust \"a priori\". Moretti argued that in a typical \"Bildungsroman\" of the early 19th century was concerned with \"everyday life\", which represented \"an unchallenged stability of social relationships\" in a world that was wracked by war and revolution. In this sense, Moretti argued that the education that Bennet needs is to learn to accept the stability represented by the world around her in England, which is preferable to war and revolution to be found elsewhere in Europe, without losing her individualism. In the same way, Clifford Siskin in his 1988 book \"The Historicity of Romantic Discourse\" argued that all of Austen's books were \"Bildungsroman\", where the struggle of the characters to develop was mainly \"internal\" as the challenge to the characters was not really to change their onward lives, but rather their \"self\". Siskin noted in Henry Fielding's popular 1742 novel \"Joseph Andrews\", where a young man working as humble servant, goes though much suffering, and is ultimately rewarded when it is discovered that he is really an aristocrat kidnapped by the Romany (gypsies) when he is a baby. By contrast, Siskin wrote that Elizabeth Bennet's paternity is not in question and there are not improbable stokes of luck which will make her rich; instead her struggle is to develop her character and conquer her \"prejudice\" against Darcy, marking the shift in British literature from an \"external\" to \"internal\" conflict. Alongside studies of Austen as the writer of \"Bildungsroman\" are studies of Austen as a writer of marriage stories. For Susan Fraiman, \"Pride and Prejudice\" is both a \"Bildungsroman\" concerning Elizabeth Bennet's growth and a marriage story that ends in her \"humiliation\" where ends up submitting to Mr. Darcy. Critics are badly divided over the question of whatever the marriages of Austen's heroines is meant to be a reward for their virtuous behavior as seen by Wayne Booth and merely \"Good Girl Being Taught a Lesson\" stories as seen by Claudia Johnson. Stuart Tave wrote that Austen's stories always seem to end unhappily, but then end with the heroine getting married happily, which led him to the conclusion that these happy endings were artificial endings imposed by the expectations of an early 19th century audience.\n\nAbout the question of the \"relevance\" of Austen to the modern world, Julia Prewitt Brown in her 1979 book \"Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form\" challenged the common complaint that she did not deal with social changes, by examining how she presented social changes within the households she chronicled. Brown argued that the social changes Austen examined were the birth of the \"modern\" individualism where people were \"alienated\" from any meaningful social identity, existing only as \"atoms\" in society. The exhibit A of her thesis, so to speak, was \"Persuasion\" where she argued that Anne Eliot cannot find personal happiness by marrying within the gentry and only marriage to the self-made man Captain Wentworth can give her happiness. Brown argued that \"Persuasion\" was in many ways the most darkest of Austen's novels, depicting a society in grip of moral decay, where the old hierarchical certainties had given way to a society of \"disparate parts\", leaving Eliot as a \"disoriented, isolated\" woman. Brown was not a Marxist, but her book owed much to the Hungarian Communist writer Georg Lukács, especially his 1920 book \"The Theory of the Novel\".\nOne of the most fruitful and contentious has been the consideration of Austen as a political writer. As critic Gary Kelly explains, \"Some see her as a political 'conservative' because she seems to defend the established social order. Others see her as sympathetic to 'radical' politics that challenged the established order, especially in the form of critics see Austen's novels as neither conservative nor subversive, but complex, criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting stability and an open class hierarchy.\" In \"Jane Austen and the War of Ideas\" (1975), perhaps the most important of these works, Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was steeped in, not insulated from, the principal moral and political controversies of her time, and espoused a partisan, fundamentally conservative and Christian position in these controversies. In a similar vein, Alistair M. Duckworth in \"The Improvement of the Estate: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels\" (1971) argues that Austen used the concept of the \"estate\" to symbolise all that was important about contemporary English society, which should be conserved, improved, and passed down to future generations. Duckworth argued that Austen followed Edmund Burke, who in his 1790 book \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" had used the metaphor of an estate that represented the work of generations, and which could be only be improved, never altered, for the way that society ought to work. Duckworth noted that in Austen's books, one's ability to keep an estate going, which could only be improved, but never altered if one was to be true to the estate, is usually the measure of one's good character. Butler placed Austen in the context of the reaction against the French Revolution, where excessive emotionalism and the sentimental \"cult of sensibility\" came to be identified with sexual promiscuity, atheism, and political radicalism. Butler argued that a novel like \"Sense and Sensibility\", where Marianne Dashwood is unable to control her emotions, is part of the conservative anti-revolutionary literature that sought to glorify old fashioned values and politics. Irvine pointed out that the identification of the \"cult of sensibility\" with republicanism was one that existed only in the minds of conservatives, and in fact the French Republic also rejected sentimentalism, so Butler's challenge is to prove Austen's call for emotional self-restraint as expressed by a character like Elinor Dashwood is in fact grounded in conservative politics. Butler wrote \"the characteristic recourse of the conservative...is to remind us ultimately of the insignificance of individual rights and even individual concerns when measured against the scale of 'the universe as one vast whole'\". Irvine wrote that novels like \"Sense and Sensibility\" appeared to support Butler's thesis, but a novel like \"Pride and Prejudice\" does not, as Elizabeth Bennet is an individualist and a non-conformist who ridicules everything, and who to a certain extent has to learn the value of sentiment.\n\nRegarding Austen's views of society and economics, Alastair MacIntyre in his 1981 \"After Virtue\" offered a critique of the Enlightenment as leading to moral chaos and decay, and citing Aristotle argued that a \"good life for man\" is only possible if one follows the traditional moral rules of one's society. In this regard, MacIntrye used Austen as an \"Aristotelian\" writer whose books offered up examples of how to be virtuous with the English country estate playing the same role that the \"polis\" did for Aristotle. By contrast, Mary Evans in her 1987 book \"Jane Austen and the State\" depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist concerned with the \"stability of human relationships and communities\" and against \"conspicuous consumption\" and the \"individualisation of feeling\" promoted by the Industrial Revolution. In her 1987 book \"Desire and Domestic Fiction\", Nancy Armstrong in a study much influenced by the theories of Karl Marx and Michel Foucault, argued that all of Austen's books reflected the dominant political-economic ideology of her times, concerning the battle to exercise power over the human body, which determined how and whether a woman was considered sexually desirable or not. The Marxist James Thompson in his 1988 book \"Between Self and the World\" likewise depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist searching for a realm of freedom and feeling in a world dominated by a soulless materialism promoted by capitalism. By contrast, Beth Fowkes Tobin in her 1990 article \"The Moral and Political Economy of Austen's \"Emma\"\" depicted Austen as a Burkean conservative with Mr. Knightly as a responsible land-owner taking care of his family's ancient estate and Emma Woodhouse symbolising wealth cut off from any sort of social role. David Kaufmann in his 1992 essay \"Propriety and the Law\" argued that Austen was a classical liberal in the mold of Adam Smith, who felt that virtue was best exercised in the private sphere of the family life rather in the public sphere of politics. Kaufmann rejected the claim that Austen was influenced by Edmund Burke, arguing that for Austen, virtue was not something passed down from time immemorial from a landed elite as Burke would have it, but rather was something that any individual could acquire, thus making Austen into something of a radical. Lauren Goodlad in a 2000 article rejected Kaufmann's claim of Austen as a classical liberal, arguing that the message of \"Sense and Sensibility\" was the failure of liberalism to reconcile alienated individuals from a society that only valued money. As Rajeswari Rajan notes in her essay on recent Austen scholarship, \"the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged\". The questions scholars now investigate involve: \"the [French] Revolution, war, nationalism, empire, class, 'improvement' [of the estate], the clergy, town versus country, abolition, the professions, female emancipation; whether her politics were Tory, Whig, or radical; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary, or occupied a reformist position between these extremes\".\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Austen studies was influenced by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's seminal \"The Madwoman in the Attic\" (1979), which contrasts the \"decorous surfaces\" with the \"explosive anger\" of 19th-century female English writers. This work, along with other feminist criticism of Austen, has firmly positioned Austen as a \"woman\" writer. Gibler and Gubar suggested that what are usually seen as the unpleasant female characters in the Austen books like Mrs. Norris in \"Mansfield Park\", Lady Catherine de Bourgh in \"Pride and Prejudice\" and Mrs. Churchill in \"Emma\" were in fact expressions of Austen's anger at a patriarchal society, whom are punished in guilt over her own immodesty in writing novels while her heroines who end up happily married are expressions of Austen's desire to compromise with society. The Gilbert-Gubar thesis proved to be influential and inspired scholars to reexamine Austen's through most have a more favorable opinion of her heroines than Gilbert and Gubar did., Other scholars such as Linda Hunt have argued that Austen used realism as a way of attacking patriarchy from the outside as opposed to subverting it from within by irony as Gilbert and Gubar claimed. The interest generated in Austen by these critics led to the discovery and study of other woman writers of the time. Moreover, with the publication of Julia Prewitt Brown's \"Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form\" (1979), Margaret Kirkham's \"Jane Austen: Feminism and Fiction\" (1983), and Claudia L. Johnson's \"Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel\" (1988), scholars were no longer able to easily argue that Austen was \"apolitical, or even unqualifiedly 'conservative'\". Kirkham, for example, described the similarities between Austen's thought and that of Mary Wollstonecraft, labelling them both as \"Enlightenment feminists\". Kirham argued that by showing women were just as capable of being rational as men that Austen was a follower of Wollstonecraft. Johnson similarly places Austen in an 18th-century political tradition, although she outlines the debt Austen owes to the political novels of the 1790s written by women.\n\nThe war with France that began in 1793 was seen as an ideological war between the British monarchy vs. the French republic, which led conservative writers such as Jane West, Hannah More, and Elizabeth Hamilton to depict the feminine private sphere in the family as the embodiment of British values under threat from France, and to write a series of polemical works demanding that young women defend their \"modesty\", as defined by conduct books, to give Britain the moral strength to prevail over the French. Johnson argued that Austen appropriated the sort of plot that More, West and Hamilton used in their books to quietly subvert via irony. In support of her thesis, Johnson noted in \"Sense and Sensibility\" the Dashwood sisters are victimized by their greedy half-brother John, showing the family as an area for competition instead of warmth and comfort; in \"Mansfield Park\" the lifestyle of the eminently respectable Bertram family is supported by a plantation in Antigua worked by slave labour; and \"Northranger Abbey\" where satirizing Gothic stories gives \"a nightmare version of patriarchal oppression\" as General Tilney, if not guilty of the specific crimes that Catherine Moreland imagines he has committed, is indeed a vicious man. Likewise, Johnson noted that Maria Rushworth's adultery in \"Mansfield Park\" is portrayed as merely salacious local gossip that does not presage a great victory for Napoleon while Marianne Dashwood does not die after being seduced by Willoughby, which undercuts the standard plot devices of the conservative writers. Johnston argued because of the drastic wartime censorship and the campaign of vitriolic abuse waged against Wollstonecraft that Austen had to be quiet in their criticism of patriarchy. Irvine in a critique of the work of feminist scholars like Johnson and Kirkham that if Austen was indeed an Enlightenment feminist, there were clearly limits to her radicalism as Austen never criticised either explicitly or implicitly the hierarchical structure of British society with her villains failing to live up to their standards expected of their class, instead of their moral failures being presented as a product of the social system. Writing about the work of Johnson, Irvine wrote for her, Austen was a radical because it is women like Emma Woodhouse, Mrs. Elton and Mrs. Churchill who really run Highbury society, undercutting traditional gender roles, but Irvine questioned whatever this really made Austen into radical, noting it was the wealth and status of the gentry women of Highbury that gave them their power. Irvine argued it was just as possible to see \"Emma\" as a conservative novel that upholds the superiority of the gentry, writing that Johnson was \"...close here to defining 'conservative' in terms of gender politics alone...\". Likewise, Elizabeth may defy Lady Catherine de Bourgh who wants to keep her in place by marrying Mr. Darcy, who comes from old landed family, which Irivne used to argue while \"Pride and Prejudice\" does have a strong heroine, the book does not criticise the structure of English society.\n\nMany scholars have noted in the conduct books that were very popular for settling out the proper rules for a young ladies in Austen's book there was a double meaning to the word modesty. Modesty meant both a woman should refrain from flamboyant behavior and be quiet while modesty also meant a woman had to be ignorant of her sexuality. This double meaning to modesty meant a young woman who was behaving in a modest way was not really modest at all as she attempting to conceal her knowledge of her sexuality, placing young women in an impossible position. Jan Fergus argued that for this reason that Austen's books were subversive by engaging in \"emotional didacticism\" by showing the reader moral lessons meant to teach young women how to be modest in the conventional sense, thus undercutting the demand made by the conduct books for modesty in the sense of ignorance of one's sexuality. In the same way, Kirkham used \"Mansfield Park\" as an example of Austen undercutting the message of the conduct books, noting that Fanny Price is attractive to Henry Crawford because she outwardly conforms to the conduct books while she is attractive to Edmund Bertram because of her intelligence and spirit, rejecting the infantisation of women promoted by the conduct books. Rachel Brownstein argued that Austen's use of irony should be seen in the same way, as a way of writing in a manner expected of a woman writer in her age while also undercutting such expectations at the same time. Devoney Looser in the 1995 book \"Jane Austen and the Discourses of Feminism\" she edited in her introduction argued that there a number of ways in which Austen could be placed not within a feminist tradition, but was herself a feminist.\n\nUsing the theories of Michel Foucault as their guide, Casey Finch and Peter Bowen in their 1990 essay \"'The Tittle-Tattle of Highbury': Gossip and the Free Indirect Style in \"Emma\"\" argued the free indirect discourse in Austen validates Fouucault's thesis that the Enlightenment was a fraud, an insidious form of oppression posing as liberation. Finch and Bowen argued that voice of the omnipresent narrator and together with the free indirect discourse summarizing the thoughts of characters in \"Emma\" were a form of \"surveillance\" that policed the thoughts of the character; seen in this light, Emma Woodhouse's discovery that she loves Mr. Knightley is not an expression of her real feelings, but rather society imposing its values on her mind by persuading her that she had to engage in a heterosexual marriage to produce sons to continue the Establishment and the while fooling her into thinking she was in love. By contrast, Lauren Goodlad in her 2000 essay \"Self-Disciplinary Self-Making\" argued that the self-discipline exercised by Elinor Dashwood in \"Sense and Sensibility\" was not an act of oppression as held by Foucault and those writing from a Foucaultian perspective, but was an \"emancipatory act of political resistance\", arguing that there was a tension between 'psychology' and 'character' as Dashwood must be the observer of her character and used what she has learn to grow.\n\nA very controversial article was \"Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl\" by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick that juxtaposed three treatments of female suffering, namely Marianne Dashwood's emotional frenzy when Willoughby abandons her, a 19th century medical account of the \"cure\" inflicted on a girl who liked to masturbate, and the critic Tony Tanner's \"vengeful\" treatment of Emma Woodhouse as a woman who had to be taught her place. Sedgwick argued the way that the portrayal of Marianne as emotionally overwrought and too inclined to give in to her feelings very closely resembled the account of patient X, the teenage girl seen as too inclined to masturbate and the way a male critic like Tanner attacked Woodhouse for her emotional self-indulgence was no different from the doctor imposing the gruesome and painful treatment on the masturbating girl. Sedwick the way that way Elinor disciplines Marianne, Tanner's \"vengeful\" views and the treatment given to patient X were all attempts to crush female sexuality as she maintained that \"emotional self-indulgence\" was merely a code-word for female masturbation. Sedgwick argued that characters such as Dashwood and Woodhouse, who did not precisely conform to the feminine ideals are symbols of both female and homosexual resistance to the ideal of heterosexuality and patriarchy as the norm for everyone. Sedgwick's provoked an uproar in 1991, becoming a prime exhibit in the American \"Culture war\" between liberals and conservatives.\n\nThe Italian critic Franco Moretti argued that Austen's novels articulated a new form of English nationalism via the marriage plot, noting most of the heroes and heroines came from different parts of England. Some critics such as Roger Gard have seized upon Austen as a symbol of an \"eternal England\", whose \"unpolitical\" works unlike the \"political\" novels of the great French and Russian novelists of the 19th century reflected the central values of \"modern Anglo-Saxon civilisations\". According to Gard, Austen is so English that only the English could really appreciate Austen, writing \"Foreigners, whether reading in translation or in the original, see little or nothing of her true brilliance...the \"feel\" of Jane Austen-so far as we can imagine it dissociated it from her language is still...peculiarly English\". Irvine wrote that Gard's book 1992 book \"Jane Austen's Novels: The Art of Clarity\" is full of historical errors such as his claim Austen was part of the movement towards \"an evolving national democracy\", when in fact the Great Reform Bill, which lowered the franchise requirements for men in a very limited way, was passed in 1832, 15 years after Austen's death, and \"nowhere in her novels or letters is England imagined as 'evolving' towards democracy of any kind\". Irvine wrote that while Austen did see England as different from the rest of Europe, she did not see England as apart from Europe in the way that Gard claimed or as a part of \"Anglo-Saxon civilisations\", which apparently include the United States and English-speaking parts of the Commonwealth, a way of thinking that did not exist in her time. Irvine charged that Gard appeared to be trying to use Austen as a way of furthering his opposition to British membership in the European Union, with his dichotomy between Austen's England with its \"clear\" style and \"unpolitical\" way of life vs. the presumably muddled style and \"political\" way of life of continental Europe with the implication that the two do not belong together.\n\nIn the late-1980s, 1990s and 2000s ideological, postcolonial and Marxist criticism dominated Austen studies. Generating heated debate, Edward Said devoted a chapter of his book \"Culture and Imperialism\" (1993) to \"Mansfield Park\", arguing that the peripheral position of \"Antigua\" and the issue of slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early 19th century. The question of whether \"Mansfield Park\" justifies or condemns slavery has become heated in Austen scholarship, and Said's claims have proved to be highly controversial. The debate about \"Mansfield Park\" and slavery is the one issue that in Austen scholarship that has transcended the limits of academia to attract widespread public attention. Many of Austen's critics come from the field of post-colonial studies, and taken up Said's thesis about \"Mansfield Park\" reflecting the \"spatial\" understanding of the world that he argued was used to justify the British empire. Writing in a post-colonial vein, Carl Plasa in his 2001 essay \"'What Was Done There Is Not To Be Told' \"Mansfield Park\"'s Colonial Unconscious\" argued that the \"barbarism\" of Maria Bertram's sexuality, which leads her into adultery, is a metaphor for the \"barbarism\" of the Haitian revolution, which attracted much media attention in Britain at the time, which was often presented as due to the \"barbarism\" and uncontrolled sexuality of the Haitian slaves. Plasa argued that British society in Austen's time was based upon set of expectations about everyone being in their \"place\", which created order. The Haitian revolution was seen as a symbol of what happened to a society without order, and Plasa argued that it was not accident that when Sir Thomas Bertram leaves Mansfield Park for his plantation in Antigua that his family falls apart, showing the importance of the family and individuals staying in their proper \"place\". Likewise, Maaja Stewart in her 1993 book \"Domestic Realities and Imperial Fictions\" argued that the plantations in the Caribbean were the source of much worry about female sexuality in Austen's time with the main concerns being the need of slave owners to depend upon the fertility of slave women to create more slaves when the slave trade was abolished in 1807, and about the general collapse of traditional English morality in the West Indies as the slave masters routinely kept harems of slave women or alternatively raped female slaves. Stewart linked these concerns to \"Mansfield Park\", writing that Sir Thomas Bertram's failure to manage his own family is put down to his failure to manage the emerging sexuality of his teenage daughters, which is precisely the same charge that was applied to the owners of the plantations in the West Indies at the same time.\n\nOther critics have seen the message of \"Mansfield Park\" as abolitionist. Joseph Lew argued that Fanny's refusal to marry Henry Crawford as \"an act of rebellion, endangering a system based upon the exchange of women between men as surely as a slave's refusal to work\". Susan Fraiman, in a 1995 essay argued strongly against the Said thesis, arguing that the values of Sir Thomas are those which Austen affirms in \"Mansfield Park\" and that if his attempt to restore order to his family in Mansfield Park is seen as analogous with his restoration of order at his Antigua plantation, then he was a failure for the \"moral blight\" at Mansfield Park remains after he returns to England. Fraiman conceded to Said that Austen was one of the writers who \"made colonialism thinkable by constructing the West as center, home and norm\", but argued slavery in \"Mansfield Park\" \"is not a subtext wherein Austen and Sir Thomas converge\", but rather used by Austen \"to argue the essential depravity of Sir Thomas's relations to other people\". Fraiman argued that Austen used the issue of slavery to argue against the patriarchal power of an English gentleman over his family, his estate and \"by implication overseas\". Fraiman argued that British imperialist discourse tended to depict the British empire as masculine and the colonies as feminine, which again to the conclusion that Said had merely inverted this discourse by making Austen a representative of the British empire while lionizing various male anti-colonial writers from Britain's colonies. Brian Southam in a 1995 essay argued that much discussed scene about the \"dead silence\" that follows Fanny Price's questions about the status of slaves in the Caribbean refers to the moral decadence of those members of the British gentry who chosen to be involved in the abolitionist campaigns of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Trevor Lloyd in a 1999 article argued on the basis of the statements in the novel suggested that about 10% of the income from Mansfield Park come from the plantation in Antigua. John Wiltshire in a 2003 article argued that parallel between the condition of women in Britain and the treatment of slaves in the West Indies is to be understood as metaphoric as literal, and that Sir Thomas willingness to make a trip in the middle of a war to his plantation in Antigua, despite the well known perils of yellow fever and malaria in the Caribbean suggested he be understood as a good master. In Wiltshire's account, it is the slave trade, not slavery, that Austen condemns in \"Mansfield Park\".\n\nIrvine argued that though all of Austen's novels are set in provincial England, there is in fact a global component to her stories with the British Empire as a place where men go off in adventures, to get rich and to tell stories which edify the heroines. Irvine used as examples the naval career of Captain Wentworth in \"Persuasion\"; that Sir Thomas Bertram owes a plantation in Antigua while William Price joins the Royal Navy in \"Mansfield Park\"; and Colonel Brandon is a veteran of the campaigns in the West Indies in \"Sense and Sensibility\". Irvine observed that all of these men are in some way improved by the love of women, who domestic otherwise scarred men, noting that for example that Colonel Brandon had fought in the British campaign to conquer Saint-Domingue, where the British lost about 100,000 men between 1793–98, mostly to yellow fever, an experience that scarred him and left him looking for a \"home\". Irvine argued that Elinor Dashwood by arranging for Colonel Brandon to marry her sister Marianne is finding for him the \"home\" that he had lost while fighting for the British empire in a doomed effort to restore slavery to Saint-Domingue. Irvine suggested that for Austen, women had a role in domesticating men scarred by their imperial experiences, and that Said was wrong that Austen could \"not\" write of the British empire; arguing instead in Austen's works the \"stories of empire\" are placed in a \"context of their telling that domesticates them, removes them from the political and moral realm where the horrors they describe might demand a moral and political response\".\n\nAnother theme of recent Austen scholarship concerns her relationship with British/English national identity within the context of the long wars with France. Jon Mee in his 2000 essay \"Austen's Treacherous Ivory: Female Patriotism, Domestic Ideology, and Empire\" examined how Fanny Price defined her sense of Englishness in connection with the English countryside, arguing that Austen was presenting a version of \"England\" defined as country estates in a bucolic countryside that was insulated from a \"larger, more uncertain and un-English world\". Mee suggested that in \"Emma\", the very name of Mr. Knightley, which suggests the Middle Ages, together with the name of his estate, Donwell Abbey, are meant to suggest a continuity between medieval and modern England, in contrast to the newness of the political institutions in the novice republics in the United States and France. Miranda Burgress in her 2000 book \"British Fiction and the Production of Social Order\" argued that Austen defined her England as a nation made up of readers, as the experience of reading the same books had created a common culture across all of England. in this regard, Janet Sorenson in \"The Grammar of Empire\" noted that in Austen's books, none of her characters speak in dialect and all use the same form of polite \"King's English\" that was expected of the upper classes.\n\nIn \"Jane Austen and the Body: 'The Picture of Health\"', (1992) John Wiltshire explored the preoccupation with illness and health of Austen's characters. Wiltshire addressed current theories of \"the body as sexuality\", and more broadly how culture is \"inscribed\" on the representation of the body. There has also been a return to considerations of aesthetics with D. A. Miller's \"Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style\" (2003), which connects artistic concerns with queer theory. Miller in his book began the \"queer\" reading of Austen, as he asked why Austen's work which celebrates heterosexual love is so popular with gay men. Miller answered it is because the narrator of the novels has no sexuality and has a \"dazzling verbal style\", which allows homosexuals to identity with the narrator who stands outside of the world of heterosexuality and whose chief attribute is a sense of style.\n\nCritic Claudia Johnson defines \"Janeitism\" as \"the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her\". Janeites not only read the novels of Austen; they also re-enact them, write plays based on them, and become experts on early 19th-century England and its customs. Austen scholar Deidre Lynch has commented that \"cult\" is an apt term for committed Janeites. She compares the practices of religious pilgrims with those of Janeites, who travel to places associated with Austen's life, her novels and the film adaptations. She speculates that this is \"a kind of time-travel to the past\" which, by catering to Janeites, preserves a \"vanished Englishness or set of 'traditional' values\". The disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen and the academic appreciation of Austen that began with Lascelles has since widened considerably. Johnson compares Janeites to Trekkies, arguing that both \"are derided and marginalized by dominant cultural institutions bent on legitimizing their own objects and protocols of expertise\". However, she notes that Austen's works are now considered to be part of both high culture and popular culture, while \"Star Trek\" can only claim to be a part of popular culture.\n\nSequels, prequels and adaptations based on Austen's work range from attempts to enlarge on the stories in Austen's own style to the soft-core pornographic novel \"Virtues and Vices\" (1981) and fantasy novel \"Resolve and Resistance\" (1996). Beginning in the middle of the 19th century, Austen family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels. By 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations of Austen's works. According to Lynch, \"her works appear to have proven more hospitable to sequelisation than those of almost any other novelist\". Relying on the categories laid out by Betty A. Schellenberg and Paul Budra, Lynch describes two different kinds of Austen sequels: those that continue the story and those that return to \"the world of Jane Austen\". The texts that continue the story are \"generally regarded as dubious enterprises, as reviews attest\" and \"often feel like throwbacks to the Gothic and sentimental novels that Austen loved to burlesque\". Those that emphasise nostalgia are \"defined not only by retrograde longing but also by a kind of postmodern playfulness and predilection for insider joking\", relying on the reader to see the web of Austenian allusions.\nBetween 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, film and stage productions appeared. The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. It has long been said that a Hollywood adaptation was first suggested by the entertainer Harpo Marx, who had seen a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy. Directed by Robert Z. Leonard and written in collaboration with the English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original. Filmed in a studio and in black and white, the story's setting was relocated to the 1830s with opulent costume designs.\n\nIn direct opposition to the Hollywood adaptations of Austen's novels, BBC dramatisations from the 1970s onward aimed to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations, and settings. The 1972 BBC adaptation of \"Emma\", for example, took great care to be historically accurate, but its slow pacing and long takes contrasted unfavourably to the pace of commercial films. The BBC's 1980 adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\" adopted many film techniques—such as the use of long landscape shots—that gave the production a greater visual sophistication. Often seen as the start of the \"heritage drama\" movement, this production was the first to be filmed largely on location. A push for \"fusion\" adaptations, or films that combined Hollywood style and British heritage style, began in the mid-1980s. The BBC's first fusion adaptation was the 1986 production of \"Northanger Abbey\", which combined authentic style and 1980s punk, with characters often veering into the surreal.\n\nA wave of Austen adaptations began to appear around 1995, starting with Emma Thompson's adaptation of \"Sense and Sensibility\" for Columbia Pictures, a fusion production directed by Ang Lee. This star-studded film departed from the novel in many ways, but it became a commercial and critical success, and was nominated for numerous awards, including seven Oscars. The BBC produced two adaptations in 1995: \"Persuasion\" and Andrew Davies's six-episode television drama, \"Pride and Prejudice\". Starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, Davies's production ignited \"Darcymania\" in Britain. Critics praised its smart departures from the novel as well as its sensual costuming, fast-paced editing, and original yet appropriate dialogue. The series sparked an explosion in the publication of printed Austen adaptations; in addition, 200,000 video copies of the serial were sold within a year of its airing, 50,000 within the first week alone. Another adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\" was released in 2005. Starring Keira Knightley, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet, Joe Wright's film marked the first feature adaptation since 1940 that aspired to be faithful to the novel. Three more film adaptations appeared in 2007—\"Mansfield Park\", \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\". \"Love & Friendship\", a film version of Austen's early epistolary novel \"Lady Susan\", was released in 2016. Directed by Whit Stillman and starring Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny, the film's title was taken from one of Austen's juvenile writings.\n\nBooks and scripts that use the general story line of Austen's novels but change or otherwise modernize the story also became popular at the end of the 20th century. \"Clueless\" (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of \"Emma\" that takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series. \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2001), based on the successful 1996 book of the same name by Helen Fielding, was inspired by both \"Pride and Prejudice\" and the 1995 BBC adaptation. The Bollywoodesque production \"Bride and Prejudice\", which sets Austen's story in present-day India while including original musical numbers, premiered in 2004.\n\n\n",
                "Jane Austen\n\nJane Austen (; 16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism and social commentary, have earned her acclaim among critics and scholars.\n\nWith the publications of \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1811), \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813), \"Mansfield Park\" (1814) and \"Emma\" (1816), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled \"Sanditon\", but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript and another unfinished novel, The Watsons. Her six full-length novels have rarely been out of print, although they were published anonymously and brought her moderate success and little fame during her lifetime.\n\nA significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and sold as a set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.\n\nAusten has inspired a large number of critical essays and literary anthologies. Her novels have inspired many films, from 1940's \"Pride and Prejudice\" to more recent productions like \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1995) and \"Love & Friendship\" (2016). \n\nThere is little biographical information about Jane Austen's life except the few letters that survive and the biographical notes her family members wrote. During her lifetime Austen wrote approximately 3,000 letters but only about 160 survive. Many of the letters were written to Austen's older sister Cassandra, who in 1843 burned the greater part of them and cut pieces out of those she kept. Ostensibly Cassandra destroyed or censored her sister's letters to prevent their falling into the hands of relatives and ensuring that \"younger nieces did not read any of Jane Austen's sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbors or family members\". Cassandra believed that in the interest of tact and Jane's penchant for forthrightness, these details should be destroyed. The paucity of record of Austen's life leaves modern biographers little to work with.\n\nThe situation was compounded as successive generations of the family expunged and sanitized the already opaque details of Austen's biography. The heirs of Jane's brother, Admiral Francis Austen, destroyed more letters; details were excised from the \"Biographical Notice\" her brother wrote in 1818; and family details continued to be elided or embellished in her nephew's \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\", published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh's biography \"Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters\", published in 1913. The legend the family and relatives created reflects their biases in favour of \"good quiet Aunt Jane\", portraying a woman whose domestic situation was happy and whose family was the mainstay of her life. Austen scholar Jan Fergus explains that modern biographies tend to include details excised from the letters and family biographical materials, but that the challenge is to avoid the polarising view that Austen experienced periods of deep unhappiness and was \"an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family.\"\nJane Austen was born in Steventon, Hampshire, on 16 December 1775. She was born a month later than her parents expected; her father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother \"certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago\". He added that her arrival was particularly welcome as \"a future companion to her sister\". The winter of 1776 was particularly harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church with the single name Jane.\n\nFor much of Jane's life, her father, George Austen (1731–1805) served as the rector of the Anglican parishes at Steventon, and a nearby Deane. He came from an old, respected, and wealthy family of wool merchants. Over the centuries as each generation of eldest sons received inheritances their wealth was consolidated, and George's branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. His sister Philadelphia went to India to find a husband and George entered St John's College, Oxford on a fellowship, where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739–1827). She came from the prominent Leigh family; her father was rector at All Souls College, Oxford, where she grew up among the gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot, with the only condition that he change his name to Leigh-Perrot. \n\nGeorge and Cassandra exchanged miniatures in 1763 and probably were engaged around that time. George received the living for the Steventon parish from the wealthy husband of his second cousin, Thomas Knight, who owned Steventon and its associated farms, one of which the Austen family rented to live in. Two months after Cassandra's father died they married on 26 April 1764 at St Swithin's Church in Bath, by licence, in a simple ceremony. They left for Hampshire the same day. \n\nTheir income was modest, with George's small \"per annum\" living; Cassandra brought the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother's death to the marriage. The Reverend Austen had an annual income of £200 pounds from his two livings. This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison, a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about £100 pounds annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between £1, 000-£5, 000 pounds. The Austens took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then placed it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.\nIn 1768 the family finally took up residence in Steventon. Henry was the first child to be born there, in 1771. At about this time Cassandra could no longer ignore that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and dumb, and she chose to send him out to be fostered. In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.\n\nAccording to Honan, life in the Austen home was lived in \"an open, amused, easy intellectual atmosphere\" where the ideas of those with whom the Austens might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed. The family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members. Cassandra Austen spent the summer of 1770 in London with George's sister, Philadelphia, and her daughter Eliza, accompanied by his other sister, Mrs Walter and her daughter Philly. Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, \"the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane's youthful horizon and influence her later life and works.\"\n\nCassandra Austen's cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and '80s, inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents on her return, \"… and almost home they were when they met Jane & Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, & have the pleasure of riding home in it.\" Le Faye writes that, \"Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.\"\n\nFrom 1773 until 1796, George Austen supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time, who boarded at his home.\n\nIn 1783, Austen and her sister Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Mrs Ann Cawley who took them with her to Southampton when she moved there later in the year. In the autumn both girls were sent home when they caught typhus and Austen nearly died. Austen was from then home educated, until she attended boarding school in Reading with her sister from early in 1785 at the Reading Abbey Girls' School, ruled by Mrs La Tournelle, who possessed a cork leg and a passion for theatre. The school curriculum probably included some French, spelling, needlework, dancing and music and, perhaps, drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family. After 1786, Austen \"never again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment\".\n\nThe remainder of her education came from reading, guided by her father and brothers James and Henry. Irene Collins believes that Austen \"used some of the same school books as the boys\" her father tutored. Austen apparently had unfettered access both to her father's library and that of a family friend, Warren Hastings. Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library. Her father was also tolerant of Austen's sometimes risqué experiments in writing, and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing.\n\nPrivate theatricals were an essential part of Austen's education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn, including Richard Sheridan's \"The Rivals\" (1775) and David Garrick's \"Bon Ton\". Austen's eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and she probably joined in these activities, first as a spectator and later as a participant. Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests how Austen's satirical gifts were cultivated. At the age of 12, she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years.\n\nBeginning at age 11, perhaps earlier, Austen wrote poems and stories for her own and her family's amusement. In these works the details of daily life are exaggerated, common plot devices are parodied, and the \"stories are full of anarchic fantasies of female power, licence, illicit behaviour, and general high spirits\", according to Janet Todd. Austen later compiled \"fair copies\" of 29 early works into three bound notebooks, now referred to as the \"Juvenilia\", containing work written between 1787 and 1793. She titled the three notebooks – \"Volume the First\", \"Volume the Second\" and \"Volume the Third\" – which preserve 90,000 words she wrote during those years. The \"Juvenilia\" are often, according to scholar Richard Jenkyns, \"boisterous\" and \"anarchic\"; he compares them to the work of 18th-century novelist Laurence Sterne.\n\nAmong these works are a satirical novel in letters titled \"Love and Freindship\" , written at age 14 in 1790, where she mocked popular novels of sensibility, and \"The History of England\", a manuscript of 34 pages accompanied by 13 watercolour miniatures by her sister, Cassandra. Austen's \"History\" parodied popular historical writing, particularly Oliver Goldsmith's \"History of England\" (1764). Honan speculates that not long after writing \"Love and Freindship\" in 1789, Austen decided to \"write for profit, to make stories her central effort\", that is, to become a professional writer. Beginning in about 1793, Austen began to write longer, more sophisticated works.\n\nIn August 1792 she started \"Catharine or the Bower\", which presaged her mature work, especially \"Northanger Abbey\"; it was left unfinished and the story picked up in \"Lady Susan\", which Todd describes as less prefiguring than \"Catharine\". A year later, she began but abandoned a short play, later titled \"Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts\", which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austen's favourite contemporary novel, \"The History of Sir Charles Grandison\" (1753), by Samuel Richardson.\n\nBetween 1793 and 1795 Austen wrote \"Lady Susan\", a short epistolary novel, usually described as her most ambitious and sophisticated early work. It is unlike any of Austen's other works. Austen biographer Claire Tomalin describes the novella's heroine as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate, betray and abuse her lovers, friends and family. Tomalin writes:\n\nTold in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the Restoration dramatists who may have provided some of her inspiration ... It stands alone in Austen's work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters.\nAccording to Janet Todd, the model for the title character may have been Eliza de Feuillide, who inspired Austen with stories of her glamorous life and various adventures. Eliza's French husband was guillotined in 1794; she married Jane's brother Henry Austen in 1797.\n\nAusten sent short pieces of writing to her newborn nieces Fanny Catherine and Jane Anna Elizabeth. There is manuscript evidence that Austen continued to work on these pieces as late as 1809–1811, and that her niece and nephew, Anna and James Edward Austen, made further additions as late as 1814.\n\nShe also attended church regularly, socialized frequently with friends and neighbours, and read novels – often of her own composition – aloud with her family in the evenings. Socialising with the neighbours often meant dancing, either impromptu in someone's home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the assembly rooms in the town hall. Her brother Henry later said that \"Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it\".\n\nWhen Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: \"I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.\"\n\nAusten wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was \"very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man\". She called him her \"friend\" and explained that on this account Cassandra must be anxious to know more about her new \"friend\". Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote she expected an \"offer\" from her \"friend\" and that \"I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat\", going on to write \"I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence\" and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: \"The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea\".\n\nHalperin cautioned that Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, and some of the statements about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.\nAfter finishing \"Lady Susan\", Austen began her first full-length novel \"Elinor and Marianne\". Her sister remembered that it was read to the family \"before 1796\" and was told through a series of letters. Without surviving original manuscripts, there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published anonymously in 1811 as \"Sense and Sensibility\".\n\nAusten began a second novel, \"First Impressions\" (later published as \"Pride and Prejudice\"), in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797, aged 21; as with all of her novels, Austen read the work aloud to her family as she was working on it and it became an \"established favourite\". At this time, her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels. In November 1797, George Austen wrote to Thomas Cadell, an established publisher in London, to ask if he would consider publishing \"First Impressions\". Cadell returned Mr. Austen's letter, marking it \"Declined by Return of Post\". Austen may not have known of her father's efforts. Following the completion of \"First Impressions\", Austen returned to \"Elinor and Marianne\" and from November 1797 until mid-1798, revised it heavily; she eliminated the epistolary format in favour of third-person narration and produced something close to \"Sense and Sensibility\". In 1797, Austen met her cousin (and future sister-in-law), Eliza de Feullide, a French aristocrat whose first husband the Comte de Feullide had been guillotined, causing her to flee to Britain, where she married Henry Austen. The description of the execution of the Comte de Feullide related by his widow left Austen with an intense horror of the French Revolution that lasted for the rest of her life.\n\nDuring the middle of 1798, after finishing revisions of \"Elinor and Marianne\", Austen began writing a third novel with the working title \"Susan\" – later \"Northanger Abbey\" – a satire on the popular Gothic novel. Austen completed her work about a year later. In early 1803, Henry Austen offered \"Susan\" to Benjamin Crosby, a London publisher, who paid £10 for the copyright. Crosby promised early publication and went so far as to advertise the book publicly as being \"in the press\", but did nothing more. The manuscript remained in Crosby's hands, unpublished, until Austen repurchased the copyright from him in 1816.\n\nIn December 1800 George Austen unexpectedly announced his decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She was able to make some revisions to \"Susan\", and she began and then abandoned a new novel, \"The Watsons\", but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.\n\nThe years from 1801 to 1804 are something of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive – he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that \"having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection\". The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had \"had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife ... All of her heroines ... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love\". A possible autobiographical element in \"Sense and Sensibility\" occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates that \"the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life\" with an unsuitable man.\nIn 1804, while living in Bath, Austen started but did not complete her novel, \"The Watsons\". The story centres on an invalid and impoverished clergyman and his four unmarried daughters. Sutherland describes the novel as \"a study in the harsh economic realities of dependent women's lives\". Honan suggests, and Tomalin agrees, that Austen chose to stop work on the novel after her father died on 21 January 1805 and her personal circumstances resembled those of her characters too closely for her comfort.\n\nHer father's relatively sudden death left Jane, Cassandra, and their mother in a precarious financial situation. Edward, James, Henry, and Francis Austen pledged to make annual contributions to support their mother and sisters. For the next four years, the family's living arrangements reflected their financial insecurity. They spent part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon and Godmersham. They moved for the autumn months to the newly fashionable seaside resort of Worthing, on the Sussex coast, where they resided at Stanford Cottage. It was here that Austen is thought to have written her fair copy of \"Lady Susan\" and added its \"Conclusion\". In 1806 the family moved to Southampton, where they shared a house with Frank Austen and his new wife. A large part of this time they spent visiting various branches of the family.\n\nOn 5 April 1809, about three months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, offering him a new manuscript of \"Susan\" if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.\n\nAround early 1809 Austen's brother Edward offered his mother and sisters a more settled life – the use of a large cottage in Chawton village that was part of Edward's nearby estate, Chawton House. Jane, Cassandra and their mother moved into Chawton cottage on 7 July 1809. Life was quieter in Chawton than it had been since the family's move to Bath in 1800. The Austens did not socialise with gentry and entertained only when family visited. Her niece Anna described the family's life in Chawton as \"a very quiet life, according to our ideas, but they were great readers, and besides the housekeeping our aunts occupied themselves in working with the poor and in teaching some girl or boy to read or write.\"\n\nDuring her time at Chawton, Jane Austen published four generally well received novels. Through her brother Henry, the publisher Thomas Egerton agreed to publish \"Sense and Sensibility\", which appeared in October 1811. Reviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers; the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen's earnings from \"Sense and Sensibility\" provided her with some financial and psychological independence. Egerton then published \"Pride and Prejudice\", a revision of \"First Impressions\", in January 1813. He advertised the book widely and it was an immediate success, garnering three favourable reviews and selling well. By October 1813 Egerton was able to begin selling a second edition. \"Mansfield Park\" was published by Egerton in May 1814. While \"Mansfield Park\" was ignored by reviewers, it was very popular with readers. All copies were sold within six months, and Austen's earnings on this novel were larger than for any of her other novels. Unknown to Austen, her novels were translated into French and published in cheaply produced, pirated editions in France. The literary critic Noel King commented that given the prevailing rage in France at the time was for lush romantic fantasies, it is remarkable that her novels with the emphasis on everyday English life had any sort of a market in France. However, King cautioned that Austen's chief translator in France, Madame Isabelle de Montolieu, had only the most rudimentary knowledge of English, and her translations were more of \"imitations\" than translations proper, as Montolieu depended upon assistants to provide a summary, which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austen's plots and characters. The first of the Austen novels to be published that credited her as the author was in France, when \"Persuasion\" was published in 1821 as \"La Famille Elliot ou L'Ancienne Inclination\".\n\nAusten learned that the Prince Regent admired her novels and kept a set at each of his residences. In November 1815, the Prince Regent's librarian James Stanier Clarke invited Austen to visit the Prince's London residence and hinted Austen should dedicate the forthcoming \"Emma\" to the Prince. Though Austen disliked the Prince Regent, she could scarcely refuse the request. Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent on the account of his womanising, gambling, drinking, spendthrift ways and generally disreputable behaviour. She later wrote \"\", a satiric outline of the \"perfect novel\" based on the librarian's many suggestions for a future Austen novel. Austen was greatly annoyed by Clarke's often pompous literary advice, and the \"Plan of A Novel\" parodying Clarke was intended as her revenge for all of the unwanted letters she had received from the royal librarian.\n\nIn mid-1815 Austen moved her work from Egerton to John Murray, a better known London publisher, who published \"Emma\" in December 1815 and a second edition of \"Mansfield Park\" in February 1816. \"Emma\" sold well but the new edition of \"Mansfield Park\" did poorly, and this failure offset most of the income from \"Emma\". These were the last of Austen's novels to be published during her lifetime.\n\nWhile Murray prepared \"Emma\" for publication, Austen began \"The Elliots\", later published as \"Persuasion\". She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition, shortly after the publication of \"Emma\", Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for \"Susan\" from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen's bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him deeply in debt and losing Edward, James, and Frank Austen large sums. Henry and Frank could no longer afford the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters.\n\nAusten was feeling unwell by early 1816, but ignored the warning signs. By the middle of that year, her decline was unmistakable, and she began a slow, irregular deterioration. The majority of biographers rely on Dr. Vincent Cope's 1964 retrospective diagnosis and list her cause of death as Addison's disease, although her final illness has also been described as resulting from Hodgkin's lymphoma. When her uncle died and left his entire fortune to his wife, effectively disinheriting his relatives, she suffered a relapse, writing, \"I am ashamed to say that the shock of my Uncle's Will brought on a relapse ... but a weak Body must excuse weak Nerves\".\n\nShe continued to work in spite of her illness. Dissatisfied with the ending of \"The Elliots\", she rewrote the final two chapters, which she finished on 6 August 1816. In January 1817 Austen began \"The Brothers\" (titled \"Sanditon\" when published in 1925), and completed twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817, probably due to illness. Todd describes \"Sanditon\"'s heroine, Diana Parker, as an \"energetic invalid\". In the novel, Austen mocked hypochondriacs and though she describes the heroine as \"bilious\", five days after abandoning the novel she wrote of herself that she was turning \"every wrong colour\" and living \"chiefly on the sofa\". She put down her pen on 18 March 1817, making a note of it.\n\nAusten made light of her condition, describing it as \"bile\" and rheumatism. As her illness progressed, she experienced difficulty walking and lacked energy; by mid-April she was confined to bed. In May Cassandra and Henry brought her to Winchester for treatment, by which time she suffered agonising pain and welcomed death. Austen died in Winchester on 18 July 1817, at the age of 41. Henry, through his clerical connections, arranged for his sister to be buried in the north aisle of the nave of Winchester Cathedral. The epitaph composed by her brother James praises Austen's personal qualities, expresses hope for her salvation and mentions the \"extraordinary endowments of her mind\", but does not explicitly mention her achievements as a writer.\n\nAfter Austen's death, Cassandra, Henry Austen and Murray arranged for the publication of \"Persuasion\" and \"Northanger Abbey\" as a set. Henry Austen contributed a \"Biographical Note\" which for the first time identified his sister as the author of the novels. Tomalin describes it as \"a loving and polished eulogy\". Sales were good for a year – only 321 copies remained unsold at the end of 1818.\n\nIn 1832 Richard Bentley purchased the remaining copyrights to all of her novels, and over the following winter published five illustrated volumes as part of his \"Standard Novels\" series. In October 1833, Bentley released the first collected edition of her works. Since then, Austen's novels have been continuously in print.\n\nAusten's works critique the sentimental novels of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. The earliest English novelists, Richardson, Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett, were followed by the school of sentimentalists and romantics such as Walter Scott, Horace Walpole, Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, Laurence Sterne and Oliver Goldsmith, whose style and genre Austen rejected, returning the novel on a \"slender thread\" to the tradition of Richardson and Fielding for a \"realistic study of manners\". In the mid-20 century, literary critics F. R. Leavis and Ian Watt placed her in the tradition of Richardson and Fielding; both believe that she used their tradition of \"irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".\n\nWalter Scott noted Austen's \"resistance to the trashy sensationalism of much of modern fiction – 'the ephemeral productions which supply the regular demand of watering places and circulating libraries'\". Yet her rejection of these genres is complex, as evidenced by \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Emma\". Similar to William Wordsworth, who excoriated the modern frantic novel in the \"Preface\" to his \"Lyrical Ballads\" (1800), Austen distances herself from escapist novels; the discipline and innovation she demonstrates is similar to his, and she shows \"that rhetorically less is artistically more.\" She eschewed popular Gothic fiction, stories of terror in which a heroine typically was stranded in a remote location, a castle or abbey (32 novels between 1784 and 1818 contain the word \"abbey\" in their title). Yet in \"Northanger Abbey\" she alludes to the trope, with the heroine, Catherine, anticipating a move to a remote locale. Rather than full-scale rejection or parody, Austen transforms the genre, juxtaposing reality, with descriptions of elegant rooms and modern comforts, against the heroine's \"novel-fueled\" desires. Nor does she completely denigrate Gothic fiction: instead she transforms settings and situations, such that the heroine is still imprisoned, yet her imprisonment is mundane and real – regulated manners and the strict rules of the ballroom. In \"Sense and Sensibility\" Austen presents characters who are more complex than in staple sentimental fiction, according to critic Keymer, who notes that although it is a parody of popular sentimental fiction, \"Marianne in her sentimental histrionics responds to the calculating world ... with a quite justifiable scream of female distress.\"\nRichardson's \"Pamela\", the prototype for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love story with a happy ending, written at a time women were beginning to have the right to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.\n\nAusten had a natural ear for speech and dialogue, according to scholar Mary Lascelles \"Few novelists can be more scrupulous than Jane Austen as to the phrasing and thoughts of their characters.\" Techniques such as fragmentary speech suggest a character's traits and their tone; \"syntax and phrasing rather than vocabulary\" is utilised to indicate social variants. Dialogue reveals a character's mood – frustration, anger, happiness – each treated differently and often through varying patterns of sentence structures. When Elizabeth Bennett rejects Darcy, her stilted speech and the convoluted sentence structure reveals that he has wounded her:\nFrom the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\nAusten's plots highlight women's traditional dependence on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. As an art form, the 18th-century novel lacked the seriousness of its equivalents from the 19th century, when novels were treated as \"the natural vehicle for discussion and ventilation of what mattered in life\". Rather than delving too deeply into the psyche of her characters, Austen enjoys them and imbues them with humour, according to critic John Bayley. He believes that the well-spring of her wit and irony is her own attitude that comedy \"is the saving grace of life\". Part of Austen's fame rests on the historical and literary significance that she was the first woman to write great comic novels. Samuel Johnson's influence is evident, in that she follows his advice to write \"a representation of life as may excite mirth\".\n\nHer humour comes from her modesty and lack of superiority, allowing her most successful characters, such as Elizabeth Bennet, to transcend the trivialities of life, which the more foolish characters are overly absorbed in. Austen used comedy to explore the individualism of women's lives and gender relations, and she appears to have used it to find the goodness in life, often fusing it with \"ethical sensibility\", creating artistic tension. Critic Robert Polhemus writes, \"To appreciate the drama and achievement of Austen, we need to realize how deep was her passion for both reverence and ridicule ... and her comic imagination reveals both the harmonies and the telling contradictions of her mind and vision as she tries to reconcile her satirical bias with her sense of the good.\"\n\nAs Austen's works were published anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels. Sir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, contributed one anonymously. Using the review as a platform to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel, he praised Austen's realism. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately set the tone for almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.\n\nBecause Austen's novels did not conform to Romantic and Victorian expectations that \"powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing\", 19th-century critics and audiences preferred the works of Charles Dickens and George Eliot. In a rare sympathetic review, in this case of \"Emma\" in 1815, Sir Walter Scott wrote that book displayed \"the art of copying from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the reader, instead of the splendid scenes from an imaginary world, a correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\". Though Scott was positive, Austen's work did not match the prevailing aesthetic values of the Romantic \"zeitgeist\". Her novels were republished in Britain from the 1830s and sold at a steady rate, but they were not bestsellers. The first French critic who paid notice to Austen was Philarète Chasles who completely dismissed her as a writer, giving her two sentences in an 1842 essay on the influence of Sir Walter Scott, calling her a boring, imitative writer who wrote nothing of substance. Apart from Chasles, Austen was almost completely ignored in France until 1878.\n\nAusten had many admiring readers in the 19th century who considered themselves part of a literary elite. Philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes expressed this viewpoint in a series of enthusiastic articles published in the 1840s and 1850s. This theme continued later in the century with novelist Henry James, who referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as among \"the fine painters of life\".\n\nThe publication of James Edward Austen-Leigh's \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" in 1869 introduced Austen to a wider public as \"dear aunt Jane\", the respectable maiden aunt. Publication of the \"Memoir\" spurred the reissue of Austen's novels – the first popular editions were released in 1883 and fancy illustrated editions and collectors' sets quickly followed. Author and critic Leslie Stephen described the popular mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\". In 1878, the French critic Léon Boucher published the essay \"Le Roman Classique en Angleterre\", where he called Austen a \"genius\", which was the first time that epithet had been used in France to describe Austen. The first proper translation of Austen into French that was completely faithful to the original occurred in 1899 when Félix Fénéon translated \"Northanger Abbey\" into French as \"Catherine Moreland\". Around the start of the 20th century, members of the literary elite reacted against the popularisation of Austen. They referred to themselves as \"Janeites\" in order to distinguish themselves from the masses who did not properly understand her works. For example, Henry James responded negatively to what he described as \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's \"intrinsic merit and interest\". The American literary critic A. Walton Litz noted that the \"anti-Janites\" in the 19th and 20th centuries comprise a formidable literary squad of Mark Twain, Henry James, Charlotte Bronte, D.H. Lawrence and Kingsley Amis, but in \"every case the adverse judgement merely reveals the special limitations or eccentricities of the critic, leaving Jane Austen relativity untouched\".\n\nSeveral of Austen's works have been subject to academic study. The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883, by George Pellew, a student at Harvard University. The first examination came from a 1911 essay by Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley. In his essay, Bradley groups Austen's novels into \"early\" and \"late\" works, a distinction still used by scholars today. The first academic books devoted to Austen in France was \"Jane Austen\" by Paul and Kate Rague published in 1914, where the Ragues set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously. The same year, Léonie Villard published \"Jane Austen, Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres\", which was originally her PhD thesis, marking the first time that Austen had subjected to a serious academic study in France. The second examination in English was R. W. Chapman's 1923 edition of Austen's collected works. Not only was it the first scholarly edition of Austen's works, it was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works.\n\nWith the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles's \"Jane Austen and Her Art\", the academic study of Austen took hold. Lascelles's innovative work included an analysis of the books Austen read and the effect of her reading on her work, an extended analysis of Austen's style, and her \"narrative art\". Concern arose that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric, a debate that has continued since.\n\nThe period since World War II has seen more scholarship on Austen using a diversity of critical approaches, including feminist theory, and perhaps most controversially, postcolonial theory. The continuing disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern Janeites, and the academic appreciation of Austen has widened considerably. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Austen was in disfavor with the authorities who only wanted Western authors to be published in translation whose work could be presented as representing the West in a negative light, and Austen was regarded as too \"frivolous\" for this purpose. As hostile as the treatment of Austen was in the 1950s, it paled besides the treatment of her books during the \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\" in China between 1966–69, when Austen was banned as a \"British bourgeois imperialist\" author. In the late 1970s, Austen was allowed to be published in China, where her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people sometimes want to read books for enjoyment instead of dialectical purposes. A sign of the way that Austen can still spark debate can be seen when the American English professor Gene Koppel mentioned in a lecture that Austen and her family were \"Tories of the deepest dye\" [the Tories were the conservative party while the Whigs were the liberal party], a statement which greatly upset many of Koppel's liberal students, who much to his amusement, complained to him how was it possible that Austen was a conservative?. The conservative Koppel noted several feminist authors such as Claudia Johnson and Mollie Sandock were claiming Austen for their own cause. Citing the work of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Koppel argued that different people can and do react to the same work of literature in different ways as art is always a subjective discipline as various people have their standards for evaluating literature. As such, Koppel argued that competing interpretations of Austen's work, provided that they are grounded in readings of her work are all equally valid, and so it is equally possible to see Austen as a feminist critiquing Regency society and as a conservative upholding the values of Regency society.\n\nAusten's novels have resulted in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's \"Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance\", and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, \"The Bennets\" (1901). The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.\n\nFrom 1995 a large number of Austen adaptations began to appear, with Ang Lee's film of \"Sense and Sensibility\", for which screenwriter and star Emma Thompson won an Academy Award, and the BBC's immensely popular TV mini-series \"Pride and Prejudice\", starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. A 2005 British production of \"Pride and Prejudice\", directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, was followed in 2007 by ITV's \"Mansfield Park\", \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", and in 2016 by \"Love & Friendship\", a film version of \"Lady Susan\" that borrowed the title of Austen's \"Love and \" [sic].\n\nNovels\n\nUnfinished fiction\n\nOther works\n\nJuvenilia – Volume the First (1787–1793)\n\nJuvenilia – Volume the Second (1787–1793)\n\nJuvenilia – Volume the Third (1787–1793)\n\n\n",
                "Jane Austen in popular culture\n\nThe author Jane Austen, as well as her works, have been represented in popular culture in a variety of forms.\n\nJane Austen (16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist whose social commentary and masterly use of both free indirect speech and irony eventually made her one of the most influential and honoured novelists in English literature. In popular culture, Austen's novels and her personal life have been adapted into book illustration (starting in 1833), dramatizations (starting in 1895), Hollywood film (starting in 1940), television (starting in 1938), and professional theatre (starting in 1901), with adaptations varying greatly in their faithfulness to the original.\n\nBooks and scripts that use the general storyline of Austen's novels but change or otherwise modernise the story also became popular at the end of the 20th century. For example, \"Clueless\" (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of \"Emma\", which takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series, and furthermore near the beginning of the 21st century, nearly two centuries after her death, her works still inform popular culture and cosplay.\nRobert Irvine, a British scholar, wrote that the works of Austen remain a popular source for film makers, who eschew Austen's narrator, rendering a true adaptation impossible. Again, Austen's use of free indirect discourse, where the thoughts of the characters are summarized by the narrator, is generally not followed in the films. It is for this reason that many Austen scholars dislike the 1995 version of \"Sense and Sensibility\" because the absence of a narrator 'glorifies the romantic conventions that Austen deflates'. Likewise, for this reason, many Austen scholars approve of \"Clueless\", an adaptation of \"Emma\" set in a high school in Beverly Hills circa 1995, as the character of Cher Horowitz (the film's version of Emma Woodhouse) narrates several scenes. This is seen as the closest approximation of Austen's style in cinema yet done.\n\nIrvine commented that because cinema and books are different mediums that the best way of resolving this problem was and is for filmmakers to concentrate on the main strength of cinema, namely its visuality, as cinema can depict what the books can only ask the reader to imagine. A recurring image in Austen films is that of women gazing through a window to the outside world, or walking in the countryside. The critic Julianne Pidduck in her essay “Of Windows and Country Walks” argues the former image symbolizes repression and a woman’s lot in Regency England, being trapped in a patriarchal society while the latter image symbolises freedom. The critic Mary Favret in her 2000 essay “Being True to Jane Austen” argued that because film is literally just moving pictures it resists the tendency of photography to have a fixed image, suggesting a world where change is always possible. In this connection Favret praised the 1995 version of \"Persuasion\" as the film used a wandering camera to capture in a kaleidoscopic way Anne Eliot’s unexpressed romantic-sexual feelings even when Anne (Amanda Root) remains still and silent. Irvine noted film adaptations of Austen’s work often used the physicality of the actors to show the sexual desires of the characters that Austen herself only hinted at, with Irving calling a “particularly notorious” example of this being the scene from the 1995 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\", where Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) dives into a pond and emerges with wet clothes clinging to his body before a clearly interested Miss Bennet (Jennifer Ehle).\n\nThe emphasis on the physicality of the actors to express emotions together with abandonment of the narrator has divided critics. Rebecca Dickson has complained that “strong and self-sufficient Elinor” of \"Sense and Sensibility\" became “a girl woman with unexpressed emotions who must learn to demonstrate them” in the Ang Lee film. By contrast, Penny Gay praised the 1995 version of \"Sense and Sensibility\" for portraying “the characters’ experiences as \"bodies\"'” as offering up a filmic version of the experiences of women Irvine argued that the emphasis on physicality of the actors is necessary once the voice of the narrator is eliminated as films used movements, looks and gestures to express emotions, requiring “…that all characters become physically and transparently expressive in a way that only problem cases such as Marianne Dashwood indulge in the novels”. Cheryl Nixon defended Mr. Darcy’s precipitous plunge into the pond as necessary to show the viewer that he was capable of depths of emotional and physical passion that the novel only implied to help explain why Miss Bennet falls in love with him.\n\nAnother issue concerning adaptations of Austen is that of gender, especially the portrayal of women. Some critics, such as Devoney Looser, have argued that by portraying strong women who are intelligent and socially adept and by emphasising the theme of sisterhood both literally between sisters and metaphorically between female friends the Austen films become feminist films. Other critics such as Kristen Samuelian and Shannon Wooden have argued that Austen films are in fact “post-feminist” films where women first encounter patriarchy before going on to live happier ever after with the men of their dreams in the patriarchal society of Regency England. Wooden also argued the 1996 version of \"Emma\", \"Clueless\", \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Persuasion\" all use the food imagery of the Austen books, where a fasting is a form of female protest, but in contrast to the books “…juxtapose food with representations or discussions of physical beauty, making a very late twentieth-century connection between not eating and feminine social and sexual success”. Other critics like Martine Vioret have noted Austen films tended “to cater to female desires and to the female gaze” by their focus on the bodies of actors, dressed in close-fitting breeches in a way that fetishises the male body at a time when the male body was still the \"locus of the beautiful\". It is often noted that Austen films tended to portray the male body in a way that is normally associated with the filmic depiction of the female body as a source of pleasure to the male viewer. Irvine described the Austen films as a fantasy for women, with, for example, the character of Mr. Darcy displaying an \"absolute and unconditioned male need for a woman\".\n\nAnother issue around the Austen films is their relation to the question of English and British national identity. In Britain, the Austen films are seen as a part of the “heritage industry”-an overlapping collection of government ministries, pressure groups and charities that seeks to preserve the “national heritage” by protecting landscapes and old buildings. Irvine observed that the buildings selected for preservation tended to be estates, castles and manor houses associated with the elite, which sends the message that the story of Britain is the story of its elites. The Austen films which are focused on the visual splendor of Regency England are seen as “heritage films” that are an extension of the “heritage industry”. Prior to 1995, television adaptations of Austen tended to be done on the cheap, but the 1995 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" was an expensive production that was filmed on location in the English countryside with Lyme Park playing Pemberly that was a great ratings success, settling the benchmark for subsequent productions. Afterwards, it became \"de rigueur\" for Austen films to be visually sumptuous, no-expenses spared productions while the National Trust billed Lyme Park as the centerpiece of the “Pemberley Trail” for Janeites to go on a pilgrimage. Because the Austen adaptations are seen as celebrating a certain ideal of an “eternal England”, there is a tendency to see both the film and television productions as implicitly conservative productions glorifying the ordered society of Regency England.\n\nHowever, Irvine has cautioned against seeing all of the Austen films as carrying a conservative message Citing the Marxist historian Raphael Samuel, Irvine argued that Britain’s heritage belongs to everyone and the memory of the past is used by disadvantaged groups just as much by advantaged groups to construct an “useable” version of British history. For instance, many of the Austen films are seen as offering a feminist critique of patriarchy of the Regency period. The leftist historian Edward Neill praised the 1996 television version of \"Emma\" released on ITV as superior to the film version of \"Emma\" released by Miramax that same year. Neill pointed out that in the Hollywood version of \"Emma\" there are no servants while there are vast armies of servants in the background in the ITV version, many of them performing patently absurd tasks. Likewise, Neill noted that the poor are nowhere to be seen in the Hollywood version of \"Emma\" while in the ITV version there are all sorts of starving people in the background Another critic Roger Sales noted that \"frequent women in windows imaginary\" suggested that the country estates of the gentry and aristocracy were in fact “genteel prisons” for women, which Irvine argued was inconsistent with the claim that the Austen films were a conservative fantasy of a lost idyll of an ordered society. The 1999 version of \"Mansfield Park\" by the Canadian director Patricia Rozema gave Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor) dialogue from some of Austen’s especially acerbic letters, attacked Sir Thomas Bertram as a tyrant for owning slaves on his estate in Antigua and added in a quasi-lesbian scene not in the book where Mary Crawford waxes eloquent to Price about how only women can really understand the pleasures that their bodies can produce, which seems to be Crawford's way of trying to seduce Price. Irvine praised Rozema's version of \"Mansfield Park\" as a way that adaptions of Austen can be used to offer a critical picture of the society of Regency England where power was concentrated into the hands of upper-class men who belonged to the Church of England and some of whom owned slaves on plantations in the Caribbean.\n\nA particular issue for Austen adaptations is the way Austen has become a form of “cultural capital” for one to assert one’s social superiority. In this regard, Austen has become a “brand”, which is especially potent as the “Austen brand” has both high cultural connotations and mass appeal. Irvine commented that as painful as this may be to English professors like himself, at least part of the mass appeal of the Austen films today is due to a “perceived continuity” between Austen’s novels and the modern “bodice rippers”; historical pulp novels published by such companies as Silhouette, Harlequin and Mills and Boon. A recurring complaint made by critics concerns the “harlequinization” of Austen on the silver screen, which is seen as cheapening and dumbing down Austen for a mass audience. However, Irvine noted that in Austen’s own lifetime, her work was popular, but seen as low culture, being lumped in at British libraries together with “popular fiction” books that were the ancestors of the Harlequin romances. The idea that Austen was a high culture writer only started later, and certainly the appeal of the Austen films to many today seems to be that they are seen as a high culture version of Harlequin romances. Andrew Davies, the producer who has made a career of adopting Austen for film, has confessed as much to the charge of “harlequinization”, saying he liked \"a bit of bodice-rippling\" when he turned Austen's books into films. The American critic Dianne F. Sadoff wrote disapproving of Davies's efforts to add in the scenes that he asserts that \"Austen couldn't write\" but claims that she wanted to write. Sadoff took issue with the 2007 version of \"Northanger Abbey\" in which Davies added scenes of Catherine Moreland imagining being kidnapped and subjected to semi-consensual sado-masochistic sex, and the 2008 version of \"Sense and Sensibility\" which begins with a seduction scene mentioned as only happening a long time ago in the novel.\n\nA testament to the appeal of the Austen films is that the most lucrative market for these films today is the United States, not the United Kingdom. On 3 August 2007, the debut of \"Becoming Jane\" took in almost $1 million US in its first weekend, low compared to \"Superbad\" which took $31 million US in its opening weekend the following week, but a highly respectable showing for a heritage film set in Regency England and starring a mostly British cast unfamiliar to American audiences. \"Becoming Jane\" ran for ten weeks in the United States and ultimately took in a profit of $19 million US. The American scholar Dianne Sadoff wrote that Hollywood likes Austen film adaptions because Hollywood producers love films with an audience that exists in advance, and as millions of people have read Austen's novels all over the world, making Austen films into the most desirable of films, the \"premier pre-sold product\". Furthermore, Sadoff noted that Austen films are popular with a female audience that ranges in age from teenage girls to middle-aged women, instead of appealing to a narrow demographic. Sadoff wrote the most recent adaptions of Austen were done in a way that was calculated to appeal to young women. Sadoff used as examples the 2005 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Keira Knightley, which brought \"swashbuckler girlfriend sex appeal and postfeminist agency\" to Austen, and \"Becoming Jane\" starring Anne Hathaway, which presented Austen as a modern career woman who just happened to be living in Georgian England. Sadoff wrote that both films have heroines with \"...bared chests and swelling cleavage above Regency gown decolletage\", perfectly \"coiled hair\" and looks of \"wide-eyed intensity\" that were meant both to arouse teenage boys and excite envy in teenage girls.\n\nAt least part of appeal of Austen films in the modern United States is that they deal directly with the subject of class, which American filmmakers generally prefer to avoid. Americans like to see their nation as a meritocracy where everyone regardless of their skin color, sex, and income level is completely equal with exactly the same opportunities in life regardless of who they are, and the suggestion that some Americans might be disadvantaged because of their race, sex and/or income level is a painful one, implying their nation is not living up to its ideals. American filmmakers often avoid confronting the subject of class especially; by contrast the Austen films set in Regency England are far away enough both in time and in geography to raise the subject of class without imposing discomfort on an American audience. Likewise, in Georgian Britain, the only roles possible for a woman in polite society were those of a wife and mother, which means that Austen films can deal starkly with sexism in ways that films set in contemporary times often do not. Irvine noted in \"Clueless\", the characters are only concerned with being “cool”, as there is almost no suggestion in the film of any class, racial and sexual barriers in southern California, circa 1995, as the only social line that matters is the one between \"cool\" and \"uncool\". Only with the minor character of the put-upon El Salvadoran maid who works for the Horowitz family, whom Cher keeps calling a \"Mexican\", does \"Clueless\" imply that there might be some inequality in modern America. However, Irvine noted that American audiences cannot entirely embrace the social hierarchy of Georgian England, based as it was on land and birth, and instead the 1996 version of \"Emma\" offered up a hierarchy based on consumption and luxury conferred by access to cash, in short a society very much like the modern United States. \n\nOne of the few American Austen films to confront class directly in a modern settling was the 1990 film \"Metropolitan\" by the American director Whit Stillman, where a group of wealthy “old money” New Yorkers talk openly about how Austen is part of their “cultural capital” that sets them apart from vulgar “new money”. \"Metropolitan\" is a very loose adaption of \"Mansfield Park\", reset in New York, circa 1989. A particular point \"Metropolitan\" made was how Austen by the 1980s had become part of the “cultural capital” of the “old money” Anglophile East Coast elite that they used to distinguish themselves from people like Donald Trump, with one character approvingly quoting Lionel Trilling's remark that \"not to like Jane Austen is to put oneself under suspicion...of a want of breeding\". Irvine argued that Austen offers a particular appeal to American conservatives in that the sort of ordered society that they used to openly admire and were nostalgic for, namely that of the South up to 1865, is now racially unacceptable to admire given that the antebellum Southern economy was based on slavery. Irvine noted that both the 1935 book and the 1939 film of \"Gone With The Wind\" were extremely popular at the time, but today are rather controversial given the way that both versions of \"Gone With The Wind\" glorify a society based on slavery and white supremacy. \"Gone With The Wind\" was inspired at least in concept by D. W. Griffith's 1915 film \"The Birth of a Nation\", which in its turn was based on the violently racist 1905 novel \"\" by Thomas Dixon Jr.. Margaret Mitchell, the author of \"Gone With The Wind\" was greatly influenced by Dixon's novels, which misrepresented the Reconstruction era as a nightmarish time where blacks, not longer slaves, ran amok raping and murdering white women with impunity, and openly admitted that \"Gone With The Wind\" would not had been possible without Dixon's books, all of which she had read. Irvine noted that the 1940 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" released by MGM moved the story from Regency England to Victorian times to make it seem similar to \"Gone With The Wind\", and the film was marketed at the time as an epic 19th century love story analogous to \"Gone With The Wind\". There were no slaves in late Georgian Britain (Lord Justice Mansfield declared slavery illegal in the United Kingdom in 1772)-through slavery was the basis of the economies of the British West Indian colonies until 1833-making Regency England a more acceptable ordered society to be nostalgic for in modern America. Irvine however cautioned that one “should not be too quick to attribute the success of the Austen adaptations in the US to an implicitly racist Anglophila”. Irvine argued that the success of Austen in America was due to the way she could be presented as offering “cultural capital” to those who were and are willing to take the time to read her novels, and to a nostalgia for the perceived better and simpler times of Regency England.\n\nAusten is generally very popular across Asia, not just in South Asia. \n\nThe global appeal of Austen today can be seen in that Bollywood regularly produces versions of Austen's books reset in modern India and adjusted to the style of Indian films, which forbid kissing and always include a number of musical numbers regardless of whether they have any connection to the plot. Austen's books often feature match-making parents, which gives her stories a particular resonance in India, where the majority of marriages are still arranged today. The British colony of India, which was ruled by the East India Company until 1858, and as a Crown colony from 1858 to 1947, came to include all of modern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. English as an academic discipline began in 19th century India as British officials of the Raj set out to teach English to their Indian subjects, and as a result, any middle-class Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi from the time of the Raj until the present is familiar with Austen's books, giving her books the sort of \"cultural capital\" appeal in modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh similar to the United States. Austen's stories which feature \"love marriages\" as the heroine marries a man with whom she falls in love with, and gains the approval of her parents in the process, are very popular with women from middle-class Indian families, the vast majority of whom are in or are destined for arranged marriages set up by their parents to men that they generally don't know. In India, \"Sense and Sensibility\" has turned into the 2000 Tamil language film \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" and the 2014 Hindi language soap opera \"Kumkum Bhagya\"; \"Emma\" has adopted as the 2010 film \"Aisha\"; and \"Pride and Prejudice\" into the 2004 film \"Bride and Prejudice\". In \"Bride and Prejudice\", Elizabeth Bennet becomes Lalita Bakshi (Aishwarya Rai), the daughter of a Sikh grandee living in a decaying mansion left over by the Raj in Amritsar; Mr. Darcy is an American billionaire visiting the Punjab to attend a wedding; Mr. Bingley becomes Mr. Balraj, a second generation Indo-British lawyer who has come to the Punjab in search of a traditional Sikh woman to marry; Lieutenant Wickham becomes Johnny Wickham, a British backpacker looking for the \"real India\"; and Mr. Collins becomes Mr. Kholi, a sanctimonious Sikh who has made a fortune in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe largest market for Austen's books are in India and Pakistan, where the themes of \"marrying off\" young women to rid families of the burdens of supporting them, the importance of the family as a social unit, dowries as a factor in marriage negotiations and inheritance laws that favor males all address issues that are relevant in both India and Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan have large Austen societies with the Pakistani Austen Society hosting events for \"Jovial Janeites” that feature “Austentatious tea parties” and “chai and chatter”. Laaleen Khan, the founder of the Jane Austen Society of Pakistan, told \"The Economist\" that Austen is relevant in the Indian subcontinent because society in South Asia is full of “disapproving Lady Catherine de Bourgh-esque society aunties, rakish Wickhams and Willoughbys, pretentious Mrs Eltons and holier-than thou Mr Collins types”. \n\nAusten was unknown in Japan until the Meiji Restoration of 1867 opened Japan up to Western influence, and even then Austen was largely ignored. Japanese translators preferred adventure stories from the West, which fitted in better with the stories of samurai, which were the most popular novels in Meiji Japan. The Greek/Irish scholar Lafcadio Hearn, who became the first Western scholar to teach in Japan, warned his Japanese students in his lectures that they would not like Austen, as the sort of violence which was normal in samurai stories was completely absent in Austen's novels. The first Japanese critic to draw attention to Austen was the influential writer Natsume Sōseki who in his 1907 book \"A Theory of Literature\" wrote that: “Anyone who is unable to appreciate Austen will be unable to understand the beauty of realism.” Sōseki, who was fluent in English, lived in London from 1900 to 1903, where he first discovered Austen, who he regarded as having achieved his ideal of \"sokuten kyoshi\" (literally “follow Heaven, forsake the self”-a writer should follow his/her instincts and write stories that have no traces of their own personality in them). At the time of his death in 1916, Sōseki was writing a novel \"Meian\" (\"Light and Darkness\"), which reset \"Pride and Prejudice\" in Taishō era Japan. Unlike \"Pride and Prejudice\", the couple Tsuda and O-Nobu are already married at the beginning of the novel, and Sōseki traced how pride and prejudice was pushing their marriage apart rather than be an obstacle to be overcome as Mr. Darcy courted Elizabeth Bennet in Austen's story. Sōseki followed Austen in using everyday life and apparently banal conversations to trace how the mutual pride of Tsuda and O-Nobu push them apart despite the fact that they both love each other.\n\nAusten was first translated into Japanese in 1926 when Nogami Toyoichirō and his wife Nogami Yaeko translated \"Pride and Prejudice\". Nogami Yaeko liked Austen so much that she published a novel in 1928, \"Machiko\", set in Taishō era Japan, that featured the heroine Machiko who was inspired by Elizabeth Bennet. \"Machiko\" also features a radical named Seki who resembles Wickham who castigates the social order imposed by the \"kokutai\" and whom Machiko almost marries until she learns that he impregnated her friend Yoneko whom he was seeing at the same time that he was courting her. The hero of the book is Kawai, an archeologist and the wealthy heir to the Kawai Financial Group, who makes a determined pursuit of Machiko despite her repeated rejections of him on both social and political grounds, and finally proves himself worthy of her by giving up his fortune to help out the impoverished and striking workers at a factory his family owes. Unlike \"Pride and Prejudice\" where the war with France only exists in the background, \"Machiko\" deals directly with turmoil of Taishō era Japan where strikes were frequent, much of the younger \"intelligentsia\" were questioning the \"kokutai\" and admired the Russian Revolution, and the police waged a vigorous campaign against those accused of \"thought crimes\". In 1925, the Imperial Diet passed the Peace Preservation Law, which made the very act of thinking about \"altering the \"kokutai\"\" a crime; the specific thoughts that were made illegal were republicanism, pacifism, and advocating the end of private property. Those found by the police to be thinking these forbidden thoughts served lengthy prison sentences and were subjected to \"Tenkō\" (\"changing direction\"), a process of brain-washing where left-wing activists were brain-washed to worship the Emperor as a living god. In \"Machiko\", which was published at a time when censorship was much less stricter in Japan is set in the midst of these struggles as Machiko and her fellow activists are constantly having to avoid the police. At same time, Nogami attacked the double standard of male radicals who preached justice for the masses, but refused to treat women as equals, seeing the duty of female radicals just to be their obliging bedmates, and nothing more. In \"Pride and Prejudice\", Wickham marries Lydia Bennet, which makes him part of the family so Elizabeth Bennet has to be civil to him, while in \"Machiko\", Machiko repudiates Seki outright, saying his dishonesty and his contempt for women makes him unworthy of her.\n\nAusten went out of favor in Japan during the militarist period in the early Showa era (1931-1945) when a xenophobic, ultra-nationalist mood prevailed, and the government discouraged people from reading foreign books. But during the period of the American occupation (1945-52), almost every Austen book was translated into Japanese except \"Mansfield Park\" (which was not translated until 1978), and Austen started to be widely taught in Japanese high schools. The translation of \"Sense and Sensibility\" in 1947, followed by a translation of \"Pride and Prejudice\" in 1950 were published by the prestigious publishing house Iwanami Shoten, and both books sold very well. The success of the Iwanami versions of \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\" was the moment that Austen became respectable in Japan. In 1963, the critic Yamamoto Kenkichi, in his essay “The Smile of \"Pride and Prejudice\"” that proved to be influential, criticized Japanese literature for being overtly solemn and praised Austen for her “natural ease”, which led him to conclude: “Collins, Wickham, Mrs. Bennet, Lady Catherine, how she turns her laughter on these minor characters. They are observed with some malice, certainly, but in a pleasant, mischievous, irreverent manner which ultimately accords salvation to even these fools”. Austen has been regarded as a major writer in Japan since the 1950s, and in 2007, the Jane Austen Society of Japan was founded to provide a space for Japanese Janeites. In 2015-2016, \"manga\" versions of \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"Emma\", and \"Sense and Sensibility\" were published in Japan.\n\nA Japanese writer very much influenced by Austen was Yumiko Kurahashi. In her 1971 novel \"Yume no ukihashi\" (\"The Bridge of Dreams\"), the heroine Keiko is a graduate student working on a thesis concerning Austen's books, an interest that paralleled the author's as \"Yume no ukihashi\" is in many ways a resetting of an Austen novel in modern Japan. However, the climax of the novel where Keiko learns that parents of her boyfriend Kōichi and her parents have been engaged in a four-sided sexual relationship for many years, and Kōichi might very well be her brother, is unlike of the denouements of any of Austen's books. The Japanese scholar Ebine Hiroshi described \"Yume no ukihashi\" as a fusion between an Austen novel and the fascination with breaking sexual taboos like incest which often characterizes Japanese literature. Even after learning that Kōichi is quite possibly her brother, Keiko cannot give him up as their souls have crossed the \"bridge of dreams\" to “the other side of the world” where they have been fused together, which leads her despite being married to another man to engage a \"ménage à quatre\" with Kōichi and his wife; the novel ends with Keiko meeting Kōichi in Kyoto while her husband calls her to say he is spending the night with Kōichi's wife. Hiroshi wrote in \"Yume no ukihashi\" Kurahashi created a heroine, Keiko, who is a many ways an Austen heroine with her quiet nature and calm dignity that hides a passionate, romantic side while at the same time the book was concerned with the mystical \"other side\", a supernatural world of power, mystery and dread that can only be glimpsed which co-exists alongside our world, a uniquely Japanese concern that would have been alien to Austen.\n\nIn Turkey Austen was first introduced at the so-called \"foreign schools\" for foreigners domiciled in the Ottoman Empire, in which Turks were also allowed to enroll in the late 19th century. Initially, Turks only read Austen in the English original, and the first novel to be translated into Turkish was \"Sense and Sensibility\" as \"Sağduyu ve Duyarlık\" in two volumes in 1946 and 1948. Austen first came to widespread notice in Turkey in the late 1960s when Nihal Yeğinobalı started translating Austen with her first translation being \"Pride and Prejudice\" as \"Aşk ve Gurur\" (\"Love and Pride\"). Yeğinobalı's translations of Austen removed much of the irony in the original, replaced the free indirect discourse with speeches by the characters and made changes to the plot and characters to make Austen fit into the style of popular Turkish romances. Yeğinobalı's translations are the ones by which Austen is best known in Turkey. The Turkish scholar Rana Tekcan wrote that Yeğinobalı was not particularly faithful to Austen, but it is very difficult to translate English novels into Turkish as in the Turkish language the predicate always comes at the end of a sentence, which is not the case in English. It was not 2006 that Austen was first translated properly into Turkish when \"Pride and Prejudice\" was translated as \"Gurur ve Önyargı\" by Hamdi Koç, who at present is engaged in translating the rest of Austen's novels into Turkish. \"Gurur ve Önyargı\" sold out in its first year, and a second edition was issued in 2007, which Tekcan used to argue that many Turks wanted a proper version of Austen in their own language. Austen's status in modern Turkey can be seen in the Wikipedia-like website \"Ekşi Sözlük\" (\"The Sourtimes Dictionary\"), when anonymous contributors write articles on various subjects; typing Jane Austen on the \"Ekşisözlük\" produces comments such as “Jane Austen is for those who are ashamed to read romance novels”and “The characters that Jane Austen created still live in the likes of a neighbor who is dying to get her daughters married to rich men.”.\n\nSuch is the appeal of Austen in Asia that during the period when Korea was a Japanese colony (1905-1945) Austen was first translated into Korean as the Japanese colonial administration- which always justified itself on the grounds that Korea was hopelessly backward and in need of Japanese rule to progress- sought to use Austen's books as an example of the sort of cultural progress the country was experiencing under Japanese rule. It should be noted that in Asia during this period, books by Western authors were always seen as embodying modernity and progress, and thus Austen in colonial Korea was presented as a symbol of modernity, at least during the so-called \"Cultural Rule\" period (1920-37) when Japanese rule was more moderate as compared to prior and succeeding periods. The South Korean writer Park Wansuh wrote two novels influenced by \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"A Faltering Afternoon\" (1977) and \"Pride and Fantasy\" (1980) both set in Yusin era South Korea. In \"A Faltering Afternoon\", three sisters from a lower middle-class background who resemble Elizabeth, Jane and Lydia Bennet respectively find that their only hope of social-economic success comes with marrying the right men. Unlike \"Pride and Prejudice\", two of the Ho sisters' relationships end unhappily and only Ho Malhi, the sister who resembles Elizabeth Bennet, ends up well with her choice of a man. Hŏ Sŏng, the once successful small businessman who was now struggling as the \"chaebol\" came to dominate the South Korean economy in the 1970s, resembled Mr. Bennet as he watches his daughters' \"quest\" to find the ideal husband, through unlike him, Hŏ ends up committing suicide on the day of his daughter's wedding. In \"Pride and Fantasy\", Park took on one of the most painful subjects in South Korea at the time, namely the fact that the \"Chinilpa\" elite who had served Japan in the colonial period was the same elite that ruled South Korea in the 1970s. General Park Chung-hee, the military dictator of South Korea from 1961 until his assassination in 1979, had started his career as an officer in the Manchukuo Army and served with the Kwantung Army in its campaigns to \"pacify\" Manchukuo. During Park's rule, he applied the same methods he learned in Japanese service to his own people, and in the 1960s-70s, South Korea was one of the world's worst human rights abusers. \"Pride and Fantasy\" concerns the relationship between two men, one of whom is a male version of Elizabeth Bennet, and the other whom resembles Mr. Darcy. The Bennet-like Namsang came from a family that resisted Japanese rule and were ruined as a result while the Darcy-like Hyǒn comes from a \"chinilpa\" family that became fabulously rich by collaborating with the Japanese. \n\nThe character of Elizabeth Bennet with her stubborn individualism and nonconformity with social norms was popular in South Korea during the stifling rule of General Park, at least in part as a reaction to his attempts to crush individualism and promote conformity. However, the South Korean scholar Park You-me noted that for a certain generation of Korean Janeites like her mother, who lived through the years 1937-45, when the Japanese state tried to stamp out the Korean language and culture, mobilized society for total war, and forced thousands of Korean young women into the \"comfort women corps\", turning women's bodies literally into commodities to be exploited, leading to a situation where :\"My mother's suspicion of Austen's moral authority is representative of Korean female readers' reception of Austen's novels following the Japanese occupation of Korea and the Korean War\". Park wrote that as much as her mother loved Austen that she always regarded Austen's novels as fantasy works, depicting a world that had never existed and could never exist ever, as it was the fate of women to be exploited and abused. In 2014, the highest rated TV series in South Korea was \"Omangwa Pyungyeon\" (\"Lawless World\"), a resettling of \"Pride and Prejudice\" in modern South Korea in a prosecutor's office. \"Omangwa Pyungyeon\" which aired between October 2014-January 2015 concerned a relationship between a passionate novice prosecutor and her more experienced and snooty colleague. Beyond the specific adaptions, many critics have noted that the heroes of Korean soap operas owe much to Mr. Darcy.\n\nThe Iranian writer Azar Nafisi recalled teaching Austen secretly in Iran in the 1990s (in the Islamic Republic of Iran Austen is banned as a \"degenerate\" Western writer) to a group of teenage girls who loved Austen's stories which feature women who fall in love with men who are worthy of their affections, which was so different from their own lives. Nafisi noted in the Islamic Republic of Iran where wife-beating is legal, \"love is forbidden, banished from the public sphere\" and sex is \"violently suppressed\", her students fell in love with an author whose books feature female \"rebels\" who defiantly say \"no\" to \"silly mothers\", \"incompetent fathers\" and a \"rigidly orthodox society\", and moreover get away with it. An American academic who went on \"Radio Times\" web broadcast to talk about Austen recalled being besieged with callers of an Asian background. One Iranian woman, living in the United States, called in to say she had first read Austen after her teenage daughter brought home \"Sense and Sensibility\", which made her cry as she had experienced nothing like this in her own culture, where dating is forbidden and marriages are arranged. Another caller was a Chinese woman whose first Austen book was \"Pride and Prejudice\", which she read in translation after the ban in China on Austen had been lifted after the end of the Cultural Revolution, saying she nothing read anything so moving and romantic before. The Chinese woman added after seeing all of the violence and horror of the Cultural Revolution when the streets of China were soaked with human blood, so many lives were ruined, and so many had behaved so badly that reading \"Pride and Prejudice\" she gave her hope in humanity again.\n\nThe novels of Jane Austen were unknown in China until 1917 when Wei Yi mentioned Austen in her book \"Brief Profiles of Famous Western Novelists\" where she was described as \"one of the celebrated English novelists\". Only a few western novels were translated in China during the 19th century, and it was not until 1898 when Lin Shu translated \"Camille\" by Alexandre Dumas, which unexpectedly become a bestseller, that Chinese publishers became interested in western books. Austen was first translated into Chinese in 1935, when two editions of \"Pride and Prejudice\" were published in Beijing and Shanghai. After 1949 Austen was out of favor in the People's Republic of China as a \"bourgeois\" author whose work was considered frivolous. In the 1950s most of the foreign books published in the People's Republic were translations of Soviet books, and Western authors were only translated into Chinese if they were \"revolutionary\" writers like Lord Byron or if their books portrayed Western societies in an unflattering light like Charles Dickens; Austen did not serve either purpose very well. In 1956, Austen was first translated in the People's Republic when \"Pride and Prejudice\" was published in Beijing, with an introduction by the translator explaining how the translation was justified on Marxist grounds as the novel showed the decline of feudalism and rise of capitalism in England. In 1965 Dong Hengxun, an academic, condemned Austen in an article titled \"The Description of Love in \"Pride and Prejudice\"\" in the \"Guangming Daily\" as \"artistically insignificant\". Austen was banned along with other Western authors in China during the Cultural Revolution and during the 1980s, translations of Austen were grudgingly allowed, though officially Austen remained out of favor. The first Chinese academic in the People's Republic to write favorably of Austen was Zhu Hong, who complained in his 1986 essay \"The Pride and Prejudice against Jane Austen\" that ordinary people liked Austen well enough, but academics had to condemn her because of the Party line, which led him to ask for books to be judged on artistic grounds only. In the 1990s Communist Party condemnations of Austen ceased, and a number of Chinese students produced dissertations on Austen, with Austen being very popular with female students. In 2011 one Chinese academic, Zhang Helong, wrote about Austen's \"huge popularity\" in modern China. In 2017, \"The Economist\" noted that in China: \"... Austen is seen as having a particular affinity with Chinese culture, where “manners matter” as they did in Georgian England.\" \"Pride and Prejudice\" has been translated into Chinese at least 50 times while \"Sense and Sensibility\" has been translated 10 times in the last decades. Austen's ideal hero as a property-owning gentleman has resonance in China, where a well-off man with good education and manners who owes land is the considered the ideal man. In 2010, Sadoff wrote that the growing appeal of Austen in Asia ensures that market for Austen films continues to grow, and it is possible Asia would soon replace the United States as the largest market for Austen films, if it has not already done so.\n\nIn the United States, Austen was described in 2013 as the object of \"wildly devotional fan-worship\" with conventions, parties and fan fiction. One American Janeite, Myretta Robens, was quoted to a BBC reporter as saying: \"There's a longing for the elegance of the time. It's an escape.\" When asked why so many American Janeites write fan fiction, Robens stated: \"Quite frankly, I think a lot of people want more sex, particularly with Elizabeth and Darcy.\" Another American Janeite, Laurel Ann Nattress explained the appeal of Austen fan fiction in the U.S. as: \"People just love her characters and they don't want to give them up.\" Nattress argued that the popularity of Austen in America was due mostly to a strong Anglophile streak in America, saying: \"I think that we look back to the motherland in many respects. Look at the incredible impact \"Downton Abbey\" has had over here. It's a perfect example of how America is fascinated by British culture.\" Robbens explained to a BBC reporter the mostly female readership of Austen in America; \"It's women, in general, who fall in love with them. It's a truth universally acknowledged that women want to read about relationships.\"\n\nMore recently, Austen has been appropriated by the Alt-right with the American scholar Nicole Wright writing that the alt-right is obsessed with Austen variously as: \"... 1) symbol of sexual purity; 2) standard-bearer of a vanished white traditional culture; and 3) exception that proves the rule of female inferiority.\" Wright wrote many of the alt-right leaders who paraphrased Austen like Milo Yiannopoulos do not know much about her, noting that Yiannupoulos called Austen a \"Victorian\" writer. In a speech, Yiannupoulos had said: \"As a Victorian novelist might have put it, it is a truth universally acknowledged that an ugly woman is far more likely to be a feminist than a hot one.\" Wright wrote that the alt-right used Austen as a way of trying to make themselves seem more wholesome, writing:\"By comparing their movement not to the nightmare Germany of Hitler and Goebbels, but instead to the cozy England of Austen — a much-beloved author with a centuries-long fandom and an unebbing academic following — the alt-right normalizes itself in the eyes of ordinary people. It also subtly panders to the nostalgia of the Brexiters, with their vision of a better, bygone Britain. Such references nudge readers who happen upon alt-right sites to think that perhaps white supremacists aren’t so different from mainstream folks.<br>But these men are distorting Austen’s work; her novels are hardly blueprints for an \"ethnostate.\" Instead, they serve as antidotes against the strategies used by the alt-right movement. After all, Austen’s heroines come to distrust men who beguile others through charismatic bluster and expedient lying (Exhibit A: Willoughby). Indeed, Austen inoculates her readers against trusting the autocrats cheered by the alt-right: her female characters come to regret taking up with coarse men (such as Rushworth in \"Mansfield Park\") who are propped up by inherited wealth that initially dazzles those around them, but which cannot compensate for astonishing ignorance, flouting of decorum, and lack of empathy. Marianne and Maria learn those life lessons the hard way, but they do learn in the end, and they eventually abandon the duplicitous grifters and foolish scions. May it be so with us, and may we never see a day with alt-right \"post-truths\" universally acknowledged.\" One American scholar, Elaine Bander, expressed considerable annoyance about the appropriation of Austen by the alt-right, writing: \"No one who reads Jane Austen’s words with any attention and reflection can possibly be alt-right. All the Janeites I know are rational, compassionate, liberal-minded people.\" The American journalist Jennifer Schuessler reported this appropriation of Austen is very common, citing the remarks of a graduate student Tracey Hutchings-Goetz, who was surprised to see the Wikipedia article about \"Pride and Prejudice\" describe the novel as celebrating traditional marriage supported by citations to an on-line article from the conservative Catholic magazine \"Crisis\", saying to Schuessler: \"It was a version of the novel that didn’t make any sense to us as scholars, supported by a completely unscholarly source\".\n\nThe American author Amy Elizabeth Smart visited several Latin American countries in 2011 to see where Austen stood in that part of the world. Smart was at first concerned that a British author like Austen would not be popular in Guatemala, where most of the people are Maya Indians. But she found Austen fitted in well with the Maya, intensely family-oriented people who criticized her for not taking her own family with her to Guatemala, saying how could she possibly leave her parents behind in America. Smart discovered that Austen's picture of close-knit families in the English countryside was to the Maya comparable to their own existence in the Guatemalan countryside. When Smart asked her Guatemalan students if the story of \"Pride and Prejudice\" could take place in modern Guatemala, the unanimous answer was yes. Smart found her Guatemalan students related to \"Pride and Prejudice\" better than her American students as the general expectation in Guatemala is that a woman should be married by her early twenties, just as was the case in Regency England, whereas her American students have trouble understanding why Elizabeth Bennet was risking social disgrace by turning down two marriage proposals. Moreover, Smart's Guatemalan students found the subject of class prejudices in Regency England more compelling than her American students, with many also saying racial prejudices against the Maya by Guatemala's \"Criollo\" elite made them relate to Elizabeth Bennet's struggle for acceptance from the Hertfordshire elite. Smart reported class discussions in the United States about \"Pride and Prejudice\" did not automatically lead to the subject of racism while in Guatemala, her students always brought up the racism against the Maya when discussing Miss Bennet's struggle against the gentry and aristocracy of Hertfordshire. By contrast, in Paraguay, where the majority of the population are Guaraní Indians, Smart discovered that hardly anyone knew who Austen was, and much of her class was indifferent to the books. Smart suggested that the War of the Triple Alliance, which wiped out most of the Paraguayan population between 1864-70 with Paraguay going from 1 million to 200, 000 people, had left a grim, death-obsessed mentality in Paraguay where the macabre was celebrated and where Austen simply could not fit into.\n\nIn Mexico, where Smart asked a group of local women in Puerto Vallarta if the plot of \"Sense and Sensibility\" had any relevance in modern Mexico, she was told by one woman: \"No, the book's really relevant...Things then, in her country, are just the same way here and now. Look at Willoughby, taking advantage of women. Men here do that all the time. And Marianne, marrying more for the sake of being married than for being in love. Women are here are afraid to be single. It is very hard\". In Ecuador, Smart discovered that Ecuadoran men all detested the character of Mr. Darcy with one man telling her Darcy deserved \"\"Es de matarlo a palos\"\" (\"to be beaten to death with a stick\") while Ecuadoran women were much more fond of the character, saying he did not deserved to be beaten to death with a stick as their menfolk were insisting upon. The Ecuadorans tended to regard Austen as more of a fantasy writer, describing life in Regency England that was simply inconceivable in modern Ecuador, with one reader of \"Pride and Prejudice\" telling Smart that none of the characters from that book would last a day in Guayaquil.\n\nIn 2007, Anne Hathaway starred as Austen in \"Becoming Jane.\" Based on the biography \"Becoming Jane Austen\" by Jon Hunter Spence, the film centred on Jane Austen's early life, her development as an author, and the posited romantic relationship with Thomas Langlois Lefroy (James McAvoy).\n\n\"Miss Austen Regrets\", a television film starring Olivia Williams as Jane Austen, was released in the same year. Based on Austen's surviving letters, the semi-biographical television movie focused on the last few years of Jane Austen's life as she looked back on her life and loves and helped her favourite niece, Fanny Knight (Imogen Poots), find a husband.\n\n\"JANE, the musical\" debuted in June 2006 in the West Midlands, England. It is a West-End style musical theatre production based on the life of Jane Austen. The musical, directed by Geetika Lizardi, focuses on Austen as a modern heroine, a woman who chose art and integrity over the security of a loveless marriage.\n\nJane Austen features as an amateur sleuth in Stephanie Barron's Jane Austen series of historical mystery novels.\n\nKate Beaton, cartoonist of webcomic \"Hark! A Vagrant\", devoted one of her comic strips to Jane Austen.\n\nJane Austen (voiced by Eden Riegel) is revealed as the narrator of 2013's \"Saints Row IV\" in a bonus cutscene, and the game's antagonist Zinyak reads the first chapter of \"Pride and Prejudice\" on an in-game radio station. Both the protagonist (the leader of the 3rd Street Saints) and the game alien antagonist Zinyak are depicted as fans of Austen's work. She appears as a figure in \"How the Saints Save Christmas\" DLC and Saints Row IV standalone expansion, \"\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"None\"\n\n\nIn 1994, American literary critic Harold Bloom placed Austen among the greatest . In a 2002 poll to determine whom the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Austen was ranked number 70 in the list of the \"100 Greatest Britons\". In 2003, Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\" came second in the BBC's The Big Read, a national poll to find the \"Nation's best-loved book.\"\n\nIn 2007, the article \"Rejecting Jane\" by British author David Lassman, which examined how Austen would fare in the modern day publishing industry, achieved worldwide attention when Austen's work—submitted under a pseudonym—was rejected by numerous publishers.\n\nAusten's writing was the inspiration for the 2013 video game \"Regency Love\", a visual novel in which the player interacts with townspeople, friends, family, and potential suitors, looking for a suitable match. The game includes storylines inspired by Austen's writing style, as well as trivia questions about Austen's work.\n\n\n"
