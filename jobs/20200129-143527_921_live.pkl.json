                "Veganism\n\nVeganism is both the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals. A follower of either the diet or the philosophy is known as a vegan ( ). Distinctions are sometimes made between several categories of veganism. \"Dietary vegans\" (or strict vegetarians) refrain from consuming animal products, not only meat but also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived substances. The term \"ethical vegan\" is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of animals for any purpose. Another term is \"environmental veganism\", which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.\n\nWell-planned vegan diets can reduce the risk of some types of chronic disease, including heart disease. They are regarded as appropriate for all stages of life including during infancy and pregnancy by the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the British Dietetic Association. The German Society for Nutrition does not recommend vegan diets for children, adolescents nor during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron and phytochemicals; and lower in dietary energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc and vitamin B. Unbalanced vegan diets may lead to nutritional deficiencies that nullify any beneficial effects and may cause serious health issues. Some of these deficiencies can only be prevented through the choice of fortified foods or the regular intake of dietary supplements. Vitamin B supplementation is especially important because its deficiency causes blood disorders and potentially irreversible neurological damage.\n\nDonald Watson coined the term \"vegan\" in 1944 when he co-founded the Vegan Society in England. At first he used it to mean \"non-dairy vegetarian\", but from 1951 the Society defined it as \"the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals\". Interest in veganism increased in the 2010s. More vegan stores opened and vegan options became increasingly available in supermarkets and restaurants in many countries.\n\nThe origin of the English term \"vegetarian\" is unknown. The earliest-known use is attributed to the actress Fanny Kemble, writing around 1839 in Georgia in the United States. The practice can be traced to Indus valley civilization in 3300–1300 BCE Ancient India. Early vegetarians included Indian philosophers such as Mahavira and Acharya Kundakunda, the Indian poet Valluvar, the Indian emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Ashoka; Greek philosophers such as Empedocles, Theophrastus, Plutarch, Plotinus, and Porphyry; and the Roman poet Ovid, the playwright Seneca the Younger. The Greek sage Pythagoras may have advocated an early form of strict vegetarianism, but his life is so obscure that it is disputed whether he ever advocated any form of vegetarianism at all. He almost certainly prohibited his followers from eating beans and from wearing woolen garments and Eudoxus of Cnidus, a student of Archytas, writes that \"Pythagoras was distinguished by such purity and so avoided killing and killers that he not only abstained from animal foods, but even kept his distance from cooks and hunters.\" The earliest known vegan was the Arab poet Al-Maʿarri (). Their arguments were based on health, the transmigration of souls, animal welfare, and the view—espoused by Porphyry in \"De Abstinentia ab Esu Animalium\" (\"On Abstinence from Animal Food\", )—that if humans deserve justice, so do animals.\n\nVegetarianism established itself as a significant movement in 19th-century England and the United States. A minority of vegetarians avoided animal food entirely. In 1813 the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley published \"A Vindication of Natural Diet\", advocating \"abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors\", and in 1815 William Lambe, a London physician, claimed that his \"water and vegetable diet\" could cure anything from tuberculosis to acne. Lambe called animal food an \"habitual irritation\", and argued that \"milk eating and flesh eating are but branches of a common system, and they must stand or fall together\". Sylvester Graham's meatless Graham diet—mostly fruit, vegetables, water and bread made at home with stoneground flour—became popular as a health remedy in the 1830s in the United States. Several vegan communities were established around this time. In Massachusetts Amos Bronson Alcott, father of the novelist Louisa May Alcott, opened the Temple School in 1834 and Fruitlands in 1844, and in England James Pierrepont Greaves founded the Concordium, a vegan community at Alcott House on Ham Common, in 1838.\n\nIn 1843 members of Alcott House created the British and Foreign Society for the Promotion of Humanity and Abstinence from Animal Food, led by Sophia Chichester, a wealthy benefactor of Alcott House. Alcott House also helped to establish the UK Vegetarian Society, which held its first meeting in 1847 in Ramsgate, Kent. \"The Medical Times and Gazette\" in London reported in 1884:\n\nThere are two kinds of Vegetarians—one an extreme form, the members of which eat no animal food whatever; and a less extreme sect, who do not object to eggs, milk, or fish. The Vegetarian Society ... belongs to the latter more moderate division.\n\nAn article in the Society's magazine, the \"Vegetarian Messenger\", in 1851 discussed alternatives to shoe leather, which suggests the presence of vegans within the membership who rejected animal use entirely, not only in diet. The first known vegan cookbook, Rupert H. Wheldon's \"No Animal Food: Two Essays and 100 Recipes\", was published in London in 1910. The consumption of milk and eggs became a battleground over the following decades. There were regular discussions about it in the \"Vegetarian Messenger\"; it appears from the correspondence pages that many opponents of veganism came from vegetarians.\n\nDuring a visit to London in 1931, Mahatma Gandhi—who had joined the Vegetarian Society's executive committee when he lived in London from 1888 to 1891—gave a speech to the Society arguing that it ought to promote a meat-free diet as a matter of morality, not health. Lacto-vegetarians acknowledged the ethical consistency of the vegan position but regarded a vegan diet as impracticable and were concerned that it might be an impediment to spreading vegetarianism if vegans found themselves unable to participate in social circles where no non-animal food was available. This became the predominant view of the Vegetarian Society, which in 1935 stated: \"The lacto-vegetarians, on the whole, do not defend the practice of consuming the dairy products except on the ground of expediency.\"\n\nIn August 1944 several members of the Vegetarian Society asked that a section of its newsletter be devoted to non-dairy vegetarianism. When the request was turned down, Donald Watson, secretary of the Leicester branch, set up a new quarterly newsletter in November 1944, priced tuppence. He called it \"The Vegan News\". He chose the word \"vegan\" himself, based on \"the first three and last two letters of 'vegetarian [..] because it marked, in Mr Watson's words, \"the beginning and end of vegetarian\", but asked his readers if they could think of anything better than \"vegan\" to stand for \"non-dairy vegetarian\". They suggested \"allvega\", \"neo-vegetarian\", \"dairyban\", \"vitan\", \"benevore\", \"sanivores\" and \"beaumangeur\".\n\nThe first edition attracted more than 100 letters, including from George Bernard Shaw, who resolved to give up eggs and dairy. The new Vegan Society held its first meeting in early November at the Attic Club, 144 High Holborn, London. Those in attendance were Donald Watson, Elsie B. Shrigley, Fay K. Henderson, Alfred Hy Haffenden, Paul Spencer and Bernard Drake, with Mme Pataleewa (Barbara Moore, a Russian-British engineer) observing. World Vegan Day is held every 1 November to mark the founding of the Society.\n\"The Vegan News\" changed its name to \"The Vegan\" in November 1945, by which time it had 500 subscribers. It published recipes and a \"vegan trade list\" of animal-free products, such as Colgate toothpaste, Kiwi shoe polish, Dawson & Owen stationery and Gloy glue. Vegan books appeared, including \"Vegan Recipes\" by Fay K. Henderson and \"Aids to a Vegan Diet for Children\" by Kathleen V. Mayo.\n\nThe Vegan Society soon made clear that it rejected the use of animals for any purpose, not only in diet. In 1947 Watson wrote: \"The vegan renounces it as superstitious that human life depends upon the exploitation of these creatures whose feelings are much the same as our own ...\". From 1948 \"The Vegan\"'s front page read: \"Advocating living without exploitation\", and in 1951 the Society published its definition of \"veganism\" as \"the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals.\" In 1956 its vice-president, Leslie Cross, founded the Plantmilk Society, and in 1965, as Plantmilk Ltd and later Plamil Foods, it began production of one of the first widely distributed soy milks in the Western world.\n\nThe first vegan society in the United States was founded in 1948 by Catherine Nimmo and Rubin Abramowitz in California, who distributed Watson's newsletter. In 1960 H. Jay Dinshah founded the American Vegan Society (AVS), linking veganism to the concept of \"ahimsa\", \"non-harming\" in Sanskrit. According to Joanne Stepaniak, the word \"vegan\" was first published independently in 1962 by the \"Oxford Illustrated Dictionary\", defined as \"a vegetarian who eats no butter, eggs, cheese or milk\".\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s a vegetarian food movement emerged as part of the counterculture in the United States that focused on concerns about diet, the environment and a distrust of food producers, leading to increasing interest in organic gardening. One of the most influential vegetarian books of that time was Frances Moore Lappé's 1971 text, \"Diet for a Small Planet\". It sold more than three million copies and suggested \"getting off the top of the food chain\".\n\nThe following decades saw research by a group of scientists and doctors in the United States, including physicians Dean Ornish, Caldwell Esselstyn, Neal D. Barnard, John A. McDougall, Michael Greger and biochemist T. Colin Campbell, who argued that diets based on animal fat and animal protein, such as the Western pattern diet, were detrimental to health. They produced a series of books that recommend vegan or vegetarian diets, including McDougall's \"The McDougall Plan\" (1983), John Robbins's \"Diet for a New America\" (1987), which associated meat eating with environmental damage, and \"Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease\" (1990). In 2003 two major North American dietitians' associations indicated that well-planned vegan diets were suitable for all life stages. This was followed by the film \"Earthlings\" (2005), Campbell's \"The China Study\" (2005), Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin's \"Skinny Bitch\" (2005), Jonathan Safran Foer's \"Eating Animals\" (2009), and the film \"Forks over Knives\" (2011).\n\nIn the 1980s veganism became associated with punk subculture and ideologies, particularly straight edge hardcore punk in the United States and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom. This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe.\n\nThe vegan diet became increasingly mainstream in the 2010s. The European Parliament defined the meaning of \"vegan\" for food labels in 2010, in force as of 2015. Chain restaurants began marking vegan items on their menus and supermarkets improved their selection of vegan processed food. The English Wikipedia article on veganism was viewed 73,000 times in August 2009 but 145,000 times in August 2013. Articles on veganism were viewed more during this period than articles on vegetarianism in the English, French, German, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish Wikipedias.\n\nThe global mock-meats market increased by eighteen percent between 2005 and 2010, and in the United States by eight percent between 2012 and 2015, to $553 million a year. \"De Vegetarische Slager\", the first known vegetarian butcher shop, selling mock meats, opened in the Netherlands in 2010, while America's first vegan butcher, the Herbivorous Butcher, opened in Minneapolis in 2016. By 2016, forty-nine percent of Americans were drinking plant milk, although 91 percent still drank dairy milk. In the United Kingdom the plant milk market increased by 155 percent in two years, from 36 million litres in 2011 to 92 million in 2013. In 2011 Europe's first vegan supermarkets appeared in Germany: Vegilicious in Dortmund and Veganz in Berlin.\nCountering the image of self-deprivation projected by vegan straight edges and animal rights activists, veganism was promoted as glamorous; in 2015 the editor of Yahoo! Food declared that it had become \"a thing\". Celebrities, athletes and politicians adopted vegan diets, some seriously, some part-time. The idea of the \"flexi-vegan\" gained currency: \"New York Times\" food columnist Mark Bittman, in \"VB6\" (2013), recommended eating vegan food until 6 pm. In 2013, the Oktoberfest in Munich, traditionally a meat-heavy affair, offered vegan dishes for the first time in its 200-year history.\n\nCritics of veganism questioned the evolutionary legitimacy and health effects of a vegan diet, and pointed to longstanding philosophical traditions which held that humans are superior to other animals. Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain wrote in 2000 that \"Vegetarians, and their Hezbollah-like splinter-faction, the vegans, are a persistent irritant to any chef worth a damn.\" Several vegetarian writers argued that the restrictions of a vegan lifestyle are impractical, and that vegetarianism is a better goal.\n\n\nVegans do not eat beef, pork, poultry, fowl, game, seafood, eggs, dairy, or any other animal products. Dietary vegans might use animal products in clothing (as leather, wool, and silk), toiletries and similar. Ethical veganism extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or use of animal products. Vegans reject the commodification of animals. The British Vegan Society will certify a product only if it is free of animal involvement as far as possible and practical, including animal testing, but \"recognises that it is not always possible to make a choice that avoids the use of animals\".\n\nAn important concern is the case of medications, which are routinely tested on animals to ensure they are effective and safe, and may also contain animal ingredients, such as lactose, gelatine, or stearates. There may be no alternatives to prescribed medication or these alternatives may be unsuitable, less effective, or have more adverse side effects. Experimentation with laboratory animals is also used for evaluating the safety of vaccines, food additives, cosmetics, household products, workplace chemicals, and many other substances.\n\nPhilosopher Gary Steiner argues that it is not possible to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are \"deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society\". Animal products in common use include albumen, allantoin, beeswax, blood, bone char, bone china, carmine, casein, castoreum, cochineal, elastin, emu oil, gelatin, honey, isinglass, keratin, lactic acid, lanolin, lard, rennet, retinol, shellac, squalene, tallow/sodium tallowate, whey and yellow grease. Some of these are chemical compounds that can be derived from animal products, plants, or petrochemicals. Allantoin, lactic acid, retinol and squalene, for example, can be vegan. These products and their origins are not always included in the list of ingredients.\n\nSome vegans will not buy woollen jumpers, silk scarves, leather shoes, bedding that contains goose down or duck feathers, pearl jewellery, seashells, ordinary soap (usually made of animal fat), or cosmetics that contain animal products. They avoid certain vaccines; the flu vaccine, for example, is usually grown in hens' eggs, although an effective alternative, Flublok, is widely available in the United States. Non-vegan items acquired before they became vegan might be donated to charity or used until worn out. Some vegan clothes, in particular leather alternatives, are made of petroleum-based products, which has triggered criticism because of the environmental damage involved in their production.\n\nThe main difference between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude dairy products. Ethical vegans avoid them on the premise that their production causes animal suffering and premature death. In egg production, most male chicks are culled because they do not lay eggs. To obtain milk from dairy cattle, cows are made pregnant to induce lactation; they are kept lactating for three to seven years, then slaughtered. Female calves are separated from their mothers within 24 hours of birth, and fed milk replacer to retain the cow's milk for human consumption. Male calves are slaughtered at birth, sent for veal production, or reared for beef.\n\nVegan groups disagree about insect products. Neither the Vegan Society nor the American Vegan Society considers honey, silk, and other insect products as suitable for vegans, while Vegan Outreach view it as a matter of personal choice. The Vegan Society recommend date syrup, maple syrup, molasses, butterscotch syrup, golden syrup and agave nectar as alternatives to honey. Insect products can be defined much more widely, as commercial bees are used to pollinate about 100 different food crops, including almonds, avocado, broccoli, cucumbers, peaches, pears, sunflowers and tomatoes.\n\nVegan diets are based on grains and other seeds, legumes (particularly beans), fruits, vegetables, edible mushrooms, and nuts. Meatless products based on soybeans (tofu), or wheat-based seitan are sources of plant protein, commonly in the form of vegetarian sausage, mince, and veggie burgers.\n\nDishes based on soybeans are a staple of vegan diets because soybeans are a complete protein; this means they contain all the essential amino acids for humans and can be relied upon entirely for protein intake. They are consumed most often in the form of soy milk and tofu (bean curd), which is soy milk mixed with a coagulant. Tofu comes in a variety of textures, depending on water content, from firm, medium firm and extra firm for stews and stir-fries to soft or silken for salad dressings, desserts and shakes. Soy is also eaten in the form of tempeh and texturized vegetable protein (TVP); also known as textured soy protein (TSP), the latter is often used in pasta sauces.\n\nPlant milks—such as soy milk, almond milk, grain milks (oat milk and rice milk), hemp milk and coconut milk—are used in place of cows' or goats' milk. Soy milk provides around 7 g of protein per cup (240 mL or 8 fl oz), compared with 8 g of protein per cup of cow's milk. Almond milk is lower in dietary energy, carbohydrates and protein. Soy milk should not be used as a replacement for breast milk for babies. Babies who are not breastfed may be fed commercial infant formula, normally based on cows' milk or soy. The latter is known as soy-based infant formula or SBIF.\n\nButter can be replaced with a vegan alternative such as Earth Balance's. Vegan (egg-free) mayonnaise brands include Vegenaise, Nayonaise, Mindful Mayo, and Plamil's Egg-Free Mayonnaise. Vegan cheeses, such as Chreese and Daiya, are made from soy, nuts and tapioca, and can replace the meltability of dairy cheese. Nutritional yeast is a common substitute for the taste of cheese in vegan recipes. Cheese substitutes can be made at home.\n\nCommercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg replacer and Ener-G egg replacer, are available for cooking and baking. The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a tablespoon of baking powder can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a tablespoon of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water, and half a tablespoon of baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, it can even be whipped up like egg whites.\n\nRaw veganism, combining veganism and raw foodism, excludes all animal products and food cooked above 48 °C (118 °F). A raw vegan diet includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, grain and legume sprouts, seeds and sea vegetables. There are many variations of the diet, including fruitarianism.\n\nProteins are composed of amino acids. Vegans obtain all their protein from plants, omnivores usually a third, and ovo-lacto vegetarians half. Sources of plant protein include legumes such as soy beans (consumed as tofu, tempeh, texturized vegetable protein, soy milk and edamame), peas, peanuts, black beans and chickpeas (the latter often eaten as hummus); grains such as quinoa (pronounced \"keenwa\"), brown rice, corn, barley, bulgur and wheat (the latter eaten as bread and seitan); and nuts and seeds. Combinations that contain high amounts of all the essential amino acids include rice and beans, corn and beans, and hummus and whole-wheat pita.\n\nSoy beans and quinoa are known as complete proteins because they each contain all the essential amino acids in amounts that meet or exceed human requirements. Mangels et al. write that consuming the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of protein (0.8 g/kg body weight) in the form of soy will meet the biologic requirement for amino acids. In 2012 the United States Department of Agriculture ruled that soy protein (tofu) may replace meat protein in the National School Lunch Program.\n\nThe American Dietetic Association said in 2009 that a variety of plant foods consumed over the course of a day can provide all the essential amino acids for healthy adults, which means that protein combining in the same meal may not be necessary. Mangels et al. write that there is little reason to advise vegans to increase their protein intake, but erring on the side of caution, they recommend a 25 percent increase over the RDA for adults, to 1.0 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight.\n\nVitamin B is a bacterial product needed for cell division, the formation and maturation of red blood cells, the synthesis of DNA, and normal nerve function. A deficiency may cause megaloblastic anaemia and neurological damage, and, if untreated, may lead to death. The high content of folacin in vegetarian diets may mask the hematological symptoms of vitamin B deficiency, so it may go undetected until neurological signs in the late stages are evident, which can be irreversible, such as neuropsychiatric abnormalities, neuropathy, dementia and, occasionally, atrophy of optic nerves. Vegans sometimes fail to obtain enough B from their diet because among non-fortified foods, only those of animal origin contain sufficient amounts. The best source is ruminant food. Vegetarians are also at risk, as are older people and those with certain medical conditions. A 2013 study found that \"vegetarians develop B depletion or deficiency regardless of demographic characteristics, place of residency, age, or type of vegetarian diet. Vegans should take preventive measures to ensure adequate intake of this vitamin, including regular consumption of supplements containing B.\"\n\nB is produced in nature only by certain bacteria and archaea; it is not made by any animal, fungus, or plant. It is synthesized by some gut bacteria in humans and other animals, but humans cannot absorb the B made in their guts, as it is made in the colon which is too far from the small intestine, where absorption of B occurs. Ruminants, such as cows and sheep, absorb B produced by bacteria in their guts.\n\nAnimals store vitamin B in liver and muscle and some pass the vitamin into their eggs and milk; meat, liver, eggs and milk are therefore sources of B.\n\nIt has been suggested that nori (an edible seaweed), tempeh (a fermented soybean food), and nutritional yeast may be sources of vitamin B. In 2016, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics established that nori, fermented foods (such as tempeh), spirulina, chlorella algae, and unfortified nutritional yeast are not adequate sources of vitamin B and that vegans need to consume regularly fortified foods or supplements containing B. Otherwise, vitamin B12 deficiency may develop, as has been demonstrated in case studies of vegan infants, children, and adults.\n\nVitamin B is mostly manufactured by industrial fermentation of various kinds of bacteria, which make forms of cyanocobalamin, which are further processed to generate the ingredient included in supplements and fortified foods. The \"Pseudomonas denitrificans\" strain was most commonly used as of 2017. It is grown in a medium containing sucrose, yeast extract, and several metallic salts. To increase vitamin production, it is supplemented with sugar beet molasses, or, less frequently, with choline. Certain brands of B supplements are vegan.\n\nCalcium is needed to maintain bone health and for several metabolic functions, including muscle function, vascular contraction and vasodilation, nerve transmission, intracellular signalling and hormonal secretion. Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth.\n\nHigh-calcium foods may include fortified plant milk or fortified tofu. Plant sources include broccoli, turnip, bok choy and kale; the bioavailability of calcium in spinach is poor. Vegans should make sure they consume enough vitamin D, which is needed for calcium absorption.\n\nA 2007 report based on the Oxford cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which began in 1993, suggested that vegans have an increased risk of bone fractures over meat eaters and vegetarians, likely because of lower dietary calcium intake. The study found that vegans consuming at least 525 mg of calcium daily have a risk of fractures similar to that of other groups. A 2009 study found the bone mineral density (BMD) of vegans was 94 percent that of omnivores, but deemed the difference clinically insignificant.\n\nVitamin D (calciferol) is needed for several functions, including calcium absorption, enabling mineralization of bone, and bone growth. Without it bones can become thin and brittle; together with calcium it offers protection against osteoporosis. Vitamin D is produced in the body when ultraviolet rays from the sun hit the skin; outdoor exposure is needed because UVB radiation does not penetrate glass. It is present in salmon, tuna, mackerel and cod liver oil, with small amounts in cheese, egg yolks and beef liver, and in some mushrooms.\n\nMost vegan diets contain little or no vitamin D without fortified food. People with little sun exposure may need supplements. The extent to which sun exposure is sufficient depends on the season, time of day, cloud and smog cover, skin melanin content, and whether sunscreen is worn. According to the National Institutes of Health, most people can obtain and store sufficient vitamin D from sunlight in the spring, summer and fall, even in the far north. They report that some researchers recommend 5–30 minutes of sun exposure without sunscreen between 10 am and 3 pm, at least twice a week. Tanning beds emitting 2–6% UVB radiation have a similar effect, though tanning is inadvisable.\n\nVitamin D comes in two forms. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D) is synthesized in the skin after exposure to the sun, or consumed in the form of animal products; when produced industrially it is taken from lanolin in sheep's wool. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D) is derived from ergosterol from UV-exposed mushrooms or yeast and is suitable for vegans. Conflicting studies have suggested that the two forms may or may not be bioequivalent. According to researchers from the Institute of Medicine, the differences between vitamins D and D do not affect metabolism, both function as prohormones, and when activated exhibit identical responses in the body.\n\nIn some cases iron and the zinc status of vegans may also be of concern because of the limited bioavailability of these minerals. There are concerns about the bioavailability of iron from plant foods, assumed by some researchers to be 5–15 percent compared to 18 percent from a nonvegetarian diet. Iron deficiency anemia is found as often in nonvegetarians as in vegetarians, though studies have shown vegetarians' iron stores to be lower.\n\nMangels et al. write that, because of the lower bioavailability of iron from plant sources, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences established a separate RDA for vegetarians and vegans of 14 mg for vegetarian men and postmenopausal women, and 33 mg for premenopausal women not using oral contraceptives. Supplements should be used with caution after consulting a physician, because iron can accumulate in the body and cause damage to organs. This is particularly true of anyone with hemochromatosis, a relatively common condition that can remain undiagnosed.\n\nHigh-iron vegan foods include soybeans, black-strap molasses, black beans, lentils, chickpeas, spinach, tempeh, tofu and lima beans. Iron absorption can be enhanced by eating a source of vitamin C at the same time, such as half a cup of cauliflower or five fluid ounces of orange juice. Coffee and some herbal teas can inhibit iron absorption, as can spices that contain tannins such as turmeric, coriander, chiles, and tamarind.\n\nAlpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is found in leafy green vegetables and nuts, and in vegetable oils such as canola and flaxseed oil. EPA and DHA, the other primary omega-3 fatty acids, are found only in animal products and algae. Iodine supplementation may be necessary for vegans in countries where salt is not typically iodized, where it is iodized at low levels, or where, as in Britain and Ireland, dairy products are relied upon for iodine delivery because of low levels in the soil. Iodine can be obtained from most vegan multivitamins or regular consumption of seaweeds, such as kelp.\n\nAs of 2014 very few studies were rigorous in their comparison of omnivore, vegetarian and vegan diets, making it difficult to discern whether health benefits attributed to the vegan diet might also apply to vegetarian diets or diets that include a moderate meat intake.\n\nVeganism appears to provide a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and ischemic heart disease. A 2016 systematic review found that a vegan diet was associated with a reduction in cancer risk, although only in a small number of studies. The review concluded that there was no effect of vegan diets overall on all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, cerebrovascular disease or cardiovascular-disease-related mortality. The effects also disappeared when specific cancers were analysed. Some studies of vegan diets in diabetes have been criticized for poorly controlling for factors such as medication status; the effect of vegan diets on diabetes and glycemic control is inconclusive.\n\nAccording to nutritionist Winston Craig, writing in \"The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\" in 2009, vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron and phytochemicals, and lower in dietary energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc and vitamin B. Vegans tend to be thinner, with lower serum cholesterol and lower blood pressure.\n\nEliminating all animal products increases the risk of deficiencies of vitamins B and D, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids. Vitamin B-12 deficiency occurs in up to 80% of vegans that do not supplement with vitamin B. Craig advises vegans to eat fortified foods or take supplements, and warns that iron and zinc may be problematic because of limited bioavailability. Vegans might be at risk of low bone mineral density without supplements.\n\nThe American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada state that properly planned vegan diets are appropriate for all life stages, including pregnancy and lactation. They indicate that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders, but that its adoption may serve to camouflage a disorder rather than cause one. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council similarly recognizes a well-planned vegan diet as viable for any age. The British National Health Service's Eatwell Plate allows for an entirely plant-based diet, as does the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) MyPlate. The USDA allows tofu to replace meat in the National School Lunch Program. The German Society for Nutrition does not recommend a vegan diet for babies, children and adolescents, and for those pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada consider well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets \"appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes\". The German Society for Nutrition cautioned against a vegan diet for pregnant women, babies, and children as of 2011. The position of the Canadian Pediatric Society is that \"well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets with appropriate attention to specific nutrient components can provide a healthy alternative lifestyle at all stages of fetal, infant, child and adolescent growth. Attention should be given to nutrient intake, particularly protein, vitamins B12 and D, essential fatty acids, iron, zinc and calcium.\n\nAccording to a 2015 systematic review, there is little evidence available about vegetarian and vegan diets during pregnancy, and a lack of randomized studies meant that the effects of diet could not be distinguished from confounding factors. It concluded: \"Within these limits, vegan-vegetarian diets may be considered safe in pregnancy, provided that attention is paid to vitamin and trace element requirements.\" A daily source of vitamin B is important for pregnant and lactating vegans, as is vitamin D if there are concerns about low sun exposure. Researchers have reported cases of vitamin B12 deficiency in lactating vegetarian mothers that were linked to deficiencies and neurological disorders in their children. A doctor or registered dietitian should be consulted about taking supplements during pregnancy.\n\nVegan diets have attracted negative attention from the media because of cases of nutritional deficiencies that have come to the attention of the courts, including the death of a baby in New Zealand in 2002 due to hypocobalaminemia, i.e. Vitamin B deficiency.\n\nVegans do not use personal care products or household cleaners that contain animal products. Animal ingredients are ubiquitous because they are cheap. After animals are slaughtered for meat, the leftovers are put through the rendering process, and some of that material, particularly the fat, ends up in toiletries. Common ingredients include tallow in soap and collagen-derived glycerine, used as a lubricant and humectant in many haircare products, moisturizers, shaving foams, soaps and toothpastes.\n\nLanolin from sheep's wool is often found in lip balm and moisturizers. Stearic acid is a common ingredient in face creams, shaving foam and shampoos; as with glycerine, it can be plant-based but is usually animal-derived. Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid derived from animal milk, is used in moisturizers, as is allantoin, from the comfrey plant or cows' urine, in shampoos, moisturizers and toothpaste. Carmine from scale insects, such as the female cochineal, is used in food and cosmetics to produce red and pink shades.\n\n\"Animal Ingredients A to Z\" (2004) and \"Veganissimo A to Z\" (2013) list which ingredients might be animal-derived. The British Vegan Society's sunflower logo and PETA's bunny logo mean the product is certified vegan, which includes no animal testing. The leaping-bunny logo signals no animal testing, but it might not be vegan. The Vegan Society criteria for vegan certification are that the product contain no animal products, and that neither the finished item nor its ingredients have been tested on animals by, or on behalf of, the manufacturer or by anyone over whom the manufacturer has control. Its website contains a list of certified products, as does Australia's \"Choose Cruelty Free\" website.\n\nBeauty Without Cruelty, founded as a charity in 1959, was one of the earliest manufacturers and certifiers of animal-free personal care products. Several international companies produce animal-free products, including clothes, shoes, fashion items and candles.\n\nVegans avoid clothing that incorporates silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, mohair and a number of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, leather, snakeskin and any other kind of skin or animal product. Most leather clothing is made from cow skins. Vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials such as hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, synthetic leather (pleather), rubber and vinyl. Leather alternatives can come from materials such as cork, piña (from pineapples) and mushroom leather.\n\nEthical veganism is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of species membership alone. Divisions within animal rights theory include the utilitarian, protectionist approach, which pursues improved conditions for animals, and rights-based abolitionism, which seeks to end human ownership of non-humans. Abolitionists argue that protectionism serves only to make the public feel that animal use can be morally unproblematic (the \"happy meat\" position).\n\nLaw professor Gary Francione, an abolitionist, argues that all sentient beings should have the right not to be treated as property, and that adopting veganism must be the baseline for anyone who believes that non-humans have intrinsic moral value. Pursuing improved welfare conditions is like campaigning for \"conscientious rapists\" who will rape without beating, he argues. Philosopher Tom Regan, also a rights theorist, argues that animals possess value as \"subjects-of-a-life\", because they have beliefs, desires, memory and the ability to initiate action in pursuit of goals. The right of subjects-of-a-life not to be harmed can be overridden by other moral principles, but Regan argues that pleasure, convenience and the economic interests of farmers are not weighty enough.\n\nPhilosopher Peter Singer, a protectionist and utilitarian, argues that there is no moral or logical justification for failing to count animal suffering as a consequence when making decisions, and that killing animals should be rejected unless necessary for survival. Despite this, he writes that \"ethical thinking can be sensitive to circumstances\", and that he is \"not too concerned about trivial infractions\".\n\nAn argument proposed by Bruce Friedrich, also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because it focuses on personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever animal products they can. For Francione, this is similar to arguing that, because human-rights abuses can never be eliminated, we should not defend human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, we reinforce that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience, he argues. He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own consequentialist terms.\n\nPhilosopher Val Plumwood maintained that ethical veganism is \"subtly human-centred\", an example of what she called \"human/nature dualism\" because it views humanity as separate from the rest of nature. Ethical vegans want to admit non-humans into the category that deserves special protection, rather than recognize the \"ecological embeddedness\" of all. Plumwood wrote that animal food may be an \"unnecessary evil\" from the perspective of the consumer who \"draws on the whole planet for nutritional needs\"—and she strongly opposed factory farming—but for anyone relying on a much smaller ecosystem, it is very difficult or impossible to be vegan.\n\nBen Mepham, bioethicist and fellow of the Royal Society of Biology, in his review of Francione and Garner's book \"The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation?\", concludes about the vegan philosophy that \"if the aim of ethics is to choose the right, or best, course of action in specific circumstances ‘all things considered’, it is arguable that adherence to such an absolutist agenda is simplistic and open to serious self-contradictions. Or, as Farlie puts it, with characteristic panache: ‘to conclude that veganism is the ‘only ethical response’ is to take a big leap into a very muddy pond’.\" He cites as examples the adverse effects on animal wildlife derived from the agricultural practices necessary to sustain most vegan diets and the ethical contradiction of favoring the welfare of domesticated animals but not that of wild animals; the imbalance between the resources that are used to promote the welfare of animals as opposed to those destined to alleviate the suffering of the approximately one billion human beings who undergo malnutrition, abuse and exploitation; the focus on attitudes and conditions in western developed countries, leaving out the rights and interests of societies whose economy, culture and, in some cases, survival rely on a symbiotic relationship with animals.\n\nEnvironmental vegans focus on conservation, rejecting the use of animal products on the premise that fishing, hunting, trapping and farming, particularly factory farming, are environmentally unsustainable. In 2010 Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society called pigs and chicken \"major aquatic predators\", because livestock eat 40 percent of the fish that are caught. All Sea Shepherd ships have been vegan, for environmental reasons, since 2002.\n\nAccording to a 2006 United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report, \"Livestock's Long Shadow\", 222 million tonnes of meat were produced globally in 1999. The report posits that around 26 percent of the planet's terrestrial surface is devoted to livestock grazing. In the United States ten billion land animals are killed every year for human consumption, and in 2005 48 billion birds were killed globally. \n\nThe UN report also concluded that livestock farming (mostly of cows, chickens and pigs) affects the air, land, soil, water, biodiversity and climate change. Livestock consumed 1,174 million tonnes of food in 2002—including 7.6 million tonnes of fishmeal and 670 million tonnes of cereals, one-third of the global cereal harvest— and in 2001 consumed 45 million tonnes of roots and vegetables and 17 million tonnes of pulses. As of 2006 the livestock industry accounted for nine percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, 37 percent of methane, 65 percent of nitrous oxide, and 68 percent of ammonia. Livestock waste emitted 30 million tonnes of ammonia a year, which is involved in the production of acid rain. A 2017 study published in the journal \"Carbon Balance and Management\" found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nA 2010 UN report, \"Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production\", argued that animal products \"in general require more resources and cause higher emissions than plant-based alternatives\". It proposed a move away from animal products to reduce environmental damage. A 2007 Cornell University study concluded that vegetarian diets use the least land \"per capita\", but require higher quality land than is needed to feed animals. A 2015 study published in \"Science of the Total Environment\" determined that significant biodiversity loss can be attributed to the growing demand for meat, which is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction, with species-rich habitats being converted to agriculture for livestock production. A 2017 study by the World Wildlife Fund found that 60% of biodiversity loss can be attributed to the vast scale of feed crop cultivation needed to rear tens of billions of farm animals, which puts an enormous strain on natural resources resulting in an extensive loss of lands and species. In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a warning to humanity calling for, among other things, \"promoting dietary shifts towards mostly plant-based foods.\"\n\nOne of the leading activists and scholars of feminist animal rights is Carol J. Adams. Her premier work, \"The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory\" (1990), sparked what was to become a movement in animal rights as she noted the relationship between feminism and meat consumption. Since the release of \"The Sexual Politics of Meat\", Adams has published several other works including essays, books, and keynote addresses. Adams ideals are carried out thoroughly, and in one of her speeches, “Why feminist-vegan now?”—adapted from her original address at the “Minding Animals” conference in Newcastle, Australia (2009)--Adams states that “the idea that there was a connection between feminism and vegetarianism came to [her] in October 1974,” illustrating that the concept of feminist veganism has been around for nearly half a century. Other authors have also paralleled Adams’ ideas while expanding on them. Angella Duvnjak states in “Joining the dots: some reflections on feminist-Vegan political practice and choice” that she was met with opposition to the connection of feminist and veganism ideals, although the connection seemed more than obvious to her and other scholars (2011). Other scholars elaborate on the connections between feminism, such as Carrie Hamilton who makes the connection to sex workers and animal reproductive rights. Many other scholars of feminist vegan philosophy continue to add to the arguments that Adams, Duvnjak, and Hamilton have brought forth.\n\nSome of the main concepts of feminist veganism is that is the connection between the violence and oppression of animals. For example, Marjorie Spiegal compares the consumption or servitude of animals for human gain to slavery. Animals are purchased from a breeder, used for personal gain—either for further breeding, or manual labor—and then discarded—most frequently as food. This capitalist use of animals for personal gain has held strong, despite the work of animal rights activists and ecofriendly feminists.\n\nSimilar notions that suggest animals—like fish, for example—feel less pain are brought forth today as a justification for animal cruelty. The feminist side of the argument, however, suggests that there is no rationalization for treating animal lives with lesser reverence than human lives, even if the theory that animals are less capable of pain is verifiable.\n\nAnother connection between feminism and veganism is the parallel of violence against women or other minority members and the violence against animals. Animal rights activists closely relates animal cruelty to feminist issues. This connection is even further mirrored as animals that are used for breeding practices are compared to human trafficking victims and migrant sex workers. Hamilton points out that violent “rapists sometimes exhibit behavior that seems to be patterned on the mutilation of animals” suggesting there is a trend between the violence towards rape victims and animal cruelty previously exhibited by the rapist.\n\nThe violence connection is not limited to sexual acts, however. It is a common fact the prevalence of violence against animals are more defined in those with psychopathic disorders. This mirroring of violence against animals and violence against weaker animals lead the pioneers of feminist veganism to suggest that there is a correspondence between violence against humans and animals, supporting feminist veganism.\n\nAnother way that feminist veganism relates to feminist thoughts is through the capitalist means of the production itself. Carol J. Adams, mentions Barbara Noske talking about “meat eating as the ultimate capitalist product, because it takes so much to make the product, it uses up so many resources”. The capitalization of resources for meat production is argued to be better used for production of other food products that have a less detrimental impact on the environment.\n\nMultiple symbols have been developed to represent veganism. Several are used on consumer packaging, including the Vegan Society trademark and Vegan Action logo, to indicate products without animal-derived ingredients. Various symbols may also be used by members of the vegan community to represent their identity and in the course of animal rights activism, for example a vegan flag.\n",
                "Vegetarianism\n\nVegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.\n\nVegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life. Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as animal rights advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal preference. There are variations of the diet as well: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs. A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including eggs and dairy. Some vegans also avoid other animal products such as beeswax, leather or silk clothing, and goose-fat shoe polish.\n\nPackaged and processed foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, so may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions. Often, prior to purchase or consumption, vegetarians will scrutinize products for animal-derived ingredients. Vegetarians' feelings vary with regard to these ingredients. For example, while some vegetarians may be unaware of animal-derived rennet's role in the production of cheese, and may therefore unknowingly consume the product, other vegetarians may not take issue with its consumption.\n\nSemi-vegetarian diets consist largely of vegetarian foods but may include fish or poultry, or sometimes other meats, on an infrequent basis. Those with diets containing fish or poultry may define \"meat\" only as mammalian flesh and may identify with vegetarianism. A pescetarian diet has been described as \"fish but no other meat\". The common use association between such diets and vegetarianism has led vegetarian groups such as the Vegetarian Society to state that diets containing these ingredients are not vegetarian, because fish and birds are also animals.\nThe term 'vegetarian' has been in use since 1839 to refer to what was previously described as a \"vegetable diet\". The word is commonly believed to be a compound of \"vegetable\" and the suffix \"-arian\" (as in \"agrarian\"). (John Davis shows that it was probably not derived from the Latin word \"vegetus\".)\nThe term was popularized with the foundation of the Vegetarian Society in Manchester, UK in 1847. The earliest occurrences of the term seem to be related to Alcott House, a school on the north side of Ham Common, London, opened in July 1838 by James Pierrepont Greaves. From 1841, it was known as \"A Concordium, or Industry Harmony College\", from which time the institution began to publish its own pamphlet, \"The Healthian\", which provides some of the earliest appearances of the term \"vegetarian\".\n\nThe earliest record of vegetarianism comes from Indus Valley Civilization as early as the 7th century BCE, inculcating tolerance towards all living beings. Vegetarianism was also practiced in ancient Greece and the earliest reliable evidence for vegetarian theory and practice in Greece dates from the 6th century BC. The Orphics, a religious movement spreading in Greece at that time. It is unclear whether the Greek religious teacher Pythagoras actually advocated vegetarianism, but later writers presented him as doing so. A fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Book XV of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", in which he advocates a form of strict vegetarianism. It was through this portrayal that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period and, prior to the coinage of the word \"vegetarianism\", vegetarians were referred to in English as \"Pythagoreans\".\n\nVegetarianism was also practiced about six centuries later in another instance (between 30 BCE–50 CE) in northern Thracian region, the Moesi tribe who inhabited present day Serbia and Bulgaria, feeding themselves on honey, milk and cheese.\n\nIn the Indian culture, the diet was closely connected with the attitude of nonviolence towards animals (called \"ahimsa\" in India) and was promoted by religious groups and philosophers. The ancient Indian work of Tirukkural explicitly and unambiguously emphasizes vegetarianism and non-killing. Chapter 26 of the Tirukkural, through couplets 251 to 260, deals exclusively on vegetarianism or veganism. Among the Hellenes, Egyptians and others, it had medical or ritual purification purposes.\nFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire in late antiquity, vegetarianism practically disappeared from Europe, as it did on other continents, except India. Several orders of monks in medieval Europe restricted or banned the consumption of meat for ascetic reasons, but none of them eschewed fish. (The medieval definition of \"fish\" included such animals as seals, porpoises, dolphins, barnacle geese, puffins, and beavers.) It re-emerged during the Renaissance, becoming more widespread in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1847, the first Vegetarian Society was founded in the United Kingdom; Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries followed. In 1886, the vegetarian colony Nueva Germania was founded in Paraguay, though its vegetarian aspect would prove short-lived. The International Vegetarian Union, an association of the national societies, was founded in 1908. In the Western world, the popularity of vegetarianism grew during the twentieth century as a result of nutritional, ethical, and more recently, environmental and economic concerns.\n\nThere are a number of vegetarian diets that exclude or include various foods:\n\nWithin the \"ovo-\" groups, there are many who refuse to consume fertilized eggs (with balut being an extreme example); however, such distinction is typically not specifically addressed.\n\nSome vegetarians also avoid products that may use animal ingredients not included in their labels or which use animal products in their manufacturing; for example, sugars that are whitened with bone char, cheeses that use animal rennet (enzymes from animal stomach lining), gelatin (derived from the collagen inside animals' skin, bones and connective tissue), some cane sugar (but not beet sugar) and apple juice/alcohol clarified with gelatin or crushed shellfish and sturgeon, while other vegetarians are unaware of or do not mind such ingredients.\n\nIndividuals sometimes label themselves \"vegetarian\" while practicing a semi-vegetarian diet, as some dictionary definitions describe vegetarianism as sometimes including the consumption of fish, or only include mammalian flesh as part of their definition of meat, while other definitions exclude fish and all animal flesh. In other cases, individuals may describe themselves as \"flexitarian\".\nThese diets may be followed by those who reduce animal flesh consumed as a way of transitioning to a complete vegetarian diet or for health, ethical, environmental, or other reasons. Semi-vegetarian diets include:\n\nSemi-vegetarianism is contested by vegetarian groups, such as the Vegetarian Society, which states that vegetarianism excludes all animal flesh.\n\nStudies on the health effects of vegetarian diets observe heterogeneous effects on mortality. One review found a decreased overall risk of all cause mortality, cancer (except breast) and cardiovascular disease; however, a meta-analysis found lower risk for ischemic heart disease and cancer but no effect on overall mortality or cerebrovascular disease. Possible limitations include varying definitions used of vegetarianism, and the observation of increased risk of lung cancer mortality in those on a vegetarian diet for less than five years. An analysis pooling two large studies found vegetarians in the UK have similar all cause mortality as meat eaters. An older meta analysis found similar results, only finding decreased mortality in vegetarians, pescatarians, and irregular meat eaters in ischemic heart disease, but not from any other cause.\n\nA vegetarian diet which is poorly planned can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia and platelet disorders; this risk may be offset by ensuring sufficient consumption of vitamin B 12 and polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada have stated that at all stages of life, a properly planned vegetarian diet is \"healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provides health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases\". Large-scale studies have shown that mortality from ischemic heart disease was 30% lower among vegetarian men and 20% lower among vegetarian women than in non-vegetarians. Vegetarian diets offer lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and animal protein, and higher levels of carbohydrates, fibre, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and phytochemicals.\n\n\"Vegetarian diets can meet guidelines for the treatment of diabetes and some research suggests that diets that are more plant-based reduce risk of type-2 diabetes. Rates of self-reported Seventh-day Adventists (SDA) were less than half of those of the general population, and, among SDA, vegetarians had lower rates of diabetes than non-vegetarians. Among possible explanations for a protective effect of vegetarian diet are the Lower BMI of vegetarians and higher fiber intake, both of which improve insulin sensitivity.\"\n\nThe relationship between vegetarian diet and bone health remains unclear. According to some studies, a vegetarian lifestyle can be associated with vitamin B 12 deficiency and low bone mineral density. However, a study of vegetarian and non-vegetarian adults in Taiwan found no significant difference in bone mineral density between the two groups. Other studies, exploring animal protein's negative effects on bone health, suggest that vegetarians may be less prone to osteoporosis than omnivores, as vegetarian subjects had greater bone mineral density and more bone formation.\n\nThe China-Cornell-Oxford Project, a 20-year study conducted by Cornell University, the University of Oxford, and the government of China has established a correlation between the consumption of animal products and a variety of chronic illnesses, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancers of the breast, prostate and bowel (see \"The China Study\").\n\nA British study of almost 10,000 men found that those who gave up meat were almost twice as likely to suffer from depression as people on a conventional balanced diet. The study found that the 350 committed vegetarians studied had a higher average depression score compared to others.\n\nWestern vegetarian diets are typically high in carotenoids, but relatively low in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B. Vegans can have particularly low intake of vitamin B and calcium if they do not eat enough items such as collard greens, leafy greens, tempeh and tofu (soy). High levels of dietary fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, and low consumption of saturated fat are all considered to be beneficial aspects of a vegetarian diet. A well planned vegetarian diet will provide all nutrients in a meat-eater's diet to the same level for all stages of life.\n\nProtein intake in vegetarian diets is lower than in meat diets but can meet the daily requirements for most people. Studies at Harvard University as well as other studies conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and various European countries,\nconfirmed vegetarian diets provide sufficient protein intake as long as a variety of plant sources are available and consumed. Pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, hemp seed, almonds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, tofu, oats, soybeans, walnuts, are great sources of protein for vegetarians. Proteins are composed of amino acids, and a common concern with protein acquired from vegetable sources is an adequate intake of the essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesised by the human body. While dairy and egg products provide complete sources for ovo-lacto vegetarian, several vegetable sources have significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids, including lupin beans, soy, hempseed, chia seed, amaranth, buckwheat, pumpkin seeds spirulina, pistachios, and quinoa. However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. brown rice and beans, or hummus and pita, though protein combining in the same meal is not necessary). A 1994 study found a varied intake of such sources can be adequate.\n\nVegetarian diets typically contain similar levels of iron to non-vegetarian diets, but this has lower bioavailability than iron from meat sources, and its absorption can sometimes be inhibited by other dietary constituents. According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, consuming food that contains vitamin C, such as citrus fruit or juices, tomatoes, or broccoli, is a good way to increase the amount of iron absorbed at a meal. Vegetarian foods rich in iron include black beans, cashews, hempseed, kidney beans, broccoli, lentils, oatmeal, raisins, spinach, cabbage, lettuce, black-eyed peas, soybeans, many breakfast cereals, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato juice, tempeh, molasses, thyme, and whole-wheat bread. The related vegan diets can often be higher in iron than vegetarian diets, because dairy products are low in iron. Iron stores often tend to be lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians, and a few small studies report very high rates of iron deficiency (up to 40%, and 58% of the respective vegetarian or vegan groups). However, the American Dietetic Association states that iron deficiency is no more common in vegetarians than non-vegetarians (adult males are rarely iron deficient); iron deficiency anaemia is rare no matter the diet.\n\nAccording to the United States National Institutes of Health, vitamin B is not generally present in plants and is naturally found in foods of animal origin. Lacto-ovo vegetarians can obtain B from dairy products and eggs, and vegans can obtain it from fortified foods (including some soy products and some breakfast cereals) and dietary supplements. Vitamin B can also be obtained from fortified yeast extract products.\n\nThe recommended dietary allowance of B in the United States is, per day, 0.4 mcg (0–6 months), rising to 1.8 mcg (9–13 years), 2.4 mcg (14+ years), and 2.8 mcg (lactating female). While the body's daily requirement for vitamin B is very small, deficiency of the vitamin is very serious leading to anemia and irreversible nerve damage.\n\nPlant-based, or vegetarian, sources of Omega 3 fatty acids include soy, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, canola oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane. Purslane contains more Omega 3 than any other known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While the health effects of low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels. Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Similar supplements providing both DHA and EPA have also begun to appear. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain algae such as spirulina are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).\n\nCalcium intake in vegetarians and vegans can be similar to non-vegetarians, as long as the diet is properly planned. Lacto-ovo vegetarians that include dairy products can still obtain calcium from dairy sources like milk, yogurt, and cheese.\n\nNon-dairy milks that are fortified with calcium, such as soymilk and almond milk can also contribute a significant amount of calcium in the diet. The calcium found in broccoli, bok choy, and kale have also been found to have calcium that is well absorbed in the body. Though the calcium content per serving is lower in these vegetables than a glass of milk, the absorption of the calcium into the body is higher. Other foods that contain calcium include calcium-set tofu, blackstrap molasses, turnip greens, mustard greens, soybeans, tempeh, almonds, okra, dried figs, and tahini. Though calcium can be found in Spinach, swiss chard, beans and beet greens, they are generally not considered to be a good source since the calcium binds to oxalic acid and is poorly absorbed into the body. Phytic acid found in nuts, seeds, and beans may also impact calcium absorption rates. See the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements for calcium needs for various ages, the Vegetarian Resource Group and the Vegetarian Nutrition Calcium Fact Sheet from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics for more specifics on how to obtain adequate calcium intake on a vegetarian or vegan diet.\n\nVitamin D needs can be met via the human body's own generation upon sufficient and sensible exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight. Products including milk, soy milk and cereal grains may be fortified to provide a source of Vitamin D. For those who do not get adequate sun exposure or food sources, Vitamin D supplementation may be necessary.\n\n\nVitamin D, or ergocalciferol is found in fungus (except alfalfa which is a plantae) and created from viosterol, which in turn is created when ultraviolet light activates ergosterol (which is found in fungi and named as a sterol from ergot). Any UV-irradiated fungus including yeast form vitamin D. Human bioavailability of vitamin D from vitamin D-enhanced button mushrooms via UV-B irradiation is effective in improving vitamin D status and not different from a vitamin D supplement according to study. For example, Vitamin D from UV-irradiated yeast baked into bread is bioavailable.\nBy visual assessment or using a chromometer, no significant discoloration of irradiated mushrooms, as measured by the degree of \"whiteness\", was observed making it hard to discover if they have been treated without labeling. Claims have been made that a normal serving (approx. 3 oz or 1/2 cup, or 60 grams) of mushrooms treated with ultraviolet light increase their vitamin D content to levels up to 80 micrograms, or 2700 IU if exposed to just 5 minutes of UV light after being harvested.\n\nThere have been many comparative and statistical studies of the relationship between diet and longevity, including vegetarianism and longevity.\n\nA 1999 metastudy combined data from five studies from western countries. The metastudy reported mortality ratios, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for fish eaters to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters (eat meat less than once per week) to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters had the base mortality rate of 1.0, while the number for vegans was very uncertain (anywhere between 0.7 and 1.44) due to too few data points. The study reported the numbers of deaths in each category, and expected error ranges for each ratio, and adjustments made to the data. However, the \"lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these [vegetarian] cohorts\". Out of the major causes of death studied, only one difference in mortality rate was attributed to the difference in diet, as the conclusion states: \"...vegetarians had a 24% lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease than non-vegetarians, but no associations of a vegetarian diet with other major causes of death were established\".\n\nIn \"Mortality in British vegetarians\", a similar conclusion is drawn:\n\nBritish vegetarians have low mortality compared with the general population. Their death rates are similar to those of comparable non-vegetarians, suggesting that much of this benefit may be attributed to non-dietary lifestyle factors such as a low prevalence of smoking and a generally high socio-economic status, or to aspects of the diet other than the avoidance of meat and fish.\"\n\nThe Adventist Health Studies is ongoing research that documents the life expectancy in Seventh-day Adventists. This is the only study among others with similar methodology which had favourable indication for vegetarianism. The researchers found that a combination of different lifestyle choices could influence life expectancy by as much as 10 years. Among the lifestyle choices investigated, a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1–1/2 to 2 years of life. The researchers concluded that \"the life expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population\" at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women. The life expectancy of California Adventists surviving to age 30 was 83.3 years for men and 85.7 years for women.\n\nThe Adventist health study is again incorporated into a metastudy titled \"Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans?\" published in \"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\", which concluded that low meat eating (less than once per week) and other lifestyle choices significantly increase life expectancy, relative to a group with high meat intake. The study concluded that \"The findings from one cohort of healthy adults raises the possibility that long-term (≥ 2 decades) adherence to a vegetarian diet can further produce a significant 3.6-y increase in life expectancy.\" However, the study also concluded that \"Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians.\" It further states that \"This raises the possibility that a low-meat, high plant-food dietary pattern may be the true causal protective factor rather than simply elimination of meat from the diet.\" In a recent review of studies relating low-meat diet patterns to all-cause mortality, Singh noted that \"5 out of 5 studies indicated that adults who followed a low meat, high plant-food diet pattern experienced significant or marginally significant decreases in mortality risk relative to other patterns of intake.\"\n\nStatistical studies, such as comparing life expectancy with regional areas and local diets in Europe also have found life expectancy considerably greater in southern France, where a low meat, high plant Mediterranean diet is common, than northern France, where a diet with high meat content is more common.\n\nA study by the Institute of Preventive and Clinical Medicine, and Institute of Physiological Chemistry looked at a group of 19 vegetarians (lacto-ovo) and used as a comparison a group of 19 omnivorous subjects recruited from the same region. The study found that this group of vegetarians (lacto-ovo) have a significantly higher amount of plasma carboxymethyllysine and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) compared to this group of non-vegetarians. Carboxymethyllysine is a glycation product which represents \"a general marker of oxidative stress and long-term damage of proteins in aging, atherosclerosis and diabetes\" and \"[a]dvanced glycation end products (AGEs) may play an important adverse role in process of atherosclerosis, diabetes, aging and chronic renal failure\".\n\nIn Western medicine, patients are sometimes advised to adhere to a vegetarian diet. According to studies by the Permanente Journal and the National Institute for Health (NIH), vegetarian diets are affordable and can help reduce health risks like high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and cholesterol levels. A plant based diet has the potential to lower the risk of heart disease as well as reducing the amount of medications prescribed in instances of chronic illness. A change to a plant based diet, or vegetarianism, has had dramatic positive effects on the health of patients with chronic illnesses, significantly more than exercise alone \nVegetarian diets have been used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, but the evidence is inconclusive whether this is effective.\nCertain alternative medicines, such as Ayurveda and Siddha, prescribe a vegetarian diet as a normal procedure. Maya Tiwari notes that Ayurveda recommends small portions of meat for some people, though \"the rules of hunting and killing the animal, practiced by the native peoples, were very specific and detailed\". Now that such methods of hunting and killing are not observed, she does not recommend the use of \"any animal meat as food, not even for the Vata types\".\n\nThe human digestive system is omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material. Some nutritional experts believe that early hominids evolved into eating meat as a result of huge climatic changes that took place three to four million years ago, when forests and jungles dried up and became open grasslands and opened hunting and scavenging opportunities.\n\nThe American Dietetic Association has presented evidence that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders. At the same time the association cautions however, that the adoption of a vegetarian diet may not necessarily lead to eating disorders, rather that \"vegetarian diets may be selected to camouflage an existing eating disorder\". Other studies and statements by dietitians and counselors support this conclusion.\n\nVegetarianism is associated with increased risk of depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorder, although causality cannot be established.\n\nVarious ethical reasons have been suggested for choosing vegetarianism, usually predicated on the interests of non-human animals. In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural taboo, such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as factory farms, or avoid certain meats, such as veal or foie gras. Some people follow vegetarian or vegan diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practises involved in the raising and slaughter of animals, i.e. factory farming and the industrialisation of animal slaughter. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant protein.\n\nEthical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain agricultural practices surrounding the production of meat.\n\nPrinceton University professor and animal rights activist Peter Singer believes that if alternative means of survival exist, one ought to choose the option that does not cause unnecessary harm to animals. Most ethical vegetarians argue that the same reasons exist against killing animals in the flesh to eat as against killing humans to eat. Singer, in his book \"Animal Liberation,\" listed possible qualities of sentience in non-human creatures that gave such creatures the scope to be considered under utilitarian ethics, and this has been widely referenced by animal rights campaigners and vegetarians. Ethical vegetarians also believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or nutrition value is not a sufficient cause. Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behaviour in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards.\n\nOpponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not moral equals to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious. This view does not excuse cruelty, but maintains that animals do not possess the rights a human has.\n\nOne of the main differences between a vegan and a typical vegetarian diet is the avoidance of both eggs and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter and yogurt. Ethical vegans do not consume dairy or eggs because they state that their production causes the animal suffering or a premature death.\n\nTo produce milk from dairy cattle, calves are separated from their mothers soon after birth and slaughtered or fed milk replacer in order to retain the cows milk for human consumption. Vegans state that this breaks the natural mother and calf bond. Unwanted male calves are either slaughtered at birth or sent for veal production. To prolong lactation, dairy cows are almost permanently kept pregnant through artificial insemination. After about five years, once the cows milk production has dropped, they are considered \"spent\" and sent to slaughter for beef and their hides. A dairy cow's natural life expectancy is about twenty years.\n\nIn battery cage and free-range egg production, unwanted male chicks are culled or discarded at birth during the process of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens.\n\nEthical vegetarianism has become popular in developed countries particularly because of the spread of factory farming, faster communications, and environmental consciousness. Some believe that the current mass demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a mass-production system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-ranging and consumption of game, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could substantially alleviate the demand for mass-produced meat.\n\nAncient Greek philosophy has a long tradition of vegetarianism. Pythagoras was reportedly vegetarian (and studied at Mt. Carmel, where some historians say there was a vegetarian community), as his followers were expected to be.\n\nRoman writer Ovid concluded his magnum opus Metamorphoses, in part, with the impassioned argument (uttered by the character of Pythagoras) that in order for humanity to change, or metamorphose, into a better, more harmonious species, it must strive towards more humane tendencies. He cited vegetarianism as the crucial decision in this metamorphosis, explaining his belief that human life and animal life are so entwined that to kill an animal is virtually the same as killing a fellow human.\n\nJainism teaches vegetarianism as moral conduct as do some major sects of Hinduism. Buddhism in general does not prohibit meat eating, while Mahayana Buddhism encourages vegetarianism as beneficial for developing compassion. Other denominations that advocate a vegetarian diet include the Seventh-day Adventists, the Rastafari movement, the Ananda Marga movement and the Hare Krishnas. Sikhism does not equate spirituality with diet and does not specify a vegetarian or meat diet.\n\nWhile there are no dietary restrictions in the Bahá'í Faith, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the religion's founder, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick. He stated that there are no requirements that Bahá'ís become vegetarian, but that a future society should gradually become vegetarian. `Abdu'l-Bahá also stated that killing animals was contrary to compassion. While Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals, both he and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Bahá'ís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bahá'í practice and that Bahá'ís can choose to eat whatever they wish but should be respectful of others' beliefs.\n\nTheravadins in general eat meat. If Buddhist monks \"see, hear or know\" a living animal was killed specifically for them to eat, they must refuse it or else incur an offense. However, this does not include eating meat which was given as alms or commercially purchased. In the Theravada canon, Buddha did not make any comment discouraging them from eating meat (except specific types, such as human, elephant meat, horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, and hyena flesh) but he specifically refused to institute vegetarianism in his monastic code when a suggestion had been made.\n\nIn several Sanskrit texts of Mahayana Buddhism, Buddha instructs his followers to avoid meat. However, each branch of Mahayana Buddhism selects which sutra to follow, and some branches, including the majority of Tibetan and Japanese Buddhists, do eat meat, while many Chinese Buddhist branches do not.\n\nChristians have always been free to make their own decisions about what to eat; however, there are groups within Christianity that practice specific dietary restrictions for various reasons. The early sect known as the Ebionites are considered to have practiced vegetarianism. Surviving fragments from their Gospel indicate their belief that – as Christ is the Passover sacrifice and eating the Passover lamb is no longer required – a vegetarian diet may (or should) be observed. However, orthodox Christianity does not accept their teaching as authentic. Indeed, their specific injunction to strict vegetarianism was cited as one of the Ebionites' \"errors\".\n\nAt a much later time, the Bible Christian Church founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet. Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society. Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance.\n\nSeventh-day Adventists are encouraged to engage in healthy eating practices, and ova-lacto-vegetarian diets are recommended by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Nutrition Council (GCNC). They have also sponsored and participated in many scientific studies exploring the impact of dietary decisions upon health outcomes. The GCNC has in addition adapted the USDA's food pyramid for a vegetarian dietary approach. However, the only kinds of meat specifically frowned upon by the SDA health message are unclean meats, or those forbidden in scripture.\n\nAdditionally, some monastic orders follow a vegetarian diet, and members of the Orthodox Church follow a vegan diet during fasts. There is also a strong association between the Quakers and vegetarianism dating back at least to the 18th century. The association grew in prominence during the 19th century, coupled with growing Quaker concerns in connection with alcohol consumption, anti-vivisection and social purity. The association between the Quaker tradition and vegetarianism, however, becomes most significant with the founding of the Friends' Vegetarian Society in 1902 \"to spread a kindlier way of living amongst the Society of Friends.\"\n\nAccording to Canon Law, Roman Catholics are required to abstain from meat (defined as all animal flesh excluding water animals) on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays of Lent including Good Friday. Canon Law also obliges Catholics to abstain from meat on the Fridays of the year outside of Lent (excluding certain holy days) unless, with the permission of the local conference of bishops, another penitential act is substituted. The restrictions on eating meat on these days is solely as an act of penance and not because of a religious objection to eating meat.\n\nSince the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the 1860s when the church began, wholeness and health have been an emphasis of the Adventist church, and has been known as the \"health message\" belief of the church. Adventists are well known for presenting a health message that recommends vegetarianism and expects adherence to the kosher laws in . Obedience to these laws means abstinence from pork, shellfish, and other animals proscribed as \"unclean\". The church discourages its members from consuming alcoholic beverages, tobacco or illegal drugs (compare Christianity and alcohol). In addition, some Adventists avoid coffee, tea, cola, and other beverages containing caffeine.\nThe pioneers of the Adventist Church had much to do with the common acceptance of breakfast cereals into the Western diet, and the \"modern commercial concept of cereal food\" originated among Adventists. John Harvey Kellogg was one of the early founders of Adventist health work. His development of breakfast cereals as a health food led to the founding of Kellogg's by his brother William. In both Australia and New Zealand, the church-owned Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company is a leading manufacturer of health and vegetarian-related products, most prominently Weet-Bix.\n\nResearch funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health has shown that the average Adventist in California lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian. The research, as cited by the cover story of the November 2005 issue of \"National Geographic\", asserts that Adventists live longer because they do not smoke or drink alcohol, have a day of rest every week, and maintain a healthy, low-fat vegetarian diet that is rich in nuts and beans. The cohesiveness of Adventists' social networks has also been put forward as an explanation for their extended lifespan.\nSince Dan Buettner's 2005 \"National Geographic\" story about Adventist longevity, his book, \"The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest\", named Loma Linda, California a \"blue zone\" because of the large concentration of Seventh-day Adventists. He cites the Adventist emphasis on health, diet, and Sabbath-keeping as primary factors for Adventist longevity.\n\nAn estimated 35% of Adventists practice vegetarianism or veganism, according to a 2002 worldwide survey of local church leaders.\n\nThough there is no strict rule on what to consume and what not to, paths of Hinduism hold vegetarianism as an ideal. Some reasons are: the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) applied to animals; the intention to offer only \"pure\" (vegetarian) food to a deity and then to receive it back as prasad; and the conviction that a sentient diet is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is not recommended for a better mind and for spiritual development.\n\nHowever, the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community, location, custom and varying traditions. Historically and currently, those Hindus who eat meat prescribe Jhatka meat, while some Hindus believe that the cow is a holy animal whose slaughter for meat is forbidden. This belief varies according to region.\n\nSome followers of Islam, or Muslims, chose to be vegetarian for health, ethical, or personal reasons. However, the choice to become vegetarian for non-medical reasons can sometimes be controversial due to conflicting fatwas and differing interpretations of the Quran. Though some more traditional Muslims may keep quiet about their vegetarian diet, the number of vegetarian Muslims is increasing.\n\nVegetarianism has been practiced by some influential Muslims including the Iraqi theologian, female mystic and poet Râbi‘ah al-‘Adawîyah of Basrah, who died in the year 801, and the Sri Lankan Sufi master Bawa Muhaiyaddeen who established The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship of North America in Philadelphia. The former Indian president Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was also famously a vegetarian.\n\nIn January 1996, The International Vegetarian Union announced the formation of the Muslim Vegetarian/Vegan Society.\n\nMany non-vegetarian Muslims will select vegetarian (or seafood) options when dining in non-halal restaurants. However, this is a matter of not having the right kind of meat rather than preferring not to eat meat on the whole.\n\nFollowers of Jainism believe that all living organisms whether they are micro-organism are living and have a soul, and have one or more senses out of five senses and they go to great lengths to minimise any harm to any living organism. Most Jains are lacto-vegetarians but more devout Jains do not eat root vegetables because they believe that root vegetables contain a lot more micro-organisms as compared to other vegetables, and that, by eating them, violence of these micro-organisms is inevitable. So they focus on eating beans and fruits, whose cultivation do not involve killing of a lot of micro-organisms. No products obtained from dead animals are allowed, because when a living beings dies, a lot of micro-organisms (called as decomposers) will reproduce in the body which decomposes the body, and in eating the dead bodies, violence of decomposers is inevitable. Jain monks usually do a lot of fasting, and when they knew through spiritual powers that their life is very little, they start fasting until death. Some particularly dedicated individuals are fruitarians. Honey is forbidden, because honey is the regurgitation of nectar by bees and may also contain eggs, excreta and dead bees. Some Jains do not consume plant parts that grow underground such as roots and bulbs, because the plants themselves and tiny animals may be killed when the plants are pulled up.\n\nWhile it is neither required (required only on special holidays [Pessach, Sukot and Shavuot] according to some traditions, but not on Shabbat [Friday], when just bread and wine/grape juice is required) nor prohibited for Jews to eat meat, a number of medieval scholars of Jewish religion (e.g., Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama) regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal, not just because of a concern for the welfare of animals, but because the slaughter of animals might cause the individual who performs such acts to develop negative character traits. One modern-day scholar who is in favour of vegetarianism is the late Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the Chief Rabbi of Mandate Palestine. In his writings, Rabbi Kook speaks of vegetarianism as an ideal, and points to the fact that Adam did not partake of the flesh of animals, as all humans and animals were originally commanded by God to only eat plants. In context, Rabbi Kook makes those comments in his portrayal of the eschatological (messianic) era. However, he personally refrained from eating meat except on the Sabbath and Festivals, and one of his leading disciples, Rabbi David Cohen, known as the \"Nazirite\" of Jerusalem, was a devout vegetarian. Several other members of Rabbi Kook's circle were also vegetarians.\n\nAccording to some Kabbalists, only a mystic, who is able to sense and elevate the reincarnated human souls and \"divine sparks\", is permitted to consume meat, though eating the flesh of an animal might still cause spiritual damage to the soul. A number of Orthodox Jewish vegetarian groups and activists promote such ideas and believe that the halakhic permission to eat meat is a temporary leniency for those who are not ready yet to accept the vegetarian diet. Jewish law also commands people to ritually slaughter animals when killing them, and goes into precise detail on the rituals of both animal sacrifice and ordinary slaughter (shechita). According to medieval sage Rabbi Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz, author of the Torah commentary Kli Yakar, the complexity of these laws was intended to discourage the consumption of meat and make it less painful for the animals.\n\nAccording to (Genesis 1:29-30), consumption of meat was banned. After the Great Flood, Noah was given permission to consume meat:\n\n\"Behold, I have given to you all herbage-yielding seed that is on the surface of the earth, and every tree that has seed-yielding fruit; it shall be yours for food. And to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the sky, and to everything that moves on the earth, within which there is a living soul, every green herb is for food.\" (Genesis 1:29-30)\n\nWithin the Afro-Caribbean community, a minority are Rastafari and follow the dietary regulations with varying degrees of strictness. The most orthodox eat only \"Ital\" or natural foods, in which the matching of herbs or spices with vegetables is the result of long tradition originating from the African ancestry and cultural heritage of Rastafari. \"Ital\", which is derived from the word vital, means essential to human existence. Ital cooking in its strictest form prohibits the use of salt, meat (especially pork), preservatives, colorings, flavorings and anything artificial. Most Rastafari are vegetarian.\n\nThe tenets of Sikhism do not advocate a particular stance on either vegetarianism or the consumption of meat, but leave the decision of diet to the individual. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, however, prohibited \"Amritdhari\" Sikhs, or those that follow the Sikh Rehat Maryada (the Official Sikh Code of Conduct) from eating Kutha meat, or meat which has been obtained from animals which have been killed in a ritualistic way. This is understood to have been for the political reason of maintaining independence from the then-new Muslim hegemony, as Muslims largely adhere to the ritualistic halal diet.\n\n\"Amritdharis\" that belong to some Sikh sects (e.g. Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal, Namdhari and Rarionwalay, etc.) are vehemently against the consumption of meat and eggs (though they do consume and encourage the consumption of milk, butter and cheese). This vegetarian stance has been traced back to the times of the British Raj, with the advent of many new Vaishnava converts. In response to the varying views on diet throughout the Sikh population, Sikh Gurus have sought to clarify the Sikh view on diet, stressing their preference only for simplicity of diet. Guru Nanak said that over-consumption of food (Lobh, Greed) involves a drain on the Earth's resources and thus on life. Passages from the \"Guru Granth Sahib\" (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the \"Adi Granth\") say that it is \"foolish\" to argue for the superiority of animal life, because though all life is related, only human life carries more importance: \"Only fools argue whether to eat meat or not. Who can define what is meat and what is not meat? Who knows where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?\" The Sikh langar, or free temple meal, is largely lacto-vegetarian, though this is understood to be a result of efforts to present a meal that is respectful of the diets of any person who would wish to dine, rather than out of dogma.\n\nEnvironmental vegetarianism is based on the concern that the production of meat and animal products for mass consumption, especially through factory farming, is environmentally unsustainable. According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide, and modern practices of raising animals for food contribute on a \"massive scale\" to air and water pollution, land degradation, climate change, and loss of biodiversity. The initiative concluded that \"the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.\"\n\nIn addition, animal agriculture is a large source of greenhouse gases. According to a 2006 report it is responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as estimated in 100-year CO equivalents. Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents. This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents.\n\nMeat produced in a laboratory (called in vitro meat) may be more environmentally sustainable than regularly produced meat. Reactions of vegetarians vary. Rearing a relatively small number of grazing animals can be beneficial, as the Food Climate Research Network at Surrey University reports: \"A little bit of livestock production is probably a good thing for the environment.\n\nIn May 2009, Ghent, Belgium, was reported to be \"the first [city] in the world to go vegetarian at least once a week\" for environmental reasons, when local authorities decided to implement a \"weekly meatless day\". Civil servants would eat vegetarian meals one day per week, in recognition of the United Nations' report. Posters were put up by local authorities to encourage the population to take part on vegetarian days, and \"veggie street maps\" were printed to highlight vegetarian restaurants. In September 2009, schools in Ghent are due to have a weekly \"veggiedag\" (\"vegetarian day\") too.\n\nSome groups, such as PETA, promote vegetarianism as a way to offset poor treatment and working conditions of workers in the contemporary meat industry. These groups cite studies showing the psychological damage caused by working in the meat industry, especially in factory and industrialised settings, and argue that the meat industry violates its labourers' human rights by assigning difficult and distressing tasks without adequate counselling, training and debriefing. However, the working conditions of agricultural workers as a whole, particularly non-permanent workers, remain poor and well below conditions prevailing in other economic sectors. Accidents, including pesticide poisoning, among farmers and plantation workers contribute to increased health risks, including increased mortality. According to the International Labour Organization, agriculture is one of the three most dangerous jobs in the world.\n\nSimilar to environmental vegetarianism is the concept of economic vegetarianism. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism from either the philosophical viewpoint concerning issues such as public health and curbing world starvation, the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound, part of a conscious simple living strategy or just out of necessity. According to the Worldwatch Institute, \"Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease their health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate. As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable to the world's chronically hungry.\"\n\nPrejudice researcher Gordon Hodson observes that vegetarians and vegans frequently face discrimination where eating meat is held as a cultural norm.\n\nA 1992 market research study conducted by the Yankelovich research organisation concluded that \"of the 12.4 million people [in the US] who call themselves vegetarian, 68% are female, while only 32% are male\".\n\nAt least one study indicates that vegetarian women are more likely to have female babies. A study of 6,000 pregnant women in 1998 \"found that while the national average in Britain is 106 boys born to every 100 girls, for vegetarian mothers the ratio was just 85 boys to 100 girls\". Catherine Collins of the British Dietetic Association has dismissed this as a \"statistical fluke\" given that it is actually the male's genetic contribution which determines the sex of a baby.\n\n\n\n",
                "Food and drink prohibitions\n\nSome people abstain from consuming various foods and beverages in conformity with various religious, cultural, legal or other societal prohibitions. Many of these prohibitions constitute taboos. Many food taboos and other prohibitions forbid the meat of a particular animal, including mammals, rodents, reptiles, amphibians, fish, molluscs, crustaceans and insects, which may relate to a disgust response being more often associated with meats than plant-based foods. Some prohibitions are specific to a particular part or excretion of an animal, while others forgo the consumption of plants or fungi.\n\nFood prohibitions can be defined as rules, codified by religion or otherwise, about which foods, or combinations of foods, may not be eaten and how animals are to be slaughtered or prepared. The origins of these prohibitions are varied. In some cases, they are thought to be a result of health considerations or other practical reasons; in others, they relate to human symbolic systems.\n\nSome foods may be prohibited during certain religious periods (\"e.g.\", Lent), at certain stages of life (\"e.g.\", pregnancy), or to certain classes of people (\"e.g.\", priests), even though the food is otherwise permitted. On a comparative basis food taboos seem to make no sense at all as what may be declared unfit for one group may be perfectly acceptable to another. Whether scientifically correct or not, often food taboos are meant to protect the human individual, but there are numerous other reasons for their existence. An ecological or medical background is apparent in many, including some that are seen as religious or spiritual in origin. Food taboos can help utilizing a resource more efficiently, but when applied to only a subsection of the community, a food taboo can also lead to the monopolization of a food item by those exempted. A food taboo acknowledged by a particular group or tribe as part of their ways, aids in the cohesion of the group, helps that particular group to stand out and maintain its identity in the face of others and therefore creates a feeling of “belonging” .\n\nVarious religions forbid the consumption of certain types of food. For example, Judaism prescribes a strict set of rules, called \"Kashrut\", regarding what may and may not be eaten, and notably forbidding the mixing of meat with dairy products. Islam has similar laws, dividing foods into \"haram\" (forbidden) and \"halal\" (permitted). Jains often follow religious directives to observe vegetarianism. Most Hindus do not eat beef, and some Hindus apply the concept of \"ahimsa\" (non-violence) to their diet and consider vegetarianism as ideal, and practice forms of vegetarianism. In some cases, the process of preparation rather than the food itself comes under scrutiny. For instance, in early medieval Christianity, certain uncooked foods were of dubious status: a penitential ascribed to Bede outlined a (mild) penance for those who ate uncooked foods, and Saint Boniface wrote to Pope Zachary (in a letter preserved in the Boniface correspondence, no. 87) asking him how long bacon would have to be cured to be proper for consumption. The Kapu system was used in Hawaii until 1819.\n\nAside from formal rules, there are cultural taboos against the consumption of some animals. Within a given society, some meats will be considered to be not for consumption that are outside the range of the generally accepted definition of a foodstuff. Novel meats, \"i.e.\" animal-derived food products not familiar to an individual or to a culture, generally provoke a disgust reaction, which may be expressed as a cultural taboo. For example, although dog meat is eaten, in certain circumstances, in Korea, Vietnam, and China, it is considered inappropriate as a food in Western countries. Likewise, horse meat is rarely eaten in the English-speaking world, although it is part of the national cuisine of countries as widespread as Kazakhstan, Japan, Italy, and France.\n\nSometimes food prohibitions enter national or local law, as with the ban on cattle abattoirs in most of India, and horse slaughter in the United States. Even after reversion to Chinese rule, Hong Kong has not lifted its ban on supplying meat from dogs and cats, imposed during British colonial rule.\n\nEnvironmentalism, ethical consumerism and other activist movements are giving rise to new prohibitions and eating guidelines. A fairly recent addition to cultural food prohibitions is the meat and eggs of endangered species or animals that are otherwise protected by law or international treaty. Examples of such protected species include some species of whales, sea turtles, and migratory birds. Similarly, sustainable seafood advisory lists and certification discourage the consumption of certain seafoods due to unsustainable fishing. Organic certification prohibits certain synthetic chemical inputs during food production, or genetically modified organisms, irradiation, and the use of sewage sludge. The Fair Trade movement and certification discourage the consumption of food and other goods produced in exploitative working conditions. Other social movements generating taboos include Local Food and \"The 100-Mile Diet\", both of which encourage abstinence from non-locally produced food, and veganism, in which adherents endeavour not to use or consume animal products of any kind.\n\nJudaism strictly forbids the consumption of amphibians such as frogs. The restriction is described in Leviticus 11:29-30 and 42-43. Derivative chemical products from amphibians, as well as with other proscribed animals, must be avoided.\n\nIn other cultures, foods such as frog legs are treasured as delicacies, and the animals may be raised commercially in some circumstances. However, environmental concerns over the endangerment of frogs, even possibly pushing them into extinction, due to overconsumption has prompted legal action in nations such as France to limit their use in food. The French Ministry of Agriculture began taking measures to protect native frog species in 1976, and efforts have continued since. Mass commercial harvesting of the animals was banned in 1980, though international imports as well as private, individual hunting and cooking remains legal in many areas.\n\nIn Judaism, the Deuteronomic Code and Priestly Code explicitly prohibit the bat. Likewise, Islamic Sharia forbids their consumption. (However, in the predominantly Muslim nation of Indonesia, bat meat is known to be a prized delicacy, especially within the Batak and Minahasa minority communities, both of which are largely non-Muslim.)\n\nBears are not considered kosher animals in Judaism. Observant Jews therefore abstain from eating bear meat. All predatory terrestrial animals are forbidden in Islam.\n\nThe Torah (Leviticus 11:13) explicitly states that the eagle, vulture, and osprey are not to be eaten. A bird now commonly raised for meat in some areas, the ostrich, is explicitly banned as food in some interpretations of Leviticus 11:16. Rabbis have frequently inferred that the singling out of birds of prey as well as natural scavengers in tradition for prohibition creates a distinction with other avian species; thus, eating chickens, ducks, geese, and turkeys is allowed.\n\nIn contrast Islamic dietary rules cite the ostrich is permissible to consume, while birds of prey (defined specifically as those who hunt with claws and talons) are forbidden.\n\nScavengers and carrion-eaters such as vultures and crows are avoided as food in many cultures because they are perceived as carriers of disease and unclean, and associated with death. An exception is the rook which was a recognised country dish, and which has in more recent times been served in a Scottish restaurant in London. In Western cultures today, most people regard songbirds as backyard wildlife rather than as food.\n\nA balut is a developing bird embryo (usually a duck or chicken) that is boiled and eaten from the shell. Part of the Quran includes understanding and respecting the law that any animal products should not be eaten if the animal has not been slaughtered properly, making the animal or animal-product \"maytah\". Because balut is an egg containing a partly-developed embryo, Muslims believe this makes it \"haram\", or \"forbidden\".\n\nThe eating of camels is strictly prohibited by the Torah in and . The Torah considers the camel unclean because even though it chews the cud, or regurgitates, the way bovines, sheep, goats, deer, antelope, and giraffes (all of which are kosher) do, it does not meet the cloven hoof criterion. Like these animals, camels (and llamas) are ruminants with a multi-chambered stomach. Camels are even-toed ungulates, with feet split in two. However, unlike them, camels' feet form not hard hooves but rather soft pads.\n\nIn Islam, the eating of camel is allowed, and is indeed traditional in the Islamic heartland in Saudi Arabia and the Arabian Peninsula more generally.\n\nThere is a strong taboo against eating cats in many Western parts of the world, including most of the Americas and Europe. Cat meat is forbidden by Jewish and Islamic law as both religions forbid the eating of carnivores. Cat meat is eaten as part of uncommon cuisines of China, Vietnam and Switzerland. Cats are commonly regarded as pets in Western countries, or as working animals, kept to control vermin, not as a food animal, and consumption of cats is thus seen as a barbaric act by a large part of the population in those countries. Cat meat was eaten, for example, during the famine in the Siege of Leningrad. In 1996, a place that served cat meat was supposedly discovered by the Argentine press in a shanty town in Rosario, but in fact the meal had been set up by media from Buenos Aires.\n\nIn 2008, it was reported that cats were a staple part of the local diet in Guangdong, China, with many cats being shipped down from the north and one Guangzhou-based business receiving up to 10,000 cats per day from different parts of China. Protesters in other parts of China have urged the Guangdong provincial government to crack down on cat traders and restaurants that serve cat meat, although no law says it is illegal to eat cats.\n\nThe term \"roof-hare\" (roof-rabbit, German \"Dachhase\") applies to cat meat presented as that of a hare, another small mammal used as a source of meat. Subtracting the skin, feet, head and tail, hare and cat carcasses appear similar. The only way to distinguish them is by looking at the \"processus hamatus\" of the feline scapula, which should have a \"processus suprahamatus\". \"Dar gato por liebre\" (\"to pass off a cat as a hare\") is an expression common to many Spanish-speaking countries, equivalent to \"to pull the wool over someone's eyes\" derived from this basic scam. There is an equivalent Portuguese expression \"Comprar gato por lebre\", meaning \"to buy a cat as a hare\". The expression \"churrasco de gato\" (\"cat barbecue\") is largely used in Brazil with a humorous note, especially for roadside stands that offer grilled meat on a stick (often coated with farofa), due to their poor hygiene and that the source of the meat is mostly unknown. Also, in the Philippines, there is an urban legend and a joke that some vendors use cat meat to make \"siopao\" (steamed bun), leading some Filipinos to name their pet cats \"Siopao\". Meanwhile, \"kitten cakes\" and \"buy three shawarma - assemble a kitten\" are common Russian urban jokes about the suspect origin of food from street vendors' stalls. In English, the common expression refers to what the victim of the trick thinks is happening: \"Buy a pig in a poke.\"\n\nThe inhabitants of Vicenza in northern Italy are reputed to eat cats, although the practice has been out of use for decades. In February 2010, a popular Italian gastronome was criticized and suspended from a show for talking about the former practice of eating cat stew in Tuscany.\n\nDuring the so-called \"Bad Times\" of hunger in Europe during and after World War I and World War II \"roof-rabbit\" was a common food. Those who thought that they were eating Australian rabbits were really eating European cats.\n\nSome restaurants in the Hai Phong and Hạ Long Bay area in north Vietnam advertise cat meat hot pot as \"little tiger\", and cats in cages can be seen inside.\n\nCattle hold a traditional place as objects of reverence in countries such as India. Many Hindus, particularly Brahmins, are vegetarian and strictly abstaining from eating meat. Many of those who do eat meat abstain from the consumption of beef, especially in the north and west India, as the cow holds a sacred place in Hinduism. For example, tradition states that the goddess Kamdhenu manifests herself as a wish-granting divine cow, with such stories repeated over generations. Beef is widely eaten in south India, especially Kerala, and throughout northeast India.\n\nIn contrast to cow slaughter, consumption of dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and particularly ghee (a form of butter) is highly common in India. Cow-derived products play a significant role in Hinduism with milk particularly being highly revered, often being used in holy ceremonies.\n\nBullocks were the primary source of agricultural power and transportation in the early days, and as India adopted an agricultural lifestyle, the cow proved to be a very useful animal: this respect stemming out of necessity led to abstaining from killing cows for food; for example, if a famine-stricken village kills and eats its bullocks, they will not be available to pull the plough and the cart when next planting season comes. However, this hypothesis has found little data to support it. Areas suffering from famine may resort to consuming cattle in efforts to survive till the next season.\n\nBy Indian law, the slaughter of female cattle (i.e. cows) is banned in almost all Indian states except Kerala, West Bengal and the seven north eastern states. A person involved in either cow slaughter or its illegal transportation could be jailed in many states. Slaughter of cows is an extremely provocative issue for many Hindus.\n\nMany Zoroastrians do not eat beef, because of the cow that saved Zoroaster's life from murderers when Zoroaster was a baby. Actual Pahlavi texts state that Zoroastrians should be fully vegetarian.\n\nSome ethnic Chinese may also refrain from eating cow meat, because many of them feel that it is wrong to eat an animal that was so useful in agriculture. Some Chinese Buddhists discourage the consumption of beef, although it is not considered taboo. A similar taboo can be seen among Sinhalese Buddhists, who consider it to be ungrateful to kill the animal whose milk and labour provides livelihoods to many Sinhalese people.\n\nWhile both beef and dairy consumption is permitted in Judaism, the mixing of dairy products with any sort of meat is completely forbidden.\n\nChewing gum is a soft, cohesive substance intended for chewing but not swallowing. Humans have used chewing gum for at least 3,000 years. In Singapore importing chewing gum is a criminal offense. The exception is made for dental or nicotine gum, which is available from dentists and pharmacies.\n\nAlmost all types of non-piscine seafood, such as shellfish, lobster, shrimp or crayfish, are forbidden by Judaism because such animals live in water but do not have both fins and scales.\n\nAs a general rule, all seafood is permissible in the 3 \"madh'hab\" of Sunni Islam except Hanafi school of thought. The Ja'fari school of Islamic jurisprudence, which is followed by most Shia Muslims, prohibits non-piscine (lacking scales) seafood (with the exception of shrimp).\n\nMilk, cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products are not consumed by vegans due to their animal origin. The consumption of dairy products together with meat is also prohibited as non-kosher in the Jewish faith, as prescribed in Deuteronomy 14:21: \"You shall not boil a young goat in its mother's milk.\"\n\nGenerally in all Western countries eating dog meat is considered taboo, though that taboo has been broken under threat of starvation in the past. Dog meat has been eaten in every major German crisis at least since the time of Frederick the Great, and is commonly referred to as \"blockade mutton.\" In the early 20th century, consumption of dog meat in Germany was common. Suspicions about the provenance of Frankfurter meat sold by German immigrants in the United States led to the coinage of the term 'hot dog'. In 1937, a meat inspection law targeted against trichinella was introduced for pigs, dogs, boars, foxes, badgers, and other carnivores. Dog meat has been prohibited in Germany since 1986. In 2009 a scandal erupted when a farm near Częstochowa was discovered rearing dogs to be rendered down into \"smalec\" - lard.\n\nAccording to the ancient Hindu scriptures (cf. Manusmṛti and medicinal texts like Sushruta Samhita), \"dog's meat\" was regarded as the most unclean (and rather poisonous) food possible. Dog's meat is also regarded as unclean under Jewish and Islamic dietary laws; therefore, both of those religious traditions also discourage its consumption.\n\nIn Irish mythology, legend recounts how Cú Chulainn, the great hero of Ulster, was presented with a Morton's fork, forcing him to either break his \"geis\" (taboo) about eating dog meat (his name means Culann's Hound) or break his taboo about declining hospitality; Cú Chulainn chose to eat the meat, leading ultimately to his death.\n\nIn Mexico during the pre-Columbian era a hairless dog named xoloitzcuintle was commonly eaten. After colonization, this custom stopped. Lewis & Clark plus the men in his expedition were recorded in Lewis's journals of having eaten and enjoyed dog meat which was common practice in Indians of the American Plains.\n\nIn East Asia, most countries excluding Vietnam, North and South Korea rarely consume dog meat either because of Islamic or Buddhist values or animal rights as in the Philippines. Manchus have a prohibition against the eating of dog meat, which is sometimes consumed by the Manchus' neighboring Northeastern Asian peoples. The Manchus also avoid the wearing of hats made of dog's fur. In addition to Manchus, Chinese Mongol, Miao, Muslims, Tibetan, Yao and Yi have a taboo against dog meat. In Indonesia, due to its majority Islamic population, consuming dog meat is prohibited, with exception of Christian Batak and Minahasan ethnic groups that traditionally consumed dog meat.\n\nThe Urapmin people of the New Guinea Highlands do not kill or eat dogs, unlike some neighboring tribes, nor do they let dogs breathe on their food.\n\nJains abstain from eating eggs. Vegans also abstain from eggs, due to their animal origin. Many Hindu vegetarians also refrain from eating eggs, although this is not universal among the faithful.\n\nAn egg that naturally contains a spot of blood may not be eaten under Jewish and Islamic tradition, although they're commonly consumed otherwise.\n\nBuddhist monks are forbidden from eating elephant meat.\n\nElephant meat is also not considered Kosher by Jewish dietary laws because they do not have cloven hooves and they are not ruminants.\n\nAmong the Somali people, most clans have a taboo against the consumption of fish, and do not intermarry with the few occupational clans that do eat it.\n\nThere are taboos on eating fish among many upland pastoralists and agriculturalists (and even some coastal peoples) inhabiting parts of southeastern Egypt, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Somalia, Kenya, and northern Tanzania. This is sometimes referred to as the \"Cushitic fish-taboo\", as Cushitic speakers are believed to have been responsible for the introduction of fish avoidance to East Africa, though not all Cushitic groups avoid fish. The zone of the fish taboo roughly coincides with the area where Cushitic languages are spoken, and as a general rule, speakers of Nilo-Saharan and Semitic languages do not have this taboo, and indeed many are watermen. The few Bantu and Nilotic groups in East Africa that do practice fish avoidance also reside in areas where Cushites appear to have lived in earlier times. Within East Africa, the fish taboo is found no further than Tanzania. This is attributed to the local presence of the tsetse fly and in areas beyond, which likely acted as a barrier to further southern migrations by wandering pastoralists, the principal fish-avoiders. Zambia and Mozambique's Bantus were therefore spared subjugation by pastoral groups, and they consequently nearly all consume fish.\n\nThere is also another center of fish avoidance in Southern Africa, among mainly Bantu speakers. It is not clear whether this disinclination developed independently or whether it was introduced. It is certain, however, that no avoidance of fish occurs among southern Africa's earliest inhabitants, the Khoisan. Nevertheless, since the Bantu of southern Africa also share various cultural traits with the pastoralists further north in East Africa, it is believed that, at an unknown date, the taboo against the consumption of fish was similarly introduced from East Africa by cattle-herding peoples who somehow managed to get their livestock past the aforementioned tsetse fly endemic regions.\n\nCertain species of fish are also forbidden in Judaism such as the freshwater eel (Anguillidae) and all species of catfish. Although they live in water, they appear to have no scales (except under a microscope) (see Leviticus 11:10-13). Sunni Muslim laws are more flexible in this. Catfish and shark are generally seen as halal as they are special types of fish. Eel is generally considered permissible in the four Sunni \"madh'hab.\" The Ja'fari jurisprudence followed by most Shia Muslims forbid all species of fish that does not have scales, it also forbid all shell fish species except prawns.\n\nMany tribes of the Southwestern United States, including the Navaho, Apache, and Zuñi, have a taboo against fish and other water-related animals, including waterfowl.\n\nNorse settlers in Greenland (10th–15th centuries AD) developed a taboo against fish consumption, as recounted in Jared Diamond's \"\". This is unusual, as Norsemen did not generally have a taboo against fish, Diamond noting that \"Fish bones account for much less than 0.1% of animal bones recovered at Greenland Norse archeological sites, compared to between 50 and 95% at most contemporary Iceland, northern Norway, and Shetland sites.\"\n\nMany countries observe this as a delicacy but it is a taboo in most countries. Considered as corpses, fetuses of goats and sheep are a delicacy in parts of India, China and Vietnam. Known as \"kutti pi\" (fetus bag), this is prepared to become a soup or a spicy curry. With only the intestines removed, the fetus is slow cooked for a few minutes.\n\nVedic Brahmins, Gaudiya Vaishnavas, tantriks and some Buddhist priests abstain from fungi and all vegetables of the onion family (Alliaceae). They believe that these excite damaging passions. In North Indian traditions, plants of the onion family, and effectively all overwintering plants are considered taboo. This is possibly due to the influence of Jain traditions. In Jain traditions, bad karma is generated with all forms of killing, including that of plants. Hierarchy of living creatures is based on the number of senses they possess. In this hierarchy, overwintering plants such as onions are ranked higher than other food crops such as wheat and rice. The ability of onions to observe the changing of the seasons and bloom in spring is believed to be an additional 'sense' absent in lower plants. The amount of bad karma generated depends on the number of senses the creature possesses. Therefore, it is thought best to avoid eating onions. Fungi are eschewed as they grow at night.\n\nIn Iceland, rural parts of Sweden and Western Finland, although not taboo, mushrooms were not widely eaten before the Second World War. They were viewed as a food for cows and were also associated with the stigma of being a wartime and poverty food. This is a marked contrast to the ancient Romans, who considered the mushroom a delicacy of the highest order and held it in high regard as food fit for emperors.\n\nGuinea pigs, or \"cuy\", are commonly eaten in Peru, in the southwestern cities and villages of Colombia, and among some populations in the highlands of Ecuador, mostly in the Andes highlands. Cuyes can be found on the menu of restaurants in Lima and other cities in Peru, as well as in Pasto, Colombia. Guinea pig meat is exported to the United States and European nations.\n\nIn 2004, the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation took legal action to stop vendors serving \"cuy\" at an Ecuadorian festival in Flushing Meadows Park. New York State allows for the consumption of guinea pigs, but New York City prohibits it. Accusations of cultural persecution have since been leveled.\n\nThe guinea pig's close rodent cousins, capybara and paca, are consumed as food in South America. The Catholic Church's restriction on eating meat during Lent does not apply to the capybara, as it is specifically exempted from this rule.\n\nHorse meat is part of the cuisine of countries as widespread as Italy, with an average of 900 grams consumed per person annually ; Belgium, France, Spain and Switzerland, where horse meat is common in supermarkets; Germany with only 50 grams consumed per person on average annually. It is still sold in some specialized butcher shops in eastern Austria, and also eaten in Polynesia , Serbia, Slovenia, Kazakhstan , but is taboo in some religions and many countries. It is forbidden by Jewish law, because the horse is not a ruminant, nor does it have cloven hooves. Similarly to dogs, eating horses was a taboo for the Castro culture in Northwestern Portugal, and it is still a counter-cultural practice in the region.\n\nHorse meat is forbidden by some sects of Christianity. In 732, Pope Gregory III instructed Saint Boniface to suppress the pagan practice of eating horses, calling it a \"filthy and abominable custom\". The Christianisation of Iceland in 1000 AD was achieved only when the Church promised that Icelanders could continue to eat horsemeat; once the Church had consolidated its power, the allowance was discontinued. Horsemeat is still popular in Iceland and is sold and consumed in the same way as beef, lamb and pork.\n\nIn Islam, opinions vary as to the permissibility of horse meat. Some cite a hadith forbidding it to Muslims, but others doubt its validity and authority. Wild horses are generally seen as halal while domesticated horses and asses are viewed as forbidden. Various Muslim cultures have differed in the attitude in eating the meat. Historically, Turks and Persians have eaten the meat, while in North Africa this is rare.\n\nHorse meat consumption is modestly counter-cultural in the English-speaking world. In Canada, horse meat is legal. Most Canadian horse meat is exported to Continental Europe or Japan. The consumer protection show \"Kassensturz\" of Swiss television SRF discovered the bad treatment and brutal animal husbandry in Canadian horse meat farms, consequently the import from such farms has been boycotted. In the United States, sale and consumption of horse meat is illegal in California and Illinois. However, it was sold in the US during WW II, since beef was expensive, rationed and destined for the troops. The last horse meat slaughterhouse in USA was closed in 2007. Nevertheless, discarded leisure, sport and work horses are collected and sold at auctions. They are shipped across the country by transporters to the borders of Canada in the north and Mexico in the south to be sold to horse meat butchers. The handling of the animals at the collection points and during the hours of transport is brutal. Some animals do not survive the hours long transports. The issue of horse consumption in the UK and Ireland was raised in 2013 with regards to the 2013 horse meat contamination scandal.\n\nAlthough generally horse meat is also avoided in the Balkans, though not Slovenia, as horse is considered to be a noble animal, or because eating horse meat is associated with war-time famine, it has a small niche market in Serbia.\n\nOf all the taboo meat, human flesh ranks as the most heavily proscribed. In recent times humans have consumed the flesh of fellow humans in rituals and out of insanity, hatred, or overriding hunger – never as a common part of their diet, but it is thought that the practice was once widespread among all humans. The consumption of human flesh is forbidden by Hinduism and Judaism and Islam.\n\nCatholics, Lutherans, and Orthodox Christians do not view themselves as engaging in cannibalism when taking communion, as it is believed that although the bread and wine become of the same substance as the body and blood of Christ before being consumed, they remain bread and wine in all ways to the senses. Catholics refer to this as transubstantiation; the Orthodox believe the change occurs, but hesitate to attempt a description of the mechanism, believing it to be a sacred mystery. Most Protestants and other Christian denominations do not believe that transubstantiation (or any actual physical presence of Jesus in any form) occurs at all.\n\nCannibalism used to be required in certain tribes; the Fore people of Papua New Guinea were particularly well-studied in their eating of the dead, because it led to kuru, a disease believed to be transmitted by prions. In the book \"Daily life in China, on the eve of the Mongol invasion, 1250-1276\" Jacques Gernet refers to restaurants that specialized in human flesh. From the context, it does not appear that this was a freak event associated with famine.\n\nIn Judaism and within other groups following the Hebrew Torah certain locusts are allowed as food (Leviticus 11:22 and Matthew 3:4). Except for certain locusts and related species, insects are not considered Kosher foods; dietary laws also require that practitioners check food carefully for insects. In Islam locusts are considered lawful food along with fish that do not require ritual slaughtering.\n\nHoney is concentrated nectar and honeydew which has been regurgitated by bees. It is considered kosher even though honey bees are not, an apparent exception to the normal rule that products of an unclean animal are also unclean. This topic is covered in the Talmud and is explained to be permissible on the grounds that the bee does not originally make the honey, the flower does, while the bees store and dehydrate the liquid into honey. This is different to royal jelly, which is produced by bees directly and is considered non-Kosher.\n\nSome vegans also avoid honey as they would any other animal product.\n\nKangaroo meat is banned in the U.S. state of California. The ban was first imposed in 1971; a moratorium was put in place in 2007, allowing the importation of the meat, but the ban was re-enacted in 2015.\n\nLettuce is taboo to the Yazidi religion.\n\nIslamic, Judaic law (including Noahide Law), and some laws of some Christians forbid any portion that is cut from a live animal (Genesis 9:4, as interpreted in the Talmud, Sanhedrin 59a). Judaism restricts this prohibition to land animals and birds; fish do not require kosher slaughter, but must first be killed before being eaten. \n\nExamples of the eating of animals that are still alive include eating live seafood, such as \"raw oyster on the half shell\" and ikizukuri (live fish). Sashimi using live animals has been banned in some countries. Practices such as \"Ikizukuri\" are prohibited in Judaism under the law forbidding unnecessary pain to animals.\n\nAnother example occurs in Shanghai, China, and surrounding areas, where live shrimp is a common dish served both in homes and restaurants. The shrimp are usually served in a bowl of alcohol, which makes the shrimp sluggish and complacent.\n\nRelated may be the revulsion in western cultures around eating fertilized partly developed eggs (balut) consumed in parts of Southeast Asia.\n\nMonkey brains is a dish consisting of, at least partially, the brain of some species of monkey or ape. In Western popular culture, its consumption is repeatedly portrayed and debated, often in the context of portraying exotic cultures as exceptionally cruel, callous, and/or strange.\n\nMonkeys are revered animals in India, largely because of the monkey god Hanuman. Most vegetarian Hindus do not eat any kind of meat, including monkeys. Meat eating Indians also do not kill or eat monkeys. Killing and eating monkeys (or other animals which are considered wild) is a taboo and illegal in India.\n\nOffal is the internal organs of butchered animals, and may refer to parts of the carcass such as the head and feet (\"trotters\") in addition to organ meats such as sweetbreads and kidney. Offal is a traditional part of many European and Asian cuisines, including such dishes as the well-known steak and kidney pie in the United Kingdom or callos a la madrileña in Spain. Haggis has been Scotland's national dish since the time of Robert Burns. In northeast Brazil, there is a similar dish to haggis called \"buchada\", made with goats' stomach. In France and Spain, eating calf's brains is common. In Western Norway, lamb head, known as \"smalahove\", is a considered a delicacy and traditionally consumed before Christmas. A similar dish of lamb's head, \"svið\", is today commonly eaten in Iceland, although it was originally only consumed during the lean times of late winter/early spring in Iceland, known as Þorrablót. Magaj, an offal dish containing cow, goat or sheep brain is considered to be a delicacy in South Asia, while Paya, a traditional breakfast dish of Pakistan, Bangladesh and India made with cow, goat or lamb hooves is also popular.\n\nExcept for heart, tongue (beef), liver (chicken, beef, or pork), and intestines used as natural sausage casings, organ meats consumed in the U.S. tend to be regional or ethnic specialities; for example, tripe as \"menudo\" or \"mondongo\" among Latinos and Hispanos, chitterlings in the Southern United States, scrapple on the Eastern Seaboard, fried-brain sandwiches in the Midwest, and beef testicles called Rocky Mountain oysters or \"prairie oysters\" in the west.\n\nIn some regions, such as the European Union, brains and other organs which can transmit bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\"mad cow disease\") and similar diseases have now been banned from the food chain as specified risk materials.\n\nAlthough eating the stomach of a goat, cow, sheep, or buffalo might be taboo, ancient cheesemaking techniques utilize stomachs (which contain rennet) for turning milk into cheese, a potentially taboo process. Newer techniques for making cheese include a chemical process with artificial rennet. This means that the \"process\" by which cheese is made (and not the cheese itself) is a factor in determining whether it is forbidden or allowed by strict vegetarians.\n\nUnited States Department of Agriculture (USDA) data reports pork as the most widely eaten meat in the world. Consumption of pigs is forbidden in Islam, Judaism and certain Christian denominations, such as Seventh-day Adventists. This prohibition is set out in the holy texts of the religions concerned, e.g. Qur'an 16:115, Leviticus 11:7-8 and Deuteronomy 14:8. Pigs were also taboo in at least three other cultures of the ancient Middle East: the Phoenicians, Egyptians and Babylonians. In some instances, the taboo extended beyond eating pork, and it was also taboo to touch or even look at pigs.\n\nThe original reason for this taboo is debated. Maimonides seems to have thought the uncleanness of pigs was self-evident, but mentions with particular aversion their propensity to eat feces. In the 19th century some people attributed the pig taboo in the Middle East to the danger of the parasite trichina, but this explanation is now out of favour. James George Frazer suggested that in ancient Israel, Egypt and Syria, the pig was originally a sacred animal, which for that reason could not be eaten or touched; the taboo survived to a time when the pig was no longer regarded as sacred, and was therefore explained by reference to its being unclean.\n\nMore recently, Marvin Harris posited that pigs are not suited for being kept in the Middle East on an ecological and socio-economical level; for example, pigs are not suited to living in arid climates and thus require more water than other animals to keep them cool, and instead of grazing they compete with humans for foods such as grains. As such, raising pigs was seen as a wasteful and decadent practice. Another explanation offered for the taboo is that pigs are omnivorous, not discerning between meat or vegetation in their natural dietary habits. The willingness to consume meat sets them apart from most other domesticated animals which are commonly eaten (cattle, sheep, goats, etc.) who would naturally eat only plants. Mary Douglas has suggested that the reason for the taboo against the pig in Judaism is three-fold: (i) it trangresses the category of ungulates, because it has a split hoof but does not chew the cud, (ii) it eats carrion and (iii) it was eaten by non-Israelites.\n\nPoppy seeds are used as condiments in many cultures. In Singapore, poppy seeds are classified as \"prohibited goods\" by the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB).\n\nThe book of Leviticus in the Bible classifies the rabbit as unclean because it does not have a split hoof, even though it does chew and reingest partially digested material (equivalent to \"chewing the cud\" among ruminants). The consumption of rabbit is allowed in Sunni Islam, and is popular in several majority-Sunni countries (e.g. Egypt, where it is a traditional ingredient in \"molokheyya\"), but it is forbidden in the Ja'fari jurisprudence of Twelver Shia Islam.\n\nIn most Western cultures, rats and mice are considered either unclean vermin or pets and thus unfit for human consumption, traditionally being seen as carriers of plague. However, rats are commonly eaten in rural Thailand and Vietnam and other parts of Indochina. Cane rats (\"Thryonomys swinderianus\" and \"Thryonomys gregorianus\") and some species of field mice are a rich source of protein in Africa. Bamboo rats are also commonly eaten in the poorer parts of Southeast Asia.\n\nIn Ghana, \"Thryonomys swinderianus\" locally referred to as \"Akrantie\", \"Grasscutter\" and (incorrectly) as \"Bush rat\" is a common food item. The proper common name for this rodent is \"Greater Cane Rat\", though actually it is not a rat at all and is a close relative of porcupines and guinea pigs that inhabit Africa, south of the Saharan Desert. In 2003, the U.S. barred the import of this and other rodents from Africa because of an outbreak of at least nine human cases of monkeypox, an illness never before been seen in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nHistorically, rats and mice have also been eaten in the West during times of shortage or emergency, such as during the Siege of Vicksburg and the Siege of Paris. Dormice were also domesticated and raised for food in Ancient Rome and by Etruscans; to this day the edible dormouse (\"Glis glis\") is considered a rare delicacy in Slovenia and Croatia. In some Asian countries, mice are eaten, and go by the name of vole. In France, rats bred in the wine stores of Gironde were cooked with the fire of broken wine barrels and eaten, dubbed as \"cooper's entrecôte\". In some communities the muskrat (which is not a rat at all) is hunted for its meat (and fur) (e.g. some parts of Flanders); see also under \"Fish\" for consumption of beaver tails. Nutria, another large rodent, has been hunted or raised for food in the United States.\n\nRats were also traditionally consumed by certain communities in the Indian state of Bihar.\n\nConsumption of any sort of rodent, or material originating from rodents, is forbidden in Judaism.\n\nIslam strictly forbids the consumption of reptiles, such as crocodiles and snakes.\n\nEating reptiles is also forbidden in Judaism.\n\nIn other cultures, foods such as alligator are treasured as delicacies, and the animals are raised commercially.\n\nAs they are molluscs, snails are not kosher. Snails are not allowed to be eaten in Islam because it is not Halal.\n\nSquirrel is neither Halal nor Kosher.\n\nJudaism forbids eating turtles, as reptiles are not kosher.\n\nIn certain versions of Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism, vegetables of the onion genus are taboo. Many Hindus discourage eating onion and garlic along with non-vegetarian food during festivals or Hindu holy months of Shrawan, puratassi and Kartik. However, shunning onion and garlic is not very popular among Hindus as compared to avoiding non-vegetarian foods, so many people do not follow this custom.\n\nJains not only abstain from consumption of meat, but also do not eat root vegetables (such as carrots, potatoes, radish, turnips, etc) as doing so kills the plant and they believe in ahimsa.\n\nChinese Buddhist cuisine traditionally prohibits garlic, \"Allium chinense\", asafoetida, shallot, and \"Allium victorialis\" (victory onion or mountain leek), while Kashmiri Brahmins forbid \"strong flavored\" foods. This encompasses garlic, onion, and spices such as black pepper and chili pepper, believing that pungent flavors on the tongue inflame the baser emotions.\n\nIn Yazidism, the eating of lettuce and butter beans is taboo. The Muslim religious teacher and scholar, Falah Hassan Juma, links the sect's belief of evil found in lettuce to its long history of persecution by Muslims and Christians. Historical theory claims one ruthless potentate who controlled the city of Mosul in the 13th century ordered an early Yazidi saint executed. The enthusiastic crowd then pelted the corpse with heads of lettuce.\n\nThe followers of Pythagoras were vegetarians, and \"Pythagorean\" at one time came to mean \"vegetarian\". However, their creed prohibited the eating of beans. The reason is unclear: perhaps the flatulence they cause, perhaps as protection from potential favism, but most likely for magico-religious reasons.\n\nVegetables like broccoli, while not taboo, may be avoided by observant Jews and other religions due to the possibility of insects hiding within the numerous crevices. Likewise, fruits such as blackberries and raspberries are recommended by kashrut agencies to be avoided as they cannot be cleaned thoroughly enough without destroying the fruit.\n\nThe common Egyptian dish mulukhiyah, a soup whose primary ingredient is jute leaves (which leaves did not have any other culinary purpose), was banned by the Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah sometime during his reign (996-1021 CE). The ban applied specifically to mulukhiyah, and also to other foodstuffs said to be eaten by Sunnis. While the ban was eventually lifted after the end of his reign, the Druze, who hold Al-Hakim in high regard and give him quasi-divine authority, continue to respect the ban, and do not eat \"mulukhiyah\" of any kind to this day.\n\nSunni Islam permits Muslims to consume the flesh of whales that have died of natural causes as there is a famous Sunni hadith which cites Muhammad's approval of such. Whale meat is forbidden (haram) in Shia Islam as whales do not have scales. In Western cultures, consumption of whale meat is generally taboo and illegal, with the exception of some indigenous peoples, Norway, and Iceland. Whale meat is also controversially consumed in Japan.\n\nSome religions – including Buddhism, Islam, Jainism, Rastafari movement, Bahá'í Faith, and various branches of Christianity such as the Baptists, the Church of God In Christ, Methodists, the Latter-day Saints, Seventh-day Adventists and the Iglesia ni Cristo – forbid or discourage the consumption of alcoholic beverages.\n\nThe Hebrew Bible describes a Nazirite vow (Numbers 6:1-21) that includes abstinence from alcohol, specifically wine and probably barley beer (according to the Septuagint translation and the Bauer lexicon: \"σικερα\", from the Akkadian shikaru, for \"barley beer)\". The New JPS translation is: \"wine and any other intoxicant\". Other versions such as the NIV prohibit both alcohol and all alcohol derived products such as wine vinegar. There is no general taboo against alcohol in Judaism. \n\nThere are also cultural taboos against the consumption of alcohol, reflected for example in the Teetotalism or Temperance movement. There is also something of a cultural taboo in several countries, against the consumption of alcohol by women during pregnancy for health reasons, as seen, for example, which in the Maternity Protection Convention, 2000 by ILO.\n\nSome religions prohibit drinking or eating blood or food made from blood. In Islam the consumption of blood is prohibited (\"Haraam\"). \"Halal\" animals should be properly slaughtered to drain out the blood. Unlike in other traditions, this is not because blood is revered or holy, but simply because blood is considered ritually unclean or \"Najis\", with certain narratives prescribing ablutions (in the case of no availability of water) if contact is made with it. In Judaism all mammal and bird meat (not fish) is salted to remove the blood. Jews follow the teaching in Leviticus, that since \"the life of the animal is in the blood\", no person may eat (or drink) the blood. Iglesia ni Cristo and Jehovah's Witnesses prohibit eating or drinking any blood.\n\nAccording to the Bible, blood is only to be used for special or sacred purposes in connection with worship (Exodus chapters 12, 24, 29, Matthew 26:29 and Hebrews). In the first century, Christians, both former Jews (the Jewish Christians), and new Gentile converts, were in dispute as to which particular features of Mosaic law were to be retained and upheld by them. The Apostolic Decree suggested that, among other things, it was necessary to abstain from consuming blood:\n\n\"Hot drinks\" are taboo for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The term is misleading as the ban is applied exclusively to coffee and tea (i.e. not hot cocoa or herbal teas). The Word of Wisdom, a code of health used by church members, outlines prohibited and allowed substances. While not banned, some Mormons avoid caffeine in general, including cola drinks. Members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church also generally avoid caffeinated drinks.\n\nThere is a widely reported story, possibly apocryphal, that some Catholics urged Pope Clement VII (1478 – 1534) to ban coffee, calling it \"devil's beverage\". After tasting the beverage, the Pope is said to have remarked that the drink was \"... so delicious that it would be a sin to let only misbelievers drink it.\" (See the History of coffee.)\n\nWhile human breast milk is universally accepted for infant nutrition, some cultures see the consumption of breast milk after weaning as taboo.\n\n\n\n"

                "Veganism\n\nVeganism is both the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products, particularly in diet, and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals. A follower of either the diet or the philosophy is known as a vegan ( ). Distinctions are sometimes made between several categories of veganism. \"Dietary vegans\" (or strict vegetarians) refrain from consuming animal products, not only meat but also eggs, dairy products and other animal-derived substances. The term \"ethical vegan\" is often applied to those who not only follow a vegan diet but extend the philosophy into other areas of their lives, and oppose the use of animals for any purpose. Another term is \"environmental veganism\", which refers to the avoidance of animal products on the premise that the harvesting or industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and unsustainable.\n\nWell-planned vegan diets can reduce the risk of some types of chronic disease, including heart disease. They are regarded as appropriate for all stages of life including during infancy and pregnancy by the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Dietitians of Canada, and the British Dietetic Association. The German Society for Nutrition does not recommend vegan diets for children, adolescents nor during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron and phytochemicals; and lower in dietary energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc and vitamin B. Unbalanced vegan diets may lead to nutritional deficiencies that nullify any beneficial effects and may cause serious health issues. Some of these deficiencies can only be prevented through the choice of fortified foods or the regular intake of dietary supplements. Vitamin B supplementation is especially important because its deficiency causes blood disorders and potentially irreversible neurological damage.\n\nDonald Watson coined the term \"vegan\" in 1944 when he co-founded the Vegan Society in England. At first he used it to mean \"non-dairy vegetarian\", but from 1951 the Society defined it as \"the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals\". Interest in veganism increased in the 2010s. More vegan stores opened and vegan options became increasingly available in supermarkets and restaurants in many countries.\n\nThe origin of the English term \"vegetarian\" is unknown. The earliest-known use is attributed to the actress Fanny Kemble, writing around 1839 in Georgia in the United States. The practice can be traced to Indus valley civilization in 3300–1300 BCE Ancient India. Early vegetarians included Indian philosophers such as Mahavira and Acharya Kundakunda, the Indian poet Valluvar, the Indian emperors Chandragupta Maurya and Ashoka; Greek philosophers such as Empedocles, Theophrastus, Plutarch, Plotinus, and Porphyry; and the Roman poet Ovid, the playwright Seneca the Younger. The Greek sage Pythagoras may have advocated an early form of strict vegetarianism, but his life is so obscure that it is disputed whether he ever advocated any form of vegetarianism at all. He almost certainly prohibited his followers from eating beans and from wearing woolen garments and Eudoxus of Cnidus, a student of Archytas, writes that \"Pythagoras was distinguished by such purity and so avoided killing and killers that he not only abstained from animal foods, but even kept his distance from cooks and hunters.\" The earliest known vegan was the Arab poet Al-Maʿarri (). Their arguments were based on health, the transmigration of souls, animal welfare, and the view—espoused by Porphyry in \"De Abstinentia ab Esu Animalium\" (\"On Abstinence from Animal Food\", )—that if humans deserve justice, so do animals.\n\nVegetarianism established itself as a significant movement in 19th-century England and the United States. A minority of vegetarians avoided animal food entirely. In 1813 the poet Percy Bysshe Shelley published \"A Vindication of Natural Diet\", advocating \"abstinence from animal food and spirituous liquors\", and in 1815 William Lambe, a London physician, claimed that his \"water and vegetable diet\" could cure anything from tuberculosis to acne. Lambe called animal food an \"habitual irritation\", and argued that \"milk eating and flesh eating are but branches of a common system, and they must stand or fall together\". Sylvester Graham's meatless Graham diet—mostly fruit, vegetables, water and bread made at home with stoneground flour—became popular as a health remedy in the 1830s in the United States. Several vegan communities were established around this time. In Massachusetts Amos Bronson Alcott, father of the novelist Louisa May Alcott, opened the Temple School in 1834 and Fruitlands in 1844, and in England James Pierrepont Greaves founded the Concordium, a vegan community at Alcott House on Ham Common, in 1838.\n\nIn 1843 members of Alcott House created the British and Foreign Society for the Promotion of Humanity and Abstinence from Animal Food, led by Sophia Chichester, a wealthy benefactor of Alcott House. Alcott House also helped to establish the UK Vegetarian Society, which held its first meeting in 1847 in Ramsgate, Kent. \"The Medical Times and Gazette\" in London reported in 1884:\n\nThere are two kinds of Vegetarians—one an extreme form, the members of which eat no animal food whatever; and a less extreme sect, who do not object to eggs, milk, or fish. The Vegetarian Society ... belongs to the latter more moderate division.\n\nAn article in the Society's magazine, the \"Vegetarian Messenger\", in 1851 discussed alternatives to shoe leather, which suggests the presence of vegans within the membership who rejected animal use entirely, not only in diet. The first known vegan cookbook, Rupert H. Wheldon's \"No Animal Food: Two Essays and 100 Recipes\", was published in London in 1910. The consumption of milk and eggs became a battleground over the following decades. There were regular discussions about it in the \"Vegetarian Messenger\"; it appears from the correspondence pages that many opponents of veganism came from vegetarians.\n\nDuring a visit to London in 1931, Mahatma Gandhi—who had joined the Vegetarian Society's executive committee when he lived in London from 1888 to 1891—gave a speech to the Society arguing that it ought to promote a meat-free diet as a matter of morality, not health. Lacto-vegetarians acknowledged the ethical consistency of the vegan position but regarded a vegan diet as impracticable and were concerned that it might be an impediment to spreading vegetarianism if vegans found themselves unable to participate in social circles where no non-animal food was available. This became the predominant view of the Vegetarian Society, which in 1935 stated: \"The lacto-vegetarians, on the whole, do not defend the practice of consuming the dairy products except on the ground of expediency.\"\n\nIn August 1944 several members of the Vegetarian Society asked that a section of its newsletter be devoted to non-dairy vegetarianism. When the request was turned down, Donald Watson, secretary of the Leicester branch, set up a new quarterly newsletter in November 1944, priced tuppence. He called it \"The Vegan News\". He chose the word \"vegan\" himself, based on \"the first three and last two letters of 'vegetarian [..] because it marked, in Mr Watson's words, \"the beginning and end of vegetarian\", but asked his readers if they could think of anything better than \"vegan\" to stand for \"non-dairy vegetarian\". They suggested \"allvega\", \"neo-vegetarian\", \"dairyban\", \"vitan\", \"benevore\", \"sanivores\" and \"beaumangeur\".\n\nThe first edition attracted more than 100 letters, including from George Bernard Shaw, who resolved to give up eggs and dairy. The new Vegan Society held its first meeting in early November at the Attic Club, 144 High Holborn, London. Those in attendance were Donald Watson, Elsie B. Shrigley, Fay K. Henderson, Alfred Hy Haffenden, Paul Spencer and Bernard Drake, with Mme Pataleewa (Barbara Moore, a Russian-British engineer) observing. World Vegan Day is held every 1 November to mark the founding of the Society.\n\"The Vegan News\" changed its name to \"The Vegan\" in November 1945, by which time it had 500 subscribers. It published recipes and a \"vegan trade list\" of animal-free products, such as Colgate toothpaste, Kiwi shoe polish, Dawson & Owen stationery and Gloy glue. Vegan books appeared, including \"Vegan Recipes\" by Fay K. Henderson and \"Aids to a Vegan Diet for Children\" by Kathleen V. Mayo.\n\nThe Vegan Society soon made clear that it rejected the use of animals for any purpose, not only in diet. In 1947 Watson wrote: \"The vegan renounces it as superstitious that human life depends upon the exploitation of these creatures whose feelings are much the same as our own ...\". From 1948 \"The Vegan\"'s front page read: \"Advocating living without exploitation\", and in 1951 the Society published its definition of \"veganism\" as \"the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals.\" In 1956 its vice-president, Leslie Cross, founded the Plantmilk Society, and in 1965, as Plantmilk Ltd and later Plamil Foods, it began production of one of the first widely distributed soy milks in the Western world.\n\nThe first vegan society in the United States was founded in 1948 by Catherine Nimmo and Rubin Abramowitz in California, who distributed Watson's newsletter. In 1960 H. Jay Dinshah founded the American Vegan Society (AVS), linking veganism to the concept of \"ahimsa\", \"non-harming\" in Sanskrit. According to Joanne Stepaniak, the word \"vegan\" was first published independently in 1962 by the \"Oxford Illustrated Dictionary\", defined as \"a vegetarian who eats no butter, eggs, cheese or milk\".\n\nIn the 1960s and 1970s a vegetarian food movement emerged as part of the counterculture in the United States that focused on concerns about diet, the environment and a distrust of food producers, leading to increasing interest in organic gardening. One of the most influential vegetarian books of that time was Frances Moore Lappé's 1971 text, \"Diet for a Small Planet\". It sold more than three million copies and suggested \"getting off the top of the food chain\".\n\nThe following decades saw research by a group of scientists and doctors in the United States, including physicians Dean Ornish, Caldwell Esselstyn, Neal D. Barnard, John A. McDougall, Michael Greger and biochemist T. Colin Campbell, who argued that diets based on animal fat and animal protein, such as the Western pattern diet, were detrimental to health. They produced a series of books that recommend vegan or vegetarian diets, including McDougall's \"The McDougall Plan\" (1983), John Robbins's \"Diet for a New America\" (1987), which associated meat eating with environmental damage, and \"Dr. Dean Ornish's Program for Reversing Heart Disease\" (1990). In 2003 two major North American dietitians' associations indicated that well-planned vegan diets were suitable for all life stages. This was followed by the film \"Earthlings\" (2005), Campbell's \"The China Study\" (2005), Rory Freedman and Kim Barnouin's \"Skinny Bitch\" (2005), Jonathan Safran Foer's \"Eating Animals\" (2009), and the film \"Forks over Knives\" (2011).\n\nIn the 1980s veganism became associated with punk subculture and ideologies, particularly straight edge hardcore punk in the United States and anarcho-punk in the United Kingdom. This association continues on into the 21st century, as evidenced by the prominence of vegan punk events such as Fluff Fest in Europe.\n\nThe vegan diet became increasingly mainstream in the 2010s. The European Parliament defined the meaning of \"vegan\" for food labels in 2010, in force as of 2015. Chain restaurants began marking vegan items on their menus and supermarkets improved their selection of vegan processed food. The English Wikipedia article on veganism was viewed 73,000 times in August 2009 but 145,000 times in August 2013. Articles on veganism were viewed more during this period than articles on vegetarianism in the English, French, German, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish Wikipedias.\n\nThe global mock-meats market increased by eighteen percent between 2005 and 2010, and in the United States by eight percent between 2012 and 2015, to $553 million a year. \"De Vegetarische Slager\", the first known vegetarian butcher shop, selling mock meats, opened in the Netherlands in 2010, while America's first vegan butcher, the Herbivorous Butcher, opened in Minneapolis in 2016. By 2016, forty-nine percent of Americans were drinking plant milk, although 91 percent still drank dairy milk. In the United Kingdom the plant milk market increased by 155 percent in two years, from 36 million litres in 2011 to 92 million in 2013. In 2011 Europe's first vegan supermarkets appeared in Germany: Vegilicious in Dortmund and Veganz in Berlin.\nCountering the image of self-deprivation projected by vegan straight edges and animal rights activists, veganism was promoted as glamorous; in 2015 the editor of Yahoo! Food declared that it had become \"a thing\". Celebrities, athletes and politicians adopted vegan diets, some seriously, some part-time. The idea of the \"flexi-vegan\" gained currency: \"New York Times\" food columnist Mark Bittman, in \"VB6\" (2013), recommended eating vegan food until 6 pm. In 2013, the Oktoberfest in Munich, traditionally a meat-heavy affair, offered vegan dishes for the first time in its 200-year history.\n\nCritics of veganism questioned the evolutionary legitimacy and health effects of a vegan diet, and pointed to longstanding philosophical traditions which held that humans are superior to other animals. Celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain wrote in 2000 that \"Vegetarians, and their Hezbollah-like splinter-faction, the vegans, are a persistent irritant to any chef worth a damn.\" Several vegetarian writers argued that the restrictions of a vegan lifestyle are impractical, and that vegetarianism is a better goal.\n\n\nVegans do not eat beef, pork, poultry, fowl, game, seafood, eggs, dairy, or any other animal products. Dietary vegans might use animal products in clothing (as leather, wool, and silk), toiletries and similar. Ethical veganism extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or use of animal products. Vegans reject the commodification of animals. The British Vegan Society will certify a product only if it is free of animal involvement as far as possible and practical, including animal testing, but \"recognises that it is not always possible to make a choice that avoids the use of animals\".\n\nAn important concern is the case of medications, which are routinely tested on animals to ensure they are effective and safe, and may also contain animal ingredients, such as lactose, gelatine, or stearates. There may be no alternatives to prescribed medication or these alternatives may be unsuitable, less effective, or have more adverse side effects. Experimentation with laboratory animals is also used for evaluating the safety of vaccines, food additives, cosmetics, household products, workplace chemicals, and many other substances.\n\nPhilosopher Gary Steiner argues that it is not possible to be entirely vegan, because animal use and products are \"deeply and imperceptibly woven into the fabric of human society\". Animal products in common use include albumen, allantoin, beeswax, blood, bone char, bone china, carmine, casein, castoreum, cochineal, elastin, emu oil, gelatin, honey, isinglass, keratin, lactic acid, lanolin, lard, rennet, retinol, shellac, squalene, tallow/sodium tallowate, whey and yellow grease. Some of these are chemical compounds that can be derived from animal products, plants, or petrochemicals. Allantoin, lactic acid, retinol and squalene, for example, can be vegan. These products and their origins are not always included in the list of ingredients.\n\nSome vegans will not buy woollen jumpers, silk scarves, leather shoes, bedding that contains goose down or duck feathers, pearl jewellery, seashells, ordinary soap (usually made of animal fat), or cosmetics that contain animal products. They avoid certain vaccines; the flu vaccine, for example, is usually grown in hens' eggs, although an effective alternative, Flublok, is widely available in the United States. Non-vegan items acquired before they became vegan might be donated to charity or used until worn out. Some vegan clothes, in particular leather alternatives, are made of petroleum-based products, which has triggered criticism because of the environmental damage involved in their production.\n\nThe main difference between a vegan and vegetarian diet is that vegans exclude dairy products. Ethical vegans avoid them on the premise that their production causes animal suffering and premature death. In egg production, most male chicks are culled because they do not lay eggs. To obtain milk from dairy cattle, cows are made pregnant to induce lactation; they are kept lactating for three to seven years, then slaughtered. Female calves are separated from their mothers within 24 hours of birth, and fed milk replacer to retain the cow's milk for human consumption. Male calves are slaughtered at birth, sent for veal production, or reared for beef.\n\nVegan groups disagree about insect products. Neither the Vegan Society nor the American Vegan Society considers honey, silk, and other insect products as suitable for vegans, while Vegan Outreach view it as a matter of personal choice. The Vegan Society recommend date syrup, maple syrup, molasses, butterscotch syrup, golden syrup and agave nectar as alternatives to honey. Insect products can be defined much more widely, as commercial bees are used to pollinate about 100 different food crops, including almonds, avocado, broccoli, cucumbers, peaches, pears, sunflowers and tomatoes.\n\nVegan diets are based on grains and other seeds, legumes (particularly beans), fruits, vegetables, edible mushrooms, and nuts. Meatless products based on soybeans (tofu), or wheat-based seitan are sources of plant protein, commonly in the form of vegetarian sausage, mince, and veggie burgers.\n\nDishes based on soybeans are a staple of vegan diets because soybeans are a complete protein; this means they contain all the essential amino acids for humans and can be relied upon entirely for protein intake. They are consumed most often in the form of soy milk and tofu (bean curd), which is soy milk mixed with a coagulant. Tofu comes in a variety of textures, depending on water content, from firm, medium firm and extra firm for stews and stir-fries to soft or silken for salad dressings, desserts and shakes. Soy is also eaten in the form of tempeh and texturized vegetable protein (TVP); also known as textured soy protein (TSP), the latter is often used in pasta sauces.\n\nPlant milks—such as soy milk, almond milk, grain milks (oat milk and rice milk), hemp milk and coconut milk—are used in place of cows' or goats' milk. Soy milk provides around 7 g of protein per cup (240 mL or 8 fl oz), compared with 8 g of protein per cup of cow's milk. Almond milk is lower in dietary energy, carbohydrates and protein. Soy milk should not be used as a replacement for breast milk for babies. Babies who are not breastfed may be fed commercial infant formula, normally based on cows' milk or soy. The latter is known as soy-based infant formula or SBIF.\n\nButter can be replaced with a vegan alternative such as Earth Balance's. Vegan (egg-free) mayonnaise brands include Vegenaise, Nayonaise, Mindful Mayo, and Plamil's Egg-Free Mayonnaise. Vegan cheeses, such as Chreese and Daiya, are made from soy, nuts and tapioca, and can replace the meltability of dairy cheese. Nutritional yeast is a common substitute for the taste of cheese in vegan recipes. Cheese substitutes can be made at home.\n\nCommercial egg substitutes, such as Bob's Red Mill egg replacer and Ener-G egg replacer, are available for cooking and baking. The protein in eggs thickens when heated and binds other ingredients together. Flaxseeds will do the same: replace each egg with one tablespoon of flaxseed meal mixed with three tablespoons of water. For pancakes a tablespoon of baking powder can be used instead of eggs. Other ingredients include (to replace one egg): one tablespoon of soy flour and one tablespoon of water; a quarter cup of mashed bananas, mashed prunes or apple sauce; or in batter two tablespoons of white flour, half a tablespoon of vegetable oil, two tablespoons of water, and half a tablespoon of baking powder. Silken (soft) tofu and mashed potato can also be used. Recently, aquafaba has come into use as a popular egg replacement, it can even be whipped up like egg whites.\n\nRaw veganism, combining veganism and raw foodism, excludes all animal products and food cooked above 48 °C (118 °F). A raw vegan diet includes vegetables, fruits, nuts, grain and legume sprouts, seeds and sea vegetables. There are many variations of the diet, including fruitarianism.\n\nProteins are composed of amino acids. Vegans obtain all their protein from plants, omnivores usually a third, and ovo-lacto vegetarians half. Sources of plant protein include legumes such as soy beans (consumed as tofu, tempeh, texturized vegetable protein, soy milk and edamame), peas, peanuts, black beans and chickpeas (the latter often eaten as hummus); grains such as quinoa (pronounced \"keenwa\"), brown rice, corn, barley, bulgur and wheat (the latter eaten as bread and seitan); and nuts and seeds. Combinations that contain high amounts of all the essential amino acids include rice and beans, corn and beans, and hummus and whole-wheat pita.\n\nSoy beans and quinoa are known as complete proteins because they each contain all the essential amino acids in amounts that meet or exceed human requirements. Mangels et al. write that consuming the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of protein (0.8 g/kg body weight) in the form of soy will meet the biologic requirement for amino acids. In 2012 the United States Department of Agriculture ruled that soy protein (tofu) may replace meat protein in the National School Lunch Program.\n\nThe American Dietetic Association said in 2009 that a variety of plant foods consumed over the course of a day can provide all the essential amino acids for healthy adults, which means that protein combining in the same meal may not be necessary. Mangels et al. write that there is little reason to advise vegans to increase their protein intake, but erring on the side of caution, they recommend a 25 percent increase over the RDA for adults, to 1.0 gram of protein per kilogram of body weight.\n\nVitamin B is a bacterial product needed for cell division, the formation and maturation of red blood cells, the synthesis of DNA, and normal nerve function. A deficiency may cause megaloblastic anaemia and neurological damage, and, if untreated, may lead to death. The high content of folacin in vegetarian diets may mask the hematological symptoms of vitamin B deficiency, so it may go undetected until neurological signs in the late stages are evident, which can be irreversible, such as neuropsychiatric abnormalities, neuropathy, dementia and, occasionally, atrophy of optic nerves. Vegans sometimes fail to obtain enough B from their diet because among non-fortified foods, only those of animal origin contain sufficient amounts. The best source is ruminant food. Vegetarians are also at risk, as are older people and those with certain medical conditions. A 2013 study found that \"vegetarians develop B depletion or deficiency regardless of demographic characteristics, place of residency, age, or type of vegetarian diet. Vegans should take preventive measures to ensure adequate intake of this vitamin, including regular consumption of supplements containing B.\"\n\nB is produced in nature only by certain bacteria and archaea; it is not made by any animal, fungus, or plant. It is synthesized by some gut bacteria in humans and other animals, but humans cannot absorb the B made in their guts, as it is made in the colon which is too far from the small intestine, where absorption of B occurs. Ruminants, such as cows and sheep, absorb B produced by bacteria in their guts.\n\nAnimals store vitamin B in liver and muscle and some pass the vitamin into their eggs and milk; meat, liver, eggs and milk are therefore sources of B.\n\nIt has been suggested that nori (an edible seaweed), tempeh (a fermented soybean food), and nutritional yeast may be sources of vitamin B. In 2016, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics established that nori, fermented foods (such as tempeh), spirulina, chlorella algae, and unfortified nutritional yeast are not adequate sources of vitamin B and that vegans need to consume regularly fortified foods or supplements containing B. Otherwise, vitamin B12 deficiency may develop, as has been demonstrated in case studies of vegan infants, children, and adults.\n\nVitamin B is mostly manufactured by industrial fermentation of various kinds of bacteria, which make forms of cyanocobalamin, which are further processed to generate the ingredient included in supplements and fortified foods. The \"Pseudomonas denitrificans\" strain was most commonly used as of 2017. It is grown in a medium containing sucrose, yeast extract, and several metallic salts. To increase vitamin production, it is supplemented with sugar beet molasses, or, less frequently, with choline. Certain brands of B supplements are vegan.\n\nCalcium is needed to maintain bone health and for several metabolic functions, including muscle function, vascular contraction and vasodilation, nerve transmission, intracellular signalling and hormonal secretion. Ninety-nine percent of the body's calcium is stored in the bones and teeth.\n\nHigh-calcium foods may include fortified plant milk or fortified tofu. Plant sources include broccoli, turnip, bok choy and kale; the bioavailability of calcium in spinach is poor. Vegans should make sure they consume enough vitamin D, which is needed for calcium absorption.\n\nA 2007 report based on the Oxford cohort of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which began in 1993, suggested that vegans have an increased risk of bone fractures over meat eaters and vegetarians, likely because of lower dietary calcium intake. The study found that vegans consuming at least 525 mg of calcium daily have a risk of fractures similar to that of other groups. A 2009 study found the bone mineral density (BMD) of vegans was 94 percent that of omnivores, but deemed the difference clinically insignificant.\n\nVitamin D (calciferol) is needed for several functions, including calcium absorption, enabling mineralization of bone, and bone growth. Without it bones can become thin and brittle; together with calcium it offers protection against osteoporosis. Vitamin D is produced in the body when ultraviolet rays from the sun hit the skin; outdoor exposure is needed because UVB radiation does not penetrate glass. It is present in salmon, tuna, mackerel and cod liver oil, with small amounts in cheese, egg yolks and beef liver, and in some mushrooms.\n\nMost vegan diets contain little or no vitamin D without fortified food. People with little sun exposure may need supplements. The extent to which sun exposure is sufficient depends on the season, time of day, cloud and smog cover, skin melanin content, and whether sunscreen is worn. According to the National Institutes of Health, most people can obtain and store sufficient vitamin D from sunlight in the spring, summer and fall, even in the far north. They report that some researchers recommend 5–30 minutes of sun exposure without sunscreen between 10 am and 3 pm, at least twice a week. Tanning beds emitting 2–6% UVB radiation have a similar effect, though tanning is inadvisable.\n\nVitamin D comes in two forms. Cholecalciferol (vitamin D) is synthesized in the skin after exposure to the sun, or consumed in the form of animal products; when produced industrially it is taken from lanolin in sheep's wool. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D) is derived from ergosterol from UV-exposed mushrooms or yeast and is suitable for vegans. Conflicting studies have suggested that the two forms may or may not be bioequivalent. According to researchers from the Institute of Medicine, the differences between vitamins D and D do not affect metabolism, both function as prohormones, and when activated exhibit identical responses in the body.\n\nIn some cases iron and the zinc status of vegans may also be of concern because of the limited bioavailability of these minerals. There are concerns about the bioavailability of iron from plant foods, assumed by some researchers to be 5–15 percent compared to 18 percent from a nonvegetarian diet. Iron deficiency anemia is found as often in nonvegetarians as in vegetarians, though studies have shown vegetarians' iron stores to be lower.\n\nMangels et al. write that, because of the lower bioavailability of iron from plant sources, the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Academy of Sciences established a separate RDA for vegetarians and vegans of 14 mg for vegetarian men and postmenopausal women, and 33 mg for premenopausal women not using oral contraceptives. Supplements should be used with caution after consulting a physician, because iron can accumulate in the body and cause damage to organs. This is particularly true of anyone with hemochromatosis, a relatively common condition that can remain undiagnosed.\n\nHigh-iron vegan foods include soybeans, black-strap molasses, black beans, lentils, chickpeas, spinach, tempeh, tofu and lima beans. Iron absorption can be enhanced by eating a source of vitamin C at the same time, such as half a cup of cauliflower or five fluid ounces of orange juice. Coffee and some herbal teas can inhibit iron absorption, as can spices that contain tannins such as turmeric, coriander, chiles, and tamarind.\n\nAlpha-linolenic acid (ALA), an omega-3 fatty acid, is found in leafy green vegetables and nuts, and in vegetable oils such as canola and flaxseed oil. EPA and DHA, the other primary omega-3 fatty acids, are found only in animal products and algae. Iodine supplementation may be necessary for vegans in countries where salt is not typically iodized, where it is iodized at low levels, or where, as in Britain and Ireland, dairy products are relied upon for iodine delivery because of low levels in the soil. Iodine can be obtained from most vegan multivitamins or regular consumption of seaweeds, such as kelp.\n\nAs of 2014 very few studies were rigorous in their comparison of omnivore, vegetarian and vegan diets, making it difficult to discern whether health benefits attributed to the vegan diet might also apply to vegetarian diets or diets that include a moderate meat intake.\n\nVeganism appears to provide a reduced risk of type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity and ischemic heart disease. A 2016 systematic review found that a vegan diet was associated with a reduction in cancer risk, although only in a small number of studies. The review concluded that there was no effect of vegan diets overall on all-cause mortality, cancer mortality, cerebrovascular disease or cardiovascular-disease-related mortality. The effects also disappeared when specific cancers were analysed. Some studies of vegan diets in diabetes have been criticized for poorly controlling for factors such as medication status; the effect of vegan diets on diabetes and glycemic control is inconclusive.\n\nAccording to nutritionist Winston Craig, writing in \"The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\" in 2009, vegan diets tend to be higher in dietary fiber, magnesium, folic acid, vitamin C, vitamin E, iron and phytochemicals, and lower in dietary energy, saturated fat, cholesterol, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin D, calcium, zinc and vitamin B. Vegans tend to be thinner, with lower serum cholesterol and lower blood pressure.\n\nEliminating all animal products increases the risk of deficiencies of vitamins B and D, calcium, and omega-3 fatty acids. Vitamin B-12 deficiency occurs in up to 80% of vegans that do not supplement with vitamin B. Craig advises vegans to eat fortified foods or take supplements, and warns that iron and zinc may be problematic because of limited bioavailability. Vegans might be at risk of low bone mineral density without supplements.\n\nThe American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada state that properly planned vegan diets are appropriate for all life stages, including pregnancy and lactation. They indicate that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders, but that its adoption may serve to camouflage a disorder rather than cause one. The Australian National Health and Medical Research Council similarly recognizes a well-planned vegan diet as viable for any age. The British National Health Service's Eatwell Plate allows for an entirely plant-based diet, as does the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) MyPlate. The USDA allows tofu to replace meat in the National School Lunch Program. The German Society for Nutrition does not recommend a vegan diet for babies, children and adolescents, and for those pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada consider well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets \"appropriate for individuals during all stages of the lifecycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes\". The German Society for Nutrition cautioned against a vegan diet for pregnant women, babies, and children as of 2011. The position of the Canadian Pediatric Society is that \"well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets with appropriate attention to specific nutrient components can provide a healthy alternative lifestyle at all stages of fetal, infant, child and adolescent growth. Attention should be given to nutrient intake, particularly protein, vitamins B12 and D, essential fatty acids, iron, zinc and calcium.\n\nAccording to a 2015 systematic review, there is little evidence available about vegetarian and vegan diets during pregnancy, and a lack of randomized studies meant that the effects of diet could not be distinguished from confounding factors. It concluded: \"Within these limits, vegan-vegetarian diets may be considered safe in pregnancy, provided that attention is paid to vitamin and trace element requirements.\" A daily source of vitamin B is important for pregnant and lactating vegans, as is vitamin D if there are concerns about low sun exposure. Researchers have reported cases of vitamin B12 deficiency in lactating vegetarian mothers that were linked to deficiencies and neurological disorders in their children. A doctor or registered dietitian should be consulted about taking supplements during pregnancy.\n\nVegan diets have attracted negative attention from the media because of cases of nutritional deficiencies that have come to the attention of the courts, including the death of a baby in New Zealand in 2002 due to hypocobalaminemia, i.e. Vitamin B deficiency.\n\nVegans do not use personal care products or household cleaners that contain animal products. Animal ingredients are ubiquitous because they are cheap. After animals are slaughtered for meat, the leftovers are put through the rendering process, and some of that material, particularly the fat, ends up in toiletries. Common ingredients include tallow in soap and collagen-derived glycerine, used as a lubricant and humectant in many haircare products, moisturizers, shaving foams, soaps and toothpastes.\n\nLanolin from sheep's wool is often found in lip balm and moisturizers. Stearic acid is a common ingredient in face creams, shaving foam and shampoos; as with glycerine, it can be plant-based but is usually animal-derived. Lactic acid, an alpha-hydroxy acid derived from animal milk, is used in moisturizers, as is allantoin, from the comfrey plant or cows' urine, in shampoos, moisturizers and toothpaste. Carmine from scale insects, such as the female cochineal, is used in food and cosmetics to produce red and pink shades.\n\n\"Animal Ingredients A to Z\" (2004) and \"Veganissimo A to Z\" (2013) list which ingredients might be animal-derived. The British Vegan Society's sunflower logo and PETA's bunny logo mean the product is certified vegan, which includes no animal testing. The leaping-bunny logo signals no animal testing, but it might not be vegan. The Vegan Society criteria for vegan certification are that the product contain no animal products, and that neither the finished item nor its ingredients have been tested on animals by, or on behalf of, the manufacturer or by anyone over whom the manufacturer has control. Its website contains a list of certified products, as does Australia's \"Choose Cruelty Free\" website.\n\nBeauty Without Cruelty, founded as a charity in 1959, was one of the earliest manufacturers and certifiers of animal-free personal care products. Several international companies produce animal-free products, including clothes, shoes, fashion items and candles.\n\nVegans avoid clothing that incorporates silk, wool (including lambswool, shearling, cashmere, angora, mohair and a number of other fine wools), fur, feathers, pearls, animal-derived dyes, leather, snakeskin and any other kind of skin or animal product. Most leather clothing is made from cow skins. Vegans regard the purchase of leather, particularly from cows, as financial support for the meat industry. Vegans may wear clothing items and accessories made of non-animal-derived materials such as hemp, linen, cotton, canvas, polyester, synthetic leather (pleather), rubber and vinyl. Leather alternatives can come from materials such as cork, piña (from pineapples) and mushroom leather.\n\nEthical veganism is based on opposition to speciesism, the assignment of value to individuals on the basis of species membership alone. Divisions within animal rights theory include the utilitarian, protectionist approach, which pursues improved conditions for animals, and rights-based abolitionism, which seeks to end human ownership of non-humans. Abolitionists argue that protectionism serves only to make the public feel that animal use can be morally unproblematic (the \"happy meat\" position).\n\nLaw professor Gary Francione, an abolitionist, argues that all sentient beings should have the right not to be treated as property, and that adopting veganism must be the baseline for anyone who believes that non-humans have intrinsic moral value. Pursuing improved welfare conditions is like campaigning for \"conscientious rapists\" who will rape without beating, he argues. Philosopher Tom Regan, also a rights theorist, argues that animals possess value as \"subjects-of-a-life\", because they have beliefs, desires, memory and the ability to initiate action in pursuit of goals. The right of subjects-of-a-life not to be harmed can be overridden by other moral principles, but Regan argues that pleasure, convenience and the economic interests of farmers are not weighty enough.\n\nPhilosopher Peter Singer, a protectionist and utilitarian, argues that there is no moral or logical justification for failing to count animal suffering as a consequence when making decisions, and that killing animals should be rejected unless necessary for survival. Despite this, he writes that \"ethical thinking can be sensitive to circumstances\", and that he is \"not too concerned about trivial infractions\".\n\nAn argument proposed by Bruce Friedrich, also a protectionist, holds that strict adherence to veganism harms animals, because it focuses on personal purity, rather than encouraging people to give up whatever animal products they can. For Francione, this is similar to arguing that, because human-rights abuses can never be eliminated, we should not defend human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, we reinforce that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience, he argues. He concludes from this that the protectionist position fails on its own consequentialist terms.\n\nPhilosopher Val Plumwood maintained that ethical veganism is \"subtly human-centred\", an example of what she called \"human/nature dualism\" because it views humanity as separate from the rest of nature. Ethical vegans want to admit non-humans into the category that deserves special protection, rather than recognize the \"ecological embeddedness\" of all. Plumwood wrote that animal food may be an \"unnecessary evil\" from the perspective of the consumer who \"draws on the whole planet for nutritional needs\"—and she strongly opposed factory farming—but for anyone relying on a much smaller ecosystem, it is very difficult or impossible to be vegan.\n\nBen Mepham, bioethicist and fellow of the Royal Society of Biology, in his review of Francione and Garner's book \"The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation?\", concludes about the vegan philosophy that \"if the aim of ethics is to choose the right, or best, course of action in specific circumstances ‘all things considered’, it is arguable that adherence to such an absolutist agenda is simplistic and open to serious self-contradictions. Or, as Farlie puts it, with characteristic panache: ‘to conclude that veganism is the ‘only ethical response’ is to take a big leap into a very muddy pond’.\" He cites as examples the adverse effects on animal wildlife derived from the agricultural practices necessary to sustain most vegan diets and the ethical contradiction of favoring the welfare of domesticated animals but not that of wild animals; the imbalance between the resources that are used to promote the welfare of animals as opposed to those destined to alleviate the suffering of the approximately one billion human beings who undergo malnutrition, abuse and exploitation; the focus on attitudes and conditions in western developed countries, leaving out the rights and interests of societies whose economy, culture and, in some cases, survival rely on a symbiotic relationship with animals.\n\nEnvironmental vegans focus on conservation, rejecting the use of animal products on the premise that fishing, hunting, trapping and farming, particularly factory farming, are environmentally unsustainable. In 2010 Paul Watson of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society called pigs and chicken \"major aquatic predators\", because livestock eat 40 percent of the fish that are caught. All Sea Shepherd ships have been vegan, for environmental reasons, since 2002.\n\nAccording to a 2006 United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization report, \"Livestock's Long Shadow\", 222 million tonnes of meat were produced globally in 1999. The report posits that around 26 percent of the planet's terrestrial surface is devoted to livestock grazing. In the United States ten billion land animals are killed every year for human consumption, and in 2005 48 billion birds were killed globally. \n\nThe UN report also concluded that livestock farming (mostly of cows, chickens and pigs) affects the air, land, soil, water, biodiversity and climate change. Livestock consumed 1,174 million tonnes of food in 2002—including 7.6 million tonnes of fishmeal and 670 million tonnes of cereals, one-third of the global cereal harvest— and in 2001 consumed 45 million tonnes of roots and vegetables and 17 million tonnes of pulses. As of 2006 the livestock industry accounted for nine percent of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions, 37 percent of methane, 65 percent of nitrous oxide, and 68 percent of ammonia. Livestock waste emitted 30 million tonnes of ammonia a year, which is involved in the production of acid rain. A 2017 study published in the journal \"Carbon Balance and Management\" found animal agriculture's global methane emissions are 11% higher than previous estimates based on data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nA 2010 UN report, \"Assessing the Environmental Impacts of Consumption and Production\", argued that animal products \"in general require more resources and cause higher emissions than plant-based alternatives\". It proposed a move away from animal products to reduce environmental damage. A 2007 Cornell University study concluded that vegetarian diets use the least land \"per capita\", but require higher quality land than is needed to feed animals. A 2015 study published in \"Science of the Total Environment\" determined that significant biodiversity loss can be attributed to the growing demand for meat, which is a significant driver of deforestation and habitat destruction, with species-rich habitats being converted to agriculture for livestock production. A 2017 study by the World Wildlife Fund found that 60% of biodiversity loss can be attributed to the vast scale of feed crop cultivation needed to rear tens of billions of farm animals, which puts an enormous strain on natural resources resulting in an extensive loss of lands and species. In November 2017, 15,364 world scientists signed a warning to humanity calling for, among other things, \"promoting dietary shifts towards mostly plant-based foods.\"\n\nOne of the leading activists and scholars of feminist animal rights is Carol J. Adams. Her premier work, \"The Sexual Politics of Meat: A Feminist-Vegetarian Critical Theory\" (1990), sparked what was to become a movement in animal rights as she noted the relationship between feminism and meat consumption. Since the release of \"The Sexual Politics of Meat\", Adams has published several other works including essays, books, and keynote addresses. Adams ideals are carried out thoroughly, and in one of her speeches, “Why feminist-vegan now?”—adapted from her original address at the “Minding Animals” conference in Newcastle, Australia (2009)--Adams states that “the idea that there was a connection between feminism and vegetarianism came to [her] in October 1974,” illustrating that the concept of feminist veganism has been around for nearly half a century. Other authors have also paralleled Adams’ ideas while expanding on them. Angella Duvnjak states in “Joining the dots: some reflections on feminist-Vegan political practice and choice” that she was met with opposition to the connection of feminist and veganism ideals, although the connection seemed more than obvious to her and other scholars (2011). Other scholars elaborate on the connections between feminism, such as Carrie Hamilton who makes the connection to sex workers and animal reproductive rights. Many other scholars of feminist vegan philosophy continue to add to the arguments that Adams, Duvnjak, and Hamilton have brought forth.\n\nSome of the main concepts of feminist veganism is that is the connection between the violence and oppression of animals. For example, Marjorie Spiegal compares the consumption or servitude of animals for human gain to slavery. Animals are purchased from a breeder, used for personal gain—either for further breeding, or manual labor—and then discarded—most frequently as food. This capitalist use of animals for personal gain has held strong, despite the work of animal rights activists and ecofriendly feminists.\n\nSimilar notions that suggest animals—like fish, for example—feel less pain are brought forth today as a justification for animal cruelty. The feminist side of the argument, however, suggests that there is no rationalization for treating animal lives with lesser reverence than human lives, even if the theory that animals are less capable of pain is verifiable.\n\nAnother connection between feminism and veganism is the parallel of violence against women or other minority members and the violence against animals. Animal rights activists closely relates animal cruelty to feminist issues. This connection is even further mirrored as animals that are used for breeding practices are compared to human trafficking victims and migrant sex workers. Hamilton points out that violent “rapists sometimes exhibit behavior that seems to be patterned on the mutilation of animals” suggesting there is a trend between the violence towards rape victims and animal cruelty previously exhibited by the rapist.\n\nThe violence connection is not limited to sexual acts, however. It is a common fact the prevalence of violence against animals are more defined in those with psychopathic disorders. This mirroring of violence against animals and violence against weaker animals lead the pioneers of feminist veganism to suggest that there is a correspondence between violence against humans and animals, supporting feminist veganism.\n\nAnother way that feminist veganism relates to feminist thoughts is through the capitalist means of the production itself. Carol J. Adams, mentions Barbara Noske talking about “meat eating as the ultimate capitalist product, because it takes so much to make the product, it uses up so many resources”. The capitalization of resources for meat production is argued to be better used for production of other food products that have a less detrimental impact on the environment.\n\nMultiple symbols have been developed to represent veganism. Several are used on consumer packaging, including the Vegan Society trademark and Vegan Action logo, to indicate products without animal-derived ingredients. Various symbols may also be used by members of the vegan community to represent their identity and in the course of animal rights activism, for example a vegan flag.\n",
                "Vegetarianism and religion\n\nVegetarianism is strongly linked with a number of religions that originated in ancient India (Jainism, Hinduism and Buddhism). In Jainism, vegetarianism is mandatory for everyone; in Hinduism and Mahayana Buddhism, it is advocated by some influential scriptures and religious authorities. Comparatively, in the Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), the Bahá'í Faith and Dharmic religions such as Sikhism, vegetarianism is not promoted by mainstream authorities, although in all these faiths there are small groups actively promoting vegetarianism on religious grounds.\n\nMost Indian religions have philosophical schools that forbid consumption of meat and Jainism institutes an outright ban on the same. Consequently, India is home to more vegetarians than any other country. About 30% of India's 1.2 billion population practices lacto vegetarianism, with overall meat consumption increasing. The per capita meat consumption in India in 2002 was 5.2 kg, while it was 24 times more in the United States at 124.8 kg. Meat consumption in the United States and India grew at about 40% over the last 50 years. In 1961 Indian per capita meat consumption was 3.7 kg, while the US consumption was 89.2 kg.\n\nVegetarianism in Jainism is based on the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa, literally \"non-injuring\"). Vegetarianism is considered mandatory for everyone. Jains are either lacto-vegetarians or vegans. No use or consumption of products obtained from dead animals is allowed. Moreover, Jains try to avoid unnecessary injury to plants and \"suksma jiva\" (Sanskrit for \"subtle life forms\"; minuscule organisms). The goal is to cause as little violence to living things as possible, hence they avoid eating roots, tubers such as potatoes, garlic and anything that involves uprooting (and thus eventually killing) a plant to obtain food.\n\nEvery act by which a person directly or indirectly supports killing or injury is seen as violence (\"hinsa\"), which creates harmful karma. The aim of ahimsa is to prevent the accumulation of such karma. Jains consider nonviolence to be the most essential religious duty for everyone (ahinsā paramo dharmaḥ, a statement often inscribed on Jain temples). Their scrupulous and thorough way of applying nonviolence to everyday activities, and especially to food, shapes their entire lives and is the most significant hallmark of Jain identity. A side effect of this strict discipline is the exercise of asceticism, which is strongly encouraged in Jainism for lay people as well as for monks and nuns.\n\nJains do not practice animal sacrifice as they consider all sentient beings to be equal.\n\nVegetarianism is an integral part of most schools of Hinduism although there are a wide variety of practices and beliefs that have changed over time. An estimated 30% of all Hindus are vegetarians. Some sects of Hindus do not observe vegetarianism.\n\nThe principle of nonviolence (Ahimsa) applied to animals is connected with the intention to avoid negative karmic influences which result from violence. The suffering of all beings is believed to arise from craving and desire, conditioned by the karmic effects of both animal and human action. The violence of slaughtering animals for food, and its source in craving, reveal flesh eating as one mode in which humans enslave themselves to suffering. Hinduism holds that such influences affect the person who permits the slaughter of an animal, the person who kills it, the person who cuts it up, the person who buys or sells meat, the person who cooks it, the person who serves it up, and the person who eats it. They must all be considered the slayers of the animal. The question of religious duties towards the animals and of negative Karma incurred from violence (\"himsa\") against them is discussed in detail in Hindu scriptures and religious law books.\n\nHindu scriptures belong or refer to the Vedic period which lasted till about 500 BCE according to the chronological division by modern historians. In the historical Vedic religion, the predecessor of Hinduism, meat eating was not banned in principle, but was restricted by specific rules. Several highly authoritative scriptures bar violence against domestic animals except in the case of ritual sacrifice. This view is clearly expressed in the Mahabharata (3.199.11-12; 13.115; 13.116.26; 13.148.17), the Bhagavata Purana (11.5.13-14), and the Chandogya Upanishad (8.15.1). For instance, many Hindus point to the Mahabharata's maxim that \"Nonviolence is the highest duty and the highest teaching,\" as advocating a vegetarian diet. The Mahabharata also states that adharma (sin) was born when creatures started to devour one another from want of food and that adharma always destroys every creature \" It is also reflected in the Manu Smriti (5.27-44), a particularly renowned traditional Hindu law book (Dharmaśāstra). These texts strongly condemn the slaughter of animals and meat eating.\n\nThe Mahabharata (12.260; 13.115-116; 14.28) and the Manu Smriti (5.27-55) contain lengthy discussions about the legitimacy of ritual slaughter and subsequent consumption of the meat. In the Mahabharata both meat eaters and vegetarians present various arguments to substantiate their viewpoints. Apart from the debates about domestic animals, there is also a long discourse by a hunter in defence of hunting and meat eating. These texts show that both ritual slaughter and hunting were challenged by advocates of universal non-violence and their acceptability was doubtful and a matter of dispute.\n\nIn modern India the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community or caste and according to regional traditions. Hindu vegetarians usually eschew eggs but consume milk and dairy products, so they are lacto-vegetarians.\n\nAccording to a survey of 2006, vegetarianism is weak in coastal states and strong in landlocked northern and western states and among Brahmins in general, 55 percent of whom are vegetarians. Many coastal inhabitants are fish eaters. In particular Bengali Hindus have romanticized fishermen and the consumption of fish through poetry, literature and music.\n\nHindus who eat meat are encouraged to eat Jhatka meat.\n\nAnimal sacrifice in Hinduism (sometimes known as Jhatka Bali) is the ritual killing of an animal in Hinduism.\n\nThe ritual sacrifice normally forms part of a festival to honour a Hindu god. For example, in Nepal the Hindu goddess Gadhimai, is honoured every 5 years with the slaughter of 250,000 animals. Bali sacrifice today is common at the Sakta shrines of the Goddess Kali.\n\nThe First Precept prohibits Buddhists from killing people or animals. The matter of whether this forbids Buddhists from eating meat has long been a matter of debate.\n\nThe first Buddhist monks and nuns were forbidden from growing, storing, or cooking their own food. They relied entirely on the generosity of alms to feed themselves, and were not allowed to accept money to buy their own food. They could not make special dietary requests, and had to accept whatever food alms givers had available, including meat. Monks and nuns of the Theravada school of Buddhism, which predominates in Sri Lanka, Thailand, Cambodia, Burma, and Laos, still follow these strictures today.\n\nThese strictures were relaxed in China, Korea, Japan, and other countries that follow Mahayana Buddhism, where monasteries were in remote mountain areas and the distance to the nearest towns made daily alms rounds impractical. There, Buddhist monks and nuns could cultivate their own crops, store their own harvests, cook their own meals, and accept money to buy anything else they needed in terms of food in the market.\n\nAccording to the Vinaya Pitaka, when Devadatta urged him to make complete abstinence from meat compulsory, the Buddha refused, maintaining that \"monks would have to accept whatever they found in their begging bowls, including meat, provided that they had not seen, had not heard, and had no reason to suspect that the animal had been killed so that the meat could be given to them\". There were prohibitions on specific kinds of meat: meat from humans, meat from royal animals such as elephants or horses, meat from dogs, and meat from dangerous animals like snakes, lions, tigers, panthers, bears and hyenas.\n\nOn the other hand, certain Mahayana sutras strongly denounce the eating of meat. According to the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the Buddha revoked this permission to eat meat and warned of a dark age when false monks would claim that they were allowed meat. In the Lankavatara Sutra, a disciple of the Buddha named Mahamati asks \"[Y]ou teach a doctrine that is flavoured with compassion. It is the teaching of the perfect Buddhas. And yet we eat meat nonetheless; we have not put an end to it.\" An entire chapter is devoted to the Buddha's response, wherein he lists a litany of spiritual, physical, mental, and emotional reasons why meat eating should be abjured. However, according to , this chapter on meat eating is a \"later addition to the text...It is quite likely that meat-eating was practiced more or less among the earlier Buddhists, which was made a subject of severe criticism by their opponents. The Buddhists at the time of the \"Laṅkāvatāra\" did not like it, hence this addition in which an apologetic tone is noticeable.\" points to a passage in the Surangama Sutra which implies advocacy of \"not just a vegetarian, but a vegan lifestyle\"; however, numerous scholars over the centuries have concluded that the Śūraṅgama Sūtra is a forgery. Moreover, in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, the same sutra which records his retraction of permission to eat meat, the Buddha explicitly identifies as \"beautiful foods\" honey, milk, and cream, all of which are eschewed by vegans.\n\nIn the modern Buddhist world, attitudes toward vegetarianism vary by location. In China and Vietnam, monks typically eat no meat, with other restrictions as well. In Japan or Korea some schools do not eat meat, while most do. Theravadins in Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia do not practice vegetarianism. All Buddhists however, including monks, are allowed to practice vegetarianism if they wish to do so. states that \"There are no accurate statistics, but I would guess—and it is only a guess—that worldwide about half of all Buddhists are vegetarian\".\n\nFollowers of Sikhism do not have a preference for meat or vegetarian consumption. There are two views on initiated or \"Amritdhari Sikhs\" and meat consumption. \"Amritdhari\" Sikhs (i.e. those that follow the Sikh Rehat Maryada - the Official Sikh Code of Conduct) can eat meat (provided it is not Kutha meat).\"Amritdharis\" that belong to some Sikh sects (e.g. Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal, Namdhari, Rarionwalay, etc.) are vehemently against the consumption of meat and eggs.\n\nIn the case of meat, the Sikh Gurus have indicated their preference for a simple diet, which could include meat or be vegetarian. Passages from the Guru Granth Sahib (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the Adi Granth) say that fools argue over this issue. Guru Nanak said that overconsumption of food (Lobh, Greed) involves a drain on the Earth's resources and thus on life. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, prohibited the Sikhs from the consumption of halal or Kutha (any ritually slaughtered meat) meat because of the Sikh belief that sacrificing an animal in the name of God is mere ritualism (something to be avoided).\n\nOn the views that eating vegetation would be eating flesh, first Sikh Guru Nanak states:\n\nOn Vegetation, the Guru described it as living and experiencing pain:\n\nPage 143 of the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji\n\nSikhs who eat meat, eat Jhatka meat.\n\nJudaic, Christian, and Muslim traditions (Abrahamic religions) all have strong connections to the Biblical ideal of the Garden of Eden, which includes references to a herbivore diet. However, only minorities within those populations actually practice and advocate such diets.\n\nRabbinical Judaism discourages \"ascetic\" practices in general, and encourages one to 'enjoy the bounty of this world in a proper fashion'. Several passages in the Hebrew scriptures permit eating animal flesh, such as supposedly , which states \"Every moving thing that liveth shall be food for you.\" This verse extends such permission to all \"children of Noah,\" i.e., all humanity. One of the sages of the Talmud asserted, \"Man will have to account for everything he saw but did not eat.\" (This refers to permissible or kosher foods only, not to forbidden animal species such as pork.) On the other hand, the Talmud discourages indulgence and states that it is preferable that one's diet consist mostly of non-meat products. To Jewish vegetarians wishing to remain consistent with this teaching, vegetarianism is not a form of self-deprivation, because the vegetarian does not desire to eat meat and believes it is healthier not to eat meat and is aware of other negative effects of meat production and consumption.\n\nGenerally speaking, Judaism has not promoted vegetarianism. However, some prominent rabbis have promoted vegetarian lifestyle, among them David Cohen (known as \"Ha-Nazir\"), and Chief Rabbi of Israel Shlomo Goren. Rabbi Yitzhak HaLevi Herzog said:\n\nRabbi Milgrom regards the commandment against blood as a law that permits man to \"indulge in his lust for meat and not be brutalized in the process.\"\n\nSome Orthodox authorities have argued that it is forbidden for an individual to become a vegetarian if they do so because they believe in animal rights; however, they have ruled that vegetarianism is allowed for pragmatic reasons (if kosher meat is expensive or hard to come by in their area), health concerns, or for reasons of personal taste (if someone finds meat unpalatable). Some believe that halakha encourages the eating of meat at the Sabbath and Festival meals; thus some Orthodox Jews who are otherwise vegetarian will nevertheless consume meat at these meals.\n\nThere are several arguments from Judaism used by Jewish vegetarians. For the Jewish vegetarian there are three main components which prove vegetarianism to be an ethical mitzvah: Tza'ar ba'alei hayyim, Pikuach nefesh and Bal tashkhit. Tza'ar ba'alei hayyim is the injunction not to cause ‘pain to living creatures’. Pikuach nefesh is not only the regard for human life which is in immediate danger. Bal Tashchit is the law which prohibits waste. Another argument is that, since Adam and Eve were not allowed to eat meat and that, according to some opinions, in the Messianic era, the whole world will be vegetarian, not eating meat is something that brings the world closer to that ideal. In his booklet summarizing many of Rav Kook’s teachings, Joseph Green, a 20th-century South African Jewish vegetarian writer, concludes that Jewish religious ethical vegetarians are pioneers of the messianic era; they are leading lives that make the coming of the Messiah more likely. The Jewish tradition asserts that one way to speed the coming of the Messiah is to start practicing the ways that will prevail in the messianic time. A second one is that the laws of shechita are meant to prevent the suffering of animals and today, with factory farming and high-speed, mechanized slaughterhouses, even kosher slaughterhouses are considered by some authorities not to fulfill enough of the requirements to render the meat kosher. Also, even if the slaughtering process is carried out perfectly, with a minimum of pain to the animal, the many months of cruel treatment of animals on factory farms should be considered. A third one is that the Sages only mandated eating an olive's bulk of meat during festivals, but even then, this was because in Talmudic times, meat was considered essential for one's diet.\n\nSacrifices were used as an excuse to eat meat, and later denounced by the biblical prophets if carried out in a society that did not practice compassion and justice.\n\nIn Israel there is one vegetarian moshav (village), called Amirim. Its vegetarianism is based on general principles of health and ethics and not on the Jewish religion.\n\nJewish Veg is a grassroots organization promoting veganism as \"God's ideal diet\".\n\nThe Shamayim V'Aretz Institute led by Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz promotes a vegan diet in the Jewish community through animal welfare activism, kosher veganism, and Jewish spirituality.\n\nNotable Jewish vegetarians include David Rosen, She'ar Yashuv Cohen, Franz Kafka, Roberta Kalechofsky, Yonassan Gershom, Shmuly Yanklowitz, Richard H. Schwartz, and Isaac Bashevis Singer. Jonathan Safran Foer narrated the short documentary film \"If This Is Kosher...\", which records what he considers abuses within the kosher meat industry.\n\nSeveral Christian monastic groups, including the Desert Fathers, Trappists, Benedictines, Cistercians and Carthusians, all of the Orthodox monks and also Christian esoteric groups, such as the Rosicrucian Fellowship, have encouraged vegetarianism.\n\nThe Bible Christian Church, a Christian vegetarian sect founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809, were one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society. Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance.\n\nSome Christian groups, such as Seventh-day Adventists, the Christian Vegetarian Association and Christian anarchists, take a literal interpretation of the Biblical prophecies of universal veg(etari)anism and encourage veg(etari)anism as preferred lifestyles or as a tool to reject the commodity status of animals and the use of animal products for any purpose, although some of them say it is not required. Other groups point instead to allegedly explicit prophecies of temple sacrifices in the Messianic Kingdom, e.g. , where so-called peace offerings and so-called freewill offerings are said that will be offered, and where it states that such offerings are eaten, what may contradict the very purpose of Jesus' purportedly sufficient atonement.\n\nSome Christian vegetarians, such as Keith Akers, argue that Jesus himself was a vegetarian. Akers argues that Jesus was influenced by the Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect. The present academic consensus is that Jesus was not an Essene. There is no historical record of Jesus’ precise attitudes to animals, but there is a strand in his ethical teaching about the primacy of mercy to the weak, the powerless and the oppressed, which Walters and Portmess argue can also refer to captive animals.\n\nWithin Eastern Christianity, Vegetarianism is practiced as part of fasting during the Great Lent (although shellfish and other non-vertebrate products are generally considered acceptable during some periods of this time); vegan fasting is particularly common in Eastern Orthodoxy and Oriental Orthodox Churches, such as the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria, which generally fasts 210 days out of the year.\n\nIslam explicitly prohibits eating of some kinds of meat, especially pork. However, one of the most important Islamic celebrations, \"Eid ul-Adha\", involves animal sacrifices. Muslims who can afford to do so sacrifice a domestic animals (usually sheep, but also camels, cows, and goats). According to the Quran, a large portion of the meat has to be given towards the poor and hungry, and every effort is to be made to see that no impoverished Muslim is left without sacrificial food during days of feast like Eid-ul-Adha. Certain Islamic orders are mainly vegetarian; many Sufis maintain a vegetarian diet.\n\nRastafarians generally follow a diet called \"I-tal\", which eschews the eating of food that has been artificially preserved, flavoured, or chemically altered in any way. Some Rastafarians consider it to also forbid the eating of meat but the majority will not eat pork at the very least, considering it unclean.\n\nWhile there are no dietary restrictions in the Bahá'í Faith, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the founder of the religion, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick. He stated that there are no requirements that Bahá'ís become vegetarian, but that a future society would gradually become vegetarian. `Abdu'l-Bahá also stated that killing animals was somewhat contrary to compassion. While Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals, both he and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Bahá'ís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bahá'í practice and that Bahá'ís can choose to eat whatever they wish, but to be respectful of others beliefs.\n\nThe Nation of Islam promotes vegetarianism deeming it the \"most healthful and virtuous way to eat\".\n\nIn Chinese societies, \"simple eating\" (素食 Mandarin: sù shí) refers to a particular restricted diet associated with Taoist monks, and sometimes practiced by members of the general population during Taoist festivals and fasting days. It is similar to Chinese Buddhist vegetarianism. Varying levels of abstinence among Taoists and Taoist-influenced people include veganism, veganism without root vegetables, lacto-ovo vegetarianism, and pescetarianism. Taoist vegetarians also tend to abstain from alcohol and pungent vegetables such as garlic and onions during lenten days. Non-vegetarian Taoists sometimes abstain from beef and water buffalo meat for many cultural reasons.\n\nVegetarianism in the Taoist tradition is similar to that of Lent in the Christian tradition. While highly religious people such as monks may be vegetarian, vegan or pescetarian on a permanent basis, lay practitioners often eat vegetarian on the 1st (new moon), 8th, 14th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 28th, 29th and 30th days of the lunar calendar. In accordance with their Buddhist peers, and because many people are both Taoist and Buddhist, they often also eat lenten on the 15th day (full moon). Taoist vegetarianism is similar to Chinese Buddhist vegetarianism, however, its roots reach to pre-Buddhist times. Believers historically abstained from animal products and alcohol before practicing Confucian, Taoist and Chinese folk religion rites.\n\nIt is referred to by the English word \"vegetarian\"; however, though it rejects meat, eggs, and milk, this diet may include oysters and oyster products or otherwise be pescetarian for some believers. Many lay Taoists who follow modern sects such as that of Yi Guan Dao or Master Ching Hai are vegan or strictly vegetarian. \n\nOne of the main precepts in Zoroastrianism is respect and kindness towards all living things and condemnation of cruelty against animals\n\nThe Shahnameh states that the evil king of Iran, Zohak was first taught eating meat by the evil one who came to him in the guise of a cook. This was the start of an age of great evil for Iran. Prior to this, in the Golden age of mankind in the days of the great Aryan Kings, man did not eat meat.\n\nThe Pahlavi scriptures state that in the final stages of the world, when the final Saviour Saoshyant arrives, man will become more spiritual and gradually give up meat eating.\n\nVegetarianism is stated to be the future state of the world in Pahlavi scriptures - Atrupat-e Emetan in Iran in Denkard Book VI requested all Zoroastrians to be vegetarians:\n\n\"ku.san enez a-on ku urwar xwarishn bawed shmah mardoman ku derziwishn bawed, ud az tan i gospand pahrezed, ce amar was, eg Ohrmaz i xwaday hay.yarih i gospand ray urwar was dad.\"\n\nMeaning: They hold this also: Be plant eaters (urwar xwarishn) (i.e. vegetarian), O you, men, so that you may live long. Keep away from the body of cattle (tan i gospand), and deeply reckon that Ohrmazd, the Lord has created plants in great number for helping cattle (and men).\"\n\nOahspe (Meaning Sky, Earth and Spirit) is the doctrinal book of those who follow Faithism. The precepts for behavior can be found throughout the book which include\" a herbivorous diet (vegan, vegetable food only), peaceful living (no warring or violence; pacifism), living a life of virtue, service to others, angelic assistance, spiritual communion, and communal living when it is feasible to do so. Freedom and responsibility are two themes reiterated throughout the text of Oahspe.\n\nThere is no set teaching on vegetarianism within the diverse neopagan communities, however many do follow a vegetarian diet often connected to ecological concerns as well as the welfare and rights of animals. Vegetarian practitioners of Wicca will often see their standpoint as a natural extension of the Wiccan Rede. Organizations like SERV refer to the historic figures of Porphyry, Pythagoras and Iamblichus as sources for the Pagan view of vegetarianism. During the 1970s the publication Earth Religion News, focused on articles related to neopaganism and vegetarianism, it was edited by the author Herman Slater.\n\nThe spiritual teacher Meher Baba recommended a vegetarian diet for his followers because he held that it helps one to avoid certain impurities: \"Killing an animal for sport, pleasure or food means catching all its bad impressions, since the motive is selfish...Impressions are contagious. Eating meat is prohibited in many spiritual disciplines because therein the person catches the impressions of the animal, thus rendering himself more susceptible to lust and anger.\"\n\nThe Creativity religion promotes a form of raw veganism in its \"Salubrious Living\" doctrine named after the third text of the faith written by Ben Klassen, which encourages the consumption of only raw foods in their \"natural state, basically fruits, vegetables, grains and nuts,\" getting plenty of physical exercise as well as abstinence from alcohol, nicotine, caffeine, sugar, preservatives, insecticides, narcotics and other drugs whether prescription or non-prescription. Salubrious Living is considered mandatory to \"fully practice\" Creativity and a lawsuit is currently in place against the Bureau of Prisons to get it recognized as a religious dietary preference for incarcerated adherents of the religious movement.\n\n\n\n",
                "Vegetarianism\n\nVegetarianism is the practice of abstaining from the consumption of meat (red meat, poultry, seafood, and the flesh of any other animal), and may also include abstention from by-products of animal slaughter.\n\nVegetarianism may be adopted for various reasons. Many people object to eating meat out of respect for sentient life. Such ethical motivations have been codified under various religious beliefs, as well as animal rights advocacy. Other motivations for vegetarianism are health-related, political, environmental, cultural, aesthetic, economic, or personal preference. There are variations of the diet as well: an ovo-lacto vegetarian diet includes both eggs and dairy products, an ovo-vegetarian diet includes eggs but not dairy products, and a lacto-vegetarian diet includes dairy products but not eggs. A vegan diet excludes all animal products, including eggs and dairy. Some vegans also avoid other animal products such as beeswax, leather or silk clothing, and goose-fat shoe polish.\n\nPackaged and processed foods, such as cakes, cookies, candies, chocolate, yogurt, and marshmallows, often contain unfamiliar animal ingredients, so may be a special concern for vegetarians due to the likelihood of such additions. Often, prior to purchase or consumption, vegetarians will scrutinize products for animal-derived ingredients. Vegetarians' feelings vary with regard to these ingredients. For example, while some vegetarians may be unaware of animal-derived rennet's role in the production of cheese, and may therefore unknowingly consume the product, other vegetarians may not take issue with its consumption.\n\nSemi-vegetarian diets consist largely of vegetarian foods but may include fish or poultry, or sometimes other meats, on an infrequent basis. Those with diets containing fish or poultry may define \"meat\" only as mammalian flesh and may identify with vegetarianism. A pescetarian diet has been described as \"fish but no other meat\". The common use association between such diets and vegetarianism has led vegetarian groups such as the Vegetarian Society to state that diets containing these ingredients are not vegetarian, because fish and birds are also animals.\nThe term 'vegetarian' has been in use since 1839 to refer to what was previously described as a \"vegetable diet\". The word is commonly believed to be a compound of \"vegetable\" and the suffix \"-arian\" (as in \"agrarian\"). (John Davis shows that it was probably not derived from the Latin word \"vegetus\".)\nThe term was popularized with the foundation of the Vegetarian Society in Manchester, UK in 1847. The earliest occurrences of the term seem to be related to Alcott House, a school on the north side of Ham Common, London, opened in July 1838 by James Pierrepont Greaves. From 1841, it was known as \"A Concordium, or Industry Harmony College\", from which time the institution began to publish its own pamphlet, \"The Healthian\", which provides some of the earliest appearances of the term \"vegetarian\".\n\nThe earliest record of vegetarianism comes from Indus Valley Civilization as early as the 7th century BCE, inculcating tolerance towards all living beings. Vegetarianism was also practiced in ancient Greece and the earliest reliable evidence for vegetarian theory and practice in Greece dates from the 6th century BC. The Orphics, a religious movement spreading in Greece at that time. It is unclear whether the Greek religious teacher Pythagoras actually advocated vegetarianism, but later writers presented him as doing so. A fictionalized portrayal of Pythagoras appears in Book XV of Ovid's \"Metamorphoses\", in which he advocates a form of strict vegetarianism. It was through this portrayal that Pythagoras was best known to English-speakers throughout the early modern period and, prior to the coinage of the word \"vegetarianism\", vegetarians were referred to in English as \"Pythagoreans\".\n\nVegetarianism was also practiced about six centuries later in another instance (between 30 BCE–50 CE) in northern Thracian region, the Moesi tribe who inhabited present day Serbia and Bulgaria, feeding themselves on honey, milk and cheese.\n\nIn the Indian culture, the diet was closely connected with the attitude of nonviolence towards animals (called \"ahimsa\" in India) and was promoted by religious groups and philosophers. The ancient Indian work of Tirukkural explicitly and unambiguously emphasizes vegetarianism and non-killing. Chapter 26 of the Tirukkural, through couplets 251 to 260, deals exclusively on vegetarianism or veganism. Among the Hellenes, Egyptians and others, it had medical or ritual purification purposes.\nFollowing the Christianization of the Roman Empire in late antiquity, vegetarianism practically disappeared from Europe, as it did on other continents, except India. Several orders of monks in medieval Europe restricted or banned the consumption of meat for ascetic reasons, but none of them eschewed fish. (The medieval definition of \"fish\" included such animals as seals, porpoises, dolphins, barnacle geese, puffins, and beavers.) It re-emerged during the Renaissance, becoming more widespread in the 19th and 20th centuries. In 1847, the first Vegetarian Society was founded in the United Kingdom; Germany, the Netherlands, and other countries followed. In 1886, the vegetarian colony Nueva Germania was founded in Paraguay, though its vegetarian aspect would prove short-lived. The International Vegetarian Union, an association of the national societies, was founded in 1908. In the Western world, the popularity of vegetarianism grew during the twentieth century as a result of nutritional, ethical, and more recently, environmental and economic concerns.\n\nThere are a number of vegetarian diets that exclude or include various foods:\n\nWithin the \"ovo-\" groups, there are many who refuse to consume fertilized eggs (with balut being an extreme example); however, such distinction is typically not specifically addressed.\n\nSome vegetarians also avoid products that may use animal ingredients not included in their labels or which use animal products in their manufacturing; for example, sugars that are whitened with bone char, cheeses that use animal rennet (enzymes from animal stomach lining), gelatin (derived from the collagen inside animals' skin, bones and connective tissue), some cane sugar (but not beet sugar) and apple juice/alcohol clarified with gelatin or crushed shellfish and sturgeon, while other vegetarians are unaware of or do not mind such ingredients.\n\nIndividuals sometimes label themselves \"vegetarian\" while practicing a semi-vegetarian diet, as some dictionary definitions describe vegetarianism as sometimes including the consumption of fish, or only include mammalian flesh as part of their definition of meat, while other definitions exclude fish and all animal flesh. In other cases, individuals may describe themselves as \"flexitarian\".\nThese diets may be followed by those who reduce animal flesh consumed as a way of transitioning to a complete vegetarian diet or for health, ethical, environmental, or other reasons. Semi-vegetarian diets include:\n\nSemi-vegetarianism is contested by vegetarian groups, such as the Vegetarian Society, which states that vegetarianism excludes all animal flesh.\n\nStudies on the health effects of vegetarian diets observe heterogeneous effects on mortality. One review found a decreased overall risk of all cause mortality, cancer (except breast) and cardiovascular disease; however, a meta-analysis found lower risk for ischemic heart disease and cancer but no effect on overall mortality or cerebrovascular disease. Possible limitations include varying definitions used of vegetarianism, and the observation of increased risk of lung cancer mortality in those on a vegetarian diet for less than five years. An analysis pooling two large studies found vegetarians in the UK have similar all cause mortality as meat eaters. An older meta analysis found similar results, only finding decreased mortality in vegetarians, pescatarians, and irregular meat eaters in ischemic heart disease, but not from any other cause.\n\nA vegetarian diet which is poorly planned can lead to hyperhomocysteinemia and platelet disorders; this risk may be offset by ensuring sufficient consumption of vitamin B 12 and polyunsaturated fatty acids.\n\nThe Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and Dietitians of Canada have stated that at all stages of life, a properly planned vegetarian diet is \"healthful, nutritionally adequate, and provides health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases\". Large-scale studies have shown that mortality from ischemic heart disease was 30% lower among vegetarian men and 20% lower among vegetarian women than in non-vegetarians. Vegetarian diets offer lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol and animal protein, and higher levels of carbohydrates, fibre, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants such as vitamins C and E and phytochemicals.\n\n\"Vegetarian diets can meet guidelines for the treatment of diabetes and some research suggests that diets that are more plant-based reduce risk of type-2 diabetes. Rates of self-reported Seventh-day Adventists (SDA) were less than half of those of the general population, and, among SDA, vegetarians had lower rates of diabetes than non-vegetarians. Among possible explanations for a protective effect of vegetarian diet are the Lower BMI of vegetarians and higher fiber intake, both of which improve insulin sensitivity.\"\n\nThe relationship between vegetarian diet and bone health remains unclear. According to some studies, a vegetarian lifestyle can be associated with vitamin B 12 deficiency and low bone mineral density. However, a study of vegetarian and non-vegetarian adults in Taiwan found no significant difference in bone mineral density between the two groups. Other studies, exploring animal protein's negative effects on bone health, suggest that vegetarians may be less prone to osteoporosis than omnivores, as vegetarian subjects had greater bone mineral density and more bone formation.\n\nThe China-Cornell-Oxford Project, a 20-year study conducted by Cornell University, the University of Oxford, and the government of China has established a correlation between the consumption of animal products and a variety of chronic illnesses, such as coronary heart disease, diabetes, and cancers of the breast, prostate and bowel (see \"The China Study\").\n\nA British study of almost 10,000 men found that those who gave up meat were almost twice as likely to suffer from depression as people on a conventional balanced diet. The study found that the 350 committed vegetarians studied had a higher average depression score compared to others.\n\nWestern vegetarian diets are typically high in carotenoids, but relatively low in omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin B. Vegans can have particularly low intake of vitamin B and calcium if they do not eat enough items such as collard greens, leafy greens, tempeh and tofu (soy). High levels of dietary fiber, folic acid, vitamins C and E, and magnesium, and low consumption of saturated fat are all considered to be beneficial aspects of a vegetarian diet. A well planned vegetarian diet will provide all nutrients in a meat-eater's diet to the same level for all stages of life.\n\nProtein intake in vegetarian diets is lower than in meat diets but can meet the daily requirements for most people. Studies at Harvard University as well as other studies conducted in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and various European countries,\nconfirmed vegetarian diets provide sufficient protein intake as long as a variety of plant sources are available and consumed. Pumpkin seeds, peanut butter, hemp seed, almonds, pistachio nuts, flaxseed, tofu, oats, soybeans, walnuts, are great sources of protein for vegetarians. Proteins are composed of amino acids, and a common concern with protein acquired from vegetable sources is an adequate intake of the essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesised by the human body. While dairy and egg products provide complete sources for ovo-lacto vegetarian, several vegetable sources have significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids, including lupin beans, soy, hempseed, chia seed, amaranth, buckwheat, pumpkin seeds spirulina, pistachios, and quinoa. However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. brown rice and beans, or hummus and pita, though protein combining in the same meal is not necessary). A 1994 study found a varied intake of such sources can be adequate.\n\nVegetarian diets typically contain similar levels of iron to non-vegetarian diets, but this has lower bioavailability than iron from meat sources, and its absorption can sometimes be inhibited by other dietary constituents. According to the Vegetarian Resource Group, consuming food that contains vitamin C, such as citrus fruit or juices, tomatoes, or broccoli, is a good way to increase the amount of iron absorbed at a meal. Vegetarian foods rich in iron include black beans, cashews, hempseed, kidney beans, broccoli, lentils, oatmeal, raisins, spinach, cabbage, lettuce, black-eyed peas, soybeans, many breakfast cereals, sunflower seeds, chickpeas, tomato juice, tempeh, molasses, thyme, and whole-wheat bread. The related vegan diets can often be higher in iron than vegetarian diets, because dairy products are low in iron. Iron stores often tend to be lower in vegetarians than non-vegetarians, and a few small studies report very high rates of iron deficiency (up to 40%, and 58% of the respective vegetarian or vegan groups). However, the American Dietetic Association states that iron deficiency is no more common in vegetarians than non-vegetarians (adult males are rarely iron deficient); iron deficiency anaemia is rare no matter the diet.\n\nAccording to the United States National Institutes of Health, vitamin B is not generally present in plants and is naturally found in foods of animal origin. Lacto-ovo vegetarians can obtain B from dairy products and eggs, and vegans can obtain it from fortified foods (including some soy products and some breakfast cereals) and dietary supplements. Vitamin B can also be obtained from fortified yeast extract products.\n\nThe recommended dietary allowance of B in the United States is, per day, 0.4 mcg (0–6 months), rising to 1.8 mcg (9–13 years), 2.4 mcg (14+ years), and 2.8 mcg (lactating female). While the body's daily requirement for vitamin B is very small, deficiency of the vitamin is very serious leading to anemia and irreversible nerve damage.\n\nPlant-based, or vegetarian, sources of Omega 3 fatty acids include soy, walnuts, pumpkin seeds, canola oil, kiwifruit, hempseed, algae, chia seed, flaxseed, echium seed and leafy vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, cabbage and purslane. Purslane contains more Omega 3 than any other known leafy green. Olives (and olive oil) are another important plant source of unsaturated fatty acids. Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA. EPA and DHA can be obtained directly in high amounts from oily fish or fish oils. Vegetarians, and particularly vegans, have lower levels of EPA and DHA than meat-eaters. While the health effects of low levels of EPA and DHA are unknown, it is unlikely that supplementation with alpha-linolenic acid will significantly increase levels. Recently, some companies have begun to market vegetarian DHA supplements containing seaweed extracts. Similar supplements providing both DHA and EPA have also begun to appear. Whole seaweeds are not suitable for supplementation because their high iodine content limits the amount that may be safely consumed. However, certain algae such as spirulina are good sources of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), linoleic acid (LA), stearidonic acid (SDA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid (AA).\n\nCalcium intake in vegetarians and vegans can be similar to non-vegetarians, as long as the diet is properly planned. Lacto-ovo vegetarians that include dairy products can still obtain calcium from dairy sources like milk, yogurt, and cheese.\n\nNon-dairy milks that are fortified with calcium, such as soymilk and almond milk can also contribute a significant amount of calcium in the diet. The calcium found in broccoli, bok choy, and kale have also been found to have calcium that is well absorbed in the body. Though the calcium content per serving is lower in these vegetables than a glass of milk, the absorption of the calcium into the body is higher. Other foods that contain calcium include calcium-set tofu, blackstrap molasses, turnip greens, mustard greens, soybeans, tempeh, almonds, okra, dried figs, and tahini. Though calcium can be found in Spinach, swiss chard, beans and beet greens, they are generally not considered to be a good source since the calcium binds to oxalic acid and is poorly absorbed into the body. Phytic acid found in nuts, seeds, and beans may also impact calcium absorption rates. See the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements for calcium needs for various ages, the Vegetarian Resource Group and the Vegetarian Nutrition Calcium Fact Sheet from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics for more specifics on how to obtain adequate calcium intake on a vegetarian or vegan diet.\n\nVitamin D needs can be met via the human body's own generation upon sufficient and sensible exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light in sunlight. Products including milk, soy milk and cereal grains may be fortified to provide a source of Vitamin D. For those who do not get adequate sun exposure or food sources, Vitamin D supplementation may be necessary.\n\n\nVitamin D, or ergocalciferol is found in fungus (except alfalfa which is a plantae) and created from viosterol, which in turn is created when ultraviolet light activates ergosterol (which is found in fungi and named as a sterol from ergot). Any UV-irradiated fungus including yeast form vitamin D. Human bioavailability of vitamin D from vitamin D-enhanced button mushrooms via UV-B irradiation is effective in improving vitamin D status and not different from a vitamin D supplement according to study. For example, Vitamin D from UV-irradiated yeast baked into bread is bioavailable.\nBy visual assessment or using a chromometer, no significant discoloration of irradiated mushrooms, as measured by the degree of \"whiteness\", was observed making it hard to discover if they have been treated without labeling. Claims have been made that a normal serving (approx. 3 oz or 1/2 cup, or 60 grams) of mushrooms treated with ultraviolet light increase their vitamin D content to levels up to 80 micrograms, or 2700 IU if exposed to just 5 minutes of UV light after being harvested.\n\nThere have been many comparative and statistical studies of the relationship between diet and longevity, including vegetarianism and longevity.\n\nA 1999 metastudy combined data from five studies from western countries. The metastudy reported mortality ratios, where lower numbers indicated fewer deaths, for fish eaters to be 0.82, vegetarians to be 0.84, occasional meat eaters (eat meat less than once per week) to be 0.84. Regular meat eaters had the base mortality rate of 1.0, while the number for vegans was very uncertain (anywhere between 0.7 and 1.44) due to too few data points. The study reported the numbers of deaths in each category, and expected error ranges for each ratio, and adjustments made to the data. However, the \"lower mortality was due largely to the relatively low prevalence of smoking in these [vegetarian] cohorts\". Out of the major causes of death studied, only one difference in mortality rate was attributed to the difference in diet, as the conclusion states: \"...vegetarians had a 24% lower mortality from ischaemic heart disease than non-vegetarians, but no associations of a vegetarian diet with other major causes of death were established\".\n\nIn \"Mortality in British vegetarians\", a similar conclusion is drawn:\n\nBritish vegetarians have low mortality compared with the general population. Their death rates are similar to those of comparable non-vegetarians, suggesting that much of this benefit may be attributed to non-dietary lifestyle factors such as a low prevalence of smoking and a generally high socio-economic status, or to aspects of the diet other than the avoidance of meat and fish.\"\n\nThe Adventist Health Studies is ongoing research that documents the life expectancy in Seventh-day Adventists. This is the only study among others with similar methodology which had favourable indication for vegetarianism. The researchers found that a combination of different lifestyle choices could influence life expectancy by as much as 10 years. Among the lifestyle choices investigated, a vegetarian diet was estimated to confer an extra 1–1/2 to 2 years of life. The researchers concluded that \"the life expectancies of California Adventist men and women are higher than those of any other well-described natural population\" at 78.5 years for men and 82.3 years for women. The life expectancy of California Adventists surviving to age 30 was 83.3 years for men and 85.7 years for women.\n\nThe Adventist health study is again incorporated into a metastudy titled \"Does low meat consumption increase life expectancy in humans?\" published in \"American Journal of Clinical Nutrition\", which concluded that low meat eating (less than once per week) and other lifestyle choices significantly increase life expectancy, relative to a group with high meat intake. The study concluded that \"The findings from one cohort of healthy adults raises the possibility that long-term (≥ 2 decades) adherence to a vegetarian diet can further produce a significant 3.6-y increase in life expectancy.\" However, the study also concluded that \"Some of the variation in the survival advantage in vegetarians may have been due to marked differences between studies in adjustment for confounders, the definition of vegetarian, measurement error, age distribution, the healthy volunteer effect, and intake of specific plant foods by the vegetarians.\" It further states that \"This raises the possibility that a low-meat, high plant-food dietary pattern may be the true causal protective factor rather than simply elimination of meat from the diet.\" In a recent review of studies relating low-meat diet patterns to all-cause mortality, Singh noted that \"5 out of 5 studies indicated that adults who followed a low meat, high plant-food diet pattern experienced significant or marginally significant decreases in mortality risk relative to other patterns of intake.\"\n\nStatistical studies, such as comparing life expectancy with regional areas and local diets in Europe also have found life expectancy considerably greater in southern France, where a low meat, high plant Mediterranean diet is common, than northern France, where a diet with high meat content is more common.\n\nA study by the Institute of Preventive and Clinical Medicine, and Institute of Physiological Chemistry looked at a group of 19 vegetarians (lacto-ovo) and used as a comparison a group of 19 omnivorous subjects recruited from the same region. The study found that this group of vegetarians (lacto-ovo) have a significantly higher amount of plasma carboxymethyllysine and advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) compared to this group of non-vegetarians. Carboxymethyllysine is a glycation product which represents \"a general marker of oxidative stress and long-term damage of proteins in aging, atherosclerosis and diabetes\" and \"[a]dvanced glycation end products (AGEs) may play an important adverse role in process of atherosclerosis, diabetes, aging and chronic renal failure\".\n\nIn Western medicine, patients are sometimes advised to adhere to a vegetarian diet. According to studies by the Permanente Journal and the National Institute for Health (NIH), vegetarian diets are affordable and can help reduce health risks like high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and cholesterol levels. A plant based diet has the potential to lower the risk of heart disease as well as reducing the amount of medications prescribed in instances of chronic illness. A change to a plant based diet, or vegetarianism, has had dramatic positive effects on the health of patients with chronic illnesses, significantly more than exercise alone \nVegetarian diets have been used as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, but the evidence is inconclusive whether this is effective.\nCertain alternative medicines, such as Ayurveda and Siddha, prescribe a vegetarian diet as a normal procedure. Maya Tiwari notes that Ayurveda recommends small portions of meat for some people, though \"the rules of hunting and killing the animal, practiced by the native peoples, were very specific and detailed\". Now that such methods of hunting and killing are not observed, she does not recommend the use of \"any animal meat as food, not even for the Vata types\".\n\nThe human digestive system is omnivorous, capable of consuming a wide variety of plant and animal material. Some nutritional experts believe that early hominids evolved into eating meat as a result of huge climatic changes that took place three to four million years ago, when forests and jungles dried up and became open grasslands and opened hunting and scavenging opportunities.\n\nThe American Dietetic Association has presented evidence that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders. At the same time the association cautions however, that the adoption of a vegetarian diet may not necessarily lead to eating disorders, rather that \"vegetarian diets may be selected to camouflage an existing eating disorder\". Other studies and statements by dietitians and counselors support this conclusion.\n\nVegetarianism is associated with increased risk of depression, anxiety, and somatoform disorder, although causality cannot be established.\n\nVarious ethical reasons have been suggested for choosing vegetarianism, usually predicated on the interests of non-human animals. In many societies, controversy and debate have arisen over the ethics of eating animals. Some people, while not vegetarians, refuse to eat the flesh of certain animals due to cultural taboo, such as cats, dogs, horses or rabbits. Others support meat eating for scientific, nutritional and cultural reasons, including religious ones. Some meat eaters abstain from the meat of animals reared in particular ways, such as factory farms, or avoid certain meats, such as veal or foie gras. Some people follow vegetarian or vegan diets not because of moral concerns involving the raising or consumption of animals in general, but because of concerns about the specific treatment and practises involved in the raising and slaughter of animals, i.e. factory farming and the industrialisation of animal slaughter. Others still avoid meat because meat production is claimed to place a greater burden on the environment than production of an equivalent amount of plant protein.\n\nEthical objections based on consideration for animals are generally divided into opposition to the act of killing in general, and opposition to certain agricultural practices surrounding the production of meat.\n\nPrinceton University professor and animal rights activist Peter Singer believes that if alternative means of survival exist, one ought to choose the option that does not cause unnecessary harm to animals. Most ethical vegetarians argue that the same reasons exist against killing animals in the flesh to eat as against killing humans to eat. Singer, in his book \"Animal Liberation,\" listed possible qualities of sentience in non-human creatures that gave such creatures the scope to be considered under utilitarian ethics, and this has been widely referenced by animal rights campaigners and vegetarians. Ethical vegetarians also believe that killing an animal, like killing a human, can only be justified in extreme circumstances and that consuming a living creature for its enjoyable taste, convenience, or nutrition value is not a sufficient cause. Another common view is that humans are morally conscious of their behaviour in a way other animals are not, and therefore subject to higher standards.\n\nOpponents of ethical vegetarianism argue that animals are not moral equals to humans and so consider the comparison of eating livestock with killing people to be fallacious. This view does not excuse cruelty, but maintains that animals do not possess the rights a human has.\n\nOne of the main differences between a vegan and a typical vegetarian diet is the avoidance of both eggs and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter and yogurt. Ethical vegans do not consume dairy or eggs because they state that their production causes the animal suffering or a premature death.\n\nTo produce milk from dairy cattle, calves are separated from their mothers soon after birth and slaughtered or fed milk replacer in order to retain the cows milk for human consumption. Vegans state that this breaks the natural mother and calf bond. Unwanted male calves are either slaughtered at birth or sent for veal production. To prolong lactation, dairy cows are almost permanently kept pregnant through artificial insemination. After about five years, once the cows milk production has dropped, they are considered \"spent\" and sent to slaughter for beef and their hides. A dairy cow's natural life expectancy is about twenty years.\n\nIn battery cage and free-range egg production, unwanted male chicks are culled or discarded at birth during the process of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens.\n\nEthical vegetarianism has become popular in developed countries particularly because of the spread of factory farming, faster communications, and environmental consciousness. Some believe that the current mass demand for meat cannot be satisfied without a mass-production system that disregards the welfare of animals, while others believe that practices like well-managed free-ranging and consumption of game, particularly from species whose natural predators have been significantly eliminated, could substantially alleviate the demand for mass-produced meat.\n\nAncient Greek philosophy has a long tradition of vegetarianism. Pythagoras was reportedly vegetarian (and studied at Mt. Carmel, where some historians say there was a vegetarian community), as his followers were expected to be.\n\nRoman writer Ovid concluded his magnum opus Metamorphoses, in part, with the impassioned argument (uttered by the character of Pythagoras) that in order for humanity to change, or metamorphose, into a better, more harmonious species, it must strive towards more humane tendencies. He cited vegetarianism as the crucial decision in this metamorphosis, explaining his belief that human life and animal life are so entwined that to kill an animal is virtually the same as killing a fellow human.\n\nJainism teaches vegetarianism as moral conduct as do some major sects of Hinduism. Buddhism in general does not prohibit meat eating, while Mahayana Buddhism encourages vegetarianism as beneficial for developing compassion. Other denominations that advocate a vegetarian diet include the Seventh-day Adventists, the Rastafari movement, the Ananda Marga movement and the Hare Krishnas. Sikhism does not equate spirituality with diet and does not specify a vegetarian or meat diet.\n\nWhile there are no dietary restrictions in the Bahá'í Faith, `Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the religion's founder, noted that a vegetarian diet consisting of fruits and grains was desirable, except for people with a weak constitution or those that are sick. He stated that there are no requirements that Bahá'ís become vegetarian, but that a future society should gradually become vegetarian. `Abdu'l-Bahá also stated that killing animals was contrary to compassion. While Shoghi Effendi, the head of the Bahá'í Faith in the first half of the 20th century, stated that a purely vegetarian diet would be preferable since it avoided killing animals, both he and the Universal House of Justice, the governing body of the Bahá'ís have stated that these teachings do not constitute a Bahá'í practice and that Bahá'ís can choose to eat whatever they wish but should be respectful of others' beliefs.\n\nTheravadins in general eat meat. If Buddhist monks \"see, hear or know\" a living animal was killed specifically for them to eat, they must refuse it or else incur an offense. However, this does not include eating meat which was given as alms or commercially purchased. In the Theravada canon, Buddha did not make any comment discouraging them from eating meat (except specific types, such as human, elephant meat, horse, dog, snake, lion, tiger, leopard, bear, and hyena flesh) but he specifically refused to institute vegetarianism in his monastic code when a suggestion had been made.\n\nIn several Sanskrit texts of Mahayana Buddhism, Buddha instructs his followers to avoid meat. However, each branch of Mahayana Buddhism selects which sutra to follow, and some branches, including the majority of Tibetan and Japanese Buddhists, do eat meat, while many Chinese Buddhist branches do not.\n\nChristians have always been free to make their own decisions about what to eat; however, there are groups within Christianity that practice specific dietary restrictions for various reasons. The early sect known as the Ebionites are considered to have practiced vegetarianism. Surviving fragments from their Gospel indicate their belief that – as Christ is the Passover sacrifice and eating the Passover lamb is no longer required – a vegetarian diet may (or should) be observed. However, orthodox Christianity does not accept their teaching as authentic. Indeed, their specific injunction to strict vegetarianism was cited as one of the Ebionites' \"errors\".\n\nAt a much later time, the Bible Christian Church founded by Reverend William Cowherd in 1809 followed a vegetarian diet. Cowherd was one of the philosophical forerunners of the Vegetarian Society. Cowherd encouraged members to abstain from eating of meat as a form of temperance.\n\nSeventh-day Adventists are encouraged to engage in healthy eating practices, and ova-lacto-vegetarian diets are recommended by the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists Nutrition Council (GCNC). They have also sponsored and participated in many scientific studies exploring the impact of dietary decisions upon health outcomes. The GCNC has in addition adapted the USDA's food pyramid for a vegetarian dietary approach. However, the only kinds of meat specifically frowned upon by the SDA health message are unclean meats, or those forbidden in scripture.\n\nAdditionally, some monastic orders follow a vegetarian diet, and members of the Orthodox Church follow a vegan diet during fasts. There is also a strong association between the Quakers and vegetarianism dating back at least to the 18th century. The association grew in prominence during the 19th century, coupled with growing Quaker concerns in connection with alcohol consumption, anti-vivisection and social purity. The association between the Quaker tradition and vegetarianism, however, becomes most significant with the founding of the Friends' Vegetarian Society in 1902 \"to spread a kindlier way of living amongst the Society of Friends.\"\n\nAccording to Canon Law, Roman Catholics are required to abstain from meat (defined as all animal flesh excluding water animals) on Ash Wednesday and all Fridays of Lent including Good Friday. Canon Law also obliges Catholics to abstain from meat on the Fridays of the year outside of Lent (excluding certain holy days) unless, with the permission of the local conference of bishops, another penitential act is substituted. The restrictions on eating meat on these days is solely as an act of penance and not because of a religious objection to eating meat.\n\nSince the formation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in the 1860s when the church began, wholeness and health have been an emphasis of the Adventist church, and has been known as the \"health message\" belief of the church. Adventists are well known for presenting a health message that recommends vegetarianism and expects adherence to the kosher laws in . Obedience to these laws means abstinence from pork, shellfish, and other animals proscribed as \"unclean\". The church discourages its members from consuming alcoholic beverages, tobacco or illegal drugs (compare Christianity and alcohol). In addition, some Adventists avoid coffee, tea, cola, and other beverages containing caffeine.\nThe pioneers of the Adventist Church had much to do with the common acceptance of breakfast cereals into the Western diet, and the \"modern commercial concept of cereal food\" originated among Adventists. John Harvey Kellogg was one of the early founders of Adventist health work. His development of breakfast cereals as a health food led to the founding of Kellogg's by his brother William. In both Australia and New Zealand, the church-owned Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company is a leading manufacturer of health and vegetarian-related products, most prominently Weet-Bix.\n\nResearch funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health has shown that the average Adventist in California lives 4 to 10 years longer than the average Californian. The research, as cited by the cover story of the November 2005 issue of \"National Geographic\", asserts that Adventists live longer because they do not smoke or drink alcohol, have a day of rest every week, and maintain a healthy, low-fat vegetarian diet that is rich in nuts and beans. The cohesiveness of Adventists' social networks has also been put forward as an explanation for their extended lifespan.\nSince Dan Buettner's 2005 \"National Geographic\" story about Adventist longevity, his book, \"The Blue Zones: Lessons for Living Longer From the People Who've Lived the Longest\", named Loma Linda, California a \"blue zone\" because of the large concentration of Seventh-day Adventists. He cites the Adventist emphasis on health, diet, and Sabbath-keeping as primary factors for Adventist longevity.\n\nAn estimated 35% of Adventists practice vegetarianism or veganism, according to a 2002 worldwide survey of local church leaders.\n\nThough there is no strict rule on what to consume and what not to, paths of Hinduism hold vegetarianism as an ideal. Some reasons are: the principle of nonviolence (ahimsa) applied to animals; the intention to offer only \"pure\" (vegetarian) food to a deity and then to receive it back as prasad; and the conviction that a sentient diet is beneficial for a healthy body and mind and that non-vegetarian food is not recommended for a better mind and for spiritual development.\n\nHowever, the food habits of Hindus vary according to their community, location, custom and varying traditions. Historically and currently, those Hindus who eat meat prescribe Jhatka meat, while some Hindus believe that the cow is a holy animal whose slaughter for meat is forbidden. This belief varies according to region.\n\nSome followers of Islam, or Muslims, chose to be vegetarian for health, ethical, or personal reasons. However, the choice to become vegetarian for non-medical reasons can sometimes be controversial due to conflicting fatwas and differing interpretations of the Quran. Though some more traditional Muslims may keep quiet about their vegetarian diet, the number of vegetarian Muslims is increasing.\n\nVegetarianism has been practiced by some influential Muslims including the Iraqi theologian, female mystic and poet Râbi‘ah al-‘Adawîyah of Basrah, who died in the year 801, and the Sri Lankan Sufi master Bawa Muhaiyaddeen who established The Bawa Muhaiyaddeen Fellowship of North America in Philadelphia. The former Indian president Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was also famously a vegetarian.\n\nIn January 1996, The International Vegetarian Union announced the formation of the Muslim Vegetarian/Vegan Society.\n\nMany non-vegetarian Muslims will select vegetarian (or seafood) options when dining in non-halal restaurants. However, this is a matter of not having the right kind of meat rather than preferring not to eat meat on the whole.\n\nFollowers of Jainism believe that all living organisms whether they are micro-organism are living and have a soul, and have one or more senses out of five senses and they go to great lengths to minimise any harm to any living organism. Most Jains are lacto-vegetarians but more devout Jains do not eat root vegetables because they believe that root vegetables contain a lot more micro-organisms as compared to other vegetables, and that, by eating them, violence of these micro-organisms is inevitable. So they focus on eating beans and fruits, whose cultivation do not involve killing of a lot of micro-organisms. No products obtained from dead animals are allowed, because when a living beings dies, a lot of micro-organisms (called as decomposers) will reproduce in the body which decomposes the body, and in eating the dead bodies, violence of decomposers is inevitable. Jain monks usually do a lot of fasting, and when they knew through spiritual powers that their life is very little, they start fasting until death. Some particularly dedicated individuals are fruitarians. Honey is forbidden, because honey is the regurgitation of nectar by bees and may also contain eggs, excreta and dead bees. Some Jains do not consume plant parts that grow underground such as roots and bulbs, because the plants themselves and tiny animals may be killed when the plants are pulled up.\n\nWhile it is neither required (required only on special holidays [Pessach, Sukot and Shavuot] according to some traditions, but not on Shabbat [Friday], when just bread and wine/grape juice is required) nor prohibited for Jews to eat meat, a number of medieval scholars of Jewish religion (e.g., Joseph Albo and Isaac Arama) regard vegetarianism as a moral ideal, not just because of a concern for the welfare of animals, but because the slaughter of animals might cause the individual who performs such acts to develop negative character traits. One modern-day scholar who is in favour of vegetarianism is the late Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, the Chief Rabbi of Mandate Palestine. In his writings, Rabbi Kook speaks of vegetarianism as an ideal, and points to the fact that Adam did not partake of the flesh of animals, as all humans and animals were originally commanded by God to only eat plants. In context, Rabbi Kook makes those comments in his portrayal of the eschatological (messianic) era. However, he personally refrained from eating meat except on the Sabbath and Festivals, and one of his leading disciples, Rabbi David Cohen, known as the \"Nazirite\" of Jerusalem, was a devout vegetarian. Several other members of Rabbi Kook's circle were also vegetarians.\n\nAccording to some Kabbalists, only a mystic, who is able to sense and elevate the reincarnated human souls and \"divine sparks\", is permitted to consume meat, though eating the flesh of an animal might still cause spiritual damage to the soul. A number of Orthodox Jewish vegetarian groups and activists promote such ideas and believe that the halakhic permission to eat meat is a temporary leniency for those who are not ready yet to accept the vegetarian diet. Jewish law also commands people to ritually slaughter animals when killing them, and goes into precise detail on the rituals of both animal sacrifice and ordinary slaughter (shechita). According to medieval sage Rabbi Shlomo Ephraim Luntschitz, author of the Torah commentary Kli Yakar, the complexity of these laws was intended to discourage the consumption of meat and make it less painful for the animals.\n\nAccording to (Genesis 1:29-30), consumption of meat was banned. After the Great Flood, Noah was given permission to consume meat:\n\n\"Behold, I have given to you all herbage-yielding seed that is on the surface of the earth, and every tree that has seed-yielding fruit; it shall be yours for food. And to every beast of the earth, to every bird of the sky, and to everything that moves on the earth, within which there is a living soul, every green herb is for food.\" (Genesis 1:29-30)\n\nWithin the Afro-Caribbean community, a minority are Rastafari and follow the dietary regulations with varying degrees of strictness. The most orthodox eat only \"Ital\" or natural foods, in which the matching of herbs or spices with vegetables is the result of long tradition originating from the African ancestry and cultural heritage of Rastafari. \"Ital\", which is derived from the word vital, means essential to human existence. Ital cooking in its strictest form prohibits the use of salt, meat (especially pork), preservatives, colorings, flavorings and anything artificial. Most Rastafari are vegetarian.\n\nThe tenets of Sikhism do not advocate a particular stance on either vegetarianism or the consumption of meat, but leave the decision of diet to the individual. The tenth guru, Guru Gobind Singh, however, prohibited \"Amritdhari\" Sikhs, or those that follow the Sikh Rehat Maryada (the Official Sikh Code of Conduct) from eating Kutha meat, or meat which has been obtained from animals which have been killed in a ritualistic way. This is understood to have been for the political reason of maintaining independence from the then-new Muslim hegemony, as Muslims largely adhere to the ritualistic halal diet.\n\n\"Amritdharis\" that belong to some Sikh sects (e.g. Akhand Kirtani Jatha, Damdami Taksal, Namdhari and Rarionwalay, etc.) are vehemently against the consumption of meat and eggs (though they do consume and encourage the consumption of milk, butter and cheese). This vegetarian stance has been traced back to the times of the British Raj, with the advent of many new Vaishnava converts. In response to the varying views on diet throughout the Sikh population, Sikh Gurus have sought to clarify the Sikh view on diet, stressing their preference only for simplicity of diet. Guru Nanak said that over-consumption of food (Lobh, Greed) involves a drain on the Earth's resources and thus on life. Passages from the \"Guru Granth Sahib\" (the holy book of Sikhs, also known as the \"Adi Granth\") say that it is \"foolish\" to argue for the superiority of animal life, because though all life is related, only human life carries more importance: \"Only fools argue whether to eat meat or not. Who can define what is meat and what is not meat? Who knows where the sin lies, being a vegetarian or a non-vegetarian?\" The Sikh langar, or free temple meal, is largely lacto-vegetarian, though this is understood to be a result of efforts to present a meal that is respectful of the diets of any person who would wish to dine, rather than out of dogma.\n\nEnvironmental vegetarianism is based on the concern that the production of meat and animal products for mass consumption, especially through factory farming, is environmentally unsustainable. According to a 2006 United Nations initiative, the livestock industry is one of the largest contributors to environmental degradation worldwide, and modern practices of raising animals for food contribute on a \"massive scale\" to air and water pollution, land degradation, climate change, and loss of biodiversity. The initiative concluded that \"the livestock sector emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global.\"\n\nIn addition, animal agriculture is a large source of greenhouse gases. According to a 2006 report it is responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as estimated in 100-year CO equivalents. Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents. This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents.\n\nMeat produced in a laboratory (called in vitro meat) may be more environmentally sustainable than regularly produced meat. Reactions of vegetarians vary. Rearing a relatively small number of grazing animals can be beneficial, as the Food Climate Research Network at Surrey University reports: \"A little bit of livestock production is probably a good thing for the environment.\n\nIn May 2009, Ghent, Belgium, was reported to be \"the first [city] in the world to go vegetarian at least once a week\" for environmental reasons, when local authorities decided to implement a \"weekly meatless day\". Civil servants would eat vegetarian meals one day per week, in recognition of the United Nations' report. Posters were put up by local authorities to encourage the population to take part on vegetarian days, and \"veggie street maps\" were printed to highlight vegetarian restaurants. In September 2009, schools in Ghent are due to have a weekly \"veggiedag\" (\"vegetarian day\") too.\n\nSome groups, such as PETA, promote vegetarianism as a way to offset poor treatment and working conditions of workers in the contemporary meat industry. These groups cite studies showing the psychological damage caused by working in the meat industry, especially in factory and industrialised settings, and argue that the meat industry violates its labourers' human rights by assigning difficult and distressing tasks without adequate counselling, training and debriefing. However, the working conditions of agricultural workers as a whole, particularly non-permanent workers, remain poor and well below conditions prevailing in other economic sectors. Accidents, including pesticide poisoning, among farmers and plantation workers contribute to increased health risks, including increased mortality. According to the International Labour Organization, agriculture is one of the three most dangerous jobs in the world.\n\nSimilar to environmental vegetarianism is the concept of economic vegetarianism. An economic vegetarian is someone who practices vegetarianism from either the philosophical viewpoint concerning issues such as public health and curbing world starvation, the belief that the consumption of meat is economically unsound, part of a conscious simple living strategy or just out of necessity. According to the Worldwatch Institute, \"Massive reductions in meat consumption in industrial nations will ease their health care burden while improving public health; declining livestock herds will take pressure off rangelands and grainlands, allowing the agricultural resource base to rejuvenate. As populations grow, lowering meat consumption worldwide will allow more efficient use of declining per capita land and water resources, while at the same time making grain more affordable to the world's chronically hungry.\"\n\nPrejudice researcher Gordon Hodson observes that vegetarians and vegans frequently face discrimination where eating meat is held as a cultural norm.\n\nA 1992 market research study conducted by the Yankelovich research organisation concluded that \"of the 12.4 million people [in the US] who call themselves vegetarian, 68% are female, while only 32% are male\".\n\nAt least one study indicates that vegetarian women are more likely to have female babies. A study of 6,000 pregnant women in 1998 \"found that while the national average in Britain is 106 boys born to every 100 girls, for vegetarian mothers the ratio was just 85 boys to 100 girls\". Catherine Collins of the British Dietetic Association has dismissed this as a \"statistical fluke\" given that it is actually the male's genetic contribution which determines the sex of a baby.\n\n\n\n"

                "Reception history of Jane Austen\n\nThe reception history of Jane Austen follows a path from modest fame to wild popularity. Jane Austen (1775–1817), the author of such works as \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813) and \"Emma\" (1815), has become one of the best-known and most widely read novelists in the English language. Her novels are the subject of intense scholarly study and the centre of a diverse fan culture.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Austen's novels brought her little personal fame. Like many women writers, she chose to publish anonymously, but her authorship was an open secret. At the time they were published, Austen's works were considered fashionable but received only a few reviews, albeit positive. By the mid-19th century, her novels were admired by members of the literary elite who viewed their appreciation of her works as a mark of cultivation, but they were also being recommended in the popular education movement and on school reading lists as early as 1838. The first illustrated edition of her works appeared in 1833, in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, which put her titles before thousands of readers across the Victorian period.\n\nThe publication in 1870 of her nephew's \"Memoir of Jane Austen\" introduced her to a wider public as an appealing personality—dear aunt Jane—and her works were republished in popular editions. By the start of the 20th century, competing groups had sprung up—some to worship her and some to defend her from the \"teeming masses\"—but all claiming to be the true Janeites, or those who properly appreciated Austen. The \"teeming masses,\" meanwhile, were creating their own ways of honoring Austen, including in amateur theatricals in drawing rooms, schools, and community groups.\n\nIn 1923, the publisher and scholar R. W. Chapman prepared a carefully edited collection of her works—which some have claimed is the first serious scholarly treatment given to any British novelist. By mid-century, Austen was widely accepted in academia as a great English novelist. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship, which explored numerous aspects of her works: artistic, ideological, and historical.\n\nWith the growing professionalisation of university English departments in the second half of the 20th century, criticism of Austen became more theoretical and specialized, as did literary studies in general. As a result, commentary on Austen sometimes seemed to imagine itself as divided into high culture and popular culture branches. In the mid- to late 20th century, fans founded Jane Austen societies and clubs to celebrate the author, her time, and her works.\n\nAs of the early 21st century, Austen fandom supports an industry of printed sequels and prequels as well as television and film adaptations, which started with the 1940 \"Pride and Prejudice\" and evolved to include the 2004 Bollywood-style production \"Bride and Prejudice\".\n\nJane Austen lived her entire life as part of a large and close-knit family on the lower fringes of the English gentry. Her family's steadfast support was critical to Austen's development as a professional writer. Austen read draft versions of all of her novels to her family, receiving feedback and encouragement, and it was her father who sent out her first publication bid. Austen's artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. With the release of \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1811), \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813), \"Mansfield Park\" (1814) and \"Emma\" (1815), she achieved success as a published writer.\n\nNovel-writing was a suspect occupation for women in the early 19th century, because it imperiled their social reputation by bringing them publicity, viewed as unfeminine. Therefore, like many other female writers, Austen published anonymously. Eventually, though, her novels' authorship became an open secret among the aristocracy. During one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her, through his librarian, James Stanier Clarke, to view his library at Carlton House; his librarian mentioned that the Regent admired her novels and that \"if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to dedicate it to the Prince\". Austen, who disapproved of the prince's extravagant lifestyle, did not want to follow this suggestion, but her friends convinced her otherwise: in short order, \"Emma\" was dedicated to him. Austen turned down the librarian's further hint to write a historical romance in honour of the prince's daughter's marriage.\n\nIn the last year of her life, Austen revised \"Northanger Abbey\" (1817), wrote \"Persuasion\" (1817), and began another novel, eventually titled \"Sanditon\", which was left unfinished at her death. Austen did not have time to see \"Northanger Abbey\" or \"Persuasion\" through the press, but her family published them as one volume after her death and her brother Henry included a \"Biographical Notice of the Author\". This short biography sowed the seeds for the myth of Austen as a quiet, retiring aunt who wrote during her spare time: \"Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives ... [S]o much did she shrink from notoriety, that no accumulation of fame would have induced her, had she lived, to affix her name to any productions of her public she turned away from any allusion to the character of an authoress.\" However, this description is in direct contrast to the excitement Austen shows in her letters regarding publication and profit: Austen was a professional writer.\n\nAusten's works are noted for their realism, biting social commentary, and masterful use of free indirect speech, burlesque and irony. They critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. As Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert explain, Austen makes fun of \"such novelistic clichés as love at first sight, the primacy of passion over all other emotions and/or duties, the chivalric exploits of the hero, the vulnerable sensitivity of the heroine, the lovers' proclaimed indifference to financial considerations, and the cruel crudity of parents\". Austen's plots, though comic, highlight the way women of the gentry depended on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Like the writings of Samuel Johnson, a strong influence on her, her works are fundamentally concerned with moral issues.\n\nAusten's novels quickly became fashionable among opinion-makers, namely, those aristocrats who often dictated fashion and taste. Lady Bessborough, sister to the notorious Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, commented on \"Sense and Sensibility\" in a letter to a friend: \"it is a clever novel.  ... tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it.\" The fifteen-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, Princess Charlotte Augusta, compared herself to one of the book's heroines: \"I think Marianne & me are very like in \"disposition\", that certainly I am not so good, the same imprudence, &tc\".\n\nAfter reading \"Pride and Prejudice\", playwright Richard Sheridan advised a friend to \"[b]uy it immediately\" for it \"was one of the cleverest things\" he had ever read. Anne Milbanke, future wife of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, wrote that \"I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice, which I think a very superior work.\" She commented that the novel \"is the most \"probable\" fiction I have ever read\" and had become \"at present the fashionable novel\". The Dowager Lady Vernon told a friend that \"Mansfield Park\" was \"[n]ot much of a novel, more the history of a family party in the country, very natural\"—as if, comments one Austen scholar, \"Lady Vernon's parties mostly featured adultery.\" Lady Anne Romilly told her friend, the novelist Maria Edgeworth, that \"[\"Mansfield Park\"] has been pretty generally admired here\" and Edgeworth commented later that \"we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park\".\n\nDespite these positive reactions from the elite, Austen's novels received relatively few reviews during her lifetime: two for \"Sense and Sensibility\", three for \"Pride and Prejudice\", none for \"Mansfield Park\", and seven for \"Emma\". Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels. Moreover, as Brian Southam, who has edited the definitive volumes on Austen's reception, writes in his description of these reviewers, \"their job was merely to provide brief notices, extended with quotations, for the benefit of women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral\". This was not atypical critical treatment for novels in Austen's day.\n\nAsked by publisher John Murray to review \"Emma\", famed historical novelist Walter Scott wrote the longest and most thoughtful of these reviews, which was published anonymously in the March 1816 issue of the \"Quarterly Review\". Using the review as a platform from which to defend the then disreputable genre of the novel, Scott praised Austen's works, celebrating her ability to copy \"from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\". Modern Austen scholar William Galperin has noted that \"unlike some of Austen's lay readers, who recognized her divergence from realistic practice as it had been prescribed and defined at the time, Walter Scott may well have been the first to install Austen as the realist par excellence\". Scott wrote in his private journal in 1826, in what later became a widely quoted comparison:\n\n\"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", published together posthumously in December 1817, were reviewed in the \"British Critic\" in March 1818 and in the \"Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany\" in May 1818. The reviewer for the \"British Critic\" felt that Austen's exclusive dependence on realism was evidence of a deficient imagination. The reviewer for the \"Edinburgh Review\" disagreed, praising Austen for her \"exhaustless invention\" and the combination of the familiar and the surprising in her plots. Overall, Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her novels—for example, they misunderstood her use of irony. Reviewers reduced \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\" to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice.\n\nIn the \"Quarterly Review\" in 1821, the English writer and theologian Richard Whately published the most serious and enthusiastic early posthumous review of Austen's work. Whately drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, praising the dramatic qualities of her narrative. He also affirmed the respectability and legitimacy of the novel as a genre, arguing that imaginative literature, especially narrative, was more valuable than history or biography. When it was properly done, as in Austen, Whately said, imaginative literature concerned itself with generalised human experience from which the reader could gain important insights into human nature; in other words, it was moral. Whately also addressed Austen's position as a female writer, writing: \"we suspect one of Miss Austin's great merits in our eyes to be, the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female heroines are what one knows women must be, though one never can get them to acknowledge it.\" No more significant, original Austen criticism was published until the late 19th century: Whately and Scott had set the tone for the Victorian era's view of Austen.\n\nAusten had many admiring readers during the 19th century, who, according to critic Ian Watt, appreciated her \" to ordinary social experience\". However, Austen's novels did not conform to certain strong Romantic and Victorian British preferences, which required that \"powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing\". Victorian critics and audiences were drawn to the work of authors such as Charles Dickens and George Eliot; by comparison, Austen's novels seemed provincial and quiet. Although Austen's works were republished beginning in late 1832 or early 1833 by Richard Bentley in the \"Standard Novels\" series, and remained in print continuously thereafter, they were not best-sellers. Southam describes her \"reading public between 1821 and 1870\" as \"minute beside the known audience for Dickens and his contemporaries\".\n\nThose who did read Austen saw themselves as discriminating readers—they were a cultured few. This became a common theme of Austen criticism during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes articulated this theme in a series of enthusiastic articles in the 1840s and 1850s. In \"The Novels of Jane Austen\", published anonymously in \"Blackwood's Magazine\" in 1859, Lewes praised Austen's novels for \"the economy of easy adaptation of means to ends, with no aid from superfluous elements\" and compared her to Shakespeare. Arguing that Austen lacked the ability to construct a plot, he still celebrated her dramatisations: \"The reader's pulse never throbs, his curiosity is never intense; but his interest never wanes for a moment. The action begins; the people speak, feel, and act; everything that is said, felt, or done tends towards the entanglement or disentanglement of the plot; and we are almost made actors as well as spectators of the little drama.\"\n\nReacting against Lewes's essays and his personal communications with her, novelist Charlotte Brontë admired Austen's fidelity to everyday life but described her as \"only shrewd and observant\" and criticised the absence of visible passion in her work. To Brontë, Austen's work appeared formal and constrained, \"a carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but no glance of bright vivid physiognomy, no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck\".\n\nAusten's novels appeared in some European countries soon after their publication in Britain, beginning in 1813 with a French translation of \"Pride and Prejudice\", quickly followed by German, Danish, and Swedish editions. Their availability in Europe was not universal. Austen was not well known in Russia and the first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967. Despite the fact that Austen's novels were translated into many European languages, Europeans did not recognise her works as part of the English novel tradition. This perception was reinforced by the changes made by translators who injected sentimentalism into Austen's novels and eliminated their humour and irony. European readers therefore more readily associated Walter Scott's style with the English novel.\n\nBecause of the significant changes made by her translators, Austen was received as a different kind of novelist in continental Europe than in Britain. For example, the French novelist Isabelle de Montolieu translated several of Austen's novels into a genre in which Montolieu herself wrote: the French sentimental novel. In Montolieu's \"Pride and Prejudice\", for example, vivacious conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy were replaced by decorous ones. Elizabeth's claim that she has \"always seen a great similarity in the turn of [their] minds\" (her and Darcy's) because they are \"unwilling to speak, unless [they] expect to say something that will amaze the whole room\" becomes \"Moi, je garde le silence, parce que je ne sais que dire, et vous, parce que vous aiguisez vos traits pour parler avec effet.\" (\"Me, I keep silent, because I don't know what to say, and you, because you excite your features for effect when speaking.\") As Cossy and Saglia explain in their essay on Austen translations, \"the equality of mind which Elizabeth takes for granted is denied and gender distinction introduced\". Because Austen's works were seen in France as part of a sentimental tradition, they were overshadowed by the works of French realists such as Stendhal, Balzac, and Flaubert. German translations and reviews of those translations also placed Austen in a line of sentimental writers, particularly late Romantic women writers.\n\nA study of other important dimensions of the French translations, such as free indirect discourse (FID) do much to nuance our understanding of Austen's initial \"aesthetic\" reception with her first French readership. Austen uses a narrative technique known as free indirect discourse (FID) to represent Anne Elliot's consciousness in \"Persuasion\". Indeed, the portrayal of the heroine's subjective experience is central to its narration. The frequent use of FID imbues \"Perusasion\"'s narrative discourse with a high degree of subtlety, placing a huge burden of interpretation on Austen's first translators. Recent studies demonstrate that FID from \"Persuasion\" was translated extensively in Montolieu's \"La Famille Elliot\". Indeed, Montolieu was aware of the propensity of Austen's narrator to delve into the heroine's psychology in \"Persuasion\" as she comments on this in the preface to \"La Famille Elliot\". She characterises it as \"almost imperceptible, delicate nuances that come from the heart\": \"des nuances délicates presque imperceptibles qui partent du fond du cœur, et dont miss JANE AUSTEN avait le secret plus qu'aucun autre romancier\". Montolieu's extensive translations of Austen's FID demonstrate that she was in fact one of Austen's first critical readers, whose own finely nuanced reading of Austen's narrative technique meant that her first French readers could also share in Anne Elliot's psychological drama in much the same way that her English readership could.\n\nFor decades, Scott's and Whately's opinions dominated the reception of Austen's works and few people read her novels. In 1869, this changed with the publication of the first significant Austen biography, \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\", which was written by Jane Austen's nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh. With its release, Austen's popularity and critical standing increased dramatically. Readers of the \"Memoir\" were presented with the myth of the amateur novelist who wrote masterpieces: the \"Memoir\" fixed in the public mind a sentimental picture of Austen as a quiet, middle-aged maiden aunt and reassured them that her work was suitable for a respectable Victorian family. James Edward Austen-Leigh had a portrait of Jane Austen painted, based on the earlier watercolour, softening her image and making her presentable to the Victorian public. The engraving by Bentley which formed the frontispiece of \"Memoir\" is based on the idealised image.\n\nThe publication of the \"Memoir\" spurred a major reissue of Austen's novels. The first popular editions were released in 1883—a cheap sixpenny series published by Routledge. This was followed by a proliferation of elaborate illustrated editions, collectors' sets, and scholarly editions. However, contemporary critics continued to assert that her works were sophisticated and only appropriate for those who could truly plumb their depths. Yet, after the publication of the \"Memoir\", more criticism was published on Austen's novels in two years than had appeared in the previous fifty.\n\nIn 1913, William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, descendants of the Austen family, published the definitive family biography, \"Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters—A Family Record\". Based primarily on family papers and letters, it is described by Austen biographer Park Honan as \"accurate, staid, reliable, and at times vivid and suggestive\". Although the authors moved away from the sentimental tone of the \"Memoir\", they made little effort to go beyond the family records and traditions immediately available to them. Their book therefore offers bare facts and little in the way of interpretation.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century, the first books of critical analysis regarding Austen's works were published. In 1890 Godwin Smith published the \"Life of Jane Austen\", initiating a \"fresh phase in the critical heritage\", in which Austen reviewers became critics. This launched the beginning of \"formal criticism\", that is, a focus on Austen as a writer and an analysis of the techniques that made her writing unique. According to Southam, while Austen criticism increased in amount and, to some degree, in quality after 1870, \"a certain uniformity\" pervaded it:\n\nAmong the most astute of these critics were Richard Simpson, Margaret Oliphant, and Leslie Stephen. In a review of the \"Memoir\", Simpson described Austen as a serious yet ironic critic of English society. He introduced two interpretative themes which later became the basis for modern literary criticism of Austen's works: humour as social critique and irony as a means of moral evaluation. Continuing Lewes's comparison to Shakespeare, Simpson wrote that Austen:\n\nSimpson's essay was not well known and did not become influential until Lionel Trilling quoted it in 1957. Another prominent writer whose Austen criticism was ignored, novelist Margaret Oliphant, described Austen in almost proto-feminist terms, as \"armed with a 'fine vein of feminine cynicism,' 'full of subtle power, keenness, finesse, and self-restraint,' blessed with an 'exquisite sense' of the 'ridiculous,' 'a fine stinging yet soft-voiced contempt,' whose novels are 'so calm and cold and keen'\". This line of criticism would not be fully explored until the 1970s with the rise of feminist literary criticism.\n\nAlthough Austen's novels had been published in the United States since 1832, albeit in bowdlerised editions, it was not until after 1870 that there was a distinctive American response to Austen. As Southam explains, \"for American literary nationalists Jane Austen's cultivated scene was too pallid, too constrained, too refined, too downright unheroic\". Austen was not democratic enough for American tastes and her canvas did not extend to the frontier themes that had come to define American literature. By the start of the 20th century, the American response was represented by the debate between the American novelist and critic William Dean Howells and the writer and humourist Mark Twain. In a series of essays, Howells helped make Austen into a canonical figure for the populace whereas Twain used Austen to argue against the Anglophile tradition in America. That is, Twain argued for the distinctiveness of American literature by attacking English literature. In his book \"Following the Equator\", Twain described the library on his ship: \"Jane Austen's absent from this library. Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn't a book in it.\"\n\nThe \"Encyclopædia Britannica's\" changing entries on Austen illustrate her increasing popularity and status. The eighth edition (1854) described her as \"an elegant novelist\" while the ninth edition (1875) lauded her as \"one of the most distinguished modern British novelists\". Around the start of the 20th century, Austen novels began to be studied at universities and appear in histories of the English novel. The image of her that dominated the popular imagination was still that first presented in the \"Memoir\" and made famous by Howells in his series of essays in \"Harper's Magazine\", that of \"dear aunt Jane\". Author and critic Leslie Stephen described a mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\"—it was only after the publication of the \"Memoir\" that readers developed a personal connection with Austen. However, around 1900, members of the literary elite, who had claimed an appreciation of Austen as a mark of culture, reacted against this popularisation of her work. They referred to themselves as \"Janeites\" to distinguish themselves from the masses who, in their view, did not properly understand Austen.\n\nAmerican novelist Henry James, one member of this literary elite, referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as among \"the fine painters of life\". But, James thought Austen an \"unconscious\" artist whom he described as \"instinctive and charming\". In 1905, James responded frustratingly to what he described as \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's \"intrinsic merit and interest\". James attributed this rise principally to \"the stiff breeze of the special bookselling body of publishers, editors, illustrators, producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines; who have found their 'dear,' our dear, everybody's dear, Jane so infinitely to their material purpose, so amenable to pretty reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful, and in what seemingly proves to be salable, form.\"\n\nIn an effort to avoid the sentimental image of the \"Aunt Jane\" tradition and approach Austen's fiction from a fresh perspective, in 1917 British intellectual and travel writer Reginald Farrer published a lengthy essay in the \"Quarterly Review\" which Austen scholar A. Walton Litz calls the best single introduction to her fiction. Southam describes it as a \"Janeite\" piece without the worship. Farrer denied that Austen's artistry was unconscious (contradicting James) and described her as a writer of intense concentration and a severe critic of her society, \"radiant and remorseless\", \"dispassionate yet pitiless\", with \"the steely quality, the incurable rigor of her judgment\". Farrer was one of the first critics who viewed Austen as a subversive writer.\n\nSeveral important early works—glimmers of brilliant Austen scholarship—paved the way for Austen to become solidly entrenched within the academy. The first was Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley's 1911 essay, \"generally regarded as the starting-point for the serious academic approach to Jane Austen\". Bradley emphasised Austen's ties to 18th-century critic and writer Samuel Johnson, arguing that she was a moralist as well as humourist; in this he was \"totally original\", according to Southam. Bradley divided Austen's works into \"early\" and \"late\" novels, categories still used by scholars. The second path-breaking early-20th-century critic of Austen was R. W. Chapman, whose magisterial edition of Austen's collected works was the first scholarly edition of the works of any English novelist. The Chapman texts have remained the basis for all subsequent editions of Austen's works.\n\nIn the wake of Bradley and Chapman's contributions, the 1920s saw a boom in Austen scholarship, and the novelist E. M. Forster primarily illustrated his concept of the \"round\" character by citing Austen's works. It was with the 1939 publication of Mary Lascelles' \"Jane Austen and Her Art\"—\"the first full-scale historical and scholarly study\" of Austen—that the academic study of her works matured. Lascelles included a short biographical essay; an innovative analysis of the books Austen read and their effect on her writing; and an extended analysis of Austen's style and her \"narrative art\". Lascelles felt that prior critics had all worked on a scale \"so small that the reader does not see how they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them\". She wished to examine all Austen's works together and to subject her style and techniques to methodical analysis. Lascelles praised Austen for her \"shallow modelling\" of her characters, giving them distinctive voices yet making certain it was clear they all belonged to the same class. Subsequent critics agree that she succeeded. Like Bradley earlier, she emphasised Austen's connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction. However, at the time some fans of Austen worried that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric—a debate that continued into the 21st century.\nIn an outpouring of mid-century revisionist views, scholars approached Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, following and expanding upon Farrer, argued in his essay \"Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen\" that Austen's novels did not support the \"status quo\" but rather subverted it. Her irony was not humorous but caustic and intended to undermine the assumptions of the society she portrayed. Through her use of irony, Austen attempted to protect her integrity as an artist and a person in the face of attitudes and practices she rejected. In his 1940 essay, Harding argued that Austen had to be rescued from the Janites, charging \"her books are, as she meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people she disliked...\". Harding argued the Janites regarded Regency England as \"expressing the gentler virtue of a civilised social order\" that was an escape from the waking nightmare of a world at war, but he argued that its own sort of way that the world of Austen's novels was nightmarish, where the government maintained a system of spies to crush any sympathy with the French Revolution, where friends take delight in causing others pain, where the polite language is usually a facade, and where intelligence in single woman is seen as a problem. Harding maintained that the problem with the Janites was that they could not grasp these aspects of Austen's works. Almost simultaneously, influential critic Q. D. Leavis argued in \"Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing\", published in \"Scrutiny\" in the early 1940s, that Austen was a professional, not an amateur, writer. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by another revisionist treatment by Marvin Mudrick in \"Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery\" (1952). Mudrick portrayed Austen as isolated, defensive, and critical of her society, and described in detail the relationship he saw between Austen's attitude toward contemporary literature and her use of irony as a technique to contrast the realities of her society with what she felt they should be. These revisionist views, together with prominent critic F. R. Leavis's pronouncement in \"The Great Tradition\" (1948) that Austen was one of the great writers of English fiction, a view shared by Ian Watt, who helped shape the scholarly debate regarding the genre of the novel, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics. They agreed that she \"combined <nowiki>[</nowiki>Henry Fielding's and Samuel Richardson's<nowiki>]</nowiki> qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".\n\nThe period after the Second World War saw a flowering of scholarship on Austen as well as a diversity of critical approaches. One school that emerged in the United States was the New Criticism, which saw literary texts in only aesthetic terms, an object of beauty to be appreciated in and of itself without no study of the individual that had produced it or the society that she lived in. The New Critics tended to praise Austen for her literacy skills at combining irony and paradox, but other critics argued that the New Criticism by only focusing on the aesthetic qualities of the books ignored the message of the books and Austen herself, who was reduced down to merely being the mere scribe who produced these books that they admired so much. More typical of the post-1945 scholarship Marvin Mudrick's 1952 book \"Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery\", where he argued that Austen used irony as a way of deflating conventions and to gently challenge the reader's beliefs.\n\nIn 1951, Arnold Kettle in his \"Introduction to the English Novel\" praised Austen for her \"fineness of feeling\", but complained about the \"relevance\" of her work to the 20th century, charging that the values of Austen's novels were too much those of Regency England to be acceptable for the 20th century, writing a modern audience could not accept the rigidly hierarchical society of her time where the vast majority of people were denied the right to vote. About the question of the \"relevance\" of Austen to the modern world, the American critic Lionel Trilling in his 1955 essay on \"Mansfield Park\" wrote about the problem of existing in the modern world, of \"the terrible strain it imposes on us...the exhausting effort which the concept of personality requires us to make\", and praised Austen for her refusal to dignify the \"uncertainty and difficulty\" of modern life, praising her irony as the \"engaging manner by which she masks society's crude coercive power\", and uses irony in a \"generosity of spirit\". In his 1957 essay \"\"Emma\" and the Legend of Jane Austen\", Trilling argued that Austen was the first novelist to handle the very modern problem of the \"deep psychological change which accompanied the establishment of democratic society\" which imposed a \"psychological burden\" on a individual which the \"new necessity of conscious self-definition and self-criticism\" as \"there is no reality about which the modern person is more uncertain and more anxious than the reality of himself\". Trilling argued that in modern society, where people existed only as \"atoms\" uncertain about how they really were, Austen offers us a \"rare hope\" of a world where people could define themselves on their own terms.\n\nIan Watt in his 1957 book \"The Rise of the Novel\" argued that 18th century British literature was characterized by a dichotomy between either novels that were told from the first person and novels from the third person; the significance of Austen rested according to Watt in her ability to combine both subjective and objective tendencies in her books though her use of free indirect discourse. Another influential work was Wayne Booth's 1961 book \"The Rhetoric of Fiction\", in which offered a detailed study of \"Emma\", which he argued was told from three points of view; Emma's, Mr. Knightley's and the unnamed narrator. Booth argued Austen adopted this three-fold narration because Emma is in many ways an unlikable character, a spoiled and immature busybody, and Austen had to find a way to make her likable and engaging to the reader. Booth's book was widely praised for the way in which he highlighted how a moral problem (Emma's character) was turned into an aesthetic problem (how to tell the story while keeping its protagonist likable enough to engage the reader's sympathy), and has been the basis of much Austen scholarship since. Critics like Graham Hough have pointed out that the morality of the characters in \"Emma\" is related to their diction of the characters with those closest to the narrator having the best character, and in this reading Mr. Knightley has the best character. A. Walton Ktiz argued the aspect of the novel of \"Knightley as the standard\" prevents the irony of \"Emma\" from becoming a cynical celebration of feminine manipulation that see it, writing that Austen's use of free indirect discourse allowed the reader to understand's Emma mind without becoming limited by it.\n\nAnother major theme of Austen scholarship has concerned the question of the \"Bildungsroman\" (novel of education). D.D Devlin in \"Jane Austen and Education\" (1975) argued that Austen's novels were all in varying ways \"Bildungsroman\", where Austen put into practice Enlightenment theories about how the character of young people can develop and change. The Italian literary critic Franco Moretti in his 1987 book \"The Way of the World\" called \"Pride and Prejudice\" a \"classic\" \"Bildungsroman\", where Elizabeth Bennet's \"prejudice\" against Mr. Darcy is really \"distrust\" and that she \"shes does not err due to a lack-but due to an \"excess of criticism\", as Bennet rejects anything that she is told to trust \"a priori\". Moretti argued that in a typical \"Bildungsroman\" of the early 19th century was concerned with \"everyday life\", which represented \"an unchallenged stability of social relationships\" in a world that was wracked by war and revolution. In this sense, Moretti argued that the education that Bennet needs is to learn to accept the stability represented by the world around her in England, which is preferable to war and revolution to be found elsewhere in Europe, without losing her individualism. In the same way, Clifford Siskin in his 1988 book \"The Historicity of Romantic Discourse\" argued that all of Austen's books were \"Bildungsroman\", where the struggle of the characters to develop was mainly \"internal\" as the challenge to the characters was not really to change their onward lives, but rather their \"self\". Siskin noted in Henry Fielding's popular 1742 novel \"Joseph Andrews\", where a young man working as humble servant, goes though much suffering, and is ultimately rewarded when it is discovered that he is really an aristocrat kidnapped by the Romany (gypsies) when he is a baby. By contrast, Siskin wrote that Elizabeth Bennet's paternity is not in question and there are not improbable stokes of luck which will make her rich; instead her struggle is to develop her character and conquer her \"prejudice\" against Darcy, marking the shift in British literature from an \"external\" to \"internal\" conflict. Alongside studies of Austen as the writer of \"Bildungsroman\" are studies of Austen as a writer of marriage stories. For Susan Fraiman, \"Pride and Prejudice\" is both a \"Bildungsroman\" concerning Elizabeth Bennet's growth and a marriage story that ends in her \"humiliation\" where ends up submitting to Mr. Darcy. Critics are badly divided over the question of whatever the marriages of Austen's heroines is meant to be a reward for their virtuous behavior as seen by Wayne Booth and merely \"Good Girl Being Taught a Lesson\" stories as seen by Claudia Johnson. Stuart Tave wrote that Austen's stories always seem to end unhappily, but then end with the heroine getting married happily, which led him to the conclusion that these happy endings were artificial endings imposed by the expectations of an early 19th century audience.\n\nAbout the question of the \"relevance\" of Austen to the modern world, Julia Prewitt Brown in her 1979 book \"Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form\" challenged the common complaint that she did not deal with social changes, by examining how she presented social changes within the households she chronicled. Brown argued that the social changes Austen examined were the birth of the \"modern\" individualism where people were \"alienated\" from any meaningful social identity, existing only as \"atoms\" in society. The exhibit A of her thesis, so to speak, was \"Persuasion\" where she argued that Anne Eliot cannot find personal happiness by marrying within the gentry and only marriage to the self-made man Captain Wentworth can give her happiness. Brown argued that \"Persuasion\" was in many ways the most darkest of Austen's novels, depicting a society in grip of moral decay, where the old hierarchical certainties had given way to a society of \"disparate parts\", leaving Eliot as a \"disoriented, isolated\" woman. Brown was not a Marxist, but her book owed much to the Hungarian Communist writer Georg Lukács, especially his 1920 book \"The Theory of the Novel\".\nOne of the most fruitful and contentious has been the consideration of Austen as a political writer. As critic Gary Kelly explains, \"Some see her as a political 'conservative' because she seems to defend the established social order. Others see her as sympathetic to 'radical' politics that challenged the established order, especially in the form of critics see Austen's novels as neither conservative nor subversive, but complex, criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting stability and an open class hierarchy.\" In \"Jane Austen and the War of Ideas\" (1975), perhaps the most important of these works, Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was steeped in, not insulated from, the principal moral and political controversies of her time, and espoused a partisan, fundamentally conservative and Christian position in these controversies. In a similar vein, Alistair M. Duckworth in \"The Improvement of the Estate: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels\" (1971) argues that Austen used the concept of the \"estate\" to symbolise all that was important about contemporary English society, which should be conserved, improved, and passed down to future generations. Duckworth argued that Austen followed Edmund Burke, who in his 1790 book \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" had used the metaphor of an estate that represented the work of generations, and which could be only be improved, never altered, for the way that society ought to work. Duckworth noted that in Austen's books, one's ability to keep an estate going, which could only be improved, but never altered if one was to be true to the estate, is usually the measure of one's good character. Butler placed Austen in the context of the reaction against the French Revolution, where excessive emotionalism and the sentimental \"cult of sensibility\" came to be identified with sexual promiscuity, atheism, and political radicalism. Butler argued that a novel like \"Sense and Sensibility\", where Marianne Dashwood is unable to control her emotions, is part of the conservative anti-revolutionary literature that sought to glorify old fashioned values and politics. Irvine pointed out that the identification of the \"cult of sensibility\" with republicanism was one that existed only in the minds of conservatives, and in fact the French Republic also rejected sentimentalism, so Butler's challenge is to prove Austen's call for emotional self-restraint as expressed by a character like Elinor Dashwood is in fact grounded in conservative politics. Butler wrote \"the characteristic recourse of the conservative...is to remind us ultimately of the insignificance of individual rights and even individual concerns when measured against the scale of 'the universe as one vast whole'\". Irvine wrote that novels like \"Sense and Sensibility\" appeared to support Butler's thesis, but a novel like \"Pride and Prejudice\" does not, as Elizabeth Bennet is an individualist and a non-conformist who ridicules everything, and who to a certain extent has to learn the value of sentiment.\n\nRegarding Austen's views of society and economics, Alastair MacIntyre in his 1981 \"After Virtue\" offered a critique of the Enlightenment as leading to moral chaos and decay, and citing Aristotle argued that a \"good life for man\" is only possible if one follows the traditional moral rules of one's society. In this regard, MacIntrye used Austen as an \"Aristotelian\" writer whose books offered up examples of how to be virtuous with the English country estate playing the same role that the \"polis\" did for Aristotle. By contrast, Mary Evans in her 1987 book \"Jane Austen and the State\" depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist concerned with the \"stability of human relationships and communities\" and against \"conspicuous consumption\" and the \"individualisation of feeling\" promoted by the Industrial Revolution. In her 1987 book \"Desire and Domestic Fiction\", Nancy Armstrong in a study much influenced by the theories of Karl Marx and Michel Foucault, argued that all of Austen's books reflected the dominant political-economic ideology of her times, concerning the battle to exercise power over the human body, which determined how and whether a woman was considered sexually desirable or not. The Marxist James Thompson in his 1988 book \"Between Self and the World\" likewise depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist searching for a realm of freedom and feeling in a world dominated by a soulless materialism promoted by capitalism. By contrast, Beth Fowkes Tobin in her 1990 article \"The Moral and Political Economy of Austen's \"Emma\"\" depicted Austen as a Burkean conservative with Mr. Knightly as a responsible land-owner taking care of his family's ancient estate and Emma Woodhouse symbolising wealth cut off from any sort of social role. David Kaufmann in his 1992 essay \"Propriety and the Law\" argued that Austen was a classical liberal in the mold of Adam Smith, who felt that virtue was best exercised in the private sphere of the family life rather in the public sphere of politics. Kaufmann rejected the claim that Austen was influenced by Edmund Burke, arguing that for Austen, virtue was not something passed down from time immemorial from a landed elite as Burke would have it, but rather was something that any individual could acquire, thus making Austen into something of a radical. Lauren Goodlad in a 2000 article rejected Kaufmann's claim of Austen as a classical liberal, arguing that the message of \"Sense and Sensibility\" was the failure of liberalism to reconcile alienated individuals from a society that only valued money. As Rajeswari Rajan notes in her essay on recent Austen scholarship, \"the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged\". The questions scholars now investigate involve: \"the [French] Revolution, war, nationalism, empire, class, 'improvement' [of the estate], the clergy, town versus country, abolition, the professions, female emancipation; whether her politics were Tory, Whig, or radical; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary, or occupied a reformist position between these extremes\".\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Austen studies was influenced by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's seminal \"The Madwoman in the Attic\" (1979), which contrasts the \"decorous surfaces\" with the \"explosive anger\" of 19th-century female English writers. This work, along with other feminist criticism of Austen, has firmly positioned Austen as a \"woman\" writer. Gibler and Gubar suggested that what are usually seen as the unpleasant female characters in the Austen books like Mrs. Norris in \"Mansfield Park\", Lady Catherine de Bourgh in \"Pride and Prejudice\" and Mrs. Churchill in \"Emma\" were in fact expressions of Austen's anger at a patriarchal society, whom are punished in guilt over her own immodesty in writing novels while her heroines who end up happily married are expressions of Austen's desire to compromise with society. The Gilbert-Gubar thesis proved to be influential and inspired scholars to reexamine Austen's through most have a more favorable opinion of her heroines than Gilbert and Gubar did., Other scholars such as Linda Hunt have argued that Austen used realism as a way of attacking patriarchy from the outside as opposed to subverting it from within by irony as Gilbert and Gubar claimed. The interest generated in Austen by these critics led to the discovery and study of other woman writers of the time. Moreover, with the publication of Julia Prewitt Brown's \"Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form\" (1979), Margaret Kirkham's \"Jane Austen: Feminism and Fiction\" (1983), and Claudia L. Johnson's \"Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel\" (1988), scholars were no longer able to easily argue that Austen was \"apolitical, or even unqualifiedly 'conservative'\". Kirkham, for example, described the similarities between Austen's thought and that of Mary Wollstonecraft, labelling them both as \"Enlightenment feminists\". Kirham argued that by showing women were just as capable of being rational as men that Austen was a follower of Wollstonecraft. Johnson similarly places Austen in an 18th-century political tradition, although she outlines the debt Austen owes to the political novels of the 1790s written by women.\n\nThe war with France that began in 1793 was seen as an ideological war between the British monarchy vs. the French republic, which led conservative writers such as Jane West, Hannah More, and Elizabeth Hamilton to depict the feminine private sphere in the family as the embodiment of British values under threat from France, and to write a series of polemical works demanding that young women defend their \"modesty\", as defined by conduct books, to give Britain the moral strength to prevail over the French. Johnson argued that Austen appropriated the sort of plot that More, West and Hamilton used in their books to quietly subvert via irony. In support of her thesis, Johnson noted in \"Sense and Sensibility\" the Dashwood sisters are victimized by their greedy half-brother John, showing the family as an area for competition instead of warmth and comfort; in \"Mansfield Park\" the lifestyle of the eminently respectable Bertram family is supported by a plantation in Antigua worked by slave labour; and \"Northranger Abbey\" where satirizing Gothic stories gives \"a nightmare version of patriarchal oppression\" as General Tilney, if not guilty of the specific crimes that Catherine Moreland imagines he has committed, is indeed a vicious man. Likewise, Johnson noted that Maria Rushworth's adultery in \"Mansfield Park\" is portrayed as merely salacious local gossip that does not presage a great victory for Napoleon while Marianne Dashwood does not die after being seduced by Willoughby, which undercuts the standard plot devices of the conservative writers. Johnston argued because of the drastic wartime censorship and the campaign of vitriolic abuse waged against Wollstonecraft that Austen had to be quiet in their criticism of patriarchy. Irvine in a critique of the work of feminist scholars like Johnson and Kirkham that if Austen was indeed an Enlightenment feminist, there were clearly limits to her radicalism as Austen never criticised either explicitly or implicitly the hierarchical structure of British society with her villains failing to live up to their standards expected of their class, instead of their moral failures being presented as a product of the social system. Writing about the work of Johnson, Irvine wrote for her, Austen was a radical because it is women like Emma Woodhouse, Mrs. Elton and Mrs. Churchill who really run Highbury society, undercutting traditional gender roles, but Irvine questioned whatever this really made Austen into radical, noting it was the wealth and status of the gentry women of Highbury that gave them their power. Irvine argued it was just as possible to see \"Emma\" as a conservative novel that upholds the superiority of the gentry, writing that Johnson was \"...close here to defining 'conservative' in terms of gender politics alone...\". Likewise, Elizabeth may defy Lady Catherine de Bourgh who wants to keep her in place by marrying Mr. Darcy, who comes from old landed family, which Irivne used to argue while \"Pride and Prejudice\" does have a strong heroine, the book does not criticise the structure of English society.\n\nMany scholars have noted in the conduct books that were very popular for settling out the proper rules for a young ladies in Austen's book there was a double meaning to the word modesty. Modesty meant both a woman should refrain from flamboyant behavior and be quiet while modesty also meant a woman had to be ignorant of her sexuality. This double meaning to modesty meant a young woman who was behaving in a modest way was not really modest at all as she attempting to conceal her knowledge of her sexuality, placing young women in an impossible position. Jan Fergus argued that for this reason that Austen's books were subversive by engaging in \"emotional didacticism\" by showing the reader moral lessons meant to teach young women how to be modest in the conventional sense, thus undercutting the demand made by the conduct books for modesty in the sense of ignorance of one's sexuality. In the same way, Kirkham used \"Mansfield Park\" as an example of Austen undercutting the message of the conduct books, noting that Fanny Price is attractive to Henry Crawford because she outwardly conforms to the conduct books while she is attractive to Edmund Bertram because of her intelligence and spirit, rejecting the infantisation of women promoted by the conduct books. Rachel Brownstein argued that Austen's use of irony should be seen in the same way, as a way of writing in a manner expected of a woman writer in her age while also undercutting such expectations at the same time. Devoney Looser in the 1995 book \"Jane Austen and the Discourses of Feminism\" she edited in her introduction argued that there a number of ways in which Austen could be placed not within a feminist tradition, but was herself a feminist.\n\nUsing the theories of Michel Foucault as their guide, Casey Finch and Peter Bowen in their 1990 essay \"'The Tittle-Tattle of Highbury': Gossip and the Free Indirect Style in \"Emma\"\" argued the free indirect discourse in Austen validates Fouucault's thesis that the Enlightenment was a fraud, an insidious form of oppression posing as liberation. Finch and Bowen argued that voice of the omnipresent narrator and together with the free indirect discourse summarizing the thoughts of characters in \"Emma\" were a form of \"surveillance\" that policed the thoughts of the character; seen in this light, Emma Woodhouse's discovery that she loves Mr. Knightley is not an expression of her real feelings, but rather society imposing its values on her mind by persuading her that she had to engage in a heterosexual marriage to produce sons to continue the Establishment and the while fooling her into thinking she was in love. By contrast, Lauren Goodlad in her 2000 essay \"Self-Disciplinary Self-Making\" argued that the self-discipline exercised by Elinor Dashwood in \"Sense and Sensibility\" was not an act of oppression as held by Foucault and those writing from a Foucaultian perspective, but was an \"emancipatory act of political resistance\", arguing that there was a tension between 'psychology' and 'character' as Dashwood must be the observer of her character and used what she has learn to grow.\n\nA very controversial article was \"Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl\" by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick that juxtaposed three treatments of female suffering, namely Marianne Dashwood's emotional frenzy when Willoughby abandons her, a 19th century medical account of the \"cure\" inflicted on a girl who liked to masturbate, and the critic Tony Tanner's \"vengeful\" treatment of Emma Woodhouse as a woman who had to be taught her place. Sedgwick argued the way that the portrayal of Marianne as emotionally overwrought and too inclined to give in to her feelings very closely resembled the account of patient X, the teenage girl seen as too inclined to masturbate and the way a male critic like Tanner attacked Woodhouse for her emotional self-indulgence was no different from the doctor imposing the gruesome and painful treatment on the masturbating girl. Sedwick the way that way Elinor disciplines Marianne, Tanner's \"vengeful\" views and the treatment given to patient X were all attempts to crush female sexuality as she maintained that \"emotional self-indulgence\" was merely a code-word for female masturbation. Sedgwick argued that characters such as Dashwood and Woodhouse, who did not precisely conform to the feminine ideals are symbols of both female and homosexual resistance to the ideal of heterosexuality and patriarchy as the norm for everyone. Sedgwick's provoked an uproar in 1991, becoming a prime exhibit in the American \"Culture war\" between liberals and conservatives.\n\nThe Italian critic Franco Moretti argued that Austen's novels articulated a new form of English nationalism via the marriage plot, noting most of the heroes and heroines came from different parts of England. Some critics such as Roger Gard have seized upon Austen as a symbol of an \"eternal England\", whose \"unpolitical\" works unlike the \"political\" novels of the great French and Russian novelists of the 19th century reflected the central values of \"modern Anglo-Saxon civilisations\". According to Gard, Austen is so English that only the English could really appreciate Austen, writing \"Foreigners, whether reading in translation or in the original, see little or nothing of her true brilliance...the \"feel\" of Jane Austen-so far as we can imagine it dissociated it from her language is still...peculiarly English\". Irvine wrote that Gard's book 1992 book \"Jane Austen's Novels: The Art of Clarity\" is full of historical errors such as his claim Austen was part of the movement towards \"an evolving national democracy\", when in fact the Great Reform Bill, which lowered the franchise requirements for men in a very limited way, was passed in 1832, 15 years after Austen's death, and \"nowhere in her novels or letters is England imagined as 'evolving' towards democracy of any kind\". Irvine wrote that while Austen did see England as different from the rest of Europe, she did not see England as apart from Europe in the way that Gard claimed or as a part of \"Anglo-Saxon civilisations\", which apparently include the United States and English-speaking parts of the Commonwealth, a way of thinking that did not exist in her time. Irvine charged that Gard appeared to be trying to use Austen as a way of furthering his opposition to British membership in the European Union, with his dichotomy between Austen's England with its \"clear\" style and \"unpolitical\" way of life vs. the presumably muddled style and \"political\" way of life of continental Europe with the implication that the two do not belong together.\n\nIn the late-1980s, 1990s and 2000s ideological, postcolonial and Marxist criticism dominated Austen studies. Generating heated debate, Edward Said devoted a chapter of his book \"Culture and Imperialism\" (1993) to \"Mansfield Park\", arguing that the peripheral position of \"Antigua\" and the issue of slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early 19th century. The question of whether \"Mansfield Park\" justifies or condemns slavery has become heated in Austen scholarship, and Said's claims have proved to be highly controversial. The debate about \"Mansfield Park\" and slavery is the one issue that in Austen scholarship that has transcended the limits of academia to attract widespread public attention. Many of Austen's critics come from the field of post-colonial studies, and taken up Said's thesis about \"Mansfield Park\" reflecting the \"spatial\" understanding of the world that he argued was used to justify the British empire. Writing in a post-colonial vein, Carl Plasa in his 2001 essay \"'What Was Done There Is Not To Be Told' \"Mansfield Park\"'s Colonial Unconscious\" argued that the \"barbarism\" of Maria Bertram's sexuality, which leads her into adultery, is a metaphor for the \"barbarism\" of the Haitian revolution, which attracted much media attention in Britain at the time, which was often presented as due to the \"barbarism\" and uncontrolled sexuality of the Haitian slaves. Plasa argued that British society in Austen's time was based upon set of expectations about everyone being in their \"place\", which created order. The Haitian revolution was seen as a symbol of what happened to a society without order, and Plasa argued that it was not accident that when Sir Thomas Bertram leaves Mansfield Park for his plantation in Antigua that his family falls apart, showing the importance of the family and individuals staying in their proper \"place\". Likewise, Maaja Stewart in her 1993 book \"Domestic Realities and Imperial Fictions\" argued that the plantations in the Caribbean were the source of much worry about female sexuality in Austen's time with the main concerns being the need of slave owners to depend upon the fertility of slave women to create more slaves when the slave trade was abolished in 1807, and about the general collapse of traditional English morality in the West Indies as the slave masters routinely kept harems of slave women or alternatively raped female slaves. Stewart linked these concerns to \"Mansfield Park\", writing that Sir Thomas Bertram's failure to manage his own family is put down to his failure to manage the emerging sexuality of his teenage daughters, which is precisely the same charge that was applied to the owners of the plantations in the West Indies at the same time.\n\nOther critics have seen the message of \"Mansfield Park\" as abolitionist. Joseph Lew argued that Fanny's refusal to marry Henry Crawford as \"an act of rebellion, endangering a system based upon the exchange of women between men as surely as a slave's refusal to work\". Susan Fraiman, in a 1995 essay argued strongly against the Said thesis, arguing that the values of Sir Thomas are those which Austen affirms in \"Mansfield Park\" and that if his attempt to restore order to his family in Mansfield Park is seen as analogous with his restoration of order at his Antigua plantation, then he was a failure for the \"moral blight\" at Mansfield Park remains after he returns to England. Fraiman conceded to Said that Austen was one of the writers who \"made colonialism thinkable by constructing the West as center, home and norm\", but argued slavery in \"Mansfield Park\" \"is not a subtext wherein Austen and Sir Thomas converge\", but rather used by Austen \"to argue the essential depravity of Sir Thomas's relations to other people\". Fraiman argued that Austen used the issue of slavery to argue against the patriarchal power of an English gentleman over his family, his estate and \"by implication overseas\". Fraiman argued that British imperialist discourse tended to depict the British empire as masculine and the colonies as feminine, which again to the conclusion that Said had merely inverted this discourse by making Austen a representative of the British empire while lionizing various male anti-colonial writers from Britain's colonies. Brian Southam in a 1995 essay argued that much discussed scene about the \"dead silence\" that follows Fanny Price's questions about the status of slaves in the Caribbean refers to the moral decadence of those members of the British gentry who chosen to be involved in the abolitionist campaigns of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Trevor Lloyd in a 1999 article argued on the basis of the statements in the novel suggested that about 10% of the income from Mansfield Park come from the plantation in Antigua. John Wiltshire in a 2003 article argued that parallel between the condition of women in Britain and the treatment of slaves in the West Indies is to be understood as metaphoric as literal, and that Sir Thomas willingness to make a trip in the middle of a war to his plantation in Antigua, despite the well known perils of yellow fever and malaria in the Caribbean suggested he be understood as a good master. In Wiltshire's account, it is the slave trade, not slavery, that Austen condemns in \"Mansfield Park\".\n\nIrvine argued that though all of Austen's novels are set in provincial England, there is in fact a global component to her stories with the British Empire as a place where men go off in adventures, to get rich and to tell stories which edify the heroines. Irvine used as examples the naval career of Captain Wentworth in \"Persuasion\"; that Sir Thomas Bertram owes a plantation in Antigua while William Price joins the Royal Navy in \"Mansfield Park\"; and Colonel Brandon is a veteran of the campaigns in the West Indies in \"Sense and Sensibility\". Irvine observed that all of these men are in some way improved by the love of women, who domestic otherwise scarred men, noting that for example that Colonel Brandon had fought in the British campaign to conquer Saint-Domingue, where the British lost about 100,000 men between 1793–98, mostly to yellow fever, an experience that scarred him and left him looking for a \"home\". Irvine argued that Elinor Dashwood by arranging for Colonel Brandon to marry her sister Marianne is finding for him the \"home\" that he had lost while fighting for the British empire in a doomed effort to restore slavery to Saint-Domingue. Irvine suggested that for Austen, women had a role in domesticating men scarred by their imperial experiences, and that Said was wrong that Austen could \"not\" write of the British empire; arguing instead in Austen's works the \"stories of empire\" are placed in a \"context of their telling that domesticates them, removes them from the political and moral realm where the horrors they describe might demand a moral and political response\".\n\nAnother theme of recent Austen scholarship concerns her relationship with British/English national identity within the context of the long wars with France. Jon Mee in his 2000 essay \"Austen's Treacherous Ivory: Female Patriotism, Domestic Ideology, and Empire\" examined how Fanny Price defined her sense of Englishness in connection with the English countryside, arguing that Austen was presenting a version of \"England\" defined as country estates in a bucolic countryside that was insulated from a \"larger, more uncertain and un-English world\". Mee suggested that in \"Emma\", the very name of Mr. Knightley, which suggests the Middle Ages, together with the name of his estate, Donwell Abbey, are meant to suggest a continuity between medieval and modern England, in contrast to the newness of the political institutions in the novice republics in the United States and France. Miranda Burgress in her 2000 book \"British Fiction and the Production of Social Order\" argued that Austen defined her England as a nation made up of readers, as the experience of reading the same books had created a common culture across all of England. in this regard, Janet Sorenson in \"The Grammar of Empire\" noted that in Austen's books, none of her characters speak in dialect and all use the same form of polite \"King's English\" that was expected of the upper classes.\n\nIn \"Jane Austen and the Body: 'The Picture of Health\"', (1992) John Wiltshire explored the preoccupation with illness and health of Austen's characters. Wiltshire addressed current theories of \"the body as sexuality\", and more broadly how culture is \"inscribed\" on the representation of the body. There has also been a return to considerations of aesthetics with D. A. Miller's \"Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style\" (2003), which connects artistic concerns with queer theory. Miller in his book began the \"queer\" reading of Austen, as he asked why Austen's work which celebrates heterosexual love is so popular with gay men. Miller answered it is because the narrator of the novels has no sexuality and has a \"dazzling verbal style\", which allows homosexuals to identity with the narrator who stands outside of the world of heterosexuality and whose chief attribute is a sense of style.\n\nCritic Claudia Johnson defines \"Janeitism\" as \"the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her\". Janeites not only read the novels of Austen; they also re-enact them, write plays based on them, and become experts on early 19th-century England and its customs. Austen scholar Deidre Lynch has commented that \"cult\" is an apt term for committed Janeites. She compares the practices of religious pilgrims with those of Janeites, who travel to places associated with Austen's life, her novels and the film adaptations. She speculates that this is \"a kind of time-travel to the past\" which, by catering to Janeites, preserves a \"vanished Englishness or set of 'traditional' values\". The disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen and the academic appreciation of Austen that began with Lascelles has since widened considerably. Johnson compares Janeites to Trekkies, arguing that both \"are derided and marginalized by dominant cultural institutions bent on legitimizing their own objects and protocols of expertise\". However, she notes that Austen's works are now considered to be part of both high culture and popular culture, while \"Star Trek\" can only claim to be a part of popular culture.\n\nSequels, prequels and adaptations based on Austen's work range from attempts to enlarge on the stories in Austen's own style to the soft-core pornographic novel \"Virtues and Vices\" (1981) and fantasy novel \"Resolve and Resistance\" (1996). Beginning in the middle of the 19th century, Austen family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels. By 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations of Austen's works. According to Lynch, \"her works appear to have proven more hospitable to sequelisation than those of almost any other novelist\". Relying on the categories laid out by Betty A. Schellenberg and Paul Budra, Lynch describes two different kinds of Austen sequels: those that continue the story and those that return to \"the world of Jane Austen\". The texts that continue the story are \"generally regarded as dubious enterprises, as reviews attest\" and \"often feel like throwbacks to the Gothic and sentimental novels that Austen loved to burlesque\". Those that emphasise nostalgia are \"defined not only by retrograde longing but also by a kind of postmodern playfulness and predilection for insider joking\", relying on the reader to see the web of Austenian allusions.\nBetween 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, film and stage productions appeared. The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. It has long been said that a Hollywood adaptation was first suggested by the entertainer Harpo Marx, who had seen a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy. Directed by Robert Z. Leonard and written in collaboration with the English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original. Filmed in a studio and in black and white, the story's setting was relocated to the 1830s with opulent costume designs.\n\nIn direct opposition to the Hollywood adaptations of Austen's novels, BBC dramatisations from the 1970s onward aimed to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations, and settings. The 1972 BBC adaptation of \"Emma\", for example, took great care to be historically accurate, but its slow pacing and long takes contrasted unfavourably to the pace of commercial films. The BBC's 1980 adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\" adopted many film techniques—such as the use of long landscape shots—that gave the production a greater visual sophistication. Often seen as the start of the \"heritage drama\" movement, this production was the first to be filmed largely on location. A push for \"fusion\" adaptations, or films that combined Hollywood style and British heritage style, began in the mid-1980s. The BBC's first fusion adaptation was the 1986 production of \"Northanger Abbey\", which combined authentic style and 1980s punk, with characters often veering into the surreal.\n\nA wave of Austen adaptations began to appear around 1995, starting with Emma Thompson's adaptation of \"Sense and Sensibility\" for Columbia Pictures, a fusion production directed by Ang Lee. This star-studded film departed from the novel in many ways, but it became a commercial and critical success, and was nominated for numerous awards, including seven Oscars. The BBC produced two adaptations in 1995: \"Persuasion\" and Andrew Davies's six-episode television drama, \"Pride and Prejudice\". Starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, Davies's production ignited \"Darcymania\" in Britain. Critics praised its smart departures from the novel as well as its sensual costuming, fast-paced editing, and original yet appropriate dialogue. The series sparked an explosion in the publication of printed Austen adaptations; in addition, 200,000 video copies of the serial were sold within a year of its airing, 50,000 within the first week alone. Another adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\" was released in 2005. Starring Keira Knightley, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet, Joe Wright's film marked the first feature adaptation since 1940 that aspired to be faithful to the novel. Three more film adaptations appeared in 2007—\"Mansfield Park\", \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\". \"Love & Friendship\", a film version of Austen's early epistolary novel \"Lady Susan\", was released in 2016. Directed by Whit Stillman and starring Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny, the film's title was taken from one of Austen's juvenile writings.\n\nBooks and scripts that use the general story line of Austen's novels but change or otherwise modernize the story also became popular at the end of the 20th century. \"Clueless\" (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of \"Emma\" that takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series. \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2001), based on the successful 1996 book of the same name by Helen Fielding, was inspired by both \"Pride and Prejudice\" and the 1995 BBC adaptation. The Bollywoodesque production \"Bride and Prejudice\", which sets Austen's story in present-day India while including original musical numbers, premiered in 2004.\n\n\n",
                "Jane Austen\n\nJane Austen (; 16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism and social commentary, have earned her acclaim among critics and scholars.\n\nWith the publications of \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1811), \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813), \"Mansfield Park\" (1814) and \"Emma\" (1816), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled \"Sanditon\", but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript and another unfinished novel, The Watsons. Her six full-length novels have rarely been out of print, although they were published anonymously and brought her moderate success and little fame during her lifetime.\n\nA significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and sold as a set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.\n\nAusten has inspired a large number of critical essays and literary anthologies. Her novels have inspired many films, from 1940's \"Pride and Prejudice\" to more recent productions like \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1995) and \"Love & Friendship\" (2016). \n\nThere is little biographical information about Jane Austen's life except the few letters that survive and the biographical notes her family members wrote. During her lifetime Austen wrote approximately 3,000 letters but only about 160 survive. Many of the letters were written to Austen's older sister Cassandra, who in 1843 burned the greater part of them and cut pieces out of those she kept. Ostensibly Cassandra destroyed or censored her sister's letters to prevent their falling into the hands of relatives and ensuring that \"younger nieces did not read any of Jane Austen's sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbors or family members\". Cassandra believed that in the interest of tact and Jane's penchant for forthrightness, these details should be destroyed. The paucity of record of Austen's life leaves modern biographers little to work with.\n\nThe situation was compounded as successive generations of the family expunged and sanitized the already opaque details of Austen's biography. The heirs of Jane's brother, Admiral Francis Austen, destroyed more letters; details were excised from the \"Biographical Notice\" her brother wrote in 1818; and family details continued to be elided or embellished in her nephew's \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\", published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh's biography \"Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters\", published in 1913. The legend the family and relatives created reflects their biases in favour of \"good quiet Aunt Jane\", portraying a woman whose domestic situation was happy and whose family was the mainstay of her life. Austen scholar Jan Fergus explains that modern biographies tend to include details excised from the letters and family biographical materials, but that the challenge is to avoid the polarising view that Austen experienced periods of deep unhappiness and was \"an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family.\"\nJane Austen was born in Steventon, Hampshire, on 16 December 1775. She was born a month later than her parents expected; her father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother \"certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago\". He added that her arrival was particularly welcome as \"a future companion to her sister\". The winter of 1776 was particularly harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church with the single name Jane.\n\nFor much of Jane's life, her father, George Austen (1731–1805) served as the rector of the Anglican parishes at Steventon, and a nearby Deane. He came from an old, respected, and wealthy family of wool merchants. Over the centuries as each generation of eldest sons received inheritances their wealth was consolidated, and George's branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. His sister Philadelphia went to India to find a husband and George entered St John's College, Oxford on a fellowship, where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739–1827). She came from the prominent Leigh family; her father was rector at All Souls College, Oxford, where she grew up among the gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot, with the only condition that he change his name to Leigh-Perrot. \n\nGeorge and Cassandra exchanged miniatures in 1763 and probably were engaged around that time. George received the living for the Steventon parish from the wealthy husband of his second cousin, Thomas Knight, who owned Steventon and its associated farms, one of which the Austen family rented to live in. Two months after Cassandra's father died they married on 26 April 1764 at St Swithin's Church in Bath, by licence, in a simple ceremony. They left for Hampshire the same day. \n\nTheir income was modest, with George's small \"per annum\" living; Cassandra brought the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother's death to the marriage. The Reverend Austen had an annual income of £200 pounds from his two livings. This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison, a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about £100 pounds annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between £1, 000-£5, 000 pounds. The Austens took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then placed it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.\nIn 1768 the family finally took up residence in Steventon. Henry was the first child to be born there, in 1771. At about this time Cassandra could no longer ignore that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and dumb, and she chose to send him out to be fostered. In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.\n\nAccording to Honan, life in the Austen home was lived in \"an open, amused, easy intellectual atmosphere\" where the ideas of those with whom the Austens might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed. The family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members. Cassandra Austen spent the summer of 1770 in London with George's sister, Philadelphia, and her daughter Eliza, accompanied by his other sister, Mrs Walter and her daughter Philly. Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, \"the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane's youthful horizon and influence her later life and works.\"\n\nCassandra Austen's cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and '80s, inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents on her return, \"… and almost home they were when they met Jane & Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, & have the pleasure of riding home in it.\" Le Faye writes that, \"Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.\"\n\nFrom 1773 until 1796, George Austen supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time, who boarded at his home.\n\nIn 1783, Austen and her sister Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Mrs Ann Cawley who took them with her to Southampton when she moved there later in the year. In the autumn both girls were sent home when they caught typhus and Austen nearly died. Austen was from then home educated, until she attended boarding school in Reading with her sister from early in 1785 at the Reading Abbey Girls' School, ruled by Mrs La Tournelle, who possessed a cork leg and a passion for theatre. The school curriculum probably included some French, spelling, needlework, dancing and music and, perhaps, drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family. After 1786, Austen \"never again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment\".\n\nThe remainder of her education came from reading, guided by her father and brothers James and Henry. Irene Collins believes that Austen \"used some of the same school books as the boys\" her father tutored. Austen apparently had unfettered access both to her father's library and that of a family friend, Warren Hastings. Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library. Her father was also tolerant of Austen's sometimes risqué experiments in writing, and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing.\n\nPrivate theatricals were an essential part of Austen's education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn, including Richard Sheridan's \"The Rivals\" (1775) and David Garrick's \"Bon Ton\". Austen's eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and she probably joined in these activities, first as a spectator and later as a participant. Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests how Austen's satirical gifts were cultivated. At the age of 12, she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years.\n\nBeginning at age 11, perhaps earlier, Austen wrote poems and stories for her own and her family's amusement. In these works the details of daily life are exaggerated, common plot devices are parodied, and the \"stories are full of anarchic fantasies of female power, licence, illicit behaviour, and general high spirits\", according to Janet Todd. Austen later compiled \"fair copies\" of 29 early works into three bound notebooks, now referred to as the \"Juvenilia\", containing work written between 1787 and 1793. She titled the three notebooks – \"Volume the First\", \"Volume the Second\" and \"Volume the Third\" – which preserve 90,000 words she wrote during those years. The \"Juvenilia\" are often, according to scholar Richard Jenkyns, \"boisterous\" and \"anarchic\"; he compares them to the work of 18th-century novelist Laurence Sterne.\n\nAmong these works are a satirical novel in letters titled \"Love and Freindship\" , written at age 14 in 1790, where she mocked popular novels of sensibility, and \"The History of England\", a manuscript of 34 pages accompanied by 13 watercolour miniatures by her sister, Cassandra. Austen's \"History\" parodied popular historical writing, particularly Oliver Goldsmith's \"History of England\" (1764). Honan speculates that not long after writing \"Love and Freindship\" in 1789, Austen decided to \"write for profit, to make stories her central effort\", that is, to become a professional writer. Beginning in about 1793, Austen began to write longer, more sophisticated works.\n\nIn August 1792 she started \"Catharine or the Bower\", which presaged her mature work, especially \"Northanger Abbey\"; it was left unfinished and the story picked up in \"Lady Susan\", which Todd describes as less prefiguring than \"Catharine\". A year later, she began but abandoned a short play, later titled \"Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts\", which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austen's favourite contemporary novel, \"The History of Sir Charles Grandison\" (1753), by Samuel Richardson.\n\nBetween 1793 and 1795 Austen wrote \"Lady Susan\", a short epistolary novel, usually described as her most ambitious and sophisticated early work. It is unlike any of Austen's other works. Austen biographer Claire Tomalin describes the novella's heroine as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate, betray and abuse her lovers, friends and family. Tomalin writes:\n\nTold in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the Restoration dramatists who may have provided some of her inspiration ... It stands alone in Austen's work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters.\nAccording to Janet Todd, the model for the title character may have been Eliza de Feuillide, who inspired Austen with stories of her glamorous life and various adventures. Eliza's French husband was guillotined in 1794; she married Jane's brother Henry Austen in 1797.\n\nAusten sent short pieces of writing to her newborn nieces Fanny Catherine and Jane Anna Elizabeth. There is manuscript evidence that Austen continued to work on these pieces as late as 1809–1811, and that her niece and nephew, Anna and James Edward Austen, made further additions as late as 1814.\n\nShe also attended church regularly, socialized frequently with friends and neighbours, and read novels – often of her own composition – aloud with her family in the evenings. Socialising with the neighbours often meant dancing, either impromptu in someone's home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the assembly rooms in the town hall. Her brother Henry later said that \"Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it\".\n\nWhen Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: \"I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.\"\n\nAusten wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was \"very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man\". She called him her \"friend\" and explained that on this account Cassandra must be anxious to know more about her new \"friend\". Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote she expected an \"offer\" from her \"friend\" and that \"I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat\", going on to write \"I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence\" and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: \"The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea\".\n\nHalperin cautioned that Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, and some of the statements about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.\nAfter finishing \"Lady Susan\", Austen began her first full-length novel \"Elinor and Marianne\". Her sister remembered that it was read to the family \"before 1796\" and was told through a series of letters. Without surviving original manuscripts, there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published anonymously in 1811 as \"Sense and Sensibility\".\n\nAusten began a second novel, \"First Impressions\" (later published as \"Pride and Prejudice\"), in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797, aged 21; as with all of her novels, Austen read the work aloud to her family as she was working on it and it became an \"established favourite\". At this time, her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels. In November 1797, George Austen wrote to Thomas Cadell, an established publisher in London, to ask if he would consider publishing \"First Impressions\". Cadell returned Mr. Austen's letter, marking it \"Declined by Return of Post\". Austen may not have known of her father's efforts. Following the completion of \"First Impressions\", Austen returned to \"Elinor and Marianne\" and from November 1797 until mid-1798, revised it heavily; she eliminated the epistolary format in favour of third-person narration and produced something close to \"Sense and Sensibility\". In 1797, Austen met her cousin (and future sister-in-law), Eliza de Feullide, a French aristocrat whose first husband the Comte de Feullide had been guillotined, causing her to flee to Britain, where she married Henry Austen. The description of the execution of the Comte de Feullide related by his widow left Austen with an intense horror of the French Revolution that lasted for the rest of her life.\n\nDuring the middle of 1798, after finishing revisions of \"Elinor and Marianne\", Austen began writing a third novel with the working title \"Susan\" – later \"Northanger Abbey\" – a satire on the popular Gothic novel. Austen completed her work about a year later. In early 1803, Henry Austen offered \"Susan\" to Benjamin Crosby, a London publisher, who paid £10 for the copyright. Crosby promised early publication and went so far as to advertise the book publicly as being \"in the press\", but did nothing more. The manuscript remained in Crosby's hands, unpublished, until Austen repurchased the copyright from him in 1816.\n\nIn December 1800 George Austen unexpectedly announced his decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She was able to make some revisions to \"Susan\", and she began and then abandoned a new novel, \"The Watsons\", but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.\n\nThe years from 1801 to 1804 are something of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive – he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that \"having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection\". The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had \"had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife ... All of her heroines ... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love\". A possible autobiographical element in \"Sense and Sensibility\" occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates that \"the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life\" with an unsuitable man.\nIn 1804, while living in Bath, Austen started but did not complete her novel, \"The Watsons\". The story centres on an invalid and impoverished clergyman and his four unmarried daughters. Sutherland describes the novel as \"a study in the harsh economic realities of dependent women's lives\". Honan suggests, and Tomalin agrees, that Austen chose to stop work on the novel after her father died on 21 January 1805 and her personal circumstances resembled those of her characters too closely for her comfort.\n\nHer father's relatively sudden death left Jane, Cassandra, and their mother in a precarious financial situation. Edward, James, Henry, and Francis Austen pledged to make annual contributions to support their mother and sisters. For the next four years, the family's living arrangements reflected their financial insecurity. They spent part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon and Godmersham. They moved for the autumn months to the newly fashionable seaside resort of Worthing, on the Sussex coast, where they resided at Stanford Cottage. It was here that Austen is thought to have written her fair copy of \"Lady Susan\" and added its \"Conclusion\". In 1806 the family moved to Southampton, where they shared a house with Frank Austen and his new wife. A large part of this time they spent visiting various branches of the family.\n\nOn 5 April 1809, about three months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, offering him a new manuscript of \"Susan\" if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.\n\nAround early 1809 Austen's brother Edward offered his mother and sisters a more settled life – the use of a large cottage in Chawton village that was part of Edward's nearby estate, Chawton House. Jane, Cassandra and their mother moved into Chawton cottage on 7 July 1809. Life was quieter in Chawton than it had been since the family's move to Bath in 1800. The Austens did not socialise with gentry and entertained only when family visited. Her niece Anna described the family's life in Chawton as \"a very quiet life, according to our ideas, but they were great readers, and besides the housekeeping our aunts occupied themselves in working with the poor and in teaching some girl or boy to read or write.\"\n\nDuring her time at Chawton, Jane Austen published four generally well received novels. Through her brother Henry, the publisher Thomas Egerton agreed to publish \"Sense and Sensibility\", which appeared in October 1811. Reviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers; the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen's earnings from \"Sense and Sensibility\" provided her with some financial and psychological independence. Egerton then published \"Pride and Prejudice\", a revision of \"First Impressions\", in January 1813. He advertised the book widely and it was an immediate success, garnering three favourable reviews and selling well. By October 1813 Egerton was able to begin selling a second edition. \"Mansfield Park\" was published by Egerton in May 1814. While \"Mansfield Park\" was ignored by reviewers, it was very popular with readers. All copies were sold within six months, and Austen's earnings on this novel were larger than for any of her other novels. Unknown to Austen, her novels were translated into French and published in cheaply produced, pirated editions in France. The literary critic Noel King commented that given the prevailing rage in France at the time was for lush romantic fantasies, it is remarkable that her novels with the emphasis on everyday English life had any sort of a market in France. However, King cautioned that Austen's chief translator in France, Madame Isabelle de Montolieu, had only the most rudimentary knowledge of English, and her translations were more of \"imitations\" than translations proper, as Montolieu depended upon assistants to provide a summary, which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austen's plots and characters. The first of the Austen novels to be published that credited her as the author was in France, when \"Persuasion\" was published in 1821 as \"La Famille Elliot ou L'Ancienne Inclination\".\n\nAusten learned that the Prince Regent admired her novels and kept a set at each of his residences. In November 1815, the Prince Regent's librarian James Stanier Clarke invited Austen to visit the Prince's London residence and hinted Austen should dedicate the forthcoming \"Emma\" to the Prince. Though Austen disliked the Prince Regent, she could scarcely refuse the request. Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent on the account of his womanising, gambling, drinking, spendthrift ways and generally disreputable behaviour. She later wrote \"\", a satiric outline of the \"perfect novel\" based on the librarian's many suggestions for a future Austen novel. Austen was greatly annoyed by Clarke's often pompous literary advice, and the \"Plan of A Novel\" parodying Clarke was intended as her revenge for all of the unwanted letters she had received from the royal librarian.\n\nIn mid-1815 Austen moved her work from Egerton to John Murray, a better known London publisher, who published \"Emma\" in December 1815 and a second edition of \"Mansfield Park\" in February 1816. \"Emma\" sold well but the new edition of \"Mansfield Park\" did poorly, and this failure offset most of the income from \"Emma\". These were the last of Austen's novels to be published during her lifetime.\n\nWhile Murray prepared \"Emma\" for publication, Austen began \"The Elliots\", later published as \"Persuasion\". She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition, shortly after the publication of \"Emma\", Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for \"Susan\" from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen's bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him deeply in debt and losing Edward, James, and Frank Austen large sums. Henry and Frank could no longer afford the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters.\n\nAusten was feeling unwell by early 1816, but ignored the warning signs. By the middle of that year, her decline was unmistakable, and she began a slow, irregular deterioration. The majority of biographers rely on Dr. Vincent Cope's 1964 retrospective diagnosis and list her cause of death as Addison's disease, although her final illness has also been described as resulting from Hodgkin's lymphoma. When her uncle died and left his entire fortune to his wife, effectively disinheriting his relatives, she suffered a relapse, writing, \"I am ashamed to say that the shock of my Uncle's Will brought on a relapse ... but a weak Body must excuse weak Nerves\".\n\nShe continued to work in spite of her illness. Dissatisfied with the ending of \"The Elliots\", she rewrote the final two chapters, which she finished on 6 August 1816. In January 1817 Austen began \"The Brothers\" (titled \"Sanditon\" when published in 1925), and completed twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817, probably due to illness. Todd describes \"Sanditon\"'s heroine, Diana Parker, as an \"energetic invalid\". In the novel, Austen mocked hypochondriacs and though she describes the heroine as \"bilious\", five days after abandoning the novel she wrote of herself that she was turning \"every wrong colour\" and living \"chiefly on the sofa\". She put down her pen on 18 March 1817, making a note of it.\n\nAusten made light of her condition, describing it as \"bile\" and rheumatism. As her illness progressed, she experienced difficulty walking and lacked energy; by mid-April she was confined to bed. In May Cassandra and Henry brought her to Winchester for treatment, by which time she suffered agonising pain and welcomed death. Austen died in Winchester on 18 July 1817, at the age of 41. Henry, through his clerical connections, arranged for his sister to be buried in the north aisle of the nave of Winchester Cathedral. The epitaph composed by her brother James praises Austen's personal qualities, expresses hope for her salvation and mentions the \"extraordinary endowments of her mind\", but does not explicitly mention her achievements as a writer.\n\nAfter Austen's death, Cassandra, Henry Austen and Murray arranged for the publication of \"Persuasion\" and \"Northanger Abbey\" as a set. Henry Austen contributed a \"Biographical Note\" which for the first time identified his sister as the author of the novels. Tomalin describes it as \"a loving and polished eulogy\". Sales were good for a year – only 321 copies remained unsold at the end of 1818.\n\nIn 1832 Richard Bentley purchased the remaining copyrights to all of her novels, and over the following winter published five illustrated volumes as part of his \"Standard Novels\" series. In October 1833, Bentley released the first collected edition of her works. Since then, Austen's novels have been continuously in print.\n\nAusten's works critique the sentimental novels of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. The earliest English novelists, Richardson, Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett, were followed by the school of sentimentalists and romantics such as Walter Scott, Horace Walpole, Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, Laurence Sterne and Oliver Goldsmith, whose style and genre Austen rejected, returning the novel on a \"slender thread\" to the tradition of Richardson and Fielding for a \"realistic study of manners\". In the mid-20 century, literary critics F. R. Leavis and Ian Watt placed her in the tradition of Richardson and Fielding; both believe that she used their tradition of \"irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".\n\nWalter Scott noted Austen's \"resistance to the trashy sensationalism of much of modern fiction – 'the ephemeral productions which supply the regular demand of watering places and circulating libraries'\". Yet her rejection of these genres is complex, as evidenced by \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Emma\". Similar to William Wordsworth, who excoriated the modern frantic novel in the \"Preface\" to his \"Lyrical Ballads\" (1800), Austen distances herself from escapist novels; the discipline and innovation she demonstrates is similar to his, and she shows \"that rhetorically less is artistically more.\" She eschewed popular Gothic fiction, stories of terror in which a heroine typically was stranded in a remote location, a castle or abbey (32 novels between 1784 and 1818 contain the word \"abbey\" in their title). Yet in \"Northanger Abbey\" she alludes to the trope, with the heroine, Catherine, anticipating a move to a remote locale. Rather than full-scale rejection or parody, Austen transforms the genre, juxtaposing reality, with descriptions of elegant rooms and modern comforts, against the heroine's \"novel-fueled\" desires. Nor does she completely denigrate Gothic fiction: instead she transforms settings and situations, such that the heroine is still imprisoned, yet her imprisonment is mundane and real – regulated manners and the strict rules of the ballroom. In \"Sense and Sensibility\" Austen presents characters who are more complex than in staple sentimental fiction, according to critic Keymer, who notes that although it is a parody of popular sentimental fiction, \"Marianne in her sentimental histrionics responds to the calculating world ... with a quite justifiable scream of female distress.\"\nRichardson's \"Pamela\", the prototype for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love story with a happy ending, written at a time women were beginning to have the right to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.\n\nAusten had a natural ear for speech and dialogue, according to scholar Mary Lascelles \"Few novelists can be more scrupulous than Jane Austen as to the phrasing and thoughts of their characters.\" Techniques such as fragmentary speech suggest a character's traits and their tone; \"syntax and phrasing rather than vocabulary\" is utilised to indicate social variants. Dialogue reveals a character's mood – frustration, anger, happiness – each treated differently and often through varying patterns of sentence structures. When Elizabeth Bennett rejects Darcy, her stilted speech and the convoluted sentence structure reveals that he has wounded her:\nFrom the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\nAusten's plots highlight women's traditional dependence on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. As an art form, the 18th-century novel lacked the seriousness of its equivalents from the 19th century, when novels were treated as \"the natural vehicle for discussion and ventilation of what mattered in life\". Rather than delving too deeply into the psyche of her characters, Austen enjoys them and imbues them with humour, according to critic John Bayley. He believes that the well-spring of her wit and irony is her own attitude that comedy \"is the saving grace of life\". Part of Austen's fame rests on the historical and literary significance that she was the first woman to write great comic novels. Samuel Johnson's influence is evident, in that she follows his advice to write \"a representation of life as may excite mirth\".\n\nHer humour comes from her modesty and lack of superiority, allowing her most successful characters, such as Elizabeth Bennet, to transcend the trivialities of life, which the more foolish characters are overly absorbed in. Austen used comedy to explore the individualism of women's lives and gender relations, and she appears to have used it to find the goodness in life, often fusing it with \"ethical sensibility\", creating artistic tension. Critic Robert Polhemus writes, \"To appreciate the drama and achievement of Austen, we need to realize how deep was her passion for both reverence and ridicule ... and her comic imagination reveals both the harmonies and the telling contradictions of her mind and vision as she tries to reconcile her satirical bias with her sense of the good.\"\n\nAs Austen's works were published anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels. Sir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, contributed one anonymously. Using the review as a platform to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel, he praised Austen's realism. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately set the tone for almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.\n\nBecause Austen's novels did not conform to Romantic and Victorian expectations that \"powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing\", 19th-century critics and audiences preferred the works of Charles Dickens and George Eliot. In a rare sympathetic review, in this case of \"Emma\" in 1815, Sir Walter Scott wrote that book displayed \"the art of copying from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the reader, instead of the splendid scenes from an imaginary world, a correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\". Though Scott was positive, Austen's work did not match the prevailing aesthetic values of the Romantic \"zeitgeist\". Her novels were republished in Britain from the 1830s and sold at a steady rate, but they were not bestsellers. The first French critic who paid notice to Austen was Philarète Chasles who completely dismissed her as a writer, giving her two sentences in an 1842 essay on the influence of Sir Walter Scott, calling her a boring, imitative writer who wrote nothing of substance. Apart from Chasles, Austen was almost completely ignored in France until 1878.\n\nAusten had many admiring readers in the 19th century who considered themselves part of a literary elite. Philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes expressed this viewpoint in a series of enthusiastic articles published in the 1840s and 1850s. This theme continued later in the century with novelist Henry James, who referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as among \"the fine painters of life\".\n\nThe publication of James Edward Austen-Leigh's \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" in 1869 introduced Austen to a wider public as \"dear aunt Jane\", the respectable maiden aunt. Publication of the \"Memoir\" spurred the reissue of Austen's novels – the first popular editions were released in 1883 and fancy illustrated editions and collectors' sets quickly followed. Author and critic Leslie Stephen described the popular mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\". In 1878, the French critic Léon Boucher published the essay \"Le Roman Classique en Angleterre\", where he called Austen a \"genius\", which was the first time that epithet had been used in France to describe Austen. The first proper translation of Austen into French that was completely faithful to the original occurred in 1899 when Félix Fénéon translated \"Northanger Abbey\" into French as \"Catherine Moreland\". Around the start of the 20th century, members of the literary elite reacted against the popularisation of Austen. They referred to themselves as \"Janeites\" in order to distinguish themselves from the masses who did not properly understand her works. For example, Henry James responded negatively to what he described as \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's \"intrinsic merit and interest\". The American literary critic A. Walton Litz noted that the \"anti-Janites\" in the 19th and 20th centuries comprise a formidable literary squad of Mark Twain, Henry James, Charlotte Bronte, D.H. Lawrence and Kingsley Amis, but in \"every case the adverse judgement merely reveals the special limitations or eccentricities of the critic, leaving Jane Austen relativity untouched\".\n\nSeveral of Austen's works have been subject to academic study. The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883, by George Pellew, a student at Harvard University. The first examination came from a 1911 essay by Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley. In his essay, Bradley groups Austen's novels into \"early\" and \"late\" works, a distinction still used by scholars today. The first academic books devoted to Austen in France was \"Jane Austen\" by Paul and Kate Rague published in 1914, where the Ragues set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously. The same year, Léonie Villard published \"Jane Austen, Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres\", which was originally her PhD thesis, marking the first time that Austen had subjected to a serious academic study in France. The second examination in English was R. W. Chapman's 1923 edition of Austen's collected works. Not only was it the first scholarly edition of Austen's works, it was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works.\n\nWith the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles's \"Jane Austen and Her Art\", the academic study of Austen took hold. Lascelles's innovative work included an analysis of the books Austen read and the effect of her reading on her work, an extended analysis of Austen's style, and her \"narrative art\". Concern arose that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric, a debate that has continued since.\n\nThe period since World War II has seen more scholarship on Austen using a diversity of critical approaches, including feminist theory, and perhaps most controversially, postcolonial theory. The continuing disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern Janeites, and the academic appreciation of Austen has widened considerably. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Austen was in disfavor with the authorities who only wanted Western authors to be published in translation whose work could be presented as representing the West in a negative light, and Austen was regarded as too \"frivolous\" for this purpose. As hostile as the treatment of Austen was in the 1950s, it paled besides the treatment of her books during the \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\" in China between 1966–69, when Austen was banned as a \"British bourgeois imperialist\" author. In the late 1970s, Austen was allowed to be published in China, where her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people sometimes want to read books for enjoyment instead of dialectical purposes. A sign of the way that Austen can still spark debate can be seen when the American English professor Gene Koppel mentioned in a lecture that Austen and her family were \"Tories of the deepest dye\" [the Tories were the conservative party while the Whigs were the liberal party], a statement which greatly upset many of Koppel's liberal students, who much to his amusement, complained to him how was it possible that Austen was a conservative?. The conservative Koppel noted several feminist authors such as Claudia Johnson and Mollie Sandock were claiming Austen for their own cause. Citing the work of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Koppel argued that different people can and do react to the same work of literature in different ways as art is always a subjective discipline as various people have their standards for evaluating literature. As such, Koppel argued that competing interpretations of Austen's work, provided that they are grounded in readings of her work are all equally valid, and so it is equally possible to see Austen as a feminist critiquing Regency society and as a conservative upholding the values of Regency society.\n\nAusten's novels have resulted in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's \"Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance\", and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, \"The Bennets\" (1901). The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.\n\nFrom 1995 a large number of Austen adaptations began to appear, with Ang Lee's film of \"Sense and Sensibility\", for which screenwriter and star Emma Thompson won an Academy Award, and the BBC's immensely popular TV mini-series \"Pride and Prejudice\", starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. A 2005 British production of \"Pride and Prejudice\", directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, was followed in 2007 by ITV's \"Mansfield Park\", \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", and in 2016 by \"Love & Friendship\", a film version of \"Lady Susan\" that borrowed the title of Austen's \"Love and \" [sic].\n\nNovels\n\nUnfinished fiction\n\nOther works\n\nJuvenilia – Volume the First (1787–1793)\n\nJuvenilia – Volume the Second (1787–1793)\n\nJuvenilia – Volume the Third (1787–1793)\n\n\n",
                "Jane Austen in popular culture\n\nThe author Jane Austen, as well as her works, have been represented in popular culture in a variety of forms.\n\nJane Austen (16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist whose social commentary and masterly use of both free indirect speech and irony eventually made her one of the most influential and honoured novelists in English literature. In popular culture, Austen's novels and her personal life have been adapted into book illustration (starting in 1833), dramatizations (starting in 1895), Hollywood film (starting in 1940), television (starting in 1938), and professional theatre (starting in 1901), with adaptations varying greatly in their faithfulness to the original.\n\nBooks and scripts that use the general storyline of Austen's novels but change or otherwise modernise the story also became popular at the end of the 20th century. For example, \"Clueless\" (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of \"Emma\", which takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series, and furthermore near the beginning of the 21st century, nearly two centuries after her death, her works still inform popular culture and cosplay.\nRobert Irvine, a British scholar, wrote that the works of Austen remain a popular source for film makers, who eschew Austen's narrator, rendering a true adaptation impossible. Again, Austen's use of free indirect discourse, where the thoughts of the characters are summarized by the narrator, is generally not followed in the films. It is for this reason that many Austen scholars dislike the 1995 version of \"Sense and Sensibility\" because the absence of a narrator 'glorifies the romantic conventions that Austen deflates'. Likewise, for this reason, many Austen scholars approve of \"Clueless\", an adaptation of \"Emma\" set in a high school in Beverly Hills circa 1995, as the character of Cher Horowitz (the film's version of Emma Woodhouse) narrates several scenes. This is seen as the closest approximation of Austen's style in cinema yet done.\n\nIrvine commented that because cinema and books are different mediums that the best way of resolving this problem was and is for filmmakers to concentrate on the main strength of cinema, namely its visuality, as cinema can depict what the books can only ask the reader to imagine. A recurring image in Austen films is that of women gazing through a window to the outside world, or walking in the countryside. The critic Julianne Pidduck in her essay “Of Windows and Country Walks” argues the former image symbolizes repression and a woman’s lot in Regency England, being trapped in a patriarchal society while the latter image symbolises freedom. The critic Mary Favret in her 2000 essay “Being True to Jane Austen” argued that because film is literally just moving pictures it resists the tendency of photography to have a fixed image, suggesting a world where change is always possible. In this connection Favret praised the 1995 version of \"Persuasion\" as the film used a wandering camera to capture in a kaleidoscopic way Anne Eliot’s unexpressed romantic-sexual feelings even when Anne (Amanda Root) remains still and silent. Irvine noted film adaptations of Austen’s work often used the physicality of the actors to show the sexual desires of the characters that Austen herself only hinted at, with Irving calling a “particularly notorious” example of this being the scene from the 1995 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\", where Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) dives into a pond and emerges with wet clothes clinging to his body before a clearly interested Miss Bennet (Jennifer Ehle).\n\nThe emphasis on the physicality of the actors to express emotions together with abandonment of the narrator has divided critics. Rebecca Dickson has complained that “strong and self-sufficient Elinor” of \"Sense and Sensibility\" became “a girl woman with unexpressed emotions who must learn to demonstrate them” in the Ang Lee film. By contrast, Penny Gay praised the 1995 version of \"Sense and Sensibility\" for portraying “the characters’ experiences as \"bodies\"'” as offering up a filmic version of the experiences of women Irvine argued that the emphasis on physicality of the actors is necessary once the voice of the narrator is eliminated as films used movements, looks and gestures to express emotions, requiring “…that all characters become physically and transparently expressive in a way that only problem cases such as Marianne Dashwood indulge in the novels”. Cheryl Nixon defended Mr. Darcy’s precipitous plunge into the pond as necessary to show the viewer that he was capable of depths of emotional and physical passion that the novel only implied to help explain why Miss Bennet falls in love with him.\n\nAnother issue concerning adaptations of Austen is that of gender, especially the portrayal of women. Some critics, such as Devoney Looser, have argued that by portraying strong women who are intelligent and socially adept and by emphasising the theme of sisterhood both literally between sisters and metaphorically between female friends the Austen films become feminist films. Other critics such as Kristen Samuelian and Shannon Wooden have argued that Austen films are in fact “post-feminist” films where women first encounter patriarchy before going on to live happier ever after with the men of their dreams in the patriarchal society of Regency England. Wooden also argued the 1996 version of \"Emma\", \"Clueless\", \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Persuasion\" all use the food imagery of the Austen books, where a fasting is a form of female protest, but in contrast to the books “…juxtapose food with representations or discussions of physical beauty, making a very late twentieth-century connection between not eating and feminine social and sexual success”. Other critics like Martine Vioret have noted Austen films tended “to cater to female desires and to the female gaze” by their focus on the bodies of actors, dressed in close-fitting breeches in a way that fetishises the male body at a time when the male body was still the \"locus of the beautiful\". It is often noted that Austen films tended to portray the male body in a way that is normally associated with the filmic depiction of the female body as a source of pleasure to the male viewer. Irvine described the Austen films as a fantasy for women, with, for example, the character of Mr. Darcy displaying an \"absolute and unconditioned male need for a woman\".\n\nAnother issue around the Austen films is their relation to the question of English and British national identity. In Britain, the Austen films are seen as a part of the “heritage industry”-an overlapping collection of government ministries, pressure groups and charities that seeks to preserve the “national heritage” by protecting landscapes and old buildings. Irvine observed that the buildings selected for preservation tended to be estates, castles and manor houses associated with the elite, which sends the message that the story of Britain is the story of its elites. The Austen films which are focused on the visual splendor of Regency England are seen as “heritage films” that are an extension of the “heritage industry”. Prior to 1995, television adaptations of Austen tended to be done on the cheap, but the 1995 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" was an expensive production that was filmed on location in the English countryside with Lyme Park playing Pemberly that was a great ratings success, settling the benchmark for subsequent productions. Afterwards, it became \"de rigueur\" for Austen films to be visually sumptuous, no-expenses spared productions while the National Trust billed Lyme Park as the centerpiece of the “Pemberley Trail” for Janeites to go on a pilgrimage. Because the Austen adaptations are seen as celebrating a certain ideal of an “eternal England”, there is a tendency to see both the film and television productions as implicitly conservative productions glorifying the ordered society of Regency England.\n\nHowever, Irvine has cautioned against seeing all of the Austen films as carrying a conservative message Citing the Marxist historian Raphael Samuel, Irvine argued that Britain’s heritage belongs to everyone and the memory of the past is used by disadvantaged groups just as much by advantaged groups to construct an “useable” version of British history. For instance, many of the Austen films are seen as offering a feminist critique of patriarchy of the Regency period. The leftist historian Edward Neill praised the 1996 television version of \"Emma\" released on ITV as superior to the film version of \"Emma\" released by Miramax that same year. Neill pointed out that in the Hollywood version of \"Emma\" there are no servants while there are vast armies of servants in the background in the ITV version, many of them performing patently absurd tasks. Likewise, Neill noted that the poor are nowhere to be seen in the Hollywood version of \"Emma\" while in the ITV version there are all sorts of starving people in the background Another critic Roger Sales noted that \"frequent women in windows imaginary\" suggested that the country estates of the gentry and aristocracy were in fact “genteel prisons” for women, which Irvine argued was inconsistent with the claim that the Austen films were a conservative fantasy of a lost idyll of an ordered society. The 1999 version of \"Mansfield Park\" by the Canadian director Patricia Rozema gave Fanny Price (Frances O'Connor) dialogue from some of Austen’s especially acerbic letters, attacked Sir Thomas Bertram as a tyrant for owning slaves on his estate in Antigua and added in a quasi-lesbian scene not in the book where Mary Crawford waxes eloquent to Price about how only women can really understand the pleasures that their bodies can produce, which seems to be Crawford's way of trying to seduce Price. Irvine praised Rozema's version of \"Mansfield Park\" as a way that adaptions of Austen can be used to offer a critical picture of the society of Regency England where power was concentrated into the hands of upper-class men who belonged to the Church of England and some of whom owned slaves on plantations in the Caribbean.\n\nA particular issue for Austen adaptations is the way Austen has become a form of “cultural capital” for one to assert one’s social superiority. In this regard, Austen has become a “brand”, which is especially potent as the “Austen brand” has both high cultural connotations and mass appeal. Irvine commented that as painful as this may be to English professors like himself, at least part of the mass appeal of the Austen films today is due to a “perceived continuity” between Austen’s novels and the modern “bodice rippers”; historical pulp novels published by such companies as Silhouette, Harlequin and Mills and Boon. A recurring complaint made by critics concerns the “harlequinization” of Austen on the silver screen, which is seen as cheapening and dumbing down Austen for a mass audience. However, Irvine noted that in Austen’s own lifetime, her work was popular, but seen as low culture, being lumped in at British libraries together with “popular fiction” books that were the ancestors of the Harlequin romances. The idea that Austen was a high culture writer only started later, and certainly the appeal of the Austen films to many today seems to be that they are seen as a high culture version of Harlequin romances. Andrew Davies, the producer who has made a career of adopting Austen for film, has confessed as much to the charge of “harlequinization”, saying he liked \"a bit of bodice-rippling\" when he turned Austen's books into films. The American critic Dianne F. Sadoff wrote disapproving of Davies's efforts to add in the scenes that he asserts that \"Austen couldn't write\" but claims that she wanted to write. Sadoff took issue with the 2007 version of \"Northanger Abbey\" in which Davies added scenes of Catherine Moreland imagining being kidnapped and subjected to semi-consensual sado-masochistic sex, and the 2008 version of \"Sense and Sensibility\" which begins with a seduction scene mentioned as only happening a long time ago in the novel.\n\nA testament to the appeal of the Austen films is that the most lucrative market for these films today is the United States, not the United Kingdom. On 3 August 2007, the debut of \"Becoming Jane\" took in almost $1 million US in its first weekend, low compared to \"Superbad\" which took $31 million US in its opening weekend the following week, but a highly respectable showing for a heritage film set in Regency England and starring a mostly British cast unfamiliar to American audiences. \"Becoming Jane\" ran for ten weeks in the United States and ultimately took in a profit of $19 million US. The American scholar Dianne Sadoff wrote that Hollywood likes Austen film adaptions because Hollywood producers love films with an audience that exists in advance, and as millions of people have read Austen's novels all over the world, making Austen films into the most desirable of films, the \"premier pre-sold product\". Furthermore, Sadoff noted that Austen films are popular with a female audience that ranges in age from teenage girls to middle-aged women, instead of appealing to a narrow demographic. Sadoff wrote the most recent adaptions of Austen were done in a way that was calculated to appeal to young women. Sadoff used as examples the 2005 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Keira Knightley, which brought \"swashbuckler girlfriend sex appeal and postfeminist agency\" to Austen, and \"Becoming Jane\" starring Anne Hathaway, which presented Austen as a modern career woman who just happened to be living in Georgian England. Sadoff wrote that both films have heroines with \"...bared chests and swelling cleavage above Regency gown decolletage\", perfectly \"coiled hair\" and looks of \"wide-eyed intensity\" that were meant both to arouse teenage boys and excite envy in teenage girls.\n\nAt least part of appeal of Austen films in the modern United States is that they deal directly with the subject of class, which American filmmakers generally prefer to avoid. Americans like to see their nation as a meritocracy where everyone regardless of their skin color, sex, and income level is completely equal with exactly the same opportunities in life regardless of who they are, and the suggestion that some Americans might be disadvantaged because of their race, sex and/or income level is a painful one, implying their nation is not living up to its ideals. American filmmakers often avoid confronting the subject of class especially; by contrast the Austen films set in Regency England are far away enough both in time and in geography to raise the subject of class without imposing discomfort on an American audience. Likewise, in Georgian Britain, the only roles possible for a woman in polite society were those of a wife and mother, which means that Austen films can deal starkly with sexism in ways that films set in contemporary times often do not. Irvine noted in \"Clueless\", the characters are only concerned with being “cool”, as there is almost no suggestion in the film of any class, racial and sexual barriers in southern California, circa 1995, as the only social line that matters is the one between \"cool\" and \"uncool\". Only with the minor character of the put-upon El Salvadoran maid who works for the Horowitz family, whom Cher keeps calling a \"Mexican\", does \"Clueless\" imply that there might be some inequality in modern America. However, Irvine noted that American audiences cannot entirely embrace the social hierarchy of Georgian England, based as it was on land and birth, and instead the 1996 version of \"Emma\" offered up a hierarchy based on consumption and luxury conferred by access to cash, in short a society very much like the modern United States. \n\nOne of the few American Austen films to confront class directly in a modern settling was the 1990 film \"Metropolitan\" by the American director Whit Stillman, where a group of wealthy “old money” New Yorkers talk openly about how Austen is part of their “cultural capital” that sets them apart from vulgar “new money”. \"Metropolitan\" is a very loose adaption of \"Mansfield Park\", reset in New York, circa 1989. A particular point \"Metropolitan\" made was how Austen by the 1980s had become part of the “cultural capital” of the “old money” Anglophile East Coast elite that they used to distinguish themselves from people like Donald Trump, with one character approvingly quoting Lionel Trilling's remark that \"not to like Jane Austen is to put oneself under suspicion...of a want of breeding\". Irvine argued that Austen offers a particular appeal to American conservatives in that the sort of ordered society that they used to openly admire and were nostalgic for, namely that of the South up to 1865, is now racially unacceptable to admire given that the antebellum Southern economy was based on slavery. Irvine noted that both the 1935 book and the 1939 film of \"Gone With The Wind\" were extremely popular at the time, but today are rather controversial given the way that both versions of \"Gone With The Wind\" glorify a society based on slavery and white supremacy. \"Gone With The Wind\" was inspired at least in concept by D. W. Griffith's 1915 film \"The Birth of a Nation\", which in its turn was based on the violently racist 1905 novel \"\" by Thomas Dixon Jr.. Margaret Mitchell, the author of \"Gone With The Wind\" was greatly influenced by Dixon's novels, which misrepresented the Reconstruction era as a nightmarish time where blacks, not longer slaves, ran amok raping and murdering white women with impunity, and openly admitted that \"Gone With The Wind\" would not had been possible without Dixon's books, all of which she had read. Irvine noted that the 1940 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" released by MGM moved the story from Regency England to Victorian times to make it seem similar to \"Gone With The Wind\", and the film was marketed at the time as an epic 19th century love story analogous to \"Gone With The Wind\". There were no slaves in late Georgian Britain (Lord Justice Mansfield declared slavery illegal in the United Kingdom in 1772)-through slavery was the basis of the economies of the British West Indian colonies until 1833-making Regency England a more acceptable ordered society to be nostalgic for in modern America. Irvine however cautioned that one “should not be too quick to attribute the success of the Austen adaptations in the US to an implicitly racist Anglophila”. Irvine argued that the success of Austen in America was due to the way she could be presented as offering “cultural capital” to those who were and are willing to take the time to read her novels, and to a nostalgia for the perceived better and simpler times of Regency England.\n\nAusten is generally very popular across Asia, not just in South Asia. \n\nThe global appeal of Austen today can be seen in that Bollywood regularly produces versions of Austen's books reset in modern India and adjusted to the style of Indian films, which forbid kissing and always include a number of musical numbers regardless of whether they have any connection to the plot. Austen's books often feature match-making parents, which gives her stories a particular resonance in India, where the majority of marriages are still arranged today. The British colony of India, which was ruled by the East India Company until 1858, and as a Crown colony from 1858 to 1947, came to include all of modern India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. English as an academic discipline began in 19th century India as British officials of the Raj set out to teach English to their Indian subjects, and as a result, any middle-class Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi from the time of the Raj until the present is familiar with Austen's books, giving her books the sort of \"cultural capital\" appeal in modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh similar to the United States. Austen's stories which feature \"love marriages\" as the heroine marries a man with whom she falls in love with, and gains the approval of her parents in the process, are very popular with women from middle-class Indian families, the vast majority of whom are in or are destined for arranged marriages set up by their parents to men that they generally don't know. In India, \"Sense and Sensibility\" has turned into the 2000 Tamil language film \"Kandukondain Kandukondain\" and the 2014 Hindi language soap opera \"Kumkum Bhagya\"; \"Emma\" has adopted as the 2010 film \"Aisha\"; and \"Pride and Prejudice\" into the 2004 film \"Bride and Prejudice\". In \"Bride and Prejudice\", Elizabeth Bennet becomes Lalita Bakshi (Aishwarya Rai), the daughter of a Sikh grandee living in a decaying mansion left over by the Raj in Amritsar; Mr. Darcy is an American billionaire visiting the Punjab to attend a wedding; Mr. Bingley becomes Mr. Balraj, a second generation Indo-British lawyer who has come to the Punjab in search of a traditional Sikh woman to marry; Lieutenant Wickham becomes Johnny Wickham, a British backpacker looking for the \"real India\"; and Mr. Collins becomes Mr. Kholi, a sanctimonious Sikh who has made a fortune in Silicon Valley.\n\nThe largest market for Austen's books are in India and Pakistan, where the themes of \"marrying off\" young women to rid families of the burdens of supporting them, the importance of the family as a social unit, dowries as a factor in marriage negotiations and inheritance laws that favor males all address issues that are relevant in both India and Pakistan. Both India and Pakistan have large Austen societies with the Pakistani Austen Society hosting events for \"Jovial Janeites” that feature “Austentatious tea parties” and “chai and chatter”. Laaleen Khan, the founder of the Jane Austen Society of Pakistan, told \"The Economist\" that Austen is relevant in the Indian subcontinent because society in South Asia is full of “disapproving Lady Catherine de Bourgh-esque society aunties, rakish Wickhams and Willoughbys, pretentious Mrs Eltons and holier-than thou Mr Collins types”. \n\nAusten was unknown in Japan until the Meiji Restoration of 1867 opened Japan up to Western influence, and even then Austen was largely ignored. Japanese translators preferred adventure stories from the West, which fitted in better with the stories of samurai, which were the most popular novels in Meiji Japan. The Greek/Irish scholar Lafcadio Hearn, who became the first Western scholar to teach in Japan, warned his Japanese students in his lectures that they would not like Austen, as the sort of violence which was normal in samurai stories was completely absent in Austen's novels. The first Japanese critic to draw attention to Austen was the influential writer Natsume Sōseki who in his 1907 book \"A Theory of Literature\" wrote that: “Anyone who is unable to appreciate Austen will be unable to understand the beauty of realism.” Sōseki, who was fluent in English, lived in London from 1900 to 1903, where he first discovered Austen, who he regarded as having achieved his ideal of \"sokuten kyoshi\" (literally “follow Heaven, forsake the self”-a writer should follow his/her instincts and write stories that have no traces of their own personality in them). At the time of his death in 1916, Sōseki was writing a novel \"Meian\" (\"Light and Darkness\"), which reset \"Pride and Prejudice\" in Taishō era Japan. Unlike \"Pride and Prejudice\", the couple Tsuda and O-Nobu are already married at the beginning of the novel, and Sōseki traced how pride and prejudice was pushing their marriage apart rather than be an obstacle to be overcome as Mr. Darcy courted Elizabeth Bennet in Austen's story. Sōseki followed Austen in using everyday life and apparently banal conversations to trace how the mutual pride of Tsuda and O-Nobu push them apart despite the fact that they both love each other.\n\nAusten was first translated into Japanese in 1926 when Nogami Toyoichirō and his wife Nogami Yaeko translated \"Pride and Prejudice\". Nogami Yaeko liked Austen so much that she published a novel in 1928, \"Machiko\", set in Taishō era Japan, that featured the heroine Machiko who was inspired by Elizabeth Bennet. \"Machiko\" also features a radical named Seki who resembles Wickham who castigates the social order imposed by the \"kokutai\" and whom Machiko almost marries until she learns that he impregnated her friend Yoneko whom he was seeing at the same time that he was courting her. The hero of the book is Kawai, an archeologist and the wealthy heir to the Kawai Financial Group, who makes a determined pursuit of Machiko despite her repeated rejections of him on both social and political grounds, and finally proves himself worthy of her by giving up his fortune to help out the impoverished and striking workers at a factory his family owes. Unlike \"Pride and Prejudice\" where the war with France only exists in the background, \"Machiko\" deals directly with turmoil of Taishō era Japan where strikes were frequent, much of the younger \"intelligentsia\" were questioning the \"kokutai\" and admired the Russian Revolution, and the police waged a vigorous campaign against those accused of \"thought crimes\". In 1925, the Imperial Diet passed the Peace Preservation Law, which made the very act of thinking about \"altering the \"kokutai\"\" a crime; the specific thoughts that were made illegal were republicanism, pacifism, and advocating the end of private property. Those found by the police to be thinking these forbidden thoughts served lengthy prison sentences and were subjected to \"Tenkō\" (\"changing direction\"), a process of brain-washing where left-wing activists were brain-washed to worship the Emperor as a living god. In \"Machiko\", which was published at a time when censorship was much less stricter in Japan is set in the midst of these struggles as Machiko and her fellow activists are constantly having to avoid the police. At same time, Nogami attacked the double standard of male radicals who preached justice for the masses, but refused to treat women as equals, seeing the duty of female radicals just to be their obliging bedmates, and nothing more. In \"Pride and Prejudice\", Wickham marries Lydia Bennet, which makes him part of the family so Elizabeth Bennet has to be civil to him, while in \"Machiko\", Machiko repudiates Seki outright, saying his dishonesty and his contempt for women makes him unworthy of her.\n\nAusten went out of favor in Japan during the militarist period in the early Showa era (1931-1945) when a xenophobic, ultra-nationalist mood prevailed, and the government discouraged people from reading foreign books. But during the period of the American occupation (1945-52), almost every Austen book was translated into Japanese except \"Mansfield Park\" (which was not translated until 1978), and Austen started to be widely taught in Japanese high schools. The translation of \"Sense and Sensibility\" in 1947, followed by a translation of \"Pride and Prejudice\" in 1950 were published by the prestigious publishing house Iwanami Shoten, and both books sold very well. The success of the Iwanami versions of \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\" was the moment that Austen became respectable in Japan. In 1963, the critic Yamamoto Kenkichi, in his essay “The Smile of \"Pride and Prejudice\"” that proved to be influential, criticized Japanese literature for being overtly solemn and praised Austen for her “natural ease”, which led him to conclude: “Collins, Wickham, Mrs. Bennet, Lady Catherine, how she turns her laughter on these minor characters. They are observed with some malice, certainly, but in a pleasant, mischievous, irreverent manner which ultimately accords salvation to even these fools”. Austen has been regarded as a major writer in Japan since the 1950s, and in 2007, the Jane Austen Society of Japan was founded to provide a space for Japanese Janeites. In 2015-2016, \"manga\" versions of \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"Emma\", and \"Sense and Sensibility\" were published in Japan.\n\nA Japanese writer very much influenced by Austen was Yumiko Kurahashi. In her 1971 novel \"Yume no ukihashi\" (\"The Bridge of Dreams\"), the heroine Keiko is a graduate student working on a thesis concerning Austen's books, an interest that paralleled the author's as \"Yume no ukihashi\" is in many ways a resetting of an Austen novel in modern Japan. However, the climax of the novel where Keiko learns that parents of her boyfriend Kōichi and her parents have been engaged in a four-sided sexual relationship for many years, and Kōichi might very well be her brother, is unlike of the denouements of any of Austen's books. The Japanese scholar Ebine Hiroshi described \"Yume no ukihashi\" as a fusion between an Austen novel and the fascination with breaking sexual taboos like incest which often characterizes Japanese literature. Even after learning that Kōichi is quite possibly her brother, Keiko cannot give him up as their souls have crossed the \"bridge of dreams\" to “the other side of the world” where they have been fused together, which leads her despite being married to another man to engage a \"ménage à quatre\" with Kōichi and his wife; the novel ends with Keiko meeting Kōichi in Kyoto while her husband calls her to say he is spending the night with Kōichi's wife. Hiroshi wrote in \"Yume no ukihashi\" Kurahashi created a heroine, Keiko, who is a many ways an Austen heroine with her quiet nature and calm dignity that hides a passionate, romantic side while at the same time the book was concerned with the mystical \"other side\", a supernatural world of power, mystery and dread that can only be glimpsed which co-exists alongside our world, a uniquely Japanese concern that would have been alien to Austen.\n\nIn Turkey Austen was first introduced at the so-called \"foreign schools\" for foreigners domiciled in the Ottoman Empire, in which Turks were also allowed to enroll in the late 19th century. Initially, Turks only read Austen in the English original, and the first novel to be translated into Turkish was \"Sense and Sensibility\" as \"Sağduyu ve Duyarlık\" in two volumes in 1946 and 1948. Austen first came to widespread notice in Turkey in the late 1960s when Nihal Yeğinobalı started translating Austen with her first translation being \"Pride and Prejudice\" as \"Aşk ve Gurur\" (\"Love and Pride\"). Yeğinobalı's translations of Austen removed much of the irony in the original, replaced the free indirect discourse with speeches by the characters and made changes to the plot and characters to make Austen fit into the style of popular Turkish romances. Yeğinobalı's translations are the ones by which Austen is best known in Turkey. The Turkish scholar Rana Tekcan wrote that Yeğinobalı was not particularly faithful to Austen, but it is very difficult to translate English novels into Turkish as in the Turkish language the predicate always comes at the end of a sentence, which is not the case in English. It was not 2006 that Austen was first translated properly into Turkish when \"Pride and Prejudice\" was translated as \"Gurur ve Önyargı\" by Hamdi Koç, who at present is engaged in translating the rest of Austen's novels into Turkish. \"Gurur ve Önyargı\" sold out in its first year, and a second edition was issued in 2007, which Tekcan used to argue that many Turks wanted a proper version of Austen in their own language. Austen's status in modern Turkey can be seen in the Wikipedia-like website \"Ekşi Sözlük\" (\"The Sourtimes Dictionary\"), when anonymous contributors write articles on various subjects; typing Jane Austen on the \"Ekşisözlük\" produces comments such as “Jane Austen is for those who are ashamed to read romance novels”and “The characters that Jane Austen created still live in the likes of a neighbor who is dying to get her daughters married to rich men.”.\n\nSuch is the appeal of Austen in Asia that during the period when Korea was a Japanese colony (1905-1945) Austen was first translated into Korean as the Japanese colonial administration- which always justified itself on the grounds that Korea was hopelessly backward and in need of Japanese rule to progress- sought to use Austen's books as an example of the sort of cultural progress the country was experiencing under Japanese rule. It should be noted that in Asia during this period, books by Western authors were always seen as embodying modernity and progress, and thus Austen in colonial Korea was presented as a symbol of modernity, at least during the so-called \"Cultural Rule\" period (1920-37) when Japanese rule was more moderate as compared to prior and succeeding periods. The South Korean writer Park Wansuh wrote two novels influenced by \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"A Faltering Afternoon\" (1977) and \"Pride and Fantasy\" (1980) both set in Yusin era South Korea. In \"A Faltering Afternoon\", three sisters from a lower middle-class background who resemble Elizabeth, Jane and Lydia Bennet respectively find that their only hope of social-economic success comes with marrying the right men. Unlike \"Pride and Prejudice\", two of the Ho sisters' relationships end unhappily and only Ho Malhi, the sister who resembles Elizabeth Bennet, ends up well with her choice of a man. Hŏ Sŏng, the once successful small businessman who was now struggling as the \"chaebol\" came to dominate the South Korean economy in the 1970s, resembled Mr. Bennet as he watches his daughters' \"quest\" to find the ideal husband, through unlike him, Hŏ ends up committing suicide on the day of his daughter's wedding. In \"Pride and Fantasy\", Park took on one of the most painful subjects in South Korea at the time, namely the fact that the \"Chinilpa\" elite who had served Japan in the colonial period was the same elite that ruled South Korea in the 1970s. General Park Chung-hee, the military dictator of South Korea from 1961 until his assassination in 1979, had started his career as an officer in the Manchukuo Army and served with the Kwantung Army in its campaigns to \"pacify\" Manchukuo. During Park's rule, he applied the same methods he learned in Japanese service to his own people, and in the 1960s-70s, South Korea was one of the world's worst human rights abusers. \"Pride and Fantasy\" concerns the relationship between two men, one of whom is a male version of Elizabeth Bennet, and the other whom resembles Mr. Darcy. The Bennet-like Namsang came from a family that resisted Japanese rule and were ruined as a result while the Darcy-like Hyǒn comes from a \"chinilpa\" family that became fabulously rich by collaborating with the Japanese. \n\nThe character of Elizabeth Bennet with her stubborn individualism and nonconformity with social norms was popular in South Korea during the stifling rule of General Park, at least in part as a reaction to his attempts to crush individualism and promote conformity. However, the South Korean scholar Park You-me noted that for a certain generation of Korean Janeites like her mother, who lived through the years 1937-45, when the Japanese state tried to stamp out the Korean language and culture, mobilized society for total war, and forced thousands of Korean young women into the \"comfort women corps\", turning women's bodies literally into commodities to be exploited, leading to a situation where :\"My mother's suspicion of Austen's moral authority is representative of Korean female readers' reception of Austen's novels following the Japanese occupation of Korea and the Korean War\". Park wrote that as much as her mother loved Austen that she always regarded Austen's novels as fantasy works, depicting a world that had never existed and could never exist ever, as it was the fate of women to be exploited and abused. In 2014, the highest rated TV series in South Korea was \"Omangwa Pyungyeon\" (\"Lawless World\"), a resettling of \"Pride and Prejudice\" in modern South Korea in a prosecutor's office. \"Omangwa Pyungyeon\" which aired between October 2014-January 2015 concerned a relationship between a passionate novice prosecutor and her more experienced and snooty colleague. Beyond the specific adaptions, many critics have noted that the heroes of Korean soap operas owe much to Mr. Darcy.\n\nThe Iranian writer Azar Nafisi recalled teaching Austen secretly in Iran in the 1990s (in the Islamic Republic of Iran Austen is banned as a \"degenerate\" Western writer) to a group of teenage girls who loved Austen's stories which feature women who fall in love with men who are worthy of their affections, which was so different from their own lives. Nafisi noted in the Islamic Republic of Iran where wife-beating is legal, \"love is forbidden, banished from the public sphere\" and sex is \"violently suppressed\", her students fell in love with an author whose books feature female \"rebels\" who defiantly say \"no\" to \"silly mothers\", \"incompetent fathers\" and a \"rigidly orthodox society\", and moreover get away with it. An American academic who went on \"Radio Times\" web broadcast to talk about Austen recalled being besieged with callers of an Asian background. One Iranian woman, living in the United States, called in to say she had first read Austen after her teenage daughter brought home \"Sense and Sensibility\", which made her cry as she had experienced nothing like this in her own culture, where dating is forbidden and marriages are arranged. Another caller was a Chinese woman whose first Austen book was \"Pride and Prejudice\", which she read in translation after the ban in China on Austen had been lifted after the end of the Cultural Revolution, saying she nothing read anything so moving and romantic before. The Chinese woman added after seeing all of the violence and horror of the Cultural Revolution when the streets of China were soaked with human blood, so many lives were ruined, and so many had behaved so badly that reading \"Pride and Prejudice\" she gave her hope in humanity again.\n\nThe novels of Jane Austen were unknown in China until 1917 when Wei Yi mentioned Austen in her book \"Brief Profiles of Famous Western Novelists\" where she was described as \"one of the celebrated English novelists\". Only a few western novels were translated in China during the 19th century, and it was not until 1898 when Lin Shu translated \"Camille\" by Alexandre Dumas, which unexpectedly become a bestseller, that Chinese publishers became interested in western books. Austen was first translated into Chinese in 1935, when two editions of \"Pride and Prejudice\" were published in Beijing and Shanghai. After 1949 Austen was out of favor in the People's Republic of China as a \"bourgeois\" author whose work was considered frivolous. In the 1950s most of the foreign books published in the People's Republic were translations of Soviet books, and Western authors were only translated into Chinese if they were \"revolutionary\" writers like Lord Byron or if their books portrayed Western societies in an unflattering light like Charles Dickens; Austen did not serve either purpose very well. In 1956, Austen was first translated in the People's Republic when \"Pride and Prejudice\" was published in Beijing, with an introduction by the translator explaining how the translation was justified on Marxist grounds as the novel showed the decline of feudalism and rise of capitalism in England. In 1965 Dong Hengxun, an academic, condemned Austen in an article titled \"The Description of Love in \"Pride and Prejudice\"\" in the \"Guangming Daily\" as \"artistically insignificant\". Austen was banned along with other Western authors in China during the Cultural Revolution and during the 1980s, translations of Austen were grudgingly allowed, though officially Austen remained out of favor. The first Chinese academic in the People's Republic to write favorably of Austen was Zhu Hong, who complained in his 1986 essay \"The Pride and Prejudice against Jane Austen\" that ordinary people liked Austen well enough, but academics had to condemn her because of the Party line, which led him to ask for books to be judged on artistic grounds only. In the 1990s Communist Party condemnations of Austen ceased, and a number of Chinese students produced dissertations on Austen, with Austen being very popular with female students. In 2011 one Chinese academic, Zhang Helong, wrote about Austen's \"huge popularity\" in modern China. In 2017, \"The Economist\" noted that in China: \"... Austen is seen as having a particular affinity with Chinese culture, where “manners matter” as they did in Georgian England.\" \"Pride and Prejudice\" has been translated into Chinese at least 50 times while \"Sense and Sensibility\" has been translated 10 times in the last decades. Austen's ideal hero as a property-owning gentleman has resonance in China, where a well-off man with good education and manners who owes land is the considered the ideal man. In 2010, Sadoff wrote that the growing appeal of Austen in Asia ensures that market for Austen films continues to grow, and it is possible Asia would soon replace the United States as the largest market for Austen films, if it has not already done so.\n\nIn the United States, Austen was described in 2013 as the object of \"wildly devotional fan-worship\" with conventions, parties and fan fiction. One American Janeite, Myretta Robens, was quoted to a BBC reporter as saying: \"There's a longing for the elegance of the time. It's an escape.\" When asked why so many American Janeites write fan fiction, Robens stated: \"Quite frankly, I think a lot of people want more sex, particularly with Elizabeth and Darcy.\" Another American Janeite, Laurel Ann Nattress explained the appeal of Austen fan fiction in the U.S. as: \"People just love her characters and they don't want to give them up.\" Nattress argued that the popularity of Austen in America was due mostly to a strong Anglophile streak in America, saying: \"I think that we look back to the motherland in many respects. Look at the incredible impact \"Downton Abbey\" has had over here. It's a perfect example of how America is fascinated by British culture.\" Robbens explained to a BBC reporter the mostly female readership of Austen in America; \"It's women, in general, who fall in love with them. It's a truth universally acknowledged that women want to read about relationships.\"\n\nMore recently, Austen has been appropriated by the Alt-right with the American scholar Nicole Wright writing that the alt-right is obsessed with Austen variously as: \"... 1) symbol of sexual purity; 2) standard-bearer of a vanished white traditional culture; and 3) exception that proves the rule of female inferiority.\" Wright wrote many of the alt-right leaders who paraphrased Austen like Milo Yiannopoulos do not know much about her, noting that Yiannupoulos called Austen a \"Victorian\" writer. In a speech, Yiannupoulos had said: \"As a Victorian novelist might have put it, it is a truth universally acknowledged that an ugly woman is far more likely to be a feminist than a hot one.\" Wright wrote that the alt-right used Austen as a way of trying to make themselves seem more wholesome, writing:\"By comparing their movement not to the nightmare Germany of Hitler and Goebbels, but instead to the cozy England of Austen — a much-beloved author with a centuries-long fandom and an unebbing academic following — the alt-right normalizes itself in the eyes of ordinary people. It also subtly panders to the nostalgia of the Brexiters, with their vision of a better, bygone Britain. Such references nudge readers who happen upon alt-right sites to think that perhaps white supremacists aren’t so different from mainstream folks.<br>But these men are distorting Austen’s work; her novels are hardly blueprints for an \"ethnostate.\" Instead, they serve as antidotes against the strategies used by the alt-right movement. After all, Austen’s heroines come to distrust men who beguile others through charismatic bluster and expedient lying (Exhibit A: Willoughby). Indeed, Austen inoculates her readers against trusting the autocrats cheered by the alt-right: her female characters come to regret taking up with coarse men (such as Rushworth in \"Mansfield Park\") who are propped up by inherited wealth that initially dazzles those around them, but which cannot compensate for astonishing ignorance, flouting of decorum, and lack of empathy. Marianne and Maria learn those life lessons the hard way, but they do learn in the end, and they eventually abandon the duplicitous grifters and foolish scions. May it be so with us, and may we never see a day with alt-right \"post-truths\" universally acknowledged.\" One American scholar, Elaine Bander, expressed considerable annoyance about the appropriation of Austen by the alt-right, writing: \"No one who reads Jane Austen’s words with any attention and reflection can possibly be alt-right. All the Janeites I know are rational, compassionate, liberal-minded people.\" The American journalist Jennifer Schuessler reported this appropriation of Austen is very common, citing the remarks of a graduate student Tracey Hutchings-Goetz, who was surprised to see the Wikipedia article about \"Pride and Prejudice\" describe the novel as celebrating traditional marriage supported by citations to an on-line article from the conservative Catholic magazine \"Crisis\", saying to Schuessler: \"It was a version of the novel that didn’t make any sense to us as scholars, supported by a completely unscholarly source\".\n\nThe American author Amy Elizabeth Smart visited several Latin American countries in 2011 to see where Austen stood in that part of the world. Smart was at first concerned that a British author like Austen would not be popular in Guatemala, where most of the people are Maya Indians. But she found Austen fitted in well with the Maya, intensely family-oriented people who criticized her for not taking her own family with her to Guatemala, saying how could she possibly leave her parents behind in America. Smart discovered that Austen's picture of close-knit families in the English countryside was to the Maya comparable to their own existence in the Guatemalan countryside. When Smart asked her Guatemalan students if the story of \"Pride and Prejudice\" could take place in modern Guatemala, the unanimous answer was yes. Smart found her Guatemalan students related to \"Pride and Prejudice\" better than her American students as the general expectation in Guatemala is that a woman should be married by her early twenties, just as was the case in Regency England, whereas her American students have trouble understanding why Elizabeth Bennet was risking social disgrace by turning down two marriage proposals. Moreover, Smart's Guatemalan students found the subject of class prejudices in Regency England more compelling than her American students, with many also saying racial prejudices against the Maya by Guatemala's \"Criollo\" elite made them relate to Elizabeth Bennet's struggle for acceptance from the Hertfordshire elite. Smart reported class discussions in the United States about \"Pride and Prejudice\" did not automatically lead to the subject of racism while in Guatemala, her students always brought up the racism against the Maya when discussing Miss Bennet's struggle against the gentry and aristocracy of Hertfordshire. By contrast, in Paraguay, where the majority of the population are Guaraní Indians, Smart discovered that hardly anyone knew who Austen was, and much of her class was indifferent to the books. Smart suggested that the War of the Triple Alliance, which wiped out most of the Paraguayan population between 1864-70 with Paraguay going from 1 million to 200, 000 people, had left a grim, death-obsessed mentality in Paraguay where the macabre was celebrated and where Austen simply could not fit into.\n\nIn Mexico, where Smart asked a group of local women in Puerto Vallarta if the plot of \"Sense and Sensibility\" had any relevance in modern Mexico, she was told by one woman: \"No, the book's really relevant...Things then, in her country, are just the same way here and now. Look at Willoughby, taking advantage of women. Men here do that all the time. And Marianne, marrying more for the sake of being married than for being in love. Women are here are afraid to be single. It is very hard\". In Ecuador, Smart discovered that Ecuadoran men all detested the character of Mr. Darcy with one man telling her Darcy deserved \"\"Es de matarlo a palos\"\" (\"to be beaten to death with a stick\") while Ecuadoran women were much more fond of the character, saying he did not deserved to be beaten to death with a stick as their menfolk were insisting upon. The Ecuadorans tended to regard Austen as more of a fantasy writer, describing life in Regency England that was simply inconceivable in modern Ecuador, with one reader of \"Pride and Prejudice\" telling Smart that none of the characters from that book would last a day in Guayaquil.\n\nIn 2007, Anne Hathaway starred as Austen in \"Becoming Jane.\" Based on the biography \"Becoming Jane Austen\" by Jon Hunter Spence, the film centred on Jane Austen's early life, her development as an author, and the posited romantic relationship with Thomas Langlois Lefroy (James McAvoy).\n\n\"Miss Austen Regrets\", a television film starring Olivia Williams as Jane Austen, was released in the same year. Based on Austen's surviving letters, the semi-biographical television movie focused on the last few years of Jane Austen's life as she looked back on her life and loves and helped her favourite niece, Fanny Knight (Imogen Poots), find a husband.\n\n\"JANE, the musical\" debuted in June 2006 in the West Midlands, England. It is a West-End style musical theatre production based on the life of Jane Austen. The musical, directed by Geetika Lizardi, focuses on Austen as a modern heroine, a woman who chose art and integrity over the security of a loveless marriage.\n\nJane Austen features as an amateur sleuth in Stephanie Barron's Jane Austen series of historical mystery novels.\n\nKate Beaton, cartoonist of webcomic \"Hark! A Vagrant\", devoted one of her comic strips to Jane Austen.\n\nJane Austen (voiced by Eden Riegel) is revealed as the narrator of 2013's \"Saints Row IV\" in a bonus cutscene, and the game's antagonist Zinyak reads the first chapter of \"Pride and Prejudice\" on an in-game radio station. Both the protagonist (the leader of the 3rd Street Saints) and the game alien antagonist Zinyak are depicted as fans of Austen's work. She appears as a figure in \"How the Saints Save Christmas\" DLC and Saints Row IV standalone expansion, \"\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"None\"\n\n\nIn 1994, American literary critic Harold Bloom placed Austen among the greatest . In a 2002 poll to determine whom the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Austen was ranked number 70 in the list of the \"100 Greatest Britons\". In 2003, Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice\" came second in the BBC's The Big Read, a national poll to find the \"Nation's best-loved book.\"\n\nIn 2007, the article \"Rejecting Jane\" by British author David Lassman, which examined how Austen would fare in the modern day publishing industry, achieved worldwide attention when Austen's work—submitted under a pseudonym—was rejected by numerous publishers.\n\nAusten's writing was the inspiration for the 2013 video game \"Regency Love\", a visual novel in which the player interacts with townspeople, friends, family, and potential suitors, looking for a suitable match. The game includes storylines inspired by Austen's writing style, as well as trivia questions about Austen's work.\n\n\n"

                "Reception history of Jane Austen\n\nThe reception history of Jane Austen follows a path from modest fame to wild popularity. Jane Austen (1775–1817), the author of such works as \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813) and \"Emma\" (1815), has become one of the best-known and most widely read novelists in the English language. Her novels are the subject of intense scholarly study and the centre of a diverse fan culture.\n\nDuring her lifetime, Austen's novels brought her little personal fame. Like many women writers, she chose to publish anonymously, but her authorship was an open secret. At the time they were published, Austen's works were considered fashionable but received only a few reviews, albeit positive. By the mid-19th century, her novels were admired by members of the literary elite who viewed their appreciation of her works as a mark of cultivation, but they were also being recommended in the popular education movement and on school reading lists as early as 1838. The first illustrated edition of her works appeared in 1833, in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, which put her titles before thousands of readers across the Victorian period.\n\nThe publication in 1870 of her nephew's \"Memoir of Jane Austen\" introduced her to a wider public as an appealing personality—dear aunt Jane—and her works were republished in popular editions. By the start of the 20th century, competing groups had sprung up—some to worship her and some to defend her from the \"teeming masses\"—but all claiming to be the true Janeites, or those who properly appreciated Austen. The \"teeming masses,\" meanwhile, were creating their own ways of honoring Austen, including in amateur theatricals in drawing rooms, schools, and community groups.\n\nIn 1923, the publisher and scholar R. W. Chapman prepared a carefully edited collection of her works—which some have claimed is the first serious scholarly treatment given to any British novelist. By mid-century, Austen was widely accepted in academia as a great English novelist. The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship, which explored numerous aspects of her works: artistic, ideological, and historical.\n\nWith the growing professionalisation of university English departments in the second half of the 20th century, criticism of Austen became more theoretical and specialized, as did literary studies in general. As a result, commentary on Austen sometimes seemed to imagine itself as divided into high culture and popular culture branches. In the mid- to late 20th century, fans founded Jane Austen societies and clubs to celebrate the author, her time, and her works.\n\nAs of the early 21st century, Austen fandom supports an industry of printed sequels and prequels as well as television and film adaptations, which started with the 1940 \"Pride and Prejudice\" and evolved to include the 2004 Bollywood-style production \"Bride and Prejudice\".\n\nJane Austen lived her entire life as part of a large and close-knit family on the lower fringes of the English gentry. Her family's steadfast support was critical to Austen's development as a professional writer. Austen read draft versions of all of her novels to her family, receiving feedback and encouragement, and it was her father who sent out her first publication bid. Austen's artistic apprenticeship lasted from her teenage years until she was about thirty-five. During this period, she experimented with various literary forms, including the epistolary novel which she tried and then abandoned, and wrote and extensively revised three major novels and began a fourth. With the release of \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1811), \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813), \"Mansfield Park\" (1814) and \"Emma\" (1815), she achieved success as a published writer.\n\nNovel-writing was a suspect occupation for women in the early 19th century, because it imperiled their social reputation by bringing them publicity, viewed as unfeminine. Therefore, like many other female writers, Austen published anonymously. Eventually, though, her novels' authorship became an open secret among the aristocracy. During one of her visits to London, the Prince Regent invited her, through his librarian, James Stanier Clarke, to view his library at Carlton House; his librarian mentioned that the Regent admired her novels and that \"if Miss Austen had any other Novel forthcoming, she was quite at liberty to dedicate it to the Prince\". Austen, who disapproved of the prince's extravagant lifestyle, did not want to follow this suggestion, but her friends convinced her otherwise: in short order, \"Emma\" was dedicated to him. Austen turned down the librarian's further hint to write a historical romance in honour of the prince's daughter's marriage.\n\nIn the last year of her life, Austen revised \"Northanger Abbey\" (1817), wrote \"Persuasion\" (1817), and began another novel, eventually titled \"Sanditon\", which was left unfinished at her death. Austen did not have time to see \"Northanger Abbey\" or \"Persuasion\" through the press, but her family published them as one volume after her death and her brother Henry included a \"Biographical Notice of the Author\". This short biography sowed the seeds for the myth of Austen as a quiet, retiring aunt who wrote during her spare time: \"Neither the hope of fame nor profit mixed with her early motives ... [S]o much did she shrink from notoriety, that no accumulation of fame would have induced her, had she lived, to affix her name to any productions of her public she turned away from any allusion to the character of an authoress.\" However, this description is in direct contrast to the excitement Austen shows in her letters regarding publication and profit: Austen was a professional writer.\n\nAusten's works are noted for their realism, biting social commentary, and masterful use of free indirect speech, burlesque and irony. They critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century realism. As Susan Gubar and Sandra Gilbert explain, Austen makes fun of \"such novelistic clichés as love at first sight, the primacy of passion over all other emotions and/or duties, the chivalric exploits of the hero, the vulnerable sensitivity of the heroine, the lovers' proclaimed indifference to financial considerations, and the cruel crudity of parents\". Austen's plots, though comic, highlight the way women of the gentry depended on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. Like the writings of Samuel Johnson, a strong influence on her, her works are fundamentally concerned with moral issues.\n\nAusten's novels quickly became fashionable among opinion-makers, namely, those aristocrats who often dictated fashion and taste. Lady Bessborough, sister to the notorious Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, commented on \"Sense and Sensibility\" in a letter to a friend: \"it is a clever novel.  ... tho' it ends stupidly, I was much amused by it.\" The fifteen-year-old daughter of the Prince Regent, Princess Charlotte Augusta, compared herself to one of the book's heroines: \"I think Marianne & me are very like in \"disposition\", that certainly I am not so good, the same imprudence, &tc\".\n\nAfter reading \"Pride and Prejudice\", playwright Richard Sheridan advised a friend to \"[b]uy it immediately\" for it \"was one of the cleverest things\" he had ever read. Anne Milbanke, future wife of the Romantic poet Lord Byron, wrote that \"I have finished the Novel called Pride and Prejudice, which I think a very superior work.\" She commented that the novel \"is the most \"probable\" fiction I have ever read\" and had become \"at present the fashionable novel\". The Dowager Lady Vernon told a friend that \"Mansfield Park\" was \"[n]ot much of a novel, more the history of a family party in the country, very natural\"—as if, comments one Austen scholar, \"Lady Vernon's parties mostly featured adultery.\" Lady Anne Romilly told her friend, the novelist Maria Edgeworth, that \"[\"Mansfield Park\"] has been pretty generally admired here\" and Edgeworth commented later that \"we have been much entertained with Mansfield Park\".\n\nDespite these positive reactions from the elite, Austen's novels received relatively few reviews during her lifetime: two for \"Sense and Sensibility\", three for \"Pride and Prejudice\", none for \"Mansfield Park\", and seven for \"Emma\". Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels. Moreover, as Brian Southam, who has edited the definitive volumes on Austen's reception, writes in his description of these reviewers, \"their job was merely to provide brief notices, extended with quotations, for the benefit of women readers compiling their library lists and interested only in knowing whether they would like a book for its story, its characters and moral\". This was not atypical critical treatment for novels in Austen's day.\n\nAsked by publisher John Murray to review \"Emma\", famed historical novelist Walter Scott wrote the longest and most thoughtful of these reviews, which was published anonymously in the March 1816 issue of the \"Quarterly Review\". Using the review as a platform from which to defend the then disreputable genre of the novel, Scott praised Austen's works, celebrating her ability to copy \"from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\". Modern Austen scholar William Galperin has noted that \"unlike some of Austen's lay readers, who recognized her divergence from realistic practice as it had been prescribed and defined at the time, Walter Scott may well have been the first to install Austen as the realist par excellence\". Scott wrote in his private journal in 1826, in what later became a widely quoted comparison:\n\n\"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", published together posthumously in December 1817, were reviewed in the \"British Critic\" in March 1818 and in the \"Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany\" in May 1818. The reviewer for the \"British Critic\" felt that Austen's exclusive dependence on realism was evidence of a deficient imagination. The reviewer for the \"Edinburgh Review\" disagreed, praising Austen for her \"exhaustless invention\" and the combination of the familiar and the surprising in her plots. Overall, Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her novels—for example, they misunderstood her use of irony. Reviewers reduced \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\" to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice.\n\nIn the \"Quarterly Review\" in 1821, the English writer and theologian Richard Whately published the most serious and enthusiastic early posthumous review of Austen's work. Whately drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, praising the dramatic qualities of her narrative. He also affirmed the respectability and legitimacy of the novel as a genre, arguing that imaginative literature, especially narrative, was more valuable than history or biography. When it was properly done, as in Austen, Whately said, imaginative literature concerned itself with generalised human experience from which the reader could gain important insights into human nature; in other words, it was moral. Whately also addressed Austen's position as a female writer, writing: \"we suspect one of Miss Austin's great merits in our eyes to be, the insight she gives us into the peculiarities of female heroines are what one knows women must be, though one never can get them to acknowledge it.\" No more significant, original Austen criticism was published until the late 19th century: Whately and Scott had set the tone for the Victorian era's view of Austen.\n\nAusten had many admiring readers during the 19th century, who, according to critic Ian Watt, appreciated her \" to ordinary social experience\". However, Austen's novels did not conform to certain strong Romantic and Victorian British preferences, which required that \"powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing\". Victorian critics and audiences were drawn to the work of authors such as Charles Dickens and George Eliot; by comparison, Austen's novels seemed provincial and quiet. Although Austen's works were republished beginning in late 1832 or early 1833 by Richard Bentley in the \"Standard Novels\" series, and remained in print continuously thereafter, they were not best-sellers. Southam describes her \"reading public between 1821 and 1870\" as \"minute beside the known audience for Dickens and his contemporaries\".\n\nThose who did read Austen saw themselves as discriminating readers—they were a cultured few. This became a common theme of Austen criticism during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes articulated this theme in a series of enthusiastic articles in the 1840s and 1850s. In \"The Novels of Jane Austen\", published anonymously in \"Blackwood's Magazine\" in 1859, Lewes praised Austen's novels for \"the economy of easy adaptation of means to ends, with no aid from superfluous elements\" and compared her to Shakespeare. Arguing that Austen lacked the ability to construct a plot, he still celebrated her dramatisations: \"The reader's pulse never throbs, his curiosity is never intense; but his interest never wanes for a moment. The action begins; the people speak, feel, and act; everything that is said, felt, or done tends towards the entanglement or disentanglement of the plot; and we are almost made actors as well as spectators of the little drama.\"\n\nReacting against Lewes's essays and his personal communications with her, novelist Charlotte Brontë admired Austen's fidelity to everyday life but described her as \"only shrewd and observant\" and criticised the absence of visible passion in her work. To Brontë, Austen's work appeared formal and constrained, \"a carefully fenced, highly cultivated garden, with neat borders and delicate flowers; but no glance of bright vivid physiognomy, no open country, no fresh air, no blue hill, no bonny beck\".\n\nAusten's novels appeared in some European countries soon after their publication in Britain, beginning in 1813 with a French translation of \"Pride and Prejudice\", quickly followed by German, Danish, and Swedish editions. Their availability in Europe was not universal. Austen was not well known in Russia and the first Russian translation of an Austen novel did not appear until 1967. Despite the fact that Austen's novels were translated into many European languages, Europeans did not recognise her works as part of the English novel tradition. This perception was reinforced by the changes made by translators who injected sentimentalism into Austen's novels and eliminated their humour and irony. European readers therefore more readily associated Walter Scott's style with the English novel.\n\nBecause of the significant changes made by her translators, Austen was received as a different kind of novelist in continental Europe than in Britain. For example, the French novelist Isabelle de Montolieu translated several of Austen's novels into a genre in which Montolieu herself wrote: the French sentimental novel. In Montolieu's \"Pride and Prejudice\", for example, vivacious conversations between Elizabeth and Darcy were replaced by decorous ones. Elizabeth's claim that she has \"always seen a great similarity in the turn of [their] minds\" (her and Darcy's) because they are \"unwilling to speak, unless [they] expect to say something that will amaze the whole room\" becomes \"Moi, je garde le silence, parce que je ne sais que dire, et vous, parce que vous aiguisez vos traits pour parler avec effet.\" (\"Me, I keep silent, because I don't know what to say, and you, because you excite your features for effect when speaking.\") As Cossy and Saglia explain in their essay on Austen translations, \"the equality of mind which Elizabeth takes for granted is denied and gender distinction introduced\". Because Austen's works were seen in France as part of a sentimental tradition, they were overshadowed by the works of French realists such as Stendhal, Balzac, and Flaubert. German translations and reviews of those translations also placed Austen in a line of sentimental writers, particularly late Romantic women writers.\n\nA study of other important dimensions of the French translations, such as free indirect discourse (FID) do much to nuance our understanding of Austen's initial \"aesthetic\" reception with her first French readership. Austen uses a narrative technique known as free indirect discourse (FID) to represent Anne Elliot's consciousness in \"Persuasion\". Indeed, the portrayal of the heroine's subjective experience is central to its narration. The frequent use of FID imbues \"Perusasion\"'s narrative discourse with a high degree of subtlety, placing a huge burden of interpretation on Austen's first translators. Recent studies demonstrate that FID from \"Persuasion\" was translated extensively in Montolieu's \"La Famille Elliot\". Indeed, Montolieu was aware of the propensity of Austen's narrator to delve into the heroine's psychology in \"Persuasion\" as she comments on this in the preface to \"La Famille Elliot\". She characterises it as \"almost imperceptible, delicate nuances that come from the heart\": \"des nuances délicates presque imperceptibles qui partent du fond du cœur, et dont miss JANE AUSTEN avait le secret plus qu'aucun autre romancier\". Montolieu's extensive translations of Austen's FID demonstrate that she was in fact one of Austen's first critical readers, whose own finely nuanced reading of Austen's narrative technique meant that her first French readers could also share in Anne Elliot's psychological drama in much the same way that her English readership could.\n\nFor decades, Scott's and Whately's opinions dominated the reception of Austen's works and few people read her novels. In 1869, this changed with the publication of the first significant Austen biography, \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\", which was written by Jane Austen's nephew, James Edward Austen-Leigh. With its release, Austen's popularity and critical standing increased dramatically. Readers of the \"Memoir\" were presented with the myth of the amateur novelist who wrote masterpieces: the \"Memoir\" fixed in the public mind a sentimental picture of Austen as a quiet, middle-aged maiden aunt and reassured them that her work was suitable for a respectable Victorian family. James Edward Austen-Leigh had a portrait of Jane Austen painted, based on the earlier watercolour, softening her image and making her presentable to the Victorian public. The engraving by Bentley which formed the frontispiece of \"Memoir\" is based on the idealised image.\n\nThe publication of the \"Memoir\" spurred a major reissue of Austen's novels. The first popular editions were released in 1883—a cheap sixpenny series published by Routledge. This was followed by a proliferation of elaborate illustrated editions, collectors' sets, and scholarly editions. However, contemporary critics continued to assert that her works were sophisticated and only appropriate for those who could truly plumb their depths. Yet, after the publication of the \"Memoir\", more criticism was published on Austen's novels in two years than had appeared in the previous fifty.\n\nIn 1913, William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, descendants of the Austen family, published the definitive family biography, \"Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters—A Family Record\". Based primarily on family papers and letters, it is described by Austen biographer Park Honan as \"accurate, staid, reliable, and at times vivid and suggestive\". Although the authors moved away from the sentimental tone of the \"Memoir\", they made little effort to go beyond the family records and traditions immediately available to them. Their book therefore offers bare facts and little in the way of interpretation.\n\nDuring the last quarter of the 19th century, the first books of critical analysis regarding Austen's works were published. In 1890 Godwin Smith published the \"Life of Jane Austen\", initiating a \"fresh phase in the critical heritage\", in which Austen reviewers became critics. This launched the beginning of \"formal criticism\", that is, a focus on Austen as a writer and an analysis of the techniques that made her writing unique. According to Southam, while Austen criticism increased in amount and, to some degree, in quality after 1870, \"a certain uniformity\" pervaded it:\n\nAmong the most astute of these critics were Richard Simpson, Margaret Oliphant, and Leslie Stephen. In a review of the \"Memoir\", Simpson described Austen as a serious yet ironic critic of English society. He introduced two interpretative themes which later became the basis for modern literary criticism of Austen's works: humour as social critique and irony as a means of moral evaluation. Continuing Lewes's comparison to Shakespeare, Simpson wrote that Austen:\n\nSimpson's essay was not well known and did not become influential until Lionel Trilling quoted it in 1957. Another prominent writer whose Austen criticism was ignored, novelist Margaret Oliphant, described Austen in almost proto-feminist terms, as \"armed with a 'fine vein of feminine cynicism,' 'full of subtle power, keenness, finesse, and self-restraint,' blessed with an 'exquisite sense' of the 'ridiculous,' 'a fine stinging yet soft-voiced contempt,' whose novels are 'so calm and cold and keen'\". This line of criticism would not be fully explored until the 1970s with the rise of feminist literary criticism.\n\nAlthough Austen's novels had been published in the United States since 1832, albeit in bowdlerised editions, it was not until after 1870 that there was a distinctive American response to Austen. As Southam explains, \"for American literary nationalists Jane Austen's cultivated scene was too pallid, too constrained, too refined, too downright unheroic\". Austen was not democratic enough for American tastes and her canvas did not extend to the frontier themes that had come to define American literature. By the start of the 20th century, the American response was represented by the debate between the American novelist and critic William Dean Howells and the writer and humourist Mark Twain. In a series of essays, Howells helped make Austen into a canonical figure for the populace whereas Twain used Austen to argue against the Anglophile tradition in America. That is, Twain argued for the distinctiveness of American literature by attacking English literature. In his book \"Following the Equator\", Twain described the library on his ship: \"Jane Austen's absent from this library. Just that one omission alone would make a fairly good library out of a library that hadn't a book in it.\"\n\nThe \"Encyclopædia Britannica's\" changing entries on Austen illustrate her increasing popularity and status. The eighth edition (1854) described her as \"an elegant novelist\" while the ninth edition (1875) lauded her as \"one of the most distinguished modern British novelists\". Around the start of the 20th century, Austen novels began to be studied at universities and appear in histories of the English novel. The image of her that dominated the popular imagination was still that first presented in the \"Memoir\" and made famous by Howells in his series of essays in \"Harper's Magazine\", that of \"dear aunt Jane\". Author and critic Leslie Stephen described a mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\"—it was only after the publication of the \"Memoir\" that readers developed a personal connection with Austen. However, around 1900, members of the literary elite, who had claimed an appreciation of Austen as a mark of culture, reacted against this popularisation of her work. They referred to themselves as \"Janeites\" to distinguish themselves from the masses who, in their view, did not properly understand Austen.\n\nAmerican novelist Henry James, one member of this literary elite, referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as among \"the fine painters of life\". But, James thought Austen an \"unconscious\" artist whom he described as \"instinctive and charming\". In 1905, James responded frustratingly to what he described as \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's \"intrinsic merit and interest\". James attributed this rise principally to \"the stiff breeze of the special bookselling body of publishers, editors, illustrators, producers of the pleasant twaddle of magazines; who have found their 'dear,' our dear, everybody's dear, Jane so infinitely to their material purpose, so amenable to pretty reproduction in every variety of what is called tasteful, and in what seemingly proves to be salable, form.\"\n\nIn an effort to avoid the sentimental image of the \"Aunt Jane\" tradition and approach Austen's fiction from a fresh perspective, in 1917 British intellectual and travel writer Reginald Farrer published a lengthy essay in the \"Quarterly Review\" which Austen scholar A. Walton Litz calls the best single introduction to her fiction. Southam describes it as a \"Janeite\" piece without the worship. Farrer denied that Austen's artistry was unconscious (contradicting James) and described her as a writer of intense concentration and a severe critic of her society, \"radiant and remorseless\", \"dispassionate yet pitiless\", with \"the steely quality, the incurable rigor of her judgment\". Farrer was one of the first critics who viewed Austen as a subversive writer.\n\nSeveral important early works—glimmers of brilliant Austen scholarship—paved the way for Austen to become solidly entrenched within the academy. The first was Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley's 1911 essay, \"generally regarded as the starting-point for the serious academic approach to Jane Austen\". Bradley emphasised Austen's ties to 18th-century critic and writer Samuel Johnson, arguing that she was a moralist as well as humourist; in this he was \"totally original\", according to Southam. Bradley divided Austen's works into \"early\" and \"late\" novels, categories still used by scholars. The second path-breaking early-20th-century critic of Austen was R. W. Chapman, whose magisterial edition of Austen's collected works was the first scholarly edition of the works of any English novelist. The Chapman texts have remained the basis for all subsequent editions of Austen's works.\n\nIn the wake of Bradley and Chapman's contributions, the 1920s saw a boom in Austen scholarship, and the novelist E. M. Forster primarily illustrated his concept of the \"round\" character by citing Austen's works. It was with the 1939 publication of Mary Lascelles' \"Jane Austen and Her Art\"—\"the first full-scale historical and scholarly study\" of Austen—that the academic study of her works matured. Lascelles included a short biographical essay; an innovative analysis of the books Austen read and their effect on her writing; and an extended analysis of Austen's style and her \"narrative art\". Lascelles felt that prior critics had all worked on a scale \"so small that the reader does not see how they have reached their conclusions until he has patiently found his own way to them\". She wished to examine all Austen's works together and to subject her style and techniques to methodical analysis. Lascelles praised Austen for her \"shallow modelling\" of her characters, giving them distinctive voices yet making certain it was clear they all belonged to the same class. Subsequent critics agree that she succeeded. Like Bradley earlier, she emphasised Austen's connection to Samuel Johnson and her desire to discuss morality through fiction. However, at the time some fans of Austen worried that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric—a debate that continued into the 21st century.\nIn an outpouring of mid-century revisionist views, scholars approached Austen more sceptically. D. W. Harding, following and expanding upon Farrer, argued in his essay \"Regulated Hatred: An Aspect of the Work of Jane Austen\" that Austen's novels did not support the \"status quo\" but rather subverted it. Her irony was not humorous but caustic and intended to undermine the assumptions of the society she portrayed. Through her use of irony, Austen attempted to protect her integrity as an artist and a person in the face of attitudes and practices she rejected. In his 1940 essay, Harding argued that Austen had to be rescued from the Janites, charging \"her books are, as she meant them to be, read and enjoyed by precisely the sort of people she disliked...\". Harding argued the Janites regarded Regency England as \"expressing the gentler virtue of a civilised social order\" that was an escape from the waking nightmare of a world at war, but he argued that its own sort of way that the world of Austen's novels was nightmarish, where the government maintained a system of spies to crush any sympathy with the French Revolution, where friends take delight in causing others pain, where the polite language is usually a facade, and where intelligence in single woman is seen as a problem. Harding maintained that the problem with the Janites was that they could not grasp these aspects of Austen's works. Almost simultaneously, influential critic Q. D. Leavis argued in \"Critical Theory of Jane Austen's Writing\", published in \"Scrutiny\" in the early 1940s, that Austen was a professional, not an amateur, writer. Harding's and Leavis's articles were followed by another revisionist treatment by Marvin Mudrick in \"Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery\" (1952). Mudrick portrayed Austen as isolated, defensive, and critical of her society, and described in detail the relationship he saw between Austen's attitude toward contemporary literature and her use of irony as a technique to contrast the realities of her society with what she felt they should be. These revisionist views, together with prominent critic F. R. Leavis's pronouncement in \"The Great Tradition\" (1948) that Austen was one of the great writers of English fiction, a view shared by Ian Watt, who helped shape the scholarly debate regarding the genre of the novel, did much to cement Austen's reputation amongst academics. They agreed that she \"combined <nowiki>[</nowiki>Henry Fielding's and Samuel Richardson's<nowiki>]</nowiki> qualities of interiority and irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".\n\nThe period after the Second World War saw a flowering of scholarship on Austen as well as a diversity of critical approaches. One school that emerged in the United States was the New Criticism, which saw literary texts in only aesthetic terms, an object of beauty to be appreciated in and of itself without no study of the individual that had produced it or the society that she lived in. The New Critics tended to praise Austen for her literacy skills at combining irony and paradox, but other critics argued that the New Criticism by only focusing on the aesthetic qualities of the books ignored the message of the books and Austen herself, who was reduced down to merely being the mere scribe who produced these books that they admired so much. More typical of the post-1945 scholarship Marvin Mudrick's 1952 book \"Jane Austen: Irony as Defense and Discovery\", where he argued that Austen used irony as a way of deflating conventions and to gently challenge the reader's beliefs.\n\nIn 1951, Arnold Kettle in his \"Introduction to the English Novel\" praised Austen for her \"fineness of feeling\", but complained about the \"relevance\" of her work to the 20th century, charging that the values of Austen's novels were too much those of Regency England to be acceptable for the 20th century, writing a modern audience could not accept the rigidly hierarchical society of her time where the vast majority of people were denied the right to vote. About the question of the \"relevance\" of Austen to the modern world, the American critic Lionel Trilling in his 1955 essay on \"Mansfield Park\" wrote about the problem of existing in the modern world, of \"the terrible strain it imposes on us...the exhausting effort which the concept of personality requires us to make\", and praised Austen for her refusal to dignify the \"uncertainty and difficulty\" of modern life, praising her irony as the \"engaging manner by which she masks society's crude coercive power\", and uses irony in a \"generosity of spirit\". In his 1957 essay \"\"Emma\" and the Legend of Jane Austen\", Trilling argued that Austen was the first novelist to handle the very modern problem of the \"deep psychological change which accompanied the establishment of democratic society\" which imposed a \"psychological burden\" on a individual which the \"new necessity of conscious self-definition and self-criticism\" as \"there is no reality about which the modern person is more uncertain and more anxious than the reality of himself\". Trilling argued that in modern society, where people existed only as \"atoms\" uncertain about how they really were, Austen offers us a \"rare hope\" of a world where people could define themselves on their own terms.\n\nIan Watt in his 1957 book \"The Rise of the Novel\" argued that 18th century British literature was characterized by a dichotomy between either novels that were told from the first person and novels from the third person; the significance of Austen rested according to Watt in her ability to combine both subjective and objective tendencies in her books though her use of free indirect discourse. Another influential work was Wayne Booth's 1961 book \"The Rhetoric of Fiction\", in which offered a detailed study of \"Emma\", which he argued was told from three points of view; Emma's, Mr. Knightley's and the unnamed narrator. Booth argued Austen adopted this three-fold narration because Emma is in many ways an unlikable character, a spoiled and immature busybody, and Austen had to find a way to make her likable and engaging to the reader. Booth's book was widely praised for the way in which he highlighted how a moral problem (Emma's character) was turned into an aesthetic problem (how to tell the story while keeping its protagonist likable enough to engage the reader's sympathy), and has been the basis of much Austen scholarship since. Critics like Graham Hough have pointed out that the morality of the characters in \"Emma\" is related to their diction of the characters with those closest to the narrator having the best character, and in this reading Mr. Knightley has the best character. A. Walton Ktiz argued the aspect of the novel of \"Knightley as the standard\" prevents the irony of \"Emma\" from becoming a cynical celebration of feminine manipulation that see it, writing that Austen's use of free indirect discourse allowed the reader to understand's Emma mind without becoming limited by it.\n\nAnother major theme of Austen scholarship has concerned the question of the \"Bildungsroman\" (novel of education). D.D Devlin in \"Jane Austen and Education\" (1975) argued that Austen's novels were all in varying ways \"Bildungsroman\", where Austen put into practice Enlightenment theories about how the character of young people can develop and change. The Italian literary critic Franco Moretti in his 1987 book \"The Way of the World\" called \"Pride and Prejudice\" a \"classic\" \"Bildungsroman\", where Elizabeth Bennet's \"prejudice\" against Mr. Darcy is really \"distrust\" and that she \"shes does not err due to a lack-but due to an \"excess of criticism\", as Bennet rejects anything that she is told to trust \"a priori\". Moretti argued that in a typical \"Bildungsroman\" of the early 19th century was concerned with \"everyday life\", which represented \"an unchallenged stability of social relationships\" in a world that was wracked by war and revolution. In this sense, Moretti argued that the education that Bennet needs is to learn to accept the stability represented by the world around her in England, which is preferable to war and revolution to be found elsewhere in Europe, without losing her individualism. In the same way, Clifford Siskin in his 1988 book \"The Historicity of Romantic Discourse\" argued that all of Austen's books were \"Bildungsroman\", where the struggle of the characters to develop was mainly \"internal\" as the challenge to the characters was not really to change their onward lives, but rather their \"self\". Siskin noted in Henry Fielding's popular 1742 novel \"Joseph Andrews\", where a young man working as humble servant, goes though much suffering, and is ultimately rewarded when it is discovered that he is really an aristocrat kidnapped by the Romany (gypsies) when he is a baby. By contrast, Siskin wrote that Elizabeth Bennet's paternity is not in question and there are not improbable stokes of luck which will make her rich; instead her struggle is to develop her character and conquer her \"prejudice\" against Darcy, marking the shift in British literature from an \"external\" to \"internal\" conflict. Alongside studies of Austen as the writer of \"Bildungsroman\" are studies of Austen as a writer of marriage stories. For Susan Fraiman, \"Pride and Prejudice\" is both a \"Bildungsroman\" concerning Elizabeth Bennet's growth and a marriage story that ends in her \"humiliation\" where ends up submitting to Mr. Darcy. Critics are badly divided over the question of whatever the marriages of Austen's heroines is meant to be a reward for their virtuous behavior as seen by Wayne Booth and merely \"Good Girl Being Taught a Lesson\" stories as seen by Claudia Johnson. Stuart Tave wrote that Austen's stories always seem to end unhappily, but then end with the heroine getting married happily, which led him to the conclusion that these happy endings were artificial endings imposed by the expectations of an early 19th century audience.\n\nAbout the question of the \"relevance\" of Austen to the modern world, Julia Prewitt Brown in her 1979 book \"Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form\" challenged the common complaint that she did not deal with social changes, by examining how she presented social changes within the households she chronicled. Brown argued that the social changes Austen examined were the birth of the \"modern\" individualism where people were \"alienated\" from any meaningful social identity, existing only as \"atoms\" in society. The exhibit A of her thesis, so to speak, was \"Persuasion\" where she argued that Anne Eliot cannot find personal happiness by marrying within the gentry and only marriage to the self-made man Captain Wentworth can give her happiness. Brown argued that \"Persuasion\" was in many ways the most darkest of Austen's novels, depicting a society in grip of moral decay, where the old hierarchical certainties had given way to a society of \"disparate parts\", leaving Eliot as a \"disoriented, isolated\" woman. Brown was not a Marxist, but her book owed much to the Hungarian Communist writer Georg Lukács, especially his 1920 book \"The Theory of the Novel\".\nOne of the most fruitful and contentious has been the consideration of Austen as a political writer. As critic Gary Kelly explains, \"Some see her as a political 'conservative' because she seems to defend the established social order. Others see her as sympathetic to 'radical' politics that challenged the established order, especially in the form of critics see Austen's novels as neither conservative nor subversive, but complex, criticizing aspects of the social order but supporting stability and an open class hierarchy.\" In \"Jane Austen and the War of Ideas\" (1975), perhaps the most important of these works, Marilyn Butler argues that Austen was steeped in, not insulated from, the principal moral and political controversies of her time, and espoused a partisan, fundamentally conservative and Christian position in these controversies. In a similar vein, Alistair M. Duckworth in \"The Improvement of the Estate: A Study of Jane Austen's Novels\" (1971) argues that Austen used the concept of the \"estate\" to symbolise all that was important about contemporary English society, which should be conserved, improved, and passed down to future generations. Duckworth argued that Austen followed Edmund Burke, who in his 1790 book \"Reflections on the Revolution in France\" had used the metaphor of an estate that represented the work of generations, and which could be only be improved, never altered, for the way that society ought to work. Duckworth noted that in Austen's books, one's ability to keep an estate going, which could only be improved, but never altered if one was to be true to the estate, is usually the measure of one's good character. Butler placed Austen in the context of the reaction against the French Revolution, where excessive emotionalism and the sentimental \"cult of sensibility\" came to be identified with sexual promiscuity, atheism, and political radicalism. Butler argued that a novel like \"Sense and Sensibility\", where Marianne Dashwood is unable to control her emotions, is part of the conservative anti-revolutionary literature that sought to glorify old fashioned values and politics. Irvine pointed out that the identification of the \"cult of sensibility\" with republicanism was one that existed only in the minds of conservatives, and in fact the French Republic also rejected sentimentalism, so Butler's challenge is to prove Austen's call for emotional self-restraint as expressed by a character like Elinor Dashwood is in fact grounded in conservative politics. Butler wrote \"the characteristic recourse of the conservative...is to remind us ultimately of the insignificance of individual rights and even individual concerns when measured against the scale of 'the universe as one vast whole'\". Irvine wrote that novels like \"Sense and Sensibility\" appeared to support Butler's thesis, but a novel like \"Pride and Prejudice\" does not, as Elizabeth Bennet is an individualist and a non-conformist who ridicules everything, and who to a certain extent has to learn the value of sentiment.\n\nRegarding Austen's views of society and economics, Alastair MacIntyre in his 1981 \"After Virtue\" offered a critique of the Enlightenment as leading to moral chaos and decay, and citing Aristotle argued that a \"good life for man\" is only possible if one follows the traditional moral rules of one's society. In this regard, MacIntrye used Austen as an \"Aristotelian\" writer whose books offered up examples of how to be virtuous with the English country estate playing the same role that the \"polis\" did for Aristotle. By contrast, Mary Evans in her 1987 book \"Jane Austen and the State\" depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist concerned with the \"stability of human relationships and communities\" and against \"conspicuous consumption\" and the \"individualisation of feeling\" promoted by the Industrial Revolution. In her 1987 book \"Desire and Domestic Fiction\", Nancy Armstrong in a study much influenced by the theories of Karl Marx and Michel Foucault, argued that all of Austen's books reflected the dominant political-economic ideology of her times, concerning the battle to exercise power over the human body, which determined how and whether a woman was considered sexually desirable or not. The Marxist James Thompson in his 1988 book \"Between Self and the World\" likewise depicted Austen as a proto-Marxist searching for a realm of freedom and feeling in a world dominated by a soulless materialism promoted by capitalism. By contrast, Beth Fowkes Tobin in her 1990 article \"The Moral and Political Economy of Austen's \"Emma\"\" depicted Austen as a Burkean conservative with Mr. Knightly as a responsible land-owner taking care of his family's ancient estate and Emma Woodhouse symbolising wealth cut off from any sort of social role. David Kaufmann in his 1992 essay \"Propriety and the Law\" argued that Austen was a classical liberal in the mold of Adam Smith, who felt that virtue was best exercised in the private sphere of the family life rather in the public sphere of politics. Kaufmann rejected the claim that Austen was influenced by Edmund Burke, arguing that for Austen, virtue was not something passed down from time immemorial from a landed elite as Burke would have it, but rather was something that any individual could acquire, thus making Austen into something of a radical. Lauren Goodlad in a 2000 article rejected Kaufmann's claim of Austen as a classical liberal, arguing that the message of \"Sense and Sensibility\" was the failure of liberalism to reconcile alienated individuals from a society that only valued money. As Rajeswari Rajan notes in her essay on recent Austen scholarship, \"the idea of a political Austen is no longer seriously challenged\". The questions scholars now investigate involve: \"the [French] Revolution, war, nationalism, empire, class, 'improvement' [of the estate], the clergy, town versus country, abolition, the professions, female emancipation; whether her politics were Tory, Whig, or radical; whether she was a conservative or a revolutionary, or occupied a reformist position between these extremes\".\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, Austen studies was influenced by Sandra Gilbert and Susan Gubar's seminal \"The Madwoman in the Attic\" (1979), which contrasts the \"decorous surfaces\" with the \"explosive anger\" of 19th-century female English writers. This work, along with other feminist criticism of Austen, has firmly positioned Austen as a \"woman\" writer. Gibler and Gubar suggested that what are usually seen as the unpleasant female characters in the Austen books like Mrs. Norris in \"Mansfield Park\", Lady Catherine de Bourgh in \"Pride and Prejudice\" and Mrs. Churchill in \"Emma\" were in fact expressions of Austen's anger at a patriarchal society, whom are punished in guilt over her own immodesty in writing novels while her heroines who end up happily married are expressions of Austen's desire to compromise with society. The Gilbert-Gubar thesis proved to be influential and inspired scholars to reexamine Austen's through most have a more favorable opinion of her heroines than Gilbert and Gubar did., Other scholars such as Linda Hunt have argued that Austen used realism as a way of attacking patriarchy from the outside as opposed to subverting it from within by irony as Gilbert and Gubar claimed. The interest generated in Austen by these critics led to the discovery and study of other woman writers of the time. Moreover, with the publication of Julia Prewitt Brown's \"Jane Austen's Novels: Social Change and Literary Form\" (1979), Margaret Kirkham's \"Jane Austen: Feminism and Fiction\" (1983), and Claudia L. Johnson's \"Jane Austen: Women, Politics and the Novel\" (1988), scholars were no longer able to easily argue that Austen was \"apolitical, or even unqualifiedly 'conservative'\". Kirkham, for example, described the similarities between Austen's thought and that of Mary Wollstonecraft, labelling them both as \"Enlightenment feminists\". Kirham argued that by showing women were just as capable of being rational as men that Austen was a follower of Wollstonecraft. Johnson similarly places Austen in an 18th-century political tradition, although she outlines the debt Austen owes to the political novels of the 1790s written by women.\n\nThe war with France that began in 1793 was seen as an ideological war between the British monarchy vs. the French republic, which led conservative writers such as Jane West, Hannah More, and Elizabeth Hamilton to depict the feminine private sphere in the family as the embodiment of British values under threat from France, and to write a series of polemical works demanding that young women defend their \"modesty\", as defined by conduct books, to give Britain the moral strength to prevail over the French. Johnson argued that Austen appropriated the sort of plot that More, West and Hamilton used in their books to quietly subvert via irony. In support of her thesis, Johnson noted in \"Sense and Sensibility\" the Dashwood sisters are victimized by their greedy half-brother John, showing the family as an area for competition instead of warmth and comfort; in \"Mansfield Park\" the lifestyle of the eminently respectable Bertram family is supported by a plantation in Antigua worked by slave labour; and \"Northranger Abbey\" where satirizing Gothic stories gives \"a nightmare version of patriarchal oppression\" as General Tilney, if not guilty of the specific crimes that Catherine Moreland imagines he has committed, is indeed a vicious man. Likewise, Johnson noted that Maria Rushworth's adultery in \"Mansfield Park\" is portrayed as merely salacious local gossip that does not presage a great victory for Napoleon while Marianne Dashwood does not die after being seduced by Willoughby, which undercuts the standard plot devices of the conservative writers. Johnston argued because of the drastic wartime censorship and the campaign of vitriolic abuse waged against Wollstonecraft that Austen had to be quiet in their criticism of patriarchy. Irvine in a critique of the work of feminist scholars like Johnson and Kirkham that if Austen was indeed an Enlightenment feminist, there were clearly limits to her radicalism as Austen never criticised either explicitly or implicitly the hierarchical structure of British society with her villains failing to live up to their standards expected of their class, instead of their moral failures being presented as a product of the social system. Writing about the work of Johnson, Irvine wrote for her, Austen was a radical because it is women like Emma Woodhouse, Mrs. Elton and Mrs. Churchill who really run Highbury society, undercutting traditional gender roles, but Irvine questioned whatever this really made Austen into radical, noting it was the wealth and status of the gentry women of Highbury that gave them their power. Irvine argued it was just as possible to see \"Emma\" as a conservative novel that upholds the superiority of the gentry, writing that Johnson was \"...close here to defining 'conservative' in terms of gender politics alone...\". Likewise, Elizabeth may defy Lady Catherine de Bourgh who wants to keep her in place by marrying Mr. Darcy, who comes from old landed family, which Irivne used to argue while \"Pride and Prejudice\" does have a strong heroine, the book does not criticise the structure of English society.\n\nMany scholars have noted in the conduct books that were very popular for settling out the proper rules for a young ladies in Austen's book there was a double meaning to the word modesty. Modesty meant both a woman should refrain from flamboyant behavior and be quiet while modesty also meant a woman had to be ignorant of her sexuality. This double meaning to modesty meant a young woman who was behaving in a modest way was not really modest at all as she attempting to conceal her knowledge of her sexuality, placing young women in an impossible position. Jan Fergus argued that for this reason that Austen's books were subversive by engaging in \"emotional didacticism\" by showing the reader moral lessons meant to teach young women how to be modest in the conventional sense, thus undercutting the demand made by the conduct books for modesty in the sense of ignorance of one's sexuality. In the same way, Kirkham used \"Mansfield Park\" as an example of Austen undercutting the message of the conduct books, noting that Fanny Price is attractive to Henry Crawford because she outwardly conforms to the conduct books while she is attractive to Edmund Bertram because of her intelligence and spirit, rejecting the infantisation of women promoted by the conduct books. Rachel Brownstein argued that Austen's use of irony should be seen in the same way, as a way of writing in a manner expected of a woman writer in her age while also undercutting such expectations at the same time. Devoney Looser in the 1995 book \"Jane Austen and the Discourses of Feminism\" she edited in her introduction argued that there a number of ways in which Austen could be placed not within a feminist tradition, but was herself a feminist.\n\nUsing the theories of Michel Foucault as their guide, Casey Finch and Peter Bowen in their 1990 essay \"'The Tittle-Tattle of Highbury': Gossip and the Free Indirect Style in \"Emma\"\" argued the free indirect discourse in Austen validates Fouucault's thesis that the Enlightenment was a fraud, an insidious form of oppression posing as liberation. Finch and Bowen argued that voice of the omnipresent narrator and together with the free indirect discourse summarizing the thoughts of characters in \"Emma\" were a form of \"surveillance\" that policed the thoughts of the character; seen in this light, Emma Woodhouse's discovery that she loves Mr. Knightley is not an expression of her real feelings, but rather society imposing its values on her mind by persuading her that she had to engage in a heterosexual marriage to produce sons to continue the Establishment and the while fooling her into thinking she was in love. By contrast, Lauren Goodlad in her 2000 essay \"Self-Disciplinary Self-Making\" argued that the self-discipline exercised by Elinor Dashwood in \"Sense and Sensibility\" was not an act of oppression as held by Foucault and those writing from a Foucaultian perspective, but was an \"emancipatory act of political resistance\", arguing that there was a tension between 'psychology' and 'character' as Dashwood must be the observer of her character and used what she has learn to grow.\n\nA very controversial article was \"Jane Austen and the Masturbating Girl\" by Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick that juxtaposed three treatments of female suffering, namely Marianne Dashwood's emotional frenzy when Willoughby abandons her, a 19th century medical account of the \"cure\" inflicted on a girl who liked to masturbate, and the critic Tony Tanner's \"vengeful\" treatment of Emma Woodhouse as a woman who had to be taught her place. Sedgwick argued the way that the portrayal of Marianne as emotionally overwrought and too inclined to give in to her feelings very closely resembled the account of patient X, the teenage girl seen as too inclined to masturbate and the way a male critic like Tanner attacked Woodhouse for her emotional self-indulgence was no different from the doctor imposing the gruesome and painful treatment on the masturbating girl. Sedwick the way that way Elinor disciplines Marianne, Tanner's \"vengeful\" views and the treatment given to patient X were all attempts to crush female sexuality as she maintained that \"emotional self-indulgence\" was merely a code-word for female masturbation. Sedgwick argued that characters such as Dashwood and Woodhouse, who did not precisely conform to the feminine ideals are symbols of both female and homosexual resistance to the ideal of heterosexuality and patriarchy as the norm for everyone. Sedgwick's provoked an uproar in 1991, becoming a prime exhibit in the American \"Culture war\" between liberals and conservatives.\n\nThe Italian critic Franco Moretti argued that Austen's novels articulated a new form of English nationalism via the marriage plot, noting most of the heroes and heroines came from different parts of England. Some critics such as Roger Gard have seized upon Austen as a symbol of an \"eternal England\", whose \"unpolitical\" works unlike the \"political\" novels of the great French and Russian novelists of the 19th century reflected the central values of \"modern Anglo-Saxon civilisations\". According to Gard, Austen is so English that only the English could really appreciate Austen, writing \"Foreigners, whether reading in translation or in the original, see little or nothing of her true brilliance...the \"feel\" of Jane Austen-so far as we can imagine it dissociated it from her language is still...peculiarly English\". Irvine wrote that Gard's book 1992 book \"Jane Austen's Novels: The Art of Clarity\" is full of historical errors such as his claim Austen was part of the movement towards \"an evolving national democracy\", when in fact the Great Reform Bill, which lowered the franchise requirements for men in a very limited way, was passed in 1832, 15 years after Austen's death, and \"nowhere in her novels or letters is England imagined as 'evolving' towards democracy of any kind\". Irvine wrote that while Austen did see England as different from the rest of Europe, she did not see England as apart from Europe in the way that Gard claimed or as a part of \"Anglo-Saxon civilisations\", which apparently include the United States and English-speaking parts of the Commonwealth, a way of thinking that did not exist in her time. Irvine charged that Gard appeared to be trying to use Austen as a way of furthering his opposition to British membership in the European Union, with his dichotomy between Austen's England with its \"clear\" style and \"unpolitical\" way of life vs. the presumably muddled style and \"political\" way of life of continental Europe with the implication that the two do not belong together.\n\nIn the late-1980s, 1990s and 2000s ideological, postcolonial and Marxist criticism dominated Austen studies. Generating heated debate, Edward Said devoted a chapter of his book \"Culture and Imperialism\" (1993) to \"Mansfield Park\", arguing that the peripheral position of \"Antigua\" and the issue of slavery demonstrated that colonial oppression was an unspoken assumption of English society during the early 19th century. The question of whether \"Mansfield Park\" justifies or condemns slavery has become heated in Austen scholarship, and Said's claims have proved to be highly controversial. The debate about \"Mansfield Park\" and slavery is the one issue that in Austen scholarship that has transcended the limits of academia to attract widespread public attention. Many of Austen's critics come from the field of post-colonial studies, and taken up Said's thesis about \"Mansfield Park\" reflecting the \"spatial\" understanding of the world that he argued was used to justify the British empire. Writing in a post-colonial vein, Carl Plasa in his 2001 essay \"'What Was Done There Is Not To Be Told' \"Mansfield Park\"'s Colonial Unconscious\" argued that the \"barbarism\" of Maria Bertram's sexuality, which leads her into adultery, is a metaphor for the \"barbarism\" of the Haitian revolution, which attracted much media attention in Britain at the time, which was often presented as due to the \"barbarism\" and uncontrolled sexuality of the Haitian slaves. Plasa argued that British society in Austen's time was based upon set of expectations about everyone being in their \"place\", which created order. The Haitian revolution was seen as a symbol of what happened to a society without order, and Plasa argued that it was not accident that when Sir Thomas Bertram leaves Mansfield Park for his plantation in Antigua that his family falls apart, showing the importance of the family and individuals staying in their proper \"place\". Likewise, Maaja Stewart in her 1993 book \"Domestic Realities and Imperial Fictions\" argued that the plantations in the Caribbean were the source of much worry about female sexuality in Austen's time with the main concerns being the need of slave owners to depend upon the fertility of slave women to create more slaves when the slave trade was abolished in 1807, and about the general collapse of traditional English morality in the West Indies as the slave masters routinely kept harems of slave women or alternatively raped female slaves. Stewart linked these concerns to \"Mansfield Park\", writing that Sir Thomas Bertram's failure to manage his own family is put down to his failure to manage the emerging sexuality of his teenage daughters, which is precisely the same charge that was applied to the owners of the plantations in the West Indies at the same time.\n\nOther critics have seen the message of \"Mansfield Park\" as abolitionist. Joseph Lew argued that Fanny's refusal to marry Henry Crawford as \"an act of rebellion, endangering a system based upon the exchange of women between men as surely as a slave's refusal to work\". Susan Fraiman, in a 1995 essay argued strongly against the Said thesis, arguing that the values of Sir Thomas are those which Austen affirms in \"Mansfield Park\" and that if his attempt to restore order to his family in Mansfield Park is seen as analogous with his restoration of order at his Antigua plantation, then he was a failure for the \"moral blight\" at Mansfield Park remains after he returns to England. Fraiman conceded to Said that Austen was one of the writers who \"made colonialism thinkable by constructing the West as center, home and norm\", but argued slavery in \"Mansfield Park\" \"is not a subtext wherein Austen and Sir Thomas converge\", but rather used by Austen \"to argue the essential depravity of Sir Thomas's relations to other people\". Fraiman argued that Austen used the issue of slavery to argue against the patriarchal power of an English gentleman over his family, his estate and \"by implication overseas\". Fraiman argued that British imperialist discourse tended to depict the British empire as masculine and the colonies as feminine, which again to the conclusion that Said had merely inverted this discourse by making Austen a representative of the British empire while lionizing various male anti-colonial writers from Britain's colonies. Brian Southam in a 1995 essay argued that much discussed scene about the \"dead silence\" that follows Fanny Price's questions about the status of slaves in the Caribbean refers to the moral decadence of those members of the British gentry who chosen to be involved in the abolitionist campaigns of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Trevor Lloyd in a 1999 article argued on the basis of the statements in the novel suggested that about 10% of the income from Mansfield Park come from the plantation in Antigua. John Wiltshire in a 2003 article argued that parallel between the condition of women in Britain and the treatment of slaves in the West Indies is to be understood as metaphoric as literal, and that Sir Thomas willingness to make a trip in the middle of a war to his plantation in Antigua, despite the well known perils of yellow fever and malaria in the Caribbean suggested he be understood as a good master. In Wiltshire's account, it is the slave trade, not slavery, that Austen condemns in \"Mansfield Park\".\n\nIrvine argued that though all of Austen's novels are set in provincial England, there is in fact a global component to her stories with the British Empire as a place where men go off in adventures, to get rich and to tell stories which edify the heroines. Irvine used as examples the naval career of Captain Wentworth in \"Persuasion\"; that Sir Thomas Bertram owes a plantation in Antigua while William Price joins the Royal Navy in \"Mansfield Park\"; and Colonel Brandon is a veteran of the campaigns in the West Indies in \"Sense and Sensibility\". Irvine observed that all of these men are in some way improved by the love of women, who domestic otherwise scarred men, noting that for example that Colonel Brandon had fought in the British campaign to conquer Saint-Domingue, where the British lost about 100,000 men between 1793–98, mostly to yellow fever, an experience that scarred him and left him looking for a \"home\". Irvine argued that Elinor Dashwood by arranging for Colonel Brandon to marry her sister Marianne is finding for him the \"home\" that he had lost while fighting for the British empire in a doomed effort to restore slavery to Saint-Domingue. Irvine suggested that for Austen, women had a role in domesticating men scarred by their imperial experiences, and that Said was wrong that Austen could \"not\" write of the British empire; arguing instead in Austen's works the \"stories of empire\" are placed in a \"context of their telling that domesticates them, removes them from the political and moral realm where the horrors they describe might demand a moral and political response\".\n\nAnother theme of recent Austen scholarship concerns her relationship with British/English national identity within the context of the long wars with France. Jon Mee in his 2000 essay \"Austen's Treacherous Ivory: Female Patriotism, Domestic Ideology, and Empire\" examined how Fanny Price defined her sense of Englishness in connection with the English countryside, arguing that Austen was presenting a version of \"England\" defined as country estates in a bucolic countryside that was insulated from a \"larger, more uncertain and un-English world\". Mee suggested that in \"Emma\", the very name of Mr. Knightley, which suggests the Middle Ages, together with the name of his estate, Donwell Abbey, are meant to suggest a continuity between medieval and modern England, in contrast to the newness of the political institutions in the novice republics in the United States and France. Miranda Burgress in her 2000 book \"British Fiction and the Production of Social Order\" argued that Austen defined her England as a nation made up of readers, as the experience of reading the same books had created a common culture across all of England. in this regard, Janet Sorenson in \"The Grammar of Empire\" noted that in Austen's books, none of her characters speak in dialect and all use the same form of polite \"King's English\" that was expected of the upper classes.\n\nIn \"Jane Austen and the Body: 'The Picture of Health\"', (1992) John Wiltshire explored the preoccupation with illness and health of Austen's characters. Wiltshire addressed current theories of \"the body as sexuality\", and more broadly how culture is \"inscribed\" on the representation of the body. There has also been a return to considerations of aesthetics with D. A. Miller's \"Jane Austen, or The Secret of Style\" (2003), which connects artistic concerns with queer theory. Miller in his book began the \"queer\" reading of Austen, as he asked why Austen's work which celebrates heterosexual love is so popular with gay men. Miller answered it is because the narrator of the novels has no sexuality and has a \"dazzling verbal style\", which allows homosexuals to identity with the narrator who stands outside of the world of heterosexuality and whose chief attribute is a sense of style.\n\nCritic Claudia Johnson defines \"Janeitism\" as \"the self-consciously idolatrous enthusiasm for 'Jane' and every detail relative to her\". Janeites not only read the novels of Austen; they also re-enact them, write plays based on them, and become experts on early 19th-century England and its customs. Austen scholar Deidre Lynch has commented that \"cult\" is an apt term for committed Janeites. She compares the practices of religious pilgrims with those of Janeites, who travel to places associated with Austen's life, her novels and the film adaptations. She speculates that this is \"a kind of time-travel to the past\" which, by catering to Janeites, preserves a \"vanished Englishness or set of 'traditional' values\". The disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen and the academic appreciation of Austen that began with Lascelles has since widened considerably. Johnson compares Janeites to Trekkies, arguing that both \"are derided and marginalized by dominant cultural institutions bent on legitimizing their own objects and protocols of expertise\". However, she notes that Austen's works are now considered to be part of both high culture and popular culture, while \"Star Trek\" can only claim to be a part of popular culture.\n\nSequels, prequels and adaptations based on Austen's work range from attempts to enlarge on the stories in Austen's own style to the soft-core pornographic novel \"Virtues and Vices\" (1981) and fantasy novel \"Resolve and Resistance\" (1996). Beginning in the middle of the 19th century, Austen family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels. By 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations of Austen's works. According to Lynch, \"her works appear to have proven more hospitable to sequelisation than those of almost any other novelist\". Relying on the categories laid out by Betty A. Schellenberg and Paul Budra, Lynch describes two different kinds of Austen sequels: those that continue the story and those that return to \"the world of Jane Austen\". The texts that continue the story are \"generally regarded as dubious enterprises, as reviews attest\" and \"often feel like throwbacks to the Gothic and sentimental novels that Austen loved to burlesque\". Those that emphasise nostalgia are \"defined not only by retrograde longing but also by a kind of postmodern playfulness and predilection for insider joking\", relying on the reader to see the web of Austenian allusions.\nBetween 1900 and 1975, over 60 radio, television, film and stage productions appeared. The first feature-film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. It has long been said that a Hollywood adaptation was first suggested by the entertainer Harpo Marx, who had seen a dramatisation of the novel in Philadelphia in 1935, but the story is of doubtful accuracy. Directed by Robert Z. Leonard and written in collaboration with the English novelist Aldous Huxley and American screenwriter Jane Murfin, the film was critically well-received, although the plot and characterisations strayed from Austen's original. Filmed in a studio and in black and white, the story's setting was relocated to the 1830s with opulent costume designs.\n\nIn direct opposition to the Hollywood adaptations of Austen's novels, BBC dramatisations from the 1970s onward aimed to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations, and settings. The 1972 BBC adaptation of \"Emma\", for example, took great care to be historically accurate, but its slow pacing and long takes contrasted unfavourably to the pace of commercial films. The BBC's 1980 adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\" adopted many film techniques—such as the use of long landscape shots—that gave the production a greater visual sophistication. Often seen as the start of the \"heritage drama\" movement, this production was the first to be filmed largely on location. A push for \"fusion\" adaptations, or films that combined Hollywood style and British heritage style, began in the mid-1980s. The BBC's first fusion adaptation was the 1986 production of \"Northanger Abbey\", which combined authentic style and 1980s punk, with characters often veering into the surreal.\n\nA wave of Austen adaptations began to appear around 1995, starting with Emma Thompson's adaptation of \"Sense and Sensibility\" for Columbia Pictures, a fusion production directed by Ang Lee. This star-studded film departed from the novel in many ways, but it became a commercial and critical success, and was nominated for numerous awards, including seven Oscars. The BBC produced two adaptations in 1995: \"Persuasion\" and Andrew Davies's six-episode television drama, \"Pride and Prejudice\". Starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle, Davies's production ignited \"Darcymania\" in Britain. Critics praised its smart departures from the novel as well as its sensual costuming, fast-paced editing, and original yet appropriate dialogue. The series sparked an explosion in the publication of printed Austen adaptations; in addition, 200,000 video copies of the serial were sold within a year of its airing, 50,000 within the first week alone. Another adaptation of \"Pride and Prejudice\" was released in 2005. Starring Keira Knightley, who was nominated for an Academy Award for her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet, Joe Wright's film marked the first feature adaptation since 1940 that aspired to be faithful to the novel. Three more film adaptations appeared in 2007—\"Mansfield Park\", \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\". \"Love & Friendship\", a film version of Austen's early epistolary novel \"Lady Susan\", was released in 2016. Directed by Whit Stillman and starring Kate Beckinsale and Chloe Sevigny, the film's title was taken from one of Austen's juvenile writings.\n\nBooks and scripts that use the general story line of Austen's novels but change or otherwise modernize the story also became popular at the end of the 20th century. \"Clueless\" (1995), Amy Heckerling's updated version of \"Emma\" that takes place in Beverly Hills, became a cultural phenomenon and spawned its own television series. \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2001), based on the successful 1996 book of the same name by Helen Fielding, was inspired by both \"Pride and Prejudice\" and the 1995 BBC adaptation. The Bollywoodesque production \"Bride and Prejudice\", which sets Austen's story in present-day India while including original musical numbers, premiered in 2004.\n\n\n",
                "Jane Austen\n\nJane Austen (; 16 December 1775 – 18 July 1817) was an English novelist known primarily for her six major novels, which interpret, critique and comment upon the British landed gentry at the end of the 18th century. Austen's plots often explore the dependence of women on marriage in the pursuit of favourable social standing and economic security. Her works critique the novels of sensibility of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. Her use of biting irony, along with her realism and social commentary, have earned her acclaim among critics and scholars.\n\nWith the publications of \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1811), \"Pride and Prejudice\" (1813), \"Mansfield Park\" (1814) and \"Emma\" (1816), she achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled \"Sanditon\", but died before its completion. She also left behind three volumes of juvenile writings in manuscript and another unfinished novel, The Watsons. Her six full-length novels have rarely been out of print, although they were published anonymously and brought her moderate success and little fame during her lifetime.\n\nA significant transition in her posthumous reputation occurred in 1833, when her novels were republished in Richard Bentley's Standard Novels series, illustrated by Ferdinand Pickering, and sold as a set. They gradually gained wider acclaim and popular readership. In 1869, fifty-two years after her death, her nephew's publication of \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" introduced a compelling version of her writing career and supposedly uneventful life to an eager audience.\n\nAusten has inspired a large number of critical essays and literary anthologies. Her novels have inspired many films, from 1940's \"Pride and Prejudice\" to more recent productions like \"Sense and Sensibility\" (1995) and \"Love & Friendship\" (2016). \n\nThere is little biographical information about Jane Austen's life except the few letters that survive and the biographical notes her family members wrote. During her lifetime Austen wrote approximately 3,000 letters but only about 160 survive. Many of the letters were written to Austen's older sister Cassandra, who in 1843 burned the greater part of them and cut pieces out of those she kept. Ostensibly Cassandra destroyed or censored her sister's letters to prevent their falling into the hands of relatives and ensuring that \"younger nieces did not read any of Jane Austen's sometimes acid or forthright comments on neighbors or family members\". Cassandra believed that in the interest of tact and Jane's penchant for forthrightness, these details should be destroyed. The paucity of record of Austen's life leaves modern biographers little to work with.\n\nThe situation was compounded as successive generations of the family expunged and sanitized the already opaque details of Austen's biography. The heirs of Jane's brother, Admiral Francis Austen, destroyed more letters; details were excised from the \"Biographical Notice\" her brother wrote in 1818; and family details continued to be elided or embellished in her nephew's \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\", published in 1869, and in William and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh's biography \"Jane Austen: Her Life and Letters\", published in 1913. The legend the family and relatives created reflects their biases in favour of \"good quiet Aunt Jane\", portraying a woman whose domestic situation was happy and whose family was the mainstay of her life. Austen scholar Jan Fergus explains that modern biographies tend to include details excised from the letters and family biographical materials, but that the challenge is to avoid the polarising view that Austen experienced periods of deep unhappiness and was \"an embittered, disappointed woman trapped in a thoroughly unpleasant family.\"\nJane Austen was born in Steventon, Hampshire, on 16 December 1775. She was born a month later than her parents expected; her father wrote of her arrival in a letter that her mother \"certainly expected to have been brought to bed a month ago\". He added that her arrival was particularly welcome as \"a future companion to her sister\". The winter of 1776 was particularly harsh and it was not until 5 April that she was baptised at the local church with the single name Jane.\n\nFor much of Jane's life, her father, George Austen (1731–1805) served as the rector of the Anglican parishes at Steventon, and a nearby Deane. He came from an old, respected, and wealthy family of wool merchants. Over the centuries as each generation of eldest sons received inheritances their wealth was consolidated, and George's branch of the family fell into poverty. He and his two sisters were orphaned as children and had to be taken in by relatives. His sister Philadelphia went to India to find a husband and George entered St John's College, Oxford on a fellowship, where he most likely met Cassandra Leigh (1739–1827). She came from the prominent Leigh family; her father was rector at All Souls College, Oxford, where she grew up among the gentry. Her eldest brother James inherited a fortune and large estate from his great-aunt Perrot, with the only condition that he change his name to Leigh-Perrot. \n\nGeorge and Cassandra exchanged miniatures in 1763 and probably were engaged around that time. George received the living for the Steventon parish from the wealthy husband of his second cousin, Thomas Knight, who owned Steventon and its associated farms, one of which the Austen family rented to live in. Two months after Cassandra's father died they married on 26 April 1764 at St Swithin's Church in Bath, by licence, in a simple ceremony. They left for Hampshire the same day. \n\nTheir income was modest, with George's small \"per annum\" living; Cassandra brought the expectation of a small inheritance at the time of her mother's death to the marriage. The Reverend Austen had an annual income of £200 pounds from his two livings. This was a very modest income at the time; by comparison, a skilled worker like a blacksmith or a carpenter could make about £100 pounds annually while the typical annual income of a gentry family was between £1, 000-£5, 000 pounds. The Austens took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then placed it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for twelve to eighteen months.\nIn 1768 the family finally took up residence in Steventon. Henry was the first child to be born there, in 1771. At about this time Cassandra could no longer ignore that little George was developmentally disabled. He was subject to seizures, may have been deaf and dumb, and she chose to send him out to be fostered. In 1773, Cassandra was born, followed by Francis in 1774, and Jane in 1775.\n\nAccording to Honan, life in the Austen home was lived in \"an open, amused, easy intellectual atmosphere\" where the ideas of those with whom the Austens might disagree politically or socially were considered and discussed. The family relied on the patronage of their kin and hosted visits from numerous family members. Cassandra Austen spent the summer of 1770 in London with George's sister, Philadelphia, and her daughter Eliza, accompanied by his other sister, Mrs Walter and her daughter Philly. Philadelphia and Eliza Hancock were, according to Le Faye, \"the bright comets flashing into an otherwise placid solar system of clerical life in rural Hampshire, and the news of their foreign travels and fashionable London life, together with their sudden descents upon the Steventon household in between times, all helped to widen Jane's youthful horizon and influence her later life and works.\"\n\nCassandra Austen's cousin Thomas Leigh visited a number of times in the 1770s and '80s, inviting young Cassie to visit them in Bath in 1781. The first mention of Jane occurs in family documents on her return, \"… and almost home they were when they met Jane & Charles, the two little ones of the family, who had to go as far as New Down to meet the chaise, & have the pleasure of riding home in it.\" Le Faye writes that, \"Mr Austen's predictions for his younger daughter were fully justified. Never were sisters more to each other than Cassandra and Jane; while in a particularly affectionate family there seems to have been a special link between Cassandra and Edward on the one hand, and between Henry and Jane on the other.\"\n\nFrom 1773 until 1796, George Austen supplemented his income by farming and by teaching three or four boys at a time, who boarded at his home.\n\nIn 1783, Austen and her sister Cassandra were sent to Oxford to be educated by Mrs Ann Cawley who took them with her to Southampton when she moved there later in the year. In the autumn both girls were sent home when they caught typhus and Austen nearly died. Austen was from then home educated, until she attended boarding school in Reading with her sister from early in 1785 at the Reading Abbey Girls' School, ruled by Mrs La Tournelle, who possessed a cork leg and a passion for theatre. The school curriculum probably included some French, spelling, needlework, dancing and music and, perhaps, drama. The sisters returned home before December 1786 because the school fees for the two girls were too high for the Austen family. After 1786, Austen \"never again lived anywhere beyond the bounds of her immediate family environment\".\n\nThe remainder of her education came from reading, guided by her father and brothers James and Henry. Irene Collins believes that Austen \"used some of the same school books as the boys\" her father tutored. Austen apparently had unfettered access both to her father's library and that of a family friend, Warren Hastings. Together these collections amounted to a large and varied library. Her father was also tolerant of Austen's sometimes risqué experiments in writing, and provided both sisters with expensive paper and other materials for their writing and drawing.\n\nPrivate theatricals were an essential part of Austen's education. From her early childhood, the family and friends staged a series of plays in the rectory barn, including Richard Sheridan's \"The Rivals\" (1775) and David Garrick's \"Bon Ton\". Austen's eldest brother James wrote the prologues and epilogues and she probably joined in these activities, first as a spectator and later as a participant. Most of the plays were comedies, which suggests how Austen's satirical gifts were cultivated. At the age of 12, she tried her own hand at dramatic writing; she wrote three short plays during her teenage years.\n\nBeginning at age 11, perhaps earlier, Austen wrote poems and stories for her own and her family's amusement. In these works the details of daily life are exaggerated, common plot devices are parodied, and the \"stories are full of anarchic fantasies of female power, licence, illicit behaviour, and general high spirits\", according to Janet Todd. Austen later compiled \"fair copies\" of 29 early works into three bound notebooks, now referred to as the \"Juvenilia\", containing work written between 1787 and 1793. She titled the three notebooks – \"Volume the First\", \"Volume the Second\" and \"Volume the Third\" – which preserve 90,000 words she wrote during those years. The \"Juvenilia\" are often, according to scholar Richard Jenkyns, \"boisterous\" and \"anarchic\"; he compares them to the work of 18th-century novelist Laurence Sterne.\n\nAmong these works are a satirical novel in letters titled \"Love and Freindship\" , written at age 14 in 1790, where she mocked popular novels of sensibility, and \"The History of England\", a manuscript of 34 pages accompanied by 13 watercolour miniatures by her sister, Cassandra. Austen's \"History\" parodied popular historical writing, particularly Oliver Goldsmith's \"History of England\" (1764). Honan speculates that not long after writing \"Love and Freindship\" in 1789, Austen decided to \"write for profit, to make stories her central effort\", that is, to become a professional writer. Beginning in about 1793, Austen began to write longer, more sophisticated works.\n\nIn August 1792 she started \"Catharine or the Bower\", which presaged her mature work, especially \"Northanger Abbey\"; it was left unfinished and the story picked up in \"Lady Susan\", which Todd describes as less prefiguring than \"Catharine\". A year later, she began but abandoned a short play, later titled \"Sir Charles Grandison or the happy Man, a comedy in 6 acts\", which she returned to and completed around 1800. This was a short parody of various school textbook abridgements of Austen's favourite contemporary novel, \"The History of Sir Charles Grandison\" (1753), by Samuel Richardson.\n\nBetween 1793 and 1795 Austen wrote \"Lady Susan\", a short epistolary novel, usually described as her most ambitious and sophisticated early work. It is unlike any of Austen's other works. Austen biographer Claire Tomalin describes the novella's heroine as a sexual predator who uses her intelligence and charm to manipulate, betray and abuse her lovers, friends and family. Tomalin writes:\n\nTold in letters, it is as neatly plotted as a play, and as cynical in tone as any of the most outrageous of the Restoration dramatists who may have provided some of her inspiration ... It stands alone in Austen's work as a study of an adult woman whose intelligence and force of character are greater than those of anyone she encounters.\nAccording to Janet Todd, the model for the title character may have been Eliza de Feuillide, who inspired Austen with stories of her glamorous life and various adventures. Eliza's French husband was guillotined in 1794; she married Jane's brother Henry Austen in 1797.\n\nAusten sent short pieces of writing to her newborn nieces Fanny Catherine and Jane Anna Elizabeth. There is manuscript evidence that Austen continued to work on these pieces as late as 1809–1811, and that her niece and nephew, Anna and James Edward Austen, made further additions as late as 1814.\n\nShe also attended church regularly, socialized frequently with friends and neighbours, and read novels – often of her own composition – aloud with her family in the evenings. Socialising with the neighbours often meant dancing, either impromptu in someone's home after supper or at the balls held regularly at the assembly rooms in the town hall. Her brother Henry later said that \"Jane was fond of dancing, and excelled in it\".\n\nWhen Austen was twenty, Tom Lefroy, a neighbour, visited Steventon from December 1795 to January 1796. He had just finished a university degree and was moving to London for training as a barrister. Lefroy and Austen would have been introduced at a ball or other neighbourhood social gathering, and it is clear from Austen's letters to Cassandra that they spent considerable time together: \"I am almost afraid to tell you how my Irish friend and I behaved. Imagine to yourself everything most profligate and shocking in the way of dancing and sitting down together.\"\n\nAusten wrote in her first surviving letter to her sister Cassandra that Lefroy was \"very gentlemanlike, good-looking, pleasant young man\". She called him her \"friend\" and explained that on this account Cassandra must be anxious to know more about her new \"friend\". Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote she expected an \"offer\" from her \"friend\" and that \"I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat\", going on to write \"I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence\" and refuse all others. The next day, Austen wrote: \"The day will come on which I flirt my last with Tom Lefroy and when you receive this it will be all over. My tears flow as I write at this melancholy idea\".\n\nHalperin cautioned that Austen often satirised popular sentimental romantic fiction in her letters, and some of the statements about Lefroy may have been ironic. However, it is clear that Austen was genuinely attracted to Lefroy and subsequently none of her other suitors ever quite measured up to him. The Lefroy family intervened and sent him away at the end of January. Marriage was impractical, as both Lefroy and Austen must have known. Neither had any money, and he was dependent on a great-uncle in Ireland to finance his education and establish his legal career. If Tom Lefroy later visited Hampshire, he was carefully kept away from the Austens, and Jane Austen never saw him again. In November 1798, Lefroy was still on Austen's mind as she wrote to her sister she had tea with one of his relatives, wanted desperately to ask about him, but could not bring herself to raise the subject.\nAfter finishing \"Lady Susan\", Austen began her first full-length novel \"Elinor and Marianne\". Her sister remembered that it was read to the family \"before 1796\" and was told through a series of letters. Without surviving original manuscripts, there is no way to know how much of the original draft survived in the novel published anonymously in 1811 as \"Sense and Sensibility\".\n\nAusten began a second novel, \"First Impressions\" (later published as \"Pride and Prejudice\"), in 1796. She completed the initial draft in August 1797, aged 21; as with all of her novels, Austen read the work aloud to her family as she was working on it and it became an \"established favourite\". At this time, her father made the first attempt to publish one of her novels. In November 1797, George Austen wrote to Thomas Cadell, an established publisher in London, to ask if he would consider publishing \"First Impressions\". Cadell returned Mr. Austen's letter, marking it \"Declined by Return of Post\". Austen may not have known of her father's efforts. Following the completion of \"First Impressions\", Austen returned to \"Elinor and Marianne\" and from November 1797 until mid-1798, revised it heavily; she eliminated the epistolary format in favour of third-person narration and produced something close to \"Sense and Sensibility\". In 1797, Austen met her cousin (and future sister-in-law), Eliza de Feullide, a French aristocrat whose first husband the Comte de Feullide had been guillotined, causing her to flee to Britain, where she married Henry Austen. The description of the execution of the Comte de Feullide related by his widow left Austen with an intense horror of the French Revolution that lasted for the rest of her life.\n\nDuring the middle of 1798, after finishing revisions of \"Elinor and Marianne\", Austen began writing a third novel with the working title \"Susan\" – later \"Northanger Abbey\" – a satire on the popular Gothic novel. Austen completed her work about a year later. In early 1803, Henry Austen offered \"Susan\" to Benjamin Crosby, a London publisher, who paid £10 for the copyright. Crosby promised early publication and went so far as to advertise the book publicly as being \"in the press\", but did nothing more. The manuscript remained in Crosby's hands, unpublished, until Austen repurchased the copyright from him in 1816.\n\nIn December 1800 George Austen unexpectedly announced his decision to retire from the ministry, leave Steventon, and move the family to 4, Sydney Place in Bath. While retirement and travel were good for the elder Austens, Jane Austen was shocked to be told she was moving from the only home she had ever known. An indication of her state of mind is her lack of productivity as a writer during the time she lived at Bath. She was able to make some revisions to \"Susan\", and she began and then abandoned a new novel, \"The Watsons\", but there was nothing like the productivity of the years 1795–1799. Tomalin suggests this reflects a deep depression disabling her as a writer, but Honan disagrees, arguing Austen wrote or revised her manuscripts throughout her creative life, except for a few months after her father died.\n\nThe years from 1801 to 1804 are something of a blank space for Austen scholars as Cassandra destroyed all of her letters from her sister in this period for unknown reasons. In December 1802 Austen received her only known proposal of marriage. She and her sister visited Alethea and Catherine Bigg, old friends who lived near Basingstoke. Their younger brother, Harris Bigg-Wither, had recently finished his education at Oxford and was also at home. Bigg-Wither proposed and Austen accepted. As described by Caroline Austen, Jane's niece, and Reginald Bigg-Wither, a descendant, Harris was not attractive – he was a large, plain-looking man who spoke little, stuttered when he did speak, was aggressive in conversation, and almost completely tactless. However, Austen had known him since both were young and the marriage offered many practical advantages to Austen and her family. He was the heir to extensive family estates located in the area where the sisters had grown up. With these resources, Austen could provide her parents a comfortable old age, give Cassandra a permanent home and, perhaps, assist her brothers in their careers. By the next morning, Austen realised she had made a mistake and withdrew her acceptance. No contemporary letters or diaries describe how Austen felt about this proposal. In 1814, Austen wrote a letter to her niece, Fanny Knight, who had asked for advice about a serious relationship, telling her that \"having written so much on one side of the question, I shall now turn around & entreat you not to commit yourself farther, & not to think of accepting him unless you really do like him. Anything is to be preferred or endured rather than marrying without Affection\". The English scholar Douglas Bush wrote that Austen had \"had a very high ideal of the love that should unite a husband and wife ... All of her heroines ... know in proportion to their maturity, the meaning of ardent love\". A possible autobiographical element in \"Sense and Sensibility\" occurs when Elinor Dashwood contemplates that \"the worse and most irremediable of all evils, a connection for life\" with an unsuitable man.\nIn 1804, while living in Bath, Austen started but did not complete her novel, \"The Watsons\". The story centres on an invalid and impoverished clergyman and his four unmarried daughters. Sutherland describes the novel as \"a study in the harsh economic realities of dependent women's lives\". Honan suggests, and Tomalin agrees, that Austen chose to stop work on the novel after her father died on 21 January 1805 and her personal circumstances resembled those of her characters too closely for her comfort.\n\nHer father's relatively sudden death left Jane, Cassandra, and their mother in a precarious financial situation. Edward, James, Henry, and Francis Austen pledged to make annual contributions to support their mother and sisters. For the next four years, the family's living arrangements reflected their financial insecurity. They spent part of the time in rented quarters in Bath before leaving the city in June 1805 for a family visit to Steventon and Godmersham. They moved for the autumn months to the newly fashionable seaside resort of Worthing, on the Sussex coast, where they resided at Stanford Cottage. It was here that Austen is thought to have written her fair copy of \"Lady Susan\" and added its \"Conclusion\". In 1806 the family moved to Southampton, where they shared a house with Frank Austen and his new wife. A large part of this time they spent visiting various branches of the family.\n\nOn 5 April 1809, about three months before the family's move to Chawton, Austen wrote an angry letter to Richard Crosby, offering him a new manuscript of \"Susan\" if needed to secure the immediate publication of the novel, and requesting the return of the original so she could find another publisher. Crosby replied that he had not agreed to publish the book by any particular time, or at all, and that Austen could repurchase the manuscript for the £10 he had paid her and find another publisher. She did not have the resources to buy the copyright back at that time, but was able to purchase it in 1816.\n\nAround early 1809 Austen's brother Edward offered his mother and sisters a more settled life – the use of a large cottage in Chawton village that was part of Edward's nearby estate, Chawton House. Jane, Cassandra and their mother moved into Chawton cottage on 7 July 1809. Life was quieter in Chawton than it had been since the family's move to Bath in 1800. The Austens did not socialise with gentry and entertained only when family visited. Her niece Anna described the family's life in Chawton as \"a very quiet life, according to our ideas, but they were great readers, and besides the housekeeping our aunts occupied themselves in working with the poor and in teaching some girl or boy to read or write.\"\n\nDuring her time at Chawton, Jane Austen published four generally well received novels. Through her brother Henry, the publisher Thomas Egerton agreed to publish \"Sense and Sensibility\", which appeared in October 1811. Reviews were favourable and the novel became fashionable among young aristocratic opinion-makers; the edition sold out by mid-1813. Austen's earnings from \"Sense and Sensibility\" provided her with some financial and psychological independence. Egerton then published \"Pride and Prejudice\", a revision of \"First Impressions\", in January 1813. He advertised the book widely and it was an immediate success, garnering three favourable reviews and selling well. By October 1813 Egerton was able to begin selling a second edition. \"Mansfield Park\" was published by Egerton in May 1814. While \"Mansfield Park\" was ignored by reviewers, it was very popular with readers. All copies were sold within six months, and Austen's earnings on this novel were larger than for any of her other novels. Unknown to Austen, her novels were translated into French and published in cheaply produced, pirated editions in France. The literary critic Noel King commented that given the prevailing rage in France at the time was for lush romantic fantasies, it is remarkable that her novels with the emphasis on everyday English life had any sort of a market in France. However, King cautioned that Austen's chief translator in France, Madame Isabelle de Montolieu, had only the most rudimentary knowledge of English, and her translations were more of \"imitations\" than translations proper, as Montolieu depended upon assistants to provide a summary, which she then translated into an embellished French that often radically altered Austen's plots and characters. The first of the Austen novels to be published that credited her as the author was in France, when \"Persuasion\" was published in 1821 as \"La Famille Elliot ou L'Ancienne Inclination\".\n\nAusten learned that the Prince Regent admired her novels and kept a set at each of his residences. In November 1815, the Prince Regent's librarian James Stanier Clarke invited Austen to visit the Prince's London residence and hinted Austen should dedicate the forthcoming \"Emma\" to the Prince. Though Austen disliked the Prince Regent, she could scarcely refuse the request. Austen disapproved of the Prince Regent on the account of his womanising, gambling, drinking, spendthrift ways and generally disreputable behaviour. She later wrote \"\", a satiric outline of the \"perfect novel\" based on the librarian's many suggestions for a future Austen novel. Austen was greatly annoyed by Clarke's often pompous literary advice, and the \"Plan of A Novel\" parodying Clarke was intended as her revenge for all of the unwanted letters she had received from the royal librarian.\n\nIn mid-1815 Austen moved her work from Egerton to John Murray, a better known London publisher, who published \"Emma\" in December 1815 and a second edition of \"Mansfield Park\" in February 1816. \"Emma\" sold well but the new edition of \"Mansfield Park\" did poorly, and this failure offset most of the income from \"Emma\". These were the last of Austen's novels to be published during her lifetime.\n\nWhile Murray prepared \"Emma\" for publication, Austen began \"The Elliots\", later published as \"Persuasion\". She completed her first draft in July 1816. In addition, shortly after the publication of \"Emma\", Henry Austen repurchased the copyright for \"Susan\" from Crosby. Austen was forced to postpone publishing either of these completed novels by family financial troubles. Henry Austen's bank failed in March 1816, depriving him of all of his assets, leaving him deeply in debt and losing Edward, James, and Frank Austen large sums. Henry and Frank could no longer afford the contributions they had made to support their mother and sisters.\n\nAusten was feeling unwell by early 1816, but ignored the warning signs. By the middle of that year, her decline was unmistakable, and she began a slow, irregular deterioration. The majority of biographers rely on Dr. Vincent Cope's 1964 retrospective diagnosis and list her cause of death as Addison's disease, although her final illness has also been described as resulting from Hodgkin's lymphoma. When her uncle died and left his entire fortune to his wife, effectively disinheriting his relatives, she suffered a relapse, writing, \"I am ashamed to say that the shock of my Uncle's Will brought on a relapse ... but a weak Body must excuse weak Nerves\".\n\nShe continued to work in spite of her illness. Dissatisfied with the ending of \"The Elliots\", she rewrote the final two chapters, which she finished on 6 August 1816. In January 1817 Austen began \"The Brothers\" (titled \"Sanditon\" when published in 1925), and completed twelve chapters before stopping work in mid-March 1817, probably due to illness. Todd describes \"Sanditon\"'s heroine, Diana Parker, as an \"energetic invalid\". In the novel, Austen mocked hypochondriacs and though she describes the heroine as \"bilious\", five days after abandoning the novel she wrote of herself that she was turning \"every wrong colour\" and living \"chiefly on the sofa\". She put down her pen on 18 March 1817, making a note of it.\n\nAusten made light of her condition, describing it as \"bile\" and rheumatism. As her illness progressed, she experienced difficulty walking and lacked energy; by mid-April she was confined to bed. In May Cassandra and Henry brought her to Winchester for treatment, by which time she suffered agonising pain and welcomed death. Austen died in Winchester on 18 July 1817, at the age of 41. Henry, through his clerical connections, arranged for his sister to be buried in the north aisle of the nave of Winchester Cathedral. The epitaph composed by her brother James praises Austen's personal qualities, expresses hope for her salvation and mentions the \"extraordinary endowments of her mind\", but does not explicitly mention her achievements as a writer.\n\nAfter Austen's death, Cassandra, Henry Austen and Murray arranged for the publication of \"Persuasion\" and \"Northanger Abbey\" as a set. Henry Austen contributed a \"Biographical Note\" which for the first time identified his sister as the author of the novels. Tomalin describes it as \"a loving and polished eulogy\". Sales were good for a year – only 321 copies remained unsold at the end of 1818.\n\nIn 1832 Richard Bentley purchased the remaining copyrights to all of her novels, and over the following winter published five illustrated volumes as part of his \"Standard Novels\" series. In October 1833, Bentley released the first collected edition of her works. Since then, Austen's novels have been continuously in print.\n\nAusten's works critique the sentimental novels of the second half of the 18th century and are part of the transition to 19th-century literary realism. The earliest English novelists, Richardson, Henry Fielding and Tobias Smollett, were followed by the school of sentimentalists and romantics such as Walter Scott, Horace Walpole, Clara Reeve, Ann Radcliffe, Laurence Sterne and Oliver Goldsmith, whose style and genre Austen rejected, returning the novel on a \"slender thread\" to the tradition of Richardson and Fielding for a \"realistic study of manners\". In the mid-20 century, literary critics F. R. Leavis and Ian Watt placed her in the tradition of Richardson and Fielding; both believe that she used their tradition of \"irony, realism and satire to form an author superior to both\".\n\nWalter Scott noted Austen's \"resistance to the trashy sensationalism of much of modern fiction – 'the ephemeral productions which supply the regular demand of watering places and circulating libraries'\". Yet her rejection of these genres is complex, as evidenced by \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Emma\". Similar to William Wordsworth, who excoriated the modern frantic novel in the \"Preface\" to his \"Lyrical Ballads\" (1800), Austen distances herself from escapist novels; the discipline and innovation she demonstrates is similar to his, and she shows \"that rhetorically less is artistically more.\" She eschewed popular Gothic fiction, stories of terror in which a heroine typically was stranded in a remote location, a castle or abbey (32 novels between 1784 and 1818 contain the word \"abbey\" in their title). Yet in \"Northanger Abbey\" she alludes to the trope, with the heroine, Catherine, anticipating a move to a remote locale. Rather than full-scale rejection or parody, Austen transforms the genre, juxtaposing reality, with descriptions of elegant rooms and modern comforts, against the heroine's \"novel-fueled\" desires. Nor does she completely denigrate Gothic fiction: instead she transforms settings and situations, such that the heroine is still imprisoned, yet her imprisonment is mundane and real – regulated manners and the strict rules of the ballroom. In \"Sense and Sensibility\" Austen presents characters who are more complex than in staple sentimental fiction, according to critic Keymer, who notes that although it is a parody of popular sentimental fiction, \"Marianne in her sentimental histrionics responds to the calculating world ... with a quite justifiable scream of female distress.\"\nRichardson's \"Pamela\", the prototype for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love story with a happy ending, written at a time women were beginning to have the right to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly to the reader and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.\n\nAusten had a natural ear for speech and dialogue, according to scholar Mary Lascelles \"Few novelists can be more scrupulous than Jane Austen as to the phrasing and thoughts of their characters.\" Techniques such as fragmentary speech suggest a character's traits and their tone; \"syntax and phrasing rather than vocabulary\" is utilised to indicate social variants. Dialogue reveals a character's mood – frustration, anger, happiness – each treated differently and often through varying patterns of sentence structures. When Elizabeth Bennett rejects Darcy, her stilted speech and the convoluted sentence structure reveals that he has wounded her:\nFrom the very beginning, from the first moment I may almost say, of my acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form that the groundwork of disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike. And I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.\nAusten's plots highlight women's traditional dependence on marriage to secure social standing and economic security. As an art form, the 18th-century novel lacked the seriousness of its equivalents from the 19th century, when novels were treated as \"the natural vehicle for discussion and ventilation of what mattered in life\". Rather than delving too deeply into the psyche of her characters, Austen enjoys them and imbues them with humour, according to critic John Bayley. He believes that the well-spring of her wit and irony is her own attitude that comedy \"is the saving grace of life\". Part of Austen's fame rests on the historical and literary significance that she was the first woman to write great comic novels. Samuel Johnson's influence is evident, in that she follows his advice to write \"a representation of life as may excite mirth\".\n\nHer humour comes from her modesty and lack of superiority, allowing her most successful characters, such as Elizabeth Bennet, to transcend the trivialities of life, which the more foolish characters are overly absorbed in. Austen used comedy to explore the individualism of women's lives and gender relations, and she appears to have used it to find the goodness in life, often fusing it with \"ethical sensibility\", creating artistic tension. Critic Robert Polhemus writes, \"To appreciate the drama and achievement of Austen, we need to realize how deep was her passion for both reverence and ridicule ... and her comic imagination reveals both the harmonies and the telling contradictions of her mind and vision as she tries to reconcile her satirical bias with her sense of the good.\"\n\nAs Austen's works were published anonymously, they brought her little personal renown. They were fashionable among opinion-makers, but were rarely reviewed. Most of the reviews were short and on balance favourable, although superficial and cautious. They most often focused on the moral lessons of the novels. Sir Walter Scott, a leading novelist of the day, contributed one anonymously. Using the review as a platform to defend the then-disreputable genre of the novel, he praised Austen's realism. The other important early review was attributed to Richard Whately in 1821. However, Whately denied having authored the review, which drew favourable comparisons between Austen and such acknowledged greats as Homer and Shakespeare, and praised the dramatic qualities of her narrative. Scott and Whately set the tone for almost all subsequent 19th-century Austen criticism.\n\nBecause Austen's novels did not conform to Romantic and Victorian expectations that \"powerful emotion [be] authenticated by an egregious display of sound and colour in the writing\", 19th-century critics and audiences preferred the works of Charles Dickens and George Eliot. In a rare sympathetic review, in this case of \"Emma\" in 1815, Sir Walter Scott wrote that book displayed \"the art of copying from nature as she really exists in the common walks of life, and presenting to the reader, instead of the splendid scenes from an imaginary world, a correct and striking representation of that which is daily taking place around him\". Though Scott was positive, Austen's work did not match the prevailing aesthetic values of the Romantic \"zeitgeist\". Her novels were republished in Britain from the 1830s and sold at a steady rate, but they were not bestsellers. The first French critic who paid notice to Austen was Philarète Chasles who completely dismissed her as a writer, giving her two sentences in an 1842 essay on the influence of Sir Walter Scott, calling her a boring, imitative writer who wrote nothing of substance. Apart from Chasles, Austen was almost completely ignored in France until 1878.\n\nAusten had many admiring readers in the 19th century who considered themselves part of a literary elite. Philosopher and literary critic George Henry Lewes expressed this viewpoint in a series of enthusiastic articles published in the 1840s and 1850s. This theme continued later in the century with novelist Henry James, who referred to Austen several times with approval and on one occasion ranked her with Shakespeare, Cervantes, and Henry Fielding as among \"the fine painters of life\".\n\nThe publication of James Edward Austen-Leigh's \"A Memoir of Jane Austen\" in 1869 introduced Austen to a wider public as \"dear aunt Jane\", the respectable maiden aunt. Publication of the \"Memoir\" spurred the reissue of Austen's novels – the first popular editions were released in 1883 and fancy illustrated editions and collectors' sets quickly followed. Author and critic Leslie Stephen described the popular mania that started to develop for Austen in the 1880s as \"Austenolatry\". In 1878, the French critic Léon Boucher published the essay \"Le Roman Classique en Angleterre\", where he called Austen a \"genius\", which was the first time that epithet had been used in France to describe Austen. The first proper translation of Austen into French that was completely faithful to the original occurred in 1899 when Félix Fénéon translated \"Northanger Abbey\" into French as \"Catherine Moreland\". Around the start of the 20th century, members of the literary elite reacted against the popularisation of Austen. They referred to themselves as \"Janeites\" in order to distinguish themselves from the masses who did not properly understand her works. For example, Henry James responded negatively to what he described as \"a beguiled infatuation\" with Austen, a rising tide of public interest that exceeded Austen's \"intrinsic merit and interest\". The American literary critic A. Walton Litz noted that the \"anti-Janites\" in the 19th and 20th centuries comprise a formidable literary squad of Mark Twain, Henry James, Charlotte Bronte, D.H. Lawrence and Kingsley Amis, but in \"every case the adverse judgement merely reveals the special limitations or eccentricities of the critic, leaving Jane Austen relativity untouched\".\n\nSeveral of Austen's works have been subject to academic study. The first dissertation on Austen was published in 1883, by George Pellew, a student at Harvard University. The first examination came from a 1911 essay by Oxford Shakespearean scholar A. C. Bradley. In his essay, Bradley groups Austen's novels into \"early\" and \"late\" works, a distinction still used by scholars today. The first academic books devoted to Austen in France was \"Jane Austen\" by Paul and Kate Rague published in 1914, where the Ragues set out to explain why French critics and readers should take Austen seriously. The same year, Léonie Villard published \"Jane Austen, Sa Vie et Ses Oeuvres\", which was originally her PhD thesis, marking the first time that Austen had subjected to a serious academic study in France. The second examination in English was R. W. Chapman's 1923 edition of Austen's collected works. Not only was it the first scholarly edition of Austen's works, it was also the first scholarly edition of any English novelist. The Chapman text has remained the basis for all subsequent published editions of Austen's works.\n\nWith the publication in 1939 of Mary Lascelles's \"Jane Austen and Her Art\", the academic study of Austen took hold. Lascelles's innovative work included an analysis of the books Austen read and the effect of her reading on her work, an extended analysis of Austen's style, and her \"narrative art\". Concern arose that academics were taking over Austen criticism and that it was becoming increasingly esoteric, a debate that has continued since.\n\nThe period since World War II has seen more scholarship on Austen using a diversity of critical approaches, including feminist theory, and perhaps most controversially, postcolonial theory. The continuing disconnection between the popular appreciation of Austen, particularly by modern Janeites, and the academic appreciation of Austen has widened considerably. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Austen was in disfavor with the authorities who only wanted Western authors to be published in translation whose work could be presented as representing the West in a negative light, and Austen was regarded as too \"frivolous\" for this purpose. As hostile as the treatment of Austen was in the 1950s, it paled besides the treatment of her books during the \"Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution\" in China between 1966–69, when Austen was banned as a \"British bourgeois imperialist\" author. In the late 1970s, Austen was allowed to be published in China, where her popularity with readers confounded the authorities who had trouble understanding that people sometimes want to read books for enjoyment instead of dialectical purposes. A sign of the way that Austen can still spark debate can be seen when the American English professor Gene Koppel mentioned in a lecture that Austen and her family were \"Tories of the deepest dye\" [the Tories were the conservative party while the Whigs were the liberal party], a statement which greatly upset many of Koppel's liberal students, who much to his amusement, complained to him how was it possible that Austen was a conservative?. The conservative Koppel noted several feminist authors such as Claudia Johnson and Mollie Sandock were claiming Austen for their own cause. Citing the work of Hans-Georg Gadamer, Koppel argued that different people can and do react to the same work of literature in different ways as art is always a subjective discipline as various people have their standards for evaluating literature. As such, Koppel argued that competing interpretations of Austen's work, provided that they are grounded in readings of her work are all equally valid, and so it is equally possible to see Austen as a feminist critiquing Regency society and as a conservative upholding the values of Regency society.\n\nAusten's novels have resulted in sequels, prequels and adaptations of almost every type, from soft-core pornography to fantasy. From the 19th century, her family members published conclusions to her incomplete novels, and by 2000 there were over 100 printed adaptations. The first dramatic adaptation of Austen was published in 1895, Rosina Filippi's \"Duologues and Scenes from the Novels of Jane Austen: Arranged and Adapted for Drawing-Room Performance\", and Filippi was also responsible for the first professional stage adaptation, \"The Bennets\" (1901). The first film adaptation was the 1940 MGM production of \"Pride and Prejudice\" starring Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson. BBC television dramatisations since the 1970s have attempted to adhere meticulously to Austen's plots, characterisations and settings. The British critic Robert Irvine noted that in American film adaptations of Austen's novels, starting with the 1940 version of \"Pride and Prejudice\" and continuing on to today, class is subtly downplayed as the United States is officially an egalitarian nation where all people are equal and the society of Regency England depicted by Austen that is grounded in a hierarchy based upon the ownership of land and the antiquity of the family name is one that Americans cannot embrace in its entirety.\n\nFrom 1995 a large number of Austen adaptations began to appear, with Ang Lee's film of \"Sense and Sensibility\", for which screenwriter and star Emma Thompson won an Academy Award, and the BBC's immensely popular TV mini-series \"Pride and Prejudice\", starring Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth. A 2005 British production of \"Pride and Prejudice\", directed by Joe Wright and starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen, was followed in 2007 by ITV's \"Mansfield Park\", \"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", and in 2016 by \"Love & Friendship\", a film version of \"Lady Susan\" that borrowed the title of Austen's \"Love and \" [sic].\n\nNovels\n\nUnfinished fiction\n\nOther works\n\nJuvenilia – Volume the First (1787–1793)\n\nJuvenilia – Volume the Second (1787–1793)\n\nJuvenilia – Volume the Third (1787–1793)\n\n\n",
                "Becoming Jane\n\nBecoming Jane is a 2007 British-Irish biographical romantic drama film directed by Julian Jarrold. It depicts the early life of the English author Jane Austen and her lasting love for Thomas Langlois Lefroy. American actress Anne Hathaway stars as the title character, while her romantic interest is played by Scottish actor James McAvoy. Also appearing in the film are Julie Walters, James Cromwell and Maggie Smith. The film was produced in cooperation with several companies, including Ecosse Films and Blueprint Pictures. It also received funding from the Irish Film Board and the UK Film Council Premiere Fund.\n\nThe film is partly based on the 2003 book \"Becoming Jane Austen\" by Jon Hunter Spence, who was also hired as historical consultant. The final screenplay, developed by Sarah Williams and Kevin Hood, pieced together some known facts about Austen into a coherent story, in what co-producer Graham Broadbent called \"our own Austenesque landscape.\" According to Hood, he attempted to weave together \"what we know about Austen's world from her books and letters,\" and believed Austen's personal life was the inspiration for \"Pride and Prejudice\". Jarrold began production of the film in early 2006, opting to shoot primarily in Ireland as he found it had better-preserved locations than Hampshire, England, where Austen was raised.\n\nReleased firstly in the United Kingdom on 9 March 2007 and in other countries later in the year, \"Becoming Jane\" earned approximately $37 million worldwide. The film received mixed reviews from critics. Hathaway's performance received mixed critical reception, with some reviewers negatively focusing on her nationality and accent. Commentators and scholars have analysed the presence of Austen characters and themes within the film, and also noted the implementation of mass marketing in the film's release.\n\nJane Austen is the younger daughter of Reverend George Austen and his wife and has yet to find a suitable husband. She aspires to be a writer, to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father.\n\nThomas Lefroy is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation, which he describes as \"typical\" for people in the profession. Tom makes a terrible first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile, she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley, the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham. Wisley proposes but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they argue but increasingly take interest in each other and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane's literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love.\n\nTom, Jane, her brother Henry and Jane's rich widowed cousin, Eliza, Comtesse de Feullide, conspire to receive an invitation from Tom's uncle and benefactor, the Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London, for the rich \"Madame La Comtesse\" and her friends. This visit is meant to be a short break in their journey to see Jane's brother, Edward. This would allow Judge Langlois to get to know Jane before and give a blessing for their marriage. Full of hope, Jane cannot sleep during the night at the Judge's place. In a flow of inspiration, she then begins the writing of \"First Impressions\", the manuscript that will become \"Pride and Prejudice\".\n\nHowever, Judge Langlois receives a letter informing him of the genteel poverty of Jane's family and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her and she is crushed, not knowing that Tom has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially.\n\nJane returns home and soon learns that Tom has become engaged to someone else at the arrangement of his family. Jane accepts the marriage proposal of Mr. Wisley, whom she had earlier declined. Later, Tom realises he cannot live without Jane, and returns, asking Jane to run away with him, for \"what value will there be in life, if we are not together?\" Jane agrees, and they leave, with only Jane's sister Cassandra knowing they plan to marry in secret.\n\nOn the way, Jane stumbles upon a letter from Tom's mother, and realises his situation: he sends money he receives from his uncle back to his parents and siblings, and his family cannot survive without it. She tells Tom that they cannot elope, not with so many people depending upon him. He insists that he and Jane must marry and tells her he will earn money, but Jane tells him that it will not be enough; he will never be able to make enough money to support his dependents with a High Court judge (his uncle) as an enemy and with a penniless wife. Distraught, Tom asks her if she loves him, and she replies, \"Yes, but if our love destroys your family, then it will destroy itself, in a long, slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame.\" As she leaves, Jane catches a last glimpse of Tom through the carriage window as he briefly follows, the horses outpacing him.\n\nTwenty years later, Jane, now a successful author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom during a gathering. Henry, now married to Eliza, brings Tom to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter, who admires Jane's novels. Tom's daughter asks Jane to read aloud, but as Jane rarely does so he remonstrates with his daughter using her name, which is also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to read. The last scene shows Tom's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from \"Pride and Prejudice\", while Tom watches Jane affectionately. As she concludes, their eyes meet, and Tom joins the rest of the company in honouring Jane and her work with applause.\n\n\nIn 2004, screenwriter Sarah Williams approached Douglas Rae and Robert Bernstein of Ecosse Films with the intention of creating a film about the life of Jane Austen, a popular eighteenth century English novelist. Williams had recently read \"Becoming Jane Austen\", a 2003 biography that largely pieced together several known facts, such as Austen's meeting Tom Lefroy on Christmas 1795, into a coherent story about unrequited love. Bernstein agreed to adapt the work, believing that it depicted \"a pivotal relationship in Jane Austen's early life that was largely unknown to the public.\" The book's author, Jon Hunter Spence, was hired as a historical consultant on the film, with the task of \"see[ing] that, given that the 'story' is a work of imagination, the factual material was as accurate as possible within the limitations of the story.\"\n\nAfter Williams completed several drafts of the screenplay, the company hired Kevin Hood to aid in further script development. Bernstein believed that Hood's past work contained \"a romantic sensibility... There is a poetic quality about his writing as well as there being a rigorous emotional truth which I thought was important for Jane.\" Hood was attracted to the film because he believed \"the story is such an important one and very much the inspiration for \"Pride and Prejudice\".\" Calling Austen a \"genius\" and \"one of the top two or three prose writers of all time\", Hood thought that her relationship with Lefroy \"was absolutely essential in shaping her work.\" Hood acknowledged however that \"Becoming Jane\" is \"based on the facts as they are known and the majority of characters did exist, as did many of the situations and circumstances in the film. Some have been fictionalised, weaving together what we know about Austen's world from her books and letters, creating a rich Austenite landscape.\"\n\nJulian Jarrold became attached to direct the film in early 2005. It was his second feature film, after \"Kinky Boots\", which was released later that year. According to Bernstein, he \"liked [Jarrold's] style as it was modern and visceral, and I just had a feeling that he was the right choice. This piece needed to be handed with delicacy but also with a certain amount of brio and Julian was able to bring those two things to the production.\" The director began work on the project in early 2006, rereading the novels \"Pride and Prejudice\", \"Sense and Sensibility\", and \"Persuasion\" and also reviewing Austen biographies such as Spence's book. Jarrold depended most heavily on the script, calling it \"a rich, witty and clever screenplay from someone who obviously knew his subject very well. It is a love story but much more besides. Kevin's screenplay has so many layers and interesting ideas. Apart from the love story I was very attracted by the themes of imagination and experience.\" The director intended to \"bring Austen up to date by roughening her up a bit\" and adding \"more life and energy and fun,\" opining that past Austen adaptations had been \"a little bit picture-postcard and safe and sweet and nice.\"\n\nJarrold sought to make \"Becoming Jane\" \"look and feel\" realistic \"so everything is not lit in a very glamorous Hollywood way.\" According to him, \"One of the key ideas in the film was to get away from the old, stuffy costume drama kind of feel of what Jane Austen is and to look at somebody before she becomes a genius, when she is in her early twenties and on the verge of writing her great thing; she had a real exuberance for life, intelligent and independent and a sort of outsider in rural Hampshire, more intelligent than the people around her and kicking against all those pressures.\" To further set his film apart from other costume dramas, American actress Anne Hathaway was cast as the title character. A fan of Jane Austen since she was fourteen, Hathaway immediately began rereading Austen's books, conducting historical research including perusing the author's letters, and also learned sign language, calligraphy, dance choreography, and playing the piano. She moved to England a month before production began to improve her English accent, and attempted to stay in character throughout filming, the first time she had done so for a movie.\n\nThere were concerns in some quarters that the American Hathaway was playing a beloved English writer. James McAvoy, who plays Thomas Langlois Lefroy, believed that filming in Ireland made her casting \"a bit safer\" than if they had shot in England. McAvoy accepted the role because he enjoyed Austen's writings and was eager to work with Jarrold, having collaborated with him previously on the 2002 television production \"White Teeth\". McAvoy first assumed that \"Becoming Jane\" would be directly associated with \"Pride and Prejudice\", with his character possessing similarities with Mr. Darcy; the actor soon realised however \"that the screenplay was nothing like \"Pride and Prejudice\". The screenwriter probably speculated on some of the inspiration for \"Pride and Prejudice\" but it is a completely different story.\"\n\nJulie Walters had once disliked Austen's writings but changed her mind when she read \"Pride and Prejudice\" after receiving her role as Mrs. Austen. Appearing as Mr. Austen was actor James Cromwell, who viewed his character as \"a generous gentleman, well educated and supportive of Jane for the most part. He is bedevilled by his financial circumstances but deeply in love with his wife and sympathetic to her concerns about what will happen to the girls if they don't marry.\" Joe Anderson portrayed Henry Austen, while Lucy Cohu played the widowed Eliza de Feuillide, the Austens' worldly cousin and Henry's romantic interest. Cohu believed that her character \"needs security. She is looking to be safe. She finds that security with Henry as she knows the Austen family.\"\n\nAnna Maxwell Martin appeared as Jane's sister Cassandra. The actress called her character \"terribly sensible\", noting that she \"gets her heart broken. It's very sad. She's the levelling force for Jane Austen, the wild one. She tries to get her back in line, but fails miserably.\" \"Becoming Jane\" also featured Laurence Fox as Mr. Wisley and Dame Maggie Smith as Lady Gresham, whom Jarrold viewed as possessing \"similarities to Lady Catherine De Burgh in \"Pride and Prejudice\" but in this film you get to see her hidden vulnerabilities – the pain of never having had children and her controlling maternal power over Wisley.\" Other cast members included Ian Richardson as Judge Langlois, Leo Bill as John Warren, Jessica Ashworth as Lucy Lefroy, Michael James Ford as Mr. Lefroy, Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Robert Fowle, and Helen McCrory as Mrs. Radcliffe.\n\nIrish costume designer Eimer Ní Mhaoldomhnaigh designed the clothing seen in the film. She attempted to create a different style of costumes than had been seen in recent Austen adaptations, and drew inspiration from the fashions of the 1790s, a time period she considered \"fascinating\" and a \"very transitional era in terms of fashion... it was a real challenge to make it work.\" Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh attended the Cannes Film Festival in May 2006 but then had to quickly return to the \"Becoming Jane\" set to complete the last two days of filming. She later collaborated with Jarrold in the 2008 drama film \"Brideshead Revisited\".\n\nFor research, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh visited museums and art galleries, and also read Austen's letters and novels. She was interested in both the effects of continental fashions on English clothing and the differences between social classes. While she recognised that 1795 \"marked the beginning\" of the empire waistline trend, Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh also understood this fashion would have barely been introduced to Austen's circle in the country; rather, the film displayed many costume designs from the early 1790s. She explained, \"We wanted to show that transition especially for the women. The look in London is very different from the look in the countryside. For the country ball the fashion for the older women is more of the old style but for the younger women we show the introduction of the Empire line.\"\n\nThe costume designer created all of Hathaway's outfits from scratch, and \"looked for images of a young Jane Austen.\" Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh explained, \"I wanted to get her youthfulness and innocence across through her dress. But crucially there was also her strength of character. So we kept away from frills and flounces. I wanted a definite look that was quite strong but also pretty at the same time. Jane was living on a working farm so her dress had to be practical as well. In terms of the costume we were definitely trying to steer away from the chocolate box image that we associate with Jane Austen.\"\n\nNí Mhaoldhomhnaigh dressed McAvoy in rich fabrics, such as velvet and beaver fur, to help distinguish him from the other men. She recalled that \"he wears very stylish waist coats and cut-away jackets. With Jane around he'd have an extra swagger in front of her. James (McAvoy) was really into it. We'd talk about the colours and fabrics to achieve his distinctive look.\" Ní Mhaoldhomhnaigh and Maggie Smith agreed that Lady Gresham's dresses would be modelled after 1770s fashion, which was \"the sort of dress that the character would have worn when she was much younger and suited her back then. Lady Gresham is very much her own character and is not someone who is dictated to by fashion.\" Smith's dresses contained stiff fabrics \"to emphasise a woman who was very set in her ways\".\n\nProduced independently by Ecosse, \"Becoming Jane\" was given a limited budget of €12.7 million (£9 million or $16.5 million). Production designer Eve Stewart researched Regency literature and Austen's life, and along with Jarrold, scouted locations in Dublin and nearby counties for five weeks in January and February 2006. They ultimately opted to shoot in Dublin and the Irish counties of Meath and Wicklow instead of Hampshire, the birthplace of Austen, because it held \"a sense of countryside that felt more unchanged,\" while Hampshire had unfortunately become too \"groomed and manicured\". Jarrold also found \"a great variety of Georgian houses and older houses\" in Ireland. His production received funds from the Irish Film Board, the UK Film Council Premiere Fund, 2 Entertain, Scion Films, and Miramax Films. Film critic Andrew Sarris noted that in Ireland \"happily, there are still architectural traces of life more than 200 years ago to correspond with the year 1795.\" However, Ireland did include a few disadvantages: Stewart found that \"the rural aspects were the most difficult as the Irish country landscape is nothing like Hampshire. There are no rolling hills so the vegetation and the landscaping was the trickiest thing for me as a production designer.\"\nDue to its low budget, \"Becoming Jane\" was filmed on a \"tight\" schedule of eight weeks from March to May 2006. Jarrold observed however that because Ecosse was not a film studio, he had more creative freedom. Bernstein stated of filming, \"We recreated a world that Jane Austen lovers can recognise and associate with. But hopefully we can also take them into areas and places like the boxing club, the cricket game and the fair that do not feature in Jane Austen's fiction. They are sort of seedy and dangerous areas that are not normally associated with Austen.\" Jarrold found filming \"very difficult. We had to make it work in the locations that we had as efficiently as possible.\" Filming outdoors was often so cold that Hathaway turned blue and had difficulty saying her lines; Automated Dialogue Replacement in post-production helped correct this by re-dubbing her lines.\n\nThe story's central location was set at Steventon rectory where Austen was raised. While it had been demolished in 1824, Jarrold and his crew \"fortunately found a wonderful house that was very like the original... We honed the script as well to make it as practical as possible.\" Stewart believed that the Austen house expressed their status and wealth, \"I think that you will lose the central thrust of the story unless you understand the status of the Austen's and that they are pretty poor. Jane spent all her formative years there and that was the place that influenced her view of the world. You have to believe that the family live in that house because that is a crucial piece of the jigsaw.\" Scenes at Steventon rectory were filmed in Higginsbrook House, a few miles off Trim in County Meath. Later in fall 2006, it appeared again as the house of the Morlands in \"Northanger Abbey\".\n\nCharleville Castle stood in for the interior scenes of Lady Gresham's estate, while Kilruddery House, an old Elizabethan revival estate, provided the exterior shots of the property. Other filming sites included Cloghlee Bridge in the Dublin Mountains (as Mr. Austen's rectory) and Dublin's Henrietta Street and North Great George's Street as Regency London. A house on Henrietta Street also provided the filming site for Mrs. Radcliffe's residence. Gentleman Jackson's club, where Lefroy boxes, was represented by \"the dark and otherworldly\" Mother Redcaps tavern, also in Dublin.\n\nThe musical score of the film was written by English composer Adrian Johnston. To prepare melodies, he reviewed music books that had belonged to the Austen family. The first track, \"First Impressions\", has been described as a \"depressing\" song that \"exhibits slow, pure and classical piano work\"; one critic quipped that it belonged in \"\"Becoming Sylvia Plath \"\". Later tracks ranged \"in mood from upbeat and playful to somber and teary.\" In his review of the score, Tim Clark of Soundtrack.net lamented the \"absence of a truly memorable theme, despite a wealth of thematic material,\" and found similarities to Dario Marianelli's composition for the 2005 film \"Pride & Prejudice\".\n\nPatsy Morita, a music critic for \"Allmusic\", wrote that the second half of Johnston's score becomes as \"unremarkable\" as \"so many other dramatic film scores of the early twenty-first century.\" She continued, \"It fulfills its purpose of underscoring the emotion of the story by being moody and slow to change melodically and harmonically, and by using many pregnant pauses and minimalist-leaning repetitive figures.\" Morita added that \"there is nothing in it to draw attention away from the film.\" The score later received a nomination for Best Original Film Score at the 2008 Ivor Novello Awards. The film soundtrack was released on 31 July 2007. A track listing for the album is as follows:\n\nHenry Purcell's \"Hole in the Wall,\" also known as \"St. Martin's Lane,\" which is featured in the ballroom scene, was first published in 1695 and is highly unlikely to have been common during the Regency, when Jane Austen was a young adult.\n\nDownloadable editions of the original soundtrack include six bonus tracks of music heard in the film:\n\nJon Spence, the author of the biography the film was based on, identifies \"Tom Lefroy as the love of Austen's life and her relationship with him as the origin of her genius. But he never suggests that there was an aborted elopement (much less subsequent reading sessions with any of Lefroy's children). And he is careful, as the filmmakers are not, to clarify that in speculating about Austen's romantic experience he is reading between the lines of the family records and of the three rather opaque Austen letters that are his principal sources.\"\n\nAn important deviation of the film's plot from history is that there is scant evidence in real life Austen and Lefroy's relationship went beyond acquaintance. Rather, all that is known of them together is that they danced at three Christmas balls before Tom returned to school and that Jane was \"too proud\" to ask his aunt about him two years later. In the latter years of Tom Lefroy's life, he was questioned about his relationship with Jane Austen by his nephew, and admitted to having loved Jane Austen, but stated that it was a \"boyish love\". As is written in a letter sent from T.E.P. Lefroy to James Edward Austen Leigh in 1870,My late venerable uncle ... said in so many words that he was in love with her, although he qualified his confession by saying it was a boyish love. As this occurred in a friendly & private conversation, I feel some doubt whether I ought to make it public.Lori Smith, author of \"The Jane Austen Guide to Life\", opined that:No doubt this relationship and her [Jane's] repartee with Tom fueled her writing. Whether it was \"her greatest inspiration\" as the trailers for \"Becoming Jane\" claim, well, that's debatable. But I'm sure it provided as spark.However, contrary to the film's story line, Jane had attempted her first full-length novel before she met Tom and had already read \"The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling\" before meeting him. In a cut scene from the movie, it is clear that she is reading the novel for the second time, but in the theatrical release without that scene, it appears he introduces her to it.\n\nVarious commentators have offered opinions concerning the presence in the film of characters and themes from Austen's works, particularly with \"Pride and Prejudice\". Deborah Cartmell contended that Hathaway's Austen is a \"replica of Elizabeth Bennet (with a touch of impetuous Lydia thrown in),\" and added that the associations between Austen and Elizabeth are \"more explicit than in\" any other Austen biopic. Tim Robey of \"The Daily Telegraph\" declared that the film took \"good old \"P&P\"s storyline and replace[d] Elizabeth Bennet with Austen herself [and added] a real-life pseudo-Darcy from the skimpiest of biographical evidence.\" \"A Companion to Jane Austen\" observed that the \"physicality\" of Jane and Lefroy's kiss was similar to the \"passionate kiss\" between Elizabeth and Darcy in the 1995 serial \"Pride and Prejudice\".\n\n\"Empire\" magazine further expressed that \n\nThe implementation of mass marketing in the film's production and release has attracted notice from film and literary scholars. Dianne F. Sadoff writes that \"Becoming Jane\" \"confirms the two-decades-long megaplexing of Jane Austen.\" According to Andrew Higson, the film was another example of \"Austen Power\" and the desire of filmmakers to \"exploit the possibilities of both the Austen industry and the market for literary cinema and television – and more generally, the market for 'traditional' English drama.\" While reviewing Austen adaptations of the 1990s and 2000s in her book \"Heritage Film: Nation, Genre and Representation\", author Belén Vidal viewed \"Becoming Jane\" as yet another \"transformation of Austen's novels into icons of popular culture.\" To Vidal, this and other productions, such as \"The Jane Austen Book Club\" (2007) and \"Miss Austen Regrets\" (2008), confirmed \"the generic status of the Austen phenomenon whilst dispensing with the incorporation of the literary text.\"\n\n\"Becoming Jane\" followed a different formula than the Austen adaptations of the 1990s and attempted to draw viewers from a variety of demographic groups. Hathaway's casting was intended to attract young female viewers who had enjoyed the actress in \"The Princess Diaries\" and \"\". According to producers, the view was that this demographic group would have been in their early teens during the release of the \"Princess\" films, making them \"the right age\" for Austen as 15-year-olds. Expecting \"Becoming Jane\" to be a popular film, in February 2007 Penguin Books announced new editions of six of Austen's best-known novels; their redesigned covers were intended to attract teenage readers.\n\n\"Becoming Jane\" has been referred to as a heritage costume drama film, a genre which has been popular in the United States among both its audiences and its film studios. According to Andrew Higson, \"Becoming Jane\" falls into the continuing trend of American attitudes influencing English film. Belén Vidal wrote that the film \"exploit[s] a well-defined heritage iconography and strategically combine[s] American stars with supporting casts of international 'quality' players.\" Hilary Radner analysed the presence of the \"marriage plot\" – a girl succeeding only by marrying the man of her choice – in film and television, and noted that while \"Becoming Jane\" critiques this film trope, it \"points to the power of the traditional marriage plot as a residual paradigm influencing feminine identity.\"\n\nJarrold's adaptation also came in the wake of a number of literary biographical films, such as \"Shakespeare in Love\" and \"Miss Potter\". Deborah Cartmell, author of \"Screen Adaptations: Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice: A Close Study of the Relationship between Text and Film\", found similarities between \"Becoming Jane\" and \"Shakespeare in Love\" \"almost so obvious that the [former] film risks the accusation of being dangerously derivative.\" A given example included the characters of Austen and William Shakespeare inputting their personal experiences directly into their works. Marina Cano López and Rosa María García-Periago explained that the film \"follows the path opened by John Madden’s \"Shakespeare in Love\". The numerous intertextual connections between both movies can be reduced to one: just as Shakespeare is imagined as the hero of his own play, Jane Austen becomes the heroine of her own novel.\" Among other listed similarities, they noted that the romantic interests of both protagonists serve as their literary muses, and that the middle part of both films \"lie\" when viewed from a historical perspective.\n\nThe world premiere of \"Becoming Jane\" took place in London on 5 March 2007. It was released to cinemas on 9 March 2007 in the United Kingdom and a week later in Ireland by Buena Vista International. It ultimately grossed £3.78 million in the UK and Ireland, placing in sixteenth among all UK films for the year in those markets. Sixty-three percent of the audience was female, and 40.5 percent were above the age of 55. The film's performance was considered \"disappointing\", and it influenced the US release date. It arrived in Australia on 29 March.\n\nMiramax Films distributed the film in the United States, giving it a release date of 3 August 2007. Originally, the studio intended to release \"Becoming Jane\" in June or July due to a \"counter-programming\" strategy, attempting to attract demographic groups who were not interested in large blockbusters. The film was expected to perform well during all seven days of the week and gradually gain more viewers during its time in cinemas. Due to the presence of recognizable stars such as Hathaway, \"Becoming Jane\" was expected to also do well among mainstream audiences. However, due to its weak UK release, the film's release was moved to August, when it opened on 100 screens in its first week. It increased to 601 screens the following week, later reaching 1,210 screens. While the film made under $1 million in its first week, it was considered \"a highly respectable showing for a heritage biopic\" and enough of a figure to \"justify a ten-week run.\" The film eventually grossed a total of $18,670,946 in the US.\n\nOn an international scale, \"Becoming Jane\" received a total of $37,311,672. It earned its highest grosses in the US, the UK, and Australia.\n\n\"Becoming Jane\" was released on DVD and Blu-ray in the UK on 10 September 2007, a month after it arrives in cinemas in the US. On 12 February 2008, Disney and Miramax released the DVD and Blu-ray in the US. Both versions contained audio commentary with Jarrold, Hood, and Bernstein, deleted scenes, \"Pop-Up Facts & Footnotes,\" and a featurette called \"Discovering the Real Jane Austen\". The US home video rights to the film have since been picked up by Echo Bridge Entertainment and the film has seen several reissues on Blu-ray and DVD, often packaged with other films such as \"Jane Eyre\".\n\nFilm review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 57% based on reviews from 136 critics. The site summarized the consensus: \"Although \"Becoming Jane\" is a well-crafted period piece, it lacks fresh insight into the life and works of Jane Austen. The film focuses too much on wardrobe and not enough on Austen's achievements.\" \"The New York Times\" called the film a \"triumph\" for Hathaway, but observed that \"the screenplay’s pseudo-Austen tone is so consistent that its lapses into modern romance-novel fantasy [and] threatens to derail the film.\" More positive, \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the film \"a charmer,\" articulating that \"the supporting cast (Julie Walters, Maggie Smith, James Cromwell) is top-drawer; and Anne Hathaway, with her coltish beauty and frank demeanor, is a welcome Jane.\"\n\nCritics lauded Hathaway and McAvoy for the chemistry between their characters, finding that it lent authenticity to the love story between Austen and Lefroy. While Hathaway was admired for her performance by some critics, some reviews negatively focused on her nationality as well as the inauthenticity of her accent. James McAvoy defended the decision of casting Hathaway by stating that a director should, \"find the right actor…and [she] is undoubtedly brilliant.\" Hathaway herself admitted the persistent tendency to \"sound too much like myself and not at all like Jane\", blaming cold weather in Ireland, which meant she had to do voice retakes for several scenes. Nonetheless, Jarrold praised Hathaway for her performance. In a wrap up party after the filming, the director confessed that the actress had been a different person, \"not just her accent but also the whole character, the way of holding yourself and speaking was so completely different\".\n\n\"Time Out London\" gave a positive review, enunciating that \"Overall, the approach is less fluffily contrived than you’d expect, and though the alignment of circumstance and social status thwarting innocent passions is hardly fresh, it’s handled with thoughtful decorum. The emotional temperature’s rather restrained as a result, but with luxury casting all down the line... elegant visuals balancing verdant and velvet, and a delightful faux-classical score, it’s a classy package, all right – just missing the extra spark.\" Some reviewers have questioned the historical accuracy of the film, for instance critiquing the depicted relationship between Austen and Lefroy.\n\n\"Becoming Jane\" and the 2008 BBC serial \"Sense and Sensibility\" have been credited with \"renew[ing] interest\" in Jane Austen's House Museum in Chawton. According to Robin Bischert, the chief executive of Bath Tourism Plus, Bath, Somerset gained \"more than £150,000 worth of free media exposure\" in the wake of \"Becoming Jane\" and \"Persuasion\", a 2007 television production adapted from another Austen novel. As the city is heavily associated with Austen, the company took advantage of \"Becoming Jane\"s release in order to celebrate the author and her writings. In late September 2007, Bath launched the seventh Jane Austen festival, which included a parade of people in Regency costumes, readings, tours, and discussions about the author. In addition, the city offered events such as Tea with Mr. Darcy to mark the release of the \"Becoming Jane\" DVD.\n\nThe film's production had a positive impact on the Irish economy, as it resulted in a direct expenditure of €7.1 million, providing jobs for 116 crew members and 17 actors, and also offered 1,250 days of work for extras. John O'Donoghue, the country's Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, visited the set and stated \n\n"

                "Sushi\n\nSushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients, and many others are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish is popular as a garnish.\n\nSushi is often confused with sashimi, a related Japanese dish consisting of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.\n\nSushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known today as \"narezushi\" ( – \"salted fish\"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling; the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish. This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term \"sushi\" comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means \"sour-tasting\"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as \"funa-zushi\" from Shiga Prefecture.\n\nVinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the rice's sourness, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be furthered developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became \"oshi-zushi\"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.\n\nIt was not until the Edo period (1603-1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice. The particular style of today's \"nigirizushi\" became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of \"nigirizushi\"'s origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799-1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku. The dish was originally termed \"Edomae zushi\" as it used freshly caught fish from the \"Edo-mae\" (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term \"Edomae nigirizushi\" is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" mistakenly notes the earliest written mention of sushi in English in an 1893 book, \"A Japanese Interior\", where it mentions sushi as \"a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring\". However, there is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese-English dictionary from 1873, and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal \"Notes and Queries\".\n\nThe common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared \"sushi rice\". Fillings, toppings, condiments, and preparation vary widely.\n\nNote that due to rendaku consonant mutation, sushi is spelled with a \"z\" instead of an \"s\" whenever a prefix is attached, such as in nigirizushi for instance.\n\n\"Chirashizushi\" (, \"scattered sushi\", also referred to as \"barazushi\") serves the rice in a bowl and tops it with a variety of raw fish and vegetable garnishes. It is commonly eaten because it is filling, fast and easy to make. It is eaten annually on Hinamatsuri in March.\n\nInarizushi () is a pouch of fried tofu typically filled with sushi rice alone.\n\nTales tell that inarizushi is named after the Shinto god \"Inari\". Foxes, messengers of Inari are believed to have a fondness for fried tofu, and an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears.\n\nRegional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette (, \"fukusa-zushi\", or , \"chakin-zushi\") instead of tofu. It should not be confused with \"inari maki\", which is a roll filled with flavored fried tofu.\n\nCone sushi is a variant of \"inarizushi\" originating in Hawaii that may include green beans, carrots, or gobo along with rice, wrapped in a triangular aburage piece. It is often sold in \"okazu-ya\" (Japanese delis) and as a component of bento boxes.\nMakizushi (, \"rolled sushi\"), norimaki (, \"Nori roll\") or makimono (, \"variety of rolls\") is a cylindrical piece, formed with the help of a bamboo mat known as a \"makisu\" (). \"Makizushi\" is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed), but is occasionally wrapped in a thin omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or shiso (perilla) leaves. \"Makizushi\" is usually cut into six or eight pieces, which constitutes a single roll order. Below are some common types of \"makizushi\", but many other kinds exist.\nFutomaki (, \"thick, large or fat rolls\") is a large cylindrical piece, usually with \"nori\" on the outside. A typical \"futomaki\" is five to six centimeters (2–2.5 in) in diameter. They are often made with two, three, or more fillings that are chosen for their complementary tastes and colors. During the evening of the Setsubun festival, it is traditional in the Kansai region to eat uncut futomaki in its cylindrical form, where it is called \"ehō-maki\" (, lit. happy direction rolls). By 2000 the custom had spread to all of Japan. Futomaki are often vegetarian, and may utilize strips of cucumber, \"kampyō\" gourd, \"takenoko\" bamboo shoots, or lotus root. Strips of \"tamagoyaki\" omelette, tiny fish roe, chopped tuna, and \"oboro\" whitefish flakes are typical non-vegetarian fillings. Traditionally, the rice is lightly seasoned with salt and sesame oil/perilla oil. Popular protein ingredients are fish cakes, imitation crab meat, eggs, or seasoned beef rib-eye. Vegetables usually include cucumbers, spinach, carrot and (pickled radish). After the makizushi has been rolled and sliced, it is typically served with takuan.\n\nShort grain white rice is usually used, although short-grain brown rice, like olive oil on nori, is now becoming more widespread among the health-conscious. Rarely, sweet rice is mixed in makizushi rice.\nNowadays, the rice in makizushi can be many kinds of black rice, boiled rice and cereals etc.Besides the common ingredients listed above, some varieties may include cheese, spicy cooked squid, yakiniku, kamaboko, lunch meat, sausage, bacon or spicy tuna. The nori may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds. In a variation, sliced pieces of makizushi may be lightly fried with egg coating.\n\nHosomaki (, \"thin rolls\") is a small cylindrical piece, with \"nori\" on the outside. A typical \"hosomaki\" has a diameter of about two and a half centimeters (1 in). They generally contain only one filling, often tuna, cucumber, \"kanpyō\", thinly sliced carrots, or, more recently, avocado. \"Kappamaki\", () a kind of \"Hosomaki\" filled with cucumber, is named after the Japanese legendary water imp fond of cucumbers called the kappa. Traditionally, \"kappamaki\" is consumed to clear the palate between eating raw fish and other kinds of food, so that the flavors of the fish are distinct from the tastes of other foods. \"Tekkamaki\" () is a kind of \"hosomaki\" filled with raw tuna. Although it is believed that the word \"tekka\", meaning \"red hot iron\", alludes to the color of the tuna flesh or salmon flesh, it actually originated as a quick snack to eat in gambling dens called \"tekkaba\" (), much like the sandwich. \"Negitoromaki\" () is a kind of \"hosomaki\" filled with scallion (\"negi\") and chopped tuna (\"toro\"). Fatty tuna is often used in this style. \"Tsunamayomaki\" () is a kind of \"hosomaki\" filled with canned tuna tossed with mayonnaise.\n\nTemaki (, \"hand roll\") is a large cone-shaped piece of \"nori\" on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end. A typical \"temaki\" is about ten centimeters (4 in) long, and is eaten with fingers because it is too awkward to pick it up with chopsticks. For optimal taste and texture, \"temaki\" must be eaten quickly after being made because the \"nori\" cone soon absorbs moisture from the filling and loses its crispness, making it somewhat difficult to bite through. For this reason, the \"nori\" in pre-made or take-out temaki is sealed in plastic film which is removed immediately before eating.\n\n\"Narezushi\" (, \"matured sushi\") is a traditional form of fermented sushi. Skinned and gutted fish are stuffed with salt, placed in a wooden barrel, doused with salt again, then weighed down with a heavy tsukemonoishi (pickling stone). As days pass, water seeps out and is removed. After six months, this \"sushi\" can be eaten, remaining edible for another six months or more. The most famous variety of \"narezushi\" still being produced is \"funa-zushi\" (made from fish of the crucian carp genus, authentically from \"C. auratus grandoculis\" () endemic to Lake Biwa), a typical dish of Shiga Prefecture.\n\n\"Nigirizushi\" (, \"hand-pressed sushi\") consists of an oblong mound of \"sushi rice\" that the chef presses between the palms of the hands to form an oval-shaped ball, and a topping (the \"neta\") draped over the ball. It is usually served with a bit of \"wasabi\"; \"neta\" are typically fish such as salmon, tuna or other seafood. Certain toppings are typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of \"nori\", most commonly octopus (\"tako\"), freshwater eel (\"unagi\"), sea eel (\"anago\"), squid (\"ika\"), and sweet egg (\"tamago\"). One order of a given type of fish typically results in two pieces, while a sushi set (sampler dish) may contain only one piece of each topping.\n\n\"Gunkanmaki\" (, \"warship roll\") is a special type of \"nigirizushi\": an oval, hand-formed clump of sushi rice that has a strip of \"nori\" wrapped around its perimeter to form a vessel that is filled with some soft, loose or fine-chopped ingredient that requires the confinement of \"nori\" such as roe, \"nattō\", oysters, \"uni\" (sea urchin roe), corn with mayonnaise, scallops, and quail eggs. \"Gunkan-maki\" was invented at the \"Ginza Kyubey\" restaurant in 1941; its invention significantly expanded the repertoire of soft toppings used in sushi.\n\n\"Temarizushi\" (, \"ball sushi\") is a sushi made by pressing rice and fish into a ball-shaped form by hand using a plastic wrap.\n\n, also known as , \"hako-zushi\", \"box sushi\"), is a pressed sushi from the Kansai region, a favorite and specialty of Osaka. A block-shaped piece is formed using a wooden mold, called an \"oshibako\". The chef lines the bottom of the \"oshibako\" with the toppings, covers them with sushi rice, and then presses the lid of the mold down to create a compact, rectilinear block. The block is removed from the mold and then cut into bite-sized pieces. Particularly famous is (\"battera\", pressed mackerel sushi) or (\"saba zushi\"). In \"oshizushi\", all the ingredients are either cooked or cured and raw fish is never used.\nThe increasing popularity of \"sushi\" around the world has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world, but rarely in Japan (a notable exception to this is the use of salmon, which was introduced by Bjorn Eirik Olsen, a Norwegian businessman tasked with helping the Norwegian salmon industry sell more fish in the early 1980s). Such creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll (a \"norimaki\" with crab (later, imitation crab), cucumber, and avocado). A wide variety of popular rolls (\"norimaki\" and \"uramaki\") has evolved since. Norway roll is another variant of \"uramakizushi\" filled with \"tamago\" (omelette), imitation crab and cucumber, rolled with \"shiso\" leaf and \"nori\", topped with slices of Norwegian salmon, garnished with lemon and mayonnaise.\n\nUramaki (, \"inside-out roll\") is a medium-sized cylindrical piece with two or more fillings, and was developed as a result of the creation of the California roll, as a method originally meant to hide the nori. \"Uramaki\" differs from other \"makimono\" because the rice is on the outside and the \"nori\" inside. The filling is in the center surrounded by \"nori\", then a layer of rice, and optionally an outer coating of some other ingredients such as roe or toasted sesame seeds. It can be made with different fillings, such as tuna, crab meat, avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber or carrots.\n\nExamples of variations include the rainbow roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced \"maguro, hamachi, ebi, sake\" and avocado) and the caterpillar roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced avocado). Also commonly found is the \"rock and roll\" (an inside-out roll with barbecued freshwater eel and avocado with toasted sesame seeds on the outside).\n\nIn Japan, \"uramaki\" is an uncommon type of \"makimono\"; because sushi is traditionally eaten by hand in Japan, the outer layer of rice can be quite difficult to handle with fingers.\n\n\"Futomaki\" is a more popular variation of sushi within the United States, and comes in variations that take their names from their place of origin. Other rolls may include a variety of ingredients, including chopped scallops, spicy tuna, beef or chicken teriyaki roll, okra, and assorted vegetables such as cucumber and avocado, and the \"tempura roll\", where shrimp tempura is inside the roll or the entire roll is battered and fried tempura-style. In the Southern United States, many sushi restaurants prepare rolls using crawfish. Sometimes, rolls are made with brown rice or black rice, which appear in Japanese cuisine as well.\n\nPer Food and Drug Administration regulations, raw fish served in the United States must be frozen prior to serving in order to kill parasites. Because of this and the relative difficulty of acquiring fresh seafood compared to Japan, raw seafood (e.g., sashimi) is not as prevalent of a component in American-style sushi.\n\nSince rolls are usually made to-order it is not unusual for the customer to specify the exact ingredients desired (e.g. salmon roll, cucumber roll, avocado roll, Shrimp/tuna tempura roll, tuna roll, etc.). Though the menu names of dishes often vary by restaurant, some examples include:\n\nAll sushi has a base of specially prepared rice, complemented with other ingredients.\n\n\"Sushi-meshi\" (also known as \"Su-meshi\" , \"shari\" , or \"gohan\" ) is a preparation of white, short-grained, Japanese rice mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally kombu and \"sake\". It has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a \"sushi\" or else it will get too sticky while being seasoned. Traditionally, the mixing is done with a hangiri, which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a wooden paddle (shamoji).\n\nSushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi is different from glutinous rice. Freshly harvested rice (\"shinmai\") typically contains too much water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some fusion cuisine restaurants, short-grain brown rice and wild rice are also used.\n\nThere are regional variations in sushi rice and individual chefs have their individual methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the Kantō region (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; in Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.\n\nThe black seaweed wrappers used in \"makimono\" are called \"nori\" (海苔). \"Nori\" is a type of algae, traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in a process similar to making rice paper. Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets.\n\nThe size of a \"nori\" sheet influences the size of \"makimono\". A full-size sheet produces \"futomaki\", and a half produces \"hosomaki\" and \"temaki\". To produce \"gunkan\" and some other \"makimono\", an appropriately-sized piece of \"nori\" is cut from a whole sheet.\n\n\"Nori\" by itself is an edible snack and is available with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi.\n\nWhen making \"fukusazushi\", a paper-thin omelette may replace a sheet of \"nori\" as the wrapping. The omelette is traditionally made on a rectangular omelette pan (makiyakinabe), and used to form the pouch for the rice and fillings.\n\nFor culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to that of fish which is to be cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection. Commonly used fish are tuna (\"maguro, shiro-maguro\"), Japanese amberjack, yellowtail (\"hamachi\"), snapper (\"kurodai\"), mackerel (\"saba\"), and salmon (\"sake\"). The most valued sushi ingredient is \"toro,\" the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a variety of \"ōtoro\" (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and \"chūtoro\", meaning \"middle toro\", implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between \"toro\" and the regular cut. \"Aburi\" style refers to \"nigiri\" sushi where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw \"neta\".\n\nOther seafoods such as squid (\"ika\"), eel (\"anago\" and \"unagi\"), pike conger (\"hamo\"), octopus (\"tako\"), shrimp (\"ebi\" and \"amaebi\"), clam (\"mirugai\", \"aoyagi\" and \"akagai\"), fish roe (\"ikura\", \"masago\", \"kazunoko\" and \"tobiko\"), sea urchin (\"uni\"), crab (\"kani\"), and various kinds of shellfish (abalone, prawn, scallop) are the most popular seafoods in sushi. Oysters, however, are less common, as the taste is not thought to go well with the rice. \"Kani kama\", or imitation crab stick, is commonly substituted for real crab, most notably in California rolls.\n\nPickled daikon radish (\"takuan\") in \"shinko maki\", pickled vegetables (\"tsukemono\"), fermented soybeans (\"nattō\") in \"nattō maki\", avocado, cucumber in \"kappa maki\", asparagus, yam, pickled ume (\"umeboshi\"), gourd (\"kanpyō\"), burdock (\"gobo\"), and sweet corn (possibly mixed with mayonnaise) are also used in sushi.\n\nTofu and eggs (in the form of slightly sweet, layered omelette called \"tamagoyaki\" and raw quail eggs ride as a \"gunkan-maki\" topping) are common.\n\nSushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in shōyu, soy sauce, and is usually flavored with wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated stem of the \"Wasabia japonica\" plant. Japanese-style mayonnaise is a common condiment in Japan on salmon, pork and other sushi cuts.\n\nTrue wasabi has anti-microbial properties and may reduce the risk of food poisoning. The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or \"samegawa oroshi\". An imitation wasabi (\"seiyo-wasabi\"), made from horseradish, mustard powder and green dye is common. It is found at lower-end \"kaiten-zushi\" restaurants, in bento box sushi and at most restaurants outside Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled \"Japanese Horseradish\".\n\nGari (sweet, pickled ginger) is eaten in between sushi courses to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion. In Japan, green tea (\"ocha\") is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as \"mecha\". In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as \"agari\".\n\nSushi may be garnished with gobo, grated daikon, thinly sliced vegetables, carrots/radishes/cucumbers that have been shaped to look like flowers, real flowers, or seaweed salad.\n\nWhen closely arranged on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called \"baran\" or \"kiri-zasa\" (切り笹). These dividers prevent the flavors of neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the \"Aspidistra elatior\" (葉蘭 \"haran\") and \"Sasa veitchii\" (熊笹 \"kuma-zasa\") plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had the added benefit of releasing antimicrobial phytoncides when cut thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi. Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic in order to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration which acted to extend the shelf life of sushi without the need for the cut leaves. Today the plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and to a lesser degree in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish.\n\nThe main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in protein, carbohydrates (the rice only), vitamins, and minerals, as are \"gari\" and \"nori\". Other vegetables wrapped within the sushi also offer various vitamins and minerals. Many of the seafood ingredients also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have a variety of health benefits. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish has certain beneficial property, especially on cardiovascular health, natural anti-inflammatory compounds, and play a role in brain function. \n\nGenerally sushi is not a particularly fattening food. However, rice in sushi contains a fair amount of carbohydrates, plus the addition of other ingredients such as mayonnaise added into sushi rolls might increase the caloric content. Sushi also has a relatively high sodium content, especially contributed from \"shoyu\" soy sauce seasoning.\n\nSome of the ingredients in sushi can present health risks. Large marine apex predators such as tuna (especially bluefin) can harbor high levels of methylmercury, which can lead to mercury poisoning when consumed in large quantity or when consumed by certain higher-risk groups, including women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers and young children.\n\nAccording to recent studies, there have been about 18 million infections worldwide from eating raw fish. This serves as a great risk to expecting mothers due to the health risks that medical interventions or treatment measures may pose on the developing fetus. Parasitic infections can have a wide range of health impacts, including bowel obstruction, anemia, liver disease, and more. The impact of these illnesses alone can pose some health concerns on the expecting mother and baby, but the curative measures that may need to take place to recover are also of concern as well.\n\nSashimi or other types of sushi containing raw fish present a risk of infection by three main types of parasites:\n\nFor the above reasons, EU regulations forbid the use of fresh raw fish. It must be frozen at temperatures below in all parts of the product for no less than 24 hours. As such, a number of fishing boats, suppliers and end users \"super-freeze\" fish for sushi to temperatures as low as −60 °C. As well as parasite destruction, super-freezing also prevents oxidation of the blood in tuna flesh, thus preventing the discoloration that happens at temperatures above −20 °C.\n\nSome forms of sushi, notably those containing pufferfish fugu and some kinds of shellfish, can cause severe poisoning if not prepared properly. Particularly, fugu consumption can be fatal. Fugu fish has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and, by law in many countries, must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the prefectural examination in Japan. The licensing examination process consists of a written test, a fish-identification test, and a practical test that involves preparing the fugu and separating out the poisonous organs. Only about 35 percent of the applicants pass.\n\nSustainable sushi is sushi made from fished or farmed sources that can be maintained or whose future production does not significantly jeopardize the ecosystems from which it is acquired. Concerns over the sustainability of sushi ingredients arise from greater concerns over environmental, economic and social stability and human health.\n\nTraditionally, sushi is served on minimalist Japanese-style, geometric, mono- or duo-tone wood or lacquer plates, in keeping with the aesthetic qualities of this cuisine.\n\nMany sushi restaurants offer fixed-price sets, selected by the chef from the catch of the day. These are often graded as \"shō-chiku-bai\" (), \"shō/matsu\" (, pine), \"chiku/take\" (, bamboo) and (\"bai/ume\"), with \"matsu\" the most expensive and \" ume\" the cheapest. Sushi restaurants will often have private booth dining, where guests are asked to remove their shoes, leaving them outside the room; However, most sushi bars offer diners a casual experience with an open dining room concept.\n\nSushi may be served \"kaiten zushi\" (sushi train) style. Color-coded plates of sushi are placed on a conveyor belt; as the belt passes, customers choose as they please. After finishing, the bill is tallied by counting how many plates of each color have been taken. Newer \"kaiten zushi\" restaurants use barcodes or RFID tags embedded in the dishes to manage elapsed time after the item was prepared.\n\nSome specialized or slang terms are used in the sushi culture. Most of these terms are used only in sushi bars.\n\n\nUnlike sashimi, which is almost always eaten with chopsticks, \"nigirizushi\" is traditionally eaten with the fingers, even in formal settings. Although it is commonly served on a small platter with a side dish for dipping, sushi can also be served in a \"bento\", a box with small compartments that hold the various dishes of the meal.\n\nSoy sauce is the usual condiment, and sushi is normally served with a small sauce dish, or a compartment in the bento. Traditional etiquette suggests that the sushi is turned over so that only the topping is dipped; this is because the soy sauce is for flavoring the topping, not the rice, and because the rice would absorb too much soy sauce and would fall apart. If it is difficult to turn the sushi upside-down, one can baste the sushi in soy sauce using \"gari\" (sliced ginger) as a brush. Toppings that have their own sauce (such as eel) should not be eaten with soy sauce.\n\nTraditionally, the sushi chef will add an appropriate amount of wasabi to the sushi while preparing it, and etiquette suggests eating the sushi as is, since the chef is supposed to know the proper amount of wasabi to use. However, today wasabi is more a matter of personal taste, and even restaurants in Japan may serve wasabi on the side for customers to use at their discretion, even when there is wasabi already in the dish.\n\n\n",
                "Ceviche\n\nCeviche () is a seafood dish popular in the coastal regions of Latin America and the Caribbean. Though the origin of ceviche is hotly debated, the dish is most closely associated with Peru. It is typically made from fresh raw fish cured in citrus juices, such as lemon or lime, and spiced with \"ají\" or chili peppers. Additional seasonings, such as chopped onions, salt, and cilantro, may also be added. Ceviche is usually accompanied by side dishes that complement its flavors, such as sweet potato, lettuce, corn, avocado or plantain. As the dish is not cooked with heat, it must be prepared and consumed fresh to minimize the risk of food poisoning.\n\nThough archeological records suggest that something resembling ceviche may have been consumed in Peru nearly two thousand years ago, some historians believe the predecessor to the dish was brought to Peru by Moorish women from Granada, who accompanied the Spanish conquistadors and colonizers, and this dish eventually evolved into what now is considered ceviche. Peruvian chef Gastón Acurio further explains the dominant position that Lima held through four centuries as the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru allowed for popular dishes such as ceviche to be brought to other Spanish colonies in the region, and in time they became a part of local cuisine by incorporating regional flavors and styles.\n\nCeviche is now a popular international dish prepared in a variety of ways throughout the Americas, reaching the United States in the 1980s. The greatest variety of ceviches are found in Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Perú; but other distinctly unique styles can also be found in coastal Honduras, El Salvador, Belize, Guatemala, the United States, Mexico, Panama, and several other nations.\n\nThe origin of the name of the dish is also disputed. One hypothesis suggests the common Spanish word for the dish, \"cebiche\", has its origin in the Latin word \"cibus\", which translates to English as \"food\" Another hypothesis, supported by the Royal Spanish Academy, is the name might derive from the Spanish-Arabic word \"assukkabáǧ\", which itself derives from the Arabic word \"sakbāj\" (, meaning meat cooked in vinegar). It is ultimately from the unattested Middle Persian *\"sikbāg\", from \"sik\" (\"vinegar\") and *\"bāg\" (\"soup\"), which also yielded the Persian word \"sekbā\" (, a soup made with meat and vinegar). Further hypotheses base the origin of the term on \"escabeche\", Spanish for pickle, or it is simply a variation of the word \"siwichi\", the traditional Quechua name for the dish.\n\nThe name of the dish may be spelled variously as \"cebiche\", \"ceviche\", or \"seviche\", but the more common spelling in Peru is Ceviche with \"v\" based on location; all three spelling variations are accepted by the Royal Spanish Academy, the official institution responsible for regulating the Spanish language. Despite this, other local terms, such as \"cerbiche\" and \"serviche\", are still used as variations to name the dish.\n\nIn regard to its origin, various explanations are given. According to some historic sources from Peru, ceviche would have originated among the Moche, a coastal civilization that began to flourish in the area of current-day northern Peru nearly 2000 years ago. The Moche apparently used the fermented juice from the local banana passionfruit. Recent investigations further show, during the Inca Empire, fish were marinated with the use of \"chicha\", an Andean fermented beverage. Different chronicles also report, along the Peruvian coast prior to the arrival of Europeans, fish was consumed with salt and \"ají\". Furthermore, this theory proposes the natives simply switched to the citrus fruits brought by the Spanish colonists, but the main concepts of the plate remain essentially the same.\n\nThe invention of the dish is also attributed to places ranging from Central America to the Polynesian islands in the South Pacific. In Ecuador, it could have also had its origins with its coastal civilizations, as both Peru and Ecuador have shared cultural heritages (such as the Inca empire) and a large variety of fish and shellfish. Ceviche is not native to Mexico, despite the fact that the dish has been a part of traditional Mexican coastal cuisine for centuries. The Spanish, who brought from Europe citrus fruits such as lime, could have originated the dish in Spain with roots in Moorish cuisine.\n\nNevertheless, most historians agree ceviche originated during colonial times in the area of present-day Peru. They propose the predecessor to the dish was brought to Peru by Moorish women from Granada who accompanied the Spaniards, and this dish eventually evolved into what nowadays is considered ceviche. Peruvian chef Gastón Acurio further explains the dominant position that Lima held through four centuries as the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru allowed for popular dishes such as ceviche to be brought to other Spanish colonies in the region, and in time they became a part of local cuisine by incorporating regional flavors and styles. Other notable chefs who support the Peruvian origin of the plate include Chilean Christopher Carpentier and Spaniard Ferran Adrià, who in an interview stated, \"Cebiche was born in Peru, and so the authentic and genuine [cebiche] is Peruvian.\"\n\nCeviche is marinated in a citrus-based mixture, with lemons and limes being the most commonly used. In addition to adding flavor, the citric acid causes the proteins in the seafood to become denatured, appearing to be cooked. (However, acid marinades will not kill bacteria or parasitic worms, unlike the heat of cooking.) Traditional-style ceviche was marinated for about three hours. Modern-style ceviche, popularized in the 1970s , usually has a very short marinating period. With the appropriate fish, it can marinate in the time it takes to mix the ingredients, serve, and carry the ceviche to the table.\n\nMost Latin American countries have given ceviche its own touch of individuality by adding their own particular garnishes.\n\nIn Chile, ceviche is often made with fillets of halibut or Patagonian toothfish, and marinated in lime and grapefruit juices, as well as finely minced garlic and red chili peppers and often fresh mint and cilantro are added.\n\nIn Ecuador, the shrimp ceviche is sometimes made with tomato sauce for a tangy taste. The Manabí style, made with lime juice, salt and the juice provided by the cooked shrimp itself is very popular. Occasionally, ceviche is made with various types of local shellfish, such as black clam (cooked or raw), oysters (cooked or raw), spondylus (raw), barnacles (cooked percebes), among others mostly cooked. It is served in a bowl with toasted corn kernels as a side dish (fried green plantain chunks called \"patacones\", thinly sliced plantain chips called \"chifle\", and popcorn are also typical ceviche side dishes). In some regions, ceviche is served with rice on the side. Well cooked Sea bass (corvina), octopus, and crab ceviches are also common in Ecuador. In all ceviches, lime juice and salt are ubiquitous ingredients.\n\nIn Peru, ceviche has been declared to be part of Peru's \"national heritage\" and has even had a holiday declared in its honor. The classic Peruvian ceviche is composed of chunks of raw fish, marinated in freshly squeezed key lime or bitter orange (\"naranja agria\") juice, with sliced onions, chili peppers, salt and pepper. Corvina or cebo (sea bass) was the fish traditionally used. The mixture was traditionally marinated for several hours and served at room temperature, with chunks of corn-on-the-cob, and slices of cooked sweet potato. Regional or contemporary variations include garlic, fish bone broth, minced Peruvian \"ají limo\", or the Andean chili \"rocoto\", toasted corn or \"cancha\" and \"yuyo\" (seaweed). A specialty of Trujillo is ceviche prepared from shark (\"tollo\" or \"tojo\"). \"Lenguado\" (sole) is often used in Lima. The modern version of Peruvian ceviche, which is similar to the method used in making Japanese sashimi, consists of fish marinated for a few minutes and served promptly. It was developed in the 1970s by Peruvian-Japanese chefs including Dario Matsufuji and Humberto Sato. Many Peruvian \"cevicherías\" serve a small glass of the marinade (as an appetizer) along with the fish, which is called \"leche de tigre\" or \"leche de pantera.\"\n\nIn Mexico and some parts Central America, it is served either in cocktail cups with tostadas, salted crackers, or as a tostada topping and taco filling. In Mexico, when served in a cup with tomato sauce, it is called a ceviche cocktail. Although this cocktail is made from the \"dry\" ceviche recipe, this presentation is rather unusual outside of some specific areas, and in most areas of Mexico the ceviche cocktail is very popular. Shrimp, octopus, squid, tuna, and mackerel are also popular bases for Mexican ceviche, apart from fish. The marinade ingredients include salt, lime, onion, chili peppers, avocado, and coriander leaves (known as cilantro in the Americas). Cut olives and a bit of tomatoes are often added to the preparation (ketchup is not used because it adds sugar and is not fresh).\n\nIn El Salvador and Nicaragua one popular ceviche recipe is \"ceviche de concha negra\" (\"black conch ceviche\"), known in Mexico as \"pata de mula\" (\"mule's foot\"). It is dark, nearly black, with a distinct look and flavor. It is prepared with lime juice, onion, yerba buena, salt, pepper, tomato, Worcestershire sauce, and sometimes picante (any kind of hot sauce or any kind of hot pepper) as desired.\n\nIn Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the dish includes marinated fish, lime juice, salt, ground black pepper, finely minced onions, coriander (cilantro) and finely minced peppers. It is usually served in a cocktail glass with a lettuce leaf and soda crackers on the side, as in Mexico. Popular condiments are tomato ketchup, mayonnaise, and tabasco sauce. The fish is typically tilapia or corvina, although mahi-mahi, shark and marlin are also popular.\n\nIn Panama, ceviche is prepared with lemon juice, chopped onion, celery, cilantro, assorted peppers, and sea salt. Ceviche de corvina (white sea bass) is very popular and is served as an appetizer in most local restaurants. It is also commonly prepared with octopus, shrimp, and squid, or served with little pastry shells called \"canastitas.\"\n\nIn Cuba, ceviche is often made using mahi-mahi prepared with lime juice, salt, onion, green pepper, habanero, and a touch of allspice. Squid and tuna are also popular. In Puerto Rico and other places in the Caribbean, the dish is prepared with coconut milk. In The Bahamas and south Florida, a conch ceviche known as 'conch salad' is very popular. It is prepared by marinating diced fresh conch in lime with chopped onions, celery, and bell pepper. Diced pequin pepper and/or scotch bonnet pepper is often added for spice. In south Florida, it is common to encounter a variation to which tomato juice has been added.\n\nIn the Philippines, \"kinilaw\" (or \"kilawin\") which use raw fish are usually referred to in English as \"Filipino ceviche\". However, this is inaccurate as \"kinilaw\" technically refers to an indigenous cooking process and thus not restricted to fish. Unlike Latin American ceviches, which primarily use citrus juices, \"kilawin\" instead primarily uses vinegar (usually coconut vinegar) and other acidic fruit juices. It is native to the Philippines, with archeological evidence dating back to the 10th to 13th century AD. It was also described by Spanish colonists and explorers to the Philippines, with the earliest mention being in the \"Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala\" (1613) as \"cqinicqilao\" and \"cquilao\".\n\nFish \"kinilaw\" typically use \"tanigue\" (Spanish mackerels), \"malasugi\" (marlins or swordfish), and anchovies. The raw fish are cubed and then marinated in vinegar, souring agents (usually calamansi, but can also be other sour fruits), and salt and spices like black pepper, ginger, onions, and chili peppers (commonly \"siling labuyo\" or bird's eye chili). Variants can also use other ingredients, like shrimp, squid, clams, oysters, crabs, sea urchin roe, seaweed, shipworms (\"tamilok\"), vegetables, and cooked meat (usually goat meat, pork, beef, or chicken).\n\nIn the Northern Mariana Islands, \"kelaguen\", is another ceviche-type dish among the Chamorro people. It is derived from and closely resembles the Filipino \"kilawin\". It is believed to have originated from Filipino settlers during the Manila galleon trade in the Spanish period. Like the Filipino \"kilawin\", the Chamorro dish is also not restricted to fish or seafood, and can use cooked meat (commonly chicken or beef), but it is influenced by the Latin American version in that they exclusively use citrus juices. It is usually served with \"titiya\" (Chamorro tortillas) during fiestas.\n\nCeviche is ideally very healthy. However, bad sanitary conditions during its preparation may lead to illness. Aside from contaminants, raw seafood can also be the vector for various pathogens, viral and bacterial, as well as larger parasitic creatures.\nAccording to the 2009 Food Code published by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and more recent studies, specific microbial hazards in ceviche include \"Anisakis simplex\", \"Diphyllobothrium\" spp., \"Pseudoterranova decipiens\" and \"Pseudoterranova cattani\", and \"Vibrio parahaemolyticus\". Anisakiasis is a zoonotic disease caused by the ingestion of larval nematodes in raw seafood dishes such as ceviche. The Latin American cholera outbreaks in the 1990s may have been attributed to the consumption of raw cholera-infested seafood that was eaten as ceviche.\n\nThe American Dietetic Association urges women to avoid ceviche during pregnancy.\n\n\n",
                "Raw bar\n\nA raw bar is a small restaurant or a bar within a restaurant where live raw shellfish are shucked and served. Raw bars typically offer a variety of raw and cooked seafood and shellfish that is served cold. Seafood-based dishes may also be proferred, and additional, non-seafood foods may also be part of the fare. Raw bars may offer alcoholic beverages such as oyster shooters, as well as wine and sake that is paired with various foods. Additional accompaniments may include condiments, sauces and foods such as lemon and lime. Several restaurants in the United States offer raw bars, some of which are seasonal.\n\nRaw bars may serve a selection of raw oysters, clams, quahogs (hard clams), scallops and mussels. Varieties of hard clam may include littlenecks, which are less than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in size, and cherrystones, which are up to 2 inches (5 cm). Various types of oysters may be served. Some raw bars may offer oyster shooters, a type of cocktail prepared with raw oyster. Some also offer ceviche, a dish prepared with raw seafood that is cured with citrus juices, particularly lime. Thinly sliced octopus (octopus carpaccio) is another raw bar item.\n\nRaw bars sometimes supplement the menu with cooked versions of the same and additional seafoods and shellfish that are typically served cold, such as clam chowder, oyster stew, poached shrimp, shrimp cocktail, cooked or seared scallops, mussels, crab legs, lobster, cured salmon, sea urchin and steamers (steamed clams).\n\nSometimes lightly cooked liver or foie gras is a raw bar item.\n\nThe plateau de fruits de mer is a seafood dish sometimes offered by raw bars that is prepared with raw and cooked shellfish and cold on a platter, usually on a bed of ice. Another raw bar dish is ceviche.\n\nRaw bars may offer wine or sake to accompany and be paired with the various foods. Condiments, such as cocktail sauce and lemon, may be available, which are typically served with raw oysters. These may also be used on other foods. Other food additions may include lime, tomato, chili peppers, mignonette sauce and caviar\n\nRaw bars exist in various cities in the United States, such as Jay's Restaurant in New York City, which has a raw bar. Some bistro-style restaurants offer a raw bar. Some restaurants offer a seasonal raw bar, such as Grand Banks restaurant in New York City and the newly opening Bagley & Shakespeare in London\n\nConsumming raw oysters is potentially dangerous as it might contains harmful bacteria. People eating raw oyster might contract vibriosis, an illness typically caused by eating raw seafood. There are reports of human casualities caused by consumming raw oyster.\n\n"
