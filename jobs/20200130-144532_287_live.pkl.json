                "Donna Karan\n\nDonna Karan (born October 2, 1948), also known as \"DK\", is an American fashion designer and the creator of the Donna Karan New York and DKNY clothing labels.\n\nKaran was born Donna Ivy Faske to mother Helen (\"Queenie\") and father Gabby Faske in the Forest Hills neighborhood of the Borough of Queens, New York City. Her family is Jewish. Karan's mother had been a model and had also worked in designer Chester Weinberg's showroom. Her father was a tailor and haberdasher who died when Donna was three years old. Karan and her older sister Gail were raised by their mother in Woodmere, in the Five Towns region of Nassau County, New York. She graduated from Hewlett High School in 1966, and then went to the Parsons School of Design.\n\nAfter leaving college, Karan worked for Anne Klein, eventually becoming head of the Anne Klein design-team, where she remained until 1985, when she launched her Donna Karan label.\nKaran began her career as an assistant designer with Anne Klein in the late 1960s, where she was promoted to associate designer in 1971. As Klein's assistant, Karan was a participant in The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show on November 28, 1973. When Klein herself died in 1974, Takihyo Corporation of Japan became the new owner and Karan, together with her former classmate and friend Louis Dell'Ollio, became head designer of the house. In 1984, Karan left Anne Klein and, together with her then husband Stephan Weiss and Takihyo Corporation, started her own business \"to design modern clothes for modern people\". She showed her first women's clothing collection in 1985.\n\nKaran became well known for her 'Essentials' line, initially offering seven easy pieces centered around the bodysuit which could all be mixed and matched, and created a fully integrated wardrobe with her First Collection in 1985. Karan always insisted that she would design only clothes like jersey dresses and opaque Lycra tights that she would wear herself. \n\nIn 1988, Karan, nicknamed \"The Queen Of Seventh Avenue\", extended her women's 'Donna Karan New York' line by creating a less expensive clothing line for younger women, called DKNY. Two years later, she created DKNY Jeans, a denim-inspired collection. DKNY for men was launched in 1992, one year after the 'Signature' line for men had been presented. In 1992, Karan also released her \"cold shoulder\" dress, a jersey long-sleeved dress which featured deep cutouts at the shoulders to reveal the skin beneath. \n\nKaran left her CEO position in 1997, but continued as chairwoman and designer for the Donna Karan line. After 2002, Karan's designer contributions became less and less. In August 2008, Karan relaunched her discontinued fragrance lines from the 1990s.\nIn 2015, Donna Karan announced that she would be stepping down as head of her eponymous company to focus on her lifestyle brand, Urban Zen, established by Karan in 2007.\n\n\nIn the early 1970s Donna Faske married Mark Karan, with whom she had a daughter. They divorced in 1978. In 1983, she married artist Stephan Weiss, who would later become co-CEO of the Donna Karan company. Weiss died of lung cancer in 2001.\n\nKaran currently resides in Northwest Harbor (East Hampton), New York, but maintains residences in New York City and the Turks & Caicos Islands.\n\n",
                "DKNY\n\nDKNY is a New York-based fashion house specializing in fashion goods for men and women, founded in 1984 by Donna Karan.\n\nKaran worked for 15 years at Anne Klein, including 10 as its head designer. In 1984 Karan and her late husband Stephan Weiss were offered the opportunity to start their own business by the owner of Anne Klein, Takihyo LLC.\nThe company became a publicly traded venture in 1996.\n\nIn 2001 it was purchased by the French conglomerate corporation LVMH (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy). In 2015 Donna Karan left as chief designer at Donna Karan International, to focus on her Urban Zen brand and Urban Zen Foundation philanthropy. LVMH sold Donna Karan International, with the 'Donna Karan' and 'DKNY' brands, to the G-III Apparel Group in 2016 for $650 million. G-III, based in New York City, is a manufacturer and distributor of clothing and accessories under their owned brands, licensed brands, and private label brands.\n\nDonna Karan's mainline label \"Donna Karan New York\", also referred as \"Donna Karan Collection\", debuted for fall 1985 with the women's collection \"Seven Easy Pieces\", \"where a handful of interchangeable items work together to create an entire wardrobe that goes from day to evening, week day to weekend, season to season\". In July 1991 she launched her first menswear collection.\n\nThe \"New York\" part on the label is there to set \"the pace, the attitude\" of the fashion house's offering.\n\nInspired by her daughter Gaby, Donna Karan founded DKNY in 1989 as a younger, more affordable diffusion line to run alongside her existing Donna Karan New York label. Many labels and brands have branched off of the original DKNY brand/label including DKNY Jeans, DKNY Active, DKNY Underwear, DKNY Juniors, DKNY Kids, DKNY Pure. DKNY Men, launched in 1992, consists of tailored suits, dress wear, formalwear, casual wear, sportswear, and shoes.\n\nThe Donna Karan Beauty collection, which specializes in fragrances, was launched in 1992. In 2001, the Donna Karan Home collection, which includes traditional luxury bedding and accessories, and DKNY Home, which has more contemporary and fashion-forward bedding, were introduced.\n\nCara Delevingne has been the face of DKNY for multiple seasons.\n\nStores opened in London in 1997 and New York City in 1999. The DKNY headquarters is located at 550 Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, New York. There are currently seventy Donna Karan collection and DKNY stores globally, including twenty stores in China including Hong Kong and Shanghai, two stores in Canada including Vancouver, B.C. and Montreal, four in Dubai and also two stores in Doha. DKNY has also opened some stores in Denmark.\n\nSince 2005, Donna Karan has offered online shopping of its DKNY and associated lines at the label's web site. Products range from DKNY and DKNY Jeans womenswear, accessories, underwear, shoes, baby clothing, the PURE collection to DKNY menswear. The latter was available up until the spring 2002 season. Since then only the DKNY Jeans label, underwear, eyewear and watches have been offered online for men.\n\nIn 2013 DKNY became embroiled in controversy over street photography it admitted it used in one of its stores, without permission, from the New York City street photographer, Brandon Stanton, the creator of Humans of New York (HONY). After Stanton learned of the use of his photography, he publicly asked DKNY to donate $100,000 to the YMCA to help with summer programs. Amidst strong criticism on social media sites, DKNY apologized and donated $25,000 to the YMCA. Stanton then asked his followers on the HONY Facebook page to make up the difference to reach his initial goal of $100,000, which was successfully reached March 1, 2013.\n\nIn July 2016 French luxury giant LVMH, which has owned Karan’s company since 2001, even though she stayed on to run the brands — shelved her flagship line Donna Karan International shortly after she left in June 2015 and said it would “substantially increase its focus” on her DKNY brand, which revolutionized women’s fashion in the ’80s with Karan’s “Seven Easy Pieces” concept of a wardrobe made up of a handful of interchangeable items. Today she is looking to sell off its Donna Karan business, less than a year after the fashion designer stepped down from her namesake brand. LVMH is targeting a “single, specific American buyer” for both the DKNY and Donna Karan International businesses after several “months of disappointing performance” under its new designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osbourne.\n\nNegotiations are reported to be “ongoing, but a price has not yet been agreed,” \n\n",
                "Andre Charles (artist)\n\nAndre Pierre Charles (born 1968) is an American artist born in Brooklyn, New York and raised in the Bronx. Charles is best known as a 1980s pioneer of the New York City graffiti art movement and for his influence on New York City nightclub and youth culture.\n\nCharles began tagging on the streets of the Bronx at age 12 and had his own studio on the Grand Concourse (Bronx) at age 18, known as \"The Zone\". The large studio whose name was based on his alias, \"Zone\" became a gathering place for young graffiti artists in the mid 1980s. It was from there that Charles would extend his reach from the trains and walls of the Bronx to creating memorial walls for friends and neighbors. These memorial walls caught the attention of the public and the press and soon Charles was being commissioned to do memorial walls all over the city. In addition, Charles came to be known as a reporter of a notable person's death. Often if someone died that Charles had an attachment too, during the night Charles would busily create a memorial wall for them which would often land itself on the cover of a New York daily newspaper that morning. Some of the more notable murals included Tupac Shakur, Princess Diana and Mother Teresa. \nHis talent was recognized early by others in the scene including the artist, Keith Haring, whom he first met in 1982 and was soon collaborating with. Known for his distinctive \"Baby\" tag, Charles was bombing his \"Baby Brandon\", usually in the form of a baby image sitting with a pacifier in the Bronx in the early 80's, while Haring was receiving attention for his crawling \"Radiant Baby\" in lower Manhattan. The image of an infant in their works was not the only similarity, Charles and Haring's treatment of the simple line in each of their works are remarkably similar, which led Charles to re-paint Haring's Pop Shop and many of his murals after Haring's death in 1990.\n\nCharles contributed his art to many of the night club invites being distributed during this time. This expanded into live art shows within the clubs and being involved with the promotion of specific nights, including Saturday nights at the Manhattan club, Red Zone.\n\nWhile Haring and Andy Warhol's daytime scene centered on an active artist's studio environment and then socializing and clubs in the evening, Charles' early 1990s influence centered on the street scene primarily located outside the clothing store, Unique Clothing Warehouse on lower Broadway, in Washington Square Park and on Eighth Street (Manhattan).\nBy 1992, Charles had firmly established the art crew, T.C.T. (The City's Talent) throughout New York City. At the time, Urban Works, an influential nightclub promotional crew, with an interest in bringing art into the club scene was handling the majority of the nightclub flyer distribution in Manhattan. Charles friendship with Urban Works founder, Joey Sheridan soon led to Urban Works and T.C.T partnering in promoting music and art events that reflected the youth culture of the early 1990s. In 1992, the New York State Democratic Committee contacted Charles and Urban Works to create a voter registration program that focused on youth registration in the streets and clubs of New York City in an effort to attract the youth vote during the first election of Bill Clinton. The campaign involved and employed over 100 young people in registering other youth to vote.\n\nAndre Charles' T.C.T. crew and Joey Sheridan's Urban Works crew had now technically became one entity. With the Clinton campaign behind them, Charles and Urban Works concentrated much of their energy on their Saturday night party at Red Zone which featured DJ's Stretch Armstrong, Funkmaster Flex and Derrik Foxx. The mission to unite many diverse crowds into one party was being marred by escalating violence in the scene and with the closing of Red Zone and the impending closing of Unique Clothing Warehouse, the idea of Urban Works formally becoming an art gallery was taking shape. Before opening a gallery, Charles, Sheridan and John Elegance the \"mother\" of a mostly straight ballroom house called the House of Elegance began working closely with Harvey Russack who owned \"Unique\", or as some called it, \"Uniques\", \"Unique Boutique\", but officially called Unique Clothing Warehouse . Russack had been under fire from the neighborhood community board and the police precinct for allowing young people to congregate in front of his store. Russack, Charles and the others felt that the young people were being singled out because they were mostly Hispanic and African-American kids from other boroughs. Charles and Urban Works were often partly responsible for the congregation as that is where they would naturally meet flyer distributors that promoted their club events and the area had created a \"before the club\" meeting place for many, as well. Russack, Charles, Sheridan and Elegance devised a plan to open up the Lafayette Street side of Unique Clothing Warehouse and create a hangout area with a DJ and an orderly area to manage the distribution of nightclub flyers for Urban Works and other promoters. \nIn 1993, Charles and Urban Works opened an office and studio space at 43 Bond Street in the emerging NOHO district of Manhattan. It was blocks away from this location that Charles created his homage to Jean-Michel Basquiat at the corner of Bond Street and Lafayette Street\n\nIt was also on Bond Street that a friendship with the model, actress and activist Lauren Hutton began. Hutton noticed Charles work one morning on a gate across from her loft on Bond Street. Intrigued by the art, Hutton came into Urban Works to inquire about meeting the artist. Hutton became an intricate part of the Bond Street studio until it closed in 1997 and moved to Union Square.\n\nCharles output continued throughout the later 1990s and 2000s receiving commissions from Mountain Dew and Lands' End. With the mainstream work, Charles received criticism for \"selling out\", but Charles defended his choices. In a 2000 interview with Adweek Magazine, Charles was quoted as saying \"Detractors say it's selling out, but at the same time, you're breaking boundaries. I want to open doors for other people who are struggling the way I struggled. … I'm going to make the new term 'selling in,' because I'm selling my ideas in that world, just like Warhol.\"\n\nBy 2005, Charles was creating art for Donna Karan for her DKNY clothing line.\n"

In 2001, the Donna Karan Home collection, which includes traditional luxury bedding and accessories, and DKNY Home, which has more contemporary and fashion-forward bedding, were introduced.\n\nCara Delevingne has been the face of DKNY for multiple seasons.\n\nStores opened in London in 1997 and New York City in 1999. The DKNY headquarters is located at 550 Seventh Avenue in Manhattan, New York. There are currently seventy Donna Karan collection and DKNY stores globally, including twenty stores in China including Hong Kong and Shanghai, two stores in Canada including Vancouver, B.C. and Montreal, four in Dubai and also two stores in Doha. DKNY has also opened some stores in Denmark.\n\nSince 2005, Donna Karan has offered online shopping of its DKNY and associated lines at the label's web site. Products range from DKNY and DKNY Jeans womenswear, accessories, underwear, shoes, baby clothing, the PURE collection to DKNY menswear. The latter was available up until the spring 2002 season. Since then only the DKNY Jeans label, underwear, eyewear and watches have been offered online for men.\n\nIn 2013 DKNY became embroiled in controversy over street photography it admitted it used in one of its stores, without permission, from the New York City street photographer, Brandon Stanton, the creator of Humans of New York (HONY). After Stanton learned of the use of his photography, he publicly asked DKNY to donate $100,000 to the YMCA to help with summer programs. Amidst strong criticism on social media sites, DKNY apologized and donated $25,000 to the YMCA. Stanton then asked his followers on the HONY Facebook page to make up the difference to reach his initial goal of $100,000, which was successfully reached March 1, 2013.\n\nIn July 2016 French luxury giant LVMH, which has owned Karan’s company since 2001, even though she stayed on to run the brands — shelved her flagship line Donna Karan International shortly after she left in June 2015 and said it would “substantially increase its focus” on her DKNY brand, which revolutionized women’s fashion in the ’80s with Karan’s “Seven Easy Pieces” concept of a wardrobe made up of a handful of interchangeable items. Today she is looking to sell off its Donna Karan business, less than a year after the fashion designer stepped down from her namesake brand. LVMH is targeting a “single, specific American buyer” for both the DKNY and Donna Karan International businesses after several “months of disappointing performance” under its new designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osbourne.\n\nNegotiations are reported to be “ongoing, but a price has not yet been agreed,” \n\n",
                "Anne Klein\n\nAnne Klein (August 3, 1923 – March 19, 1974) was an American fashion designer who founded her own women's sportswear and apparel label.\n\nKlein was born as Hannah Golofski to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York on August 3, 1923. She studied art at Girls' Commercial High School in Brooklyn and later went to the Traphagen School of Design in New York City from 1937 to 1938 to study fashion. She married her first husband, Ben Klein, in the early 1940s, and together they founded Junior Sophisticates – a clothing company which completely transformed the clothing styles, choices, and attitudes of young American women. The company revolutionized the junior market, doing away with the traditional \"little-girl\" clothing that featured button-and-bow detailing, and addressing the primary need of this important group—the desire to look more stylish, more polished, and, above all, more grown up.\n\nBeginning as a sketcher she later rose to prominence as a designer of women's sportswear and apparel, establishing Anne Klein and Co. with fashion guru Gunther Oppenheim in 1968. Klein died of breast cancer on March 19, 1974 at the age of 50.\n\nThe Anne Klein label was established in 1968 as a partnership with famed fashion guru Gunther Oppenheim. In 1971, Klein met Tomio Taki from Takihyo who approached her to enter a joint-venture to manufacture in the Far East with materials bought in Europe for sale in the US and Japan. The joint-venture never materialized as the margins were too thin; however, Klein approached Taki to partner in the company and by 1973 Takihyo owned 25% of the Anne Klein company.\n\nIn 1974 Klein died, leaving her equity position in the hands of her second husband, Chip Rubenstein. Oppenheim wanted to sell his shares in the company, and Taki bought Oppenheim out despite the death of the company's driving force. There was great contention among Taki, Oppenheim, and Rubenstein regarding Anne's successor. Taki wanted to elevate the assistant designer, but Oppenheim and Rubenstein wanted a name-brand designer to take the helm. At the time, Taki had the largest individual stake in the company so his equity position allowed him to promote the assistant Donna Karan, who a decade later became a household name. In a matter of a few years after Anne's death with Donna Karan leading the design-room, Takihyo purchased all of Rubenstein's position.\n\nThe success of the Anne Klein brand led to the development of the first bridge-line in American fashion, Anne Klein II. A line with a price point just under designer-label fashion yet still much better quality than better, moderate, and budget lines while maintaining a similar look. The bridge-line was a new system Klein developed with Taki before her death. Depending on the garment, certain fabrics or manufacturing methods, or both in some cases, would change to offer a lower price point for consumers. For example, a skirt may be made from eight leaves of fabric rather than two. The leaves could be used modularly as well to increase the number of garments made from a given amount of material. Jackets would be cut a little shorter in the back. While consumers may not notice a big difference in the garment, the savings from three inches increased productivity at the manufacturing level.\n\nAnne Klein then Anne Klein II were continued after her death by Donna Karan and Louis Dell'Ollio as head designers until 1985. Taki and his partner Frank Mori at Takihyo then fired Donna on a Friday to hire her the next Monday to begin a new partnership that became the highly successful Donna Karan New York line followed by its diffusion line, DKNY.\n\nIn 2001, fashion designer Charles Nolan was hired to revive Anne Klein's image as a hipper, more fashion-forward brand. The next year, 2002, Charles Nolan quit to work on Howard Dean's presidential campaign.\n\nAnne Klein and Co is currently owned by Jones Apparel Group, who acquired then-parent company Kasper it in 2003.\n\nThe Anne Klein brand of watches are made by Sutton Time.\n\n\n"

                "The Beatles (TV series)\n\nThe Beatles is an American animated television series featuring representations of the popular English rock band of the same name. It ran from 1965 to 1969 on ABC in the U.S. (only 1965 to 1967 was first run; later transmissions were reruns). The series debuted on September 25, 1965 and ended on October 21, 1967. A total of 39 episodes were produced. The series was shown on Saturday mornings at 10:30 AM EST until the 1967 third season when it was moved to 12:00 PM EST. For the fourth season, which consisted of reruns, the series was shown at 9:30 AM EST on Sunday mornings. Each episode has a name of a Beatles song, so the story is based on its lyrics and it is also played at some time in the episode. The original series was rebroadcast in syndication by MTV in 1986 and 1987 and on the Disney Channel beginning in 1989 on Fridays at 5 PM. The series was a historical milestone as the first weekly television series to feature animated versions of real, living people.\n\nThe series consisted of short animated stories that essentially were intended to set up the visual illustration of Beatles songs that were played in their entirety. In addition, there were sing along sequences with simpler imagery complementing the full lyrics of particular songs.\n\nThe series became notorious for its static depiction of the band in their early \"moptop-and-suit\" look as depicted in the live action film, \"A Hard Day's Night\", even though the band moved beyond it during the series' run. The producers did attempt to acknowledge the band members' contemporary appearances with photographs of them in the series' title sequences during its production run.\n\nThe band members themselves had nothing to do with the series' production beyond the use of their music recordings. American actor Paul Frees did the voices of John and George while Lance Percival (of the \"Carry On\" series) did the voices of Paul and Ringo. Frees had been the voice of Boris Badenov in the \"Rocky and Bullwinkle\" series. At first, the Beatles disliked the series. It is reported, however, that the band members enjoyed the cartoons in later years. Their views of the cartoon series discouraged them from participating significantly in the later animated feature film, \"Yellow Submarine\". Only when the band saw and were impressed by the \"Yellow Submarine\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s finished footage did they realize the film was a more ambitious creation. As a result, they agreed to appear in a short live action epilogue for it. In fact, \"Yellow Submarine\" producer Al Brodax and director George Dunning were involved in the production both of the animated series and of \"Yellow Submarine\".\n\nInitially, the opening credits theme was a guitar riff from \"A Hard Day's Night\" segueing into \"Can't Buy Me Love\", over a cartoon sequence of the group running down a fire escape, echoing a scene in \"A Hard Day's Night\". The second season's opening theme was \"Help!\", while the third season's theme was \"And Your Bird Can Sing\", over a different cartoon sequence.\n\nAlthough uncredited, Dennis Marks, along with Jack Mendelsohn, Heywood Kling and Bruce Howard, wrote all 39 episodes of \"The Beatles\" series.\n\nMost of the episodes of the series were produced by Artransa Park Studios in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia and George Dunning's company TVC Animation in London, with a handful of episodes made in Hollywood, with a crew supervised by veteran cartoon writer John W. Dunn. \n\nEach Beatles figure was a loose, rough, exaggerated description of them with John and Paul wearing a blue collar-less suit and tie while George and Ringo wore navy blue shirts and light blue blazer jackets, all of them wearing matching blue drainpipe trousers and Beatle Boots.\n\nJohn is described as being the leader. His mop-top is slightly shorter than that of the rest of the band. He has his chin up, looking down his nose, feet apart and hands on hips, and points and poses with his hands with a \"showbiz\" expression with a mocking gesture, especially when giving orders (showing John does not take his job as leader seriously), and is often malicious, especially towards George and Ringo. He slouches rather than sits. He will often pull funny faces and immediately wipe them off. John's movements are described as being short and slightly aggressive. His chin is rather large, chubby and rounded and his eyes are rather small. Whenever he looks to the front he uses a sideways look to talk to somebody and looks away after giving an order. John's right eyebrow is connected to his nose and gives him a look suitable to his \"real life\" appearance.\n\nHe tends to use sarcastic, dry humor. He is also extremely lazy and overly laid-back. And yet, despite all that, he truly cares about the band members and will do anything for them.\n\nPaul is shown as second-in-command of the band. Paul is the most poised and stylish of the cartoon Beatles, and his mop-top is the neatest of the four of them.\n\nHe uses his hands, with his fingers spread apart, to express himself when talking. He is the one to get excited whenever John suggests something. He always looks straight at whomever he's talking to. His face is very fine, with his eyebrows wide and far apart and his eyes partly closed in an almost mockingly sad expression and they will only open fully when he is excited or frightened. His moptop takes on a messier look and his eyes open wide when he is terrified. Paul sits like he's about to jump out and get on with whatever is happening. He does not really walk, he skips. When he is making his own suggestions or comments, especially when suggesting mischief, he covers up by assuming a mockingly innocent look; eyes wide and head tilted to one side. Whenever he gets especially excited, he will put his hand in his mouth.\n\nAlso like John, Paul uses a dry and sarcastic humour and is happy-go-lucky and rather laid-back. In spite of this, he will always help somebody when needed. Paul, along with Ringo, are the only Beatles who sound closest to their real-life counterparts.\nHis character is the only left-hander, while in real life both he and Ringo use their left hands.\n\nGeorge's character has a more angular, pie-limbed and wry figure, especially when he walks, his legs are long and thin (emphasis on the knees keeps his angular appearance). His mop-top is rather longer in the back compared to the other members of the band. He always leans against something, shoulders hunched, hands in pocket, legs crossed. He is also the same height as Paul. His shoulders are hunched when he is in a standing or a leaning pose, which can indicate direction and his head tilted forward. He has a crooked smile and is almost always giving the impression of frowning due to his characters eyebrows becoming thicker as they reach his nose. His chin is long and thin, with sunken cheeks, and his nose is tall and thin. He never looks at who he's speaking to and will close his eyes for short periods when talking. Notice the distance between his nose and his mouth; his mouth is lopsided.\n\nHe often uses dry, witty humour and succumbs to peer pressure. George is the only Beatle with a diverse accent that does not really fit with any accent in particular, but it sounds slightly Scottish/Irish. George has been shown to be fascinated with various cultures and is occasionally superstitious. He and Ringo are almost always made to do the work for John and Paul, such as in the episode \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\", they were the only ones carrying in the bands' extensive luggage into their vacation cottage. He cares a lot about the group members and will help them when they need him.\n\nRingo is the most sympathetic, naive, dimwitted and misfortunate Beatle. His mop-top is the longest and shaggiest (sometimes almost completely covering his eyes) of the four of them. He is the more calm, gentle, least aggressive, innocent, and more lovable Beatle. Ringo's nose and sad, goofy, expressive eyes are among his most prominent features along with his trademark, rather deep, goofy laugh, which is highly exaggerated. His face usually has a sad or goofy expression with his upper lip protruding in a wavy line. He does smile a lot, but when he does not he has a look of curiosity or sadness on his face. Ringo's expressions and humour are usually deadpan, but when expression is required, his eye position (eyes arched) are used to make a goofy expression whenever he laughs. Whenever he laughs, having made a funny remark, he squints.\n\nHe is the smallest Beatle with a disjointed Groucho Marx-like figure. His neck is thin and gets smaller as it reaches the base of his neck, with his small chin sticking out a little, which is evidence of his disjointed figure. When he walks, his feet, legs, knees, arms and hands move loosely. Being responsible for the show's light-hearted humorous, or slapstick comical relief, after having bodily harm of any kind, his figure is crooked, bent or twisted into an, sometimes, unusual position. His clothes also often look a bit too big, especially his Beatle Boots and Blue Blazer Jacket.\n\nDuring the song portions of the episodes (not the sing-along segments), he often shakes his head and mop-top around with a goofy expression when drumming. He gets along best with George, and he, like George, shows interest in various cultures. He often makes bad puns and jokes (usually he's the only one laughing). During the introductions to the Sing-Along segments he substitutes for the prop-man (who is either on vacation, out sick or just not there) and sets the stage, literally, to John, Paul, or George's description, and more often than not, to their surprise or chagrin.\n\nHe is often the butt of the joke, victim of a prank, or just simply has bad luck. Ringo's character tends to have bad luck, often because of his naivety, curiosity and being unaware of the danger, mistake or threat. In the episode \"Good Day Sunshine\", he becomes depressed and upset, thinking he is a jinx for misfortunes, such as that it rained at Carny Island on the Beatles' weekends, (i.e. it rained at the piers fair every time Ringo arrived) and was described in that episode as being a \"sourpuss\". He felt better after John, Paul, and George sang \"Good Day Sunshine\" for him, and showed him how to have fun again.\n\nIt is revealed in \"Money\" that Ringo's mother dropped him as a baby (\"Me mother dropped me once\").\n\nRingo, like Paul, is also left-handed, although in \"I'll Be Back\" Ringo plays a guitar right-handed.\n\nBrian Epstein acts as the Beatles' manager. He is rarely seen or mentioned but he was mostly mentioned in the episode \"Please Mr. Postman\" when the Beatles ran out of money. Ringo had purchased 15 rings, which were later snapped by autograph collectors, and they needed to contact Epstein for money. Epstien finally makes his appearance in the episode \"Thank You Girl\" in the beginning of the episode, but only his arm is seen, again voiced by Paul Frees as he grounds the Beatles for gaining so much weight after dining on the French cooking. Epstein, himself, along with the other real-life Beatles, appear in a lost deleted scene featuring the production of the animated Beatles cartoons at the end.\n\nHis fictionalized animated version of his appearance and habit of smoking is an homage and based on the animated series' creator, Al Brodax.\n\nRingo's pet frog. His only appearance is in the episode \"I Call Your Name\", in which he is found by Ringo after jumping through the window of the Beatles' bedroom at the Beverly Hotel into their bed. The band keeps on telling him to get rid of the frog because it is so noisy, but Ringo keeps it as a pet. Ringo names him Bartholomew over the other members' suggestions: Loudmouth, Spot and Rover. When Ringo goes to a restaurant, the customers flee, which persuades him to set Bartholomew free. Unfortunately, a film producer is producing a movie featuring the Beatles and a frog (\"Froggy Come Home\") and offers Ringo $100 per day to get Bartholomew to the studio for a screen test. The gang search in the swamp and find him, but when he is finally found and screen-tested the producer rejects the frog and instead uses a parakeet dressed as a frog for the role since the studio will pay him $100 per day for it. This causes Bartholomew to chase the parakeet and beat it with a stick.\n\nThe vocal effects for Bartholomew are provided by Paul Frees.\n\n1.

It racked up a 13 score (or 52 share), then unheard of in daytime television. The series was sponsored by the A. C. Gilbert Company, the Quaker Oats Company and the Mars Candy Company. For the third season in 1967, the series was moved to Saturdays at noon. For the fourth season, the series was moved to 9:30 AM EST on Sunday mornings.\n\nOriginally, the Beatles disliked the cartoon; however, as time went on they grew to like it. In 1972, Lennon commented, \"I still get a blast out of watching the Beatles cartoons on TV.\" In 1999, Harrison said, \"I always kind of liked [the cartoons]. They were so bad or silly that they were good, if you know what I mean, and I think the passage of time might make them more fun now.\"\n\nThe series was syndicated worldwide on television and cable after the original run ended in 1969. In 1986 and 1987, new generations were introduced to the series when it was rebroadcast in syndication by MTV and also by the Disney Channel. On MTV, the series was shown on Saturday and Sunday mornings at 10 AM ET or 7 AM PT. On The Disney Channel, the series was shown on Fridays at 5 PM beginning in 1989. Mark Hamill was a guest host of the MTV run of the series in 1987.\n\nWhile the series remained popular in syndication globally, the internet has allowed for even more exposure due to its so bad it's good nature. Due to the nature of the show and the Beatles popularity as a band, the series has recently gained a cult following online, particularly on the fandom blogging site Tumblr, urging fans to create memes based on the show and uncover all there is to know about it. The series was available on YouTube and on online websites, but most episodes have been removed due to copyright infringement. In December 2004, McFarlane Toys released a line of figures based on the cartoon series featuring all four band members with instruments. In 2005, they released a boxed set featuring cartoon figures of all four band members with instruments, plus an alligator figure, speakers, and a radio. Apple Corps Ltd. purchased the rights to the series in the early 1990s. There has been popular demand for the remastered release of the series on DVD by Apple.\n\n\n",
                "The Beatles\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential music band. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\"; as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were integral to pop music's evolution into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.\n\nThe Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960, with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding the group's popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the next year, and by early 1964 became international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 onwards, the Beatles produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums \"Rubber Soul\" (1965), \"Revolver\" (1966), \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967), \"The Beatles\" (also known as the White Album, 1968) and \"Abbey Road\" (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active. \n\nThe Beatles are the best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over 800 million physical and digital albums worldwide. They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. They are also the best-selling music artists in the United States, with 178 million certified units. In 2008, the group topped \"Billboard\" magazine's list of the all-time most successful artists; , they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with twenty. They have received seven Grammy Awards, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were inducted individually from 1994 to 2015. They were also collectively included in \"Time\" magazine's compilation of .\n\nIn March 1957, John Lennon, then aged sixteen, formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High School. They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young to join them. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting, arranged by McCartney, he performed the lead guitar part for the instrumental \"Raunchy\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist. By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had recently sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used the name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had changed their name to the Silver Beatles and by the middle of August to the Beatles.\n\nAllan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg, but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired Pete Best in mid-August 1960. The band, now a five-piece, left four days later, contracted to club owner Bruno Koschmider for what would be a 3½-month residency. Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes: \"They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the red-light area comes to life ... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities.\"\n\nKoschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the district into music venues, and he initially placed the Beatles at the Indra Club. After closing the Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.\n\nDuring the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe's hair in the \"exi\" (existentialist) style, later adopted by the other Beatles. When Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany, McCartney took up the bass. Producer Bert Kaempfert contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962, and he used them as Tony Sheridan's backing band on a series of recordings for Polydor Records. As part of the sessions, the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one year. Credited to \"Tony Sheridan & the Beat Brothers\", the single \"My Bonnie\", recorded in June 1961 and released four months later, reached number 32 on the \"Musikmarkt\" chart.\n\nAfter the Beatles completed their second Hamburg residency, they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool with the growing Merseybeat movement. However, they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night. In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at The Cavern Club, they encountered Brian Epstein, a local record-store owner and music columnist. He later recalled: \"I immediately liked what I heard. They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what I thought was a sort of presence ... [a] star quality.\" Epstein courted the band over the next couple of months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962. Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He eventually negotiated a one-month-early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg. Tragedy greeted them on their return to Germany in April, when a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from what would later be determined to have been a brain hemorrhage. Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. In order to secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan. After a New Year's Day audition, Decca Records rejected the band with the comment \"Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein.\" However, three months later, producer George Martin signed the Beatles to EMI's Parlophone label.\n\nMartin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \"Love Me Do\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \"Love Me Do\", \"Please Please Me\" and \"P.S. I Love You\". Martin initially selected the Starr version of \"Love Me Do\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \"Love Me Do\" peaked at number seventeen on the \"Record Retailer\" chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme \"People and Places\". After Martin suggested rerecording \"Please Please Me\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \"You've just made your first No.1.\"\n\nIn December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, \"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ...\" Lennon said: \"We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage. He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square. He'd let us have our own sense of individuality.\"\n\nOn 11 February 1963, the Beatles recorded ten songs during a single studio session for their debut LP, \"Please Please Me\". The album was supplemented by the four tracks already released on their first two singles. Martin originally considered recording the Beatles' debut LP live at The Cavern Club, but after deciding that the building's acoustics were inadequate, he elected to simulate a \"live\" album with minimal production in \"a single marathon session at Abbey Road\". After the moderate success of \"Love Me Do\", the single \"Please Please Me\" met with a more emphatic reception. Released in January 1963, two months ahead of the album of the same name, the song reached number one on every chart in London except \"Record Retailer\", where it peaked at number two. Recalling how the Beatles \"rushed to deliver a debut album, bashing out \"Please Please Me\" in a day\", AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine comments, \"Decades after its release, the album still sounds fresh, precisely because of its intense origins.\" Lennon said little thought went into composition at the time; he and McCartney were \"just writing songs \"à la\" Everly Brothers, \"à la\" Buddy Holly, pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant.\"\n\nReleased in March 1963, the album initiated a run during which eleven of their twelve studio albums released in the United Kingdom through 1970 reached number one. The band's third single, \"From Me to You\", came out in April and was also a chart-topping hit, starting an almost unbroken string of seventeen British number-one singles for the Beatles, including all but one of the eighteen they released over the next six years. Issued in August, the band's fourth single, \"She Loves You\", achieved the fastest sales of any record in the UK up to that time, selling three-quarters of a million copies in under four weeks. It became their first single to sell a million copies, and remained the biggest-selling record in the UK until 1978. Their commercial success brought increased media exposure, to which the Beatles responded with an irreverent and comical attitude that defied the expectations of pop musicians at the time, inspiring even more interest. The band toured the UK three times in the first half of the year: a four-week tour that began in February, the Beatles' first nationwide, preceded three-week tours in March and May–June. As their popularity spread, a frenzied adulation of the group took hold. Greeted with riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans, the press dubbed the phenomenon \"Beatlemania\". Although not billed as tour leaders, the Beatles overshadowed American acts Tommy Roe and Chris Montez during the February engagements and assumed top billing \"by audience demand\", something no British act had previously accomplished while touring with artists from the US. A similar situation arose during their May–June tour with Roy Orbison.\n\nIn late October, the Beatles began a five-day tour of Sweden, their first time abroad since the final Hamburg engagement of December 1962. On their return to the UK on 31 October several hundred screaming fans greeted them in heavy rain at Heathrow Airport. Around 50 to 100 journalists and photographers as well as representatives from the BBC also joined the airport reception, the first of more than 100 such events. The next day, the band began its fourth tour of Britain within nine months, this one scheduled for six weeks. In mid-November, as Beatlemania intensified, police resorted to using high-pressure water hoses to control the crowd before a concert in Plymouth.\n\n\"Please Please Me\" maintained the top position on the \"Record Retailer\" chart for 30 weeks, only to be displaced by its follow-up, \"With the Beatles\", which EMI released on 22 November to record advance orders of 270,000 copies. The LP topped a half-million albums sold in one week. Recorded between July and October, \"With the Beatles\" made better use of studio production techniques than its predecessor. It held the top spot for 21 weeks with a chart life of 40 weeks. Erlewine described the LP as \"a sequel of the highest order – one that betters the original\". In a reversal of then standard practice, EMI released the album ahead of the impending single \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", with the song excluded to maximise the single's sales. The album caught the attention of music critic William Mann of \"The Times\", who suggested that Lennon and McCartney were \"the outstanding English composers of 1963\". The newspaper published a series of articles in which Mann offered detailed analyses of the music, lending it respectability. \"With the Beatles\" became the second album in UK chart history to sell a million copies, a figure previously reached only by the 1958 \"South Pacific\" soundtrack. When writing the sleeve notes for the album, the band's press officer, Tony Barrow, used the superlative the \"fabulous foursome\", which the media widely adopted as \"the Fab Four\".\n\nEMI's American subsidiary, Capitol Records, hindered the Beatles' releases in the United States for more than a year by initially declining to issue their music, including their first three singles. Concurrent negotiations with the independent US label Vee-Jay led to the release of some of the songs in 1963, but not all. Vee-Jay finished preparation for the album \"Introducing... The Beatles\", culled from most of the songs of Parlophone's \"Please Please Me\", but a management shake-up led to the album not being released. Then when it surfaced that the label did not report royalties on their sales, the licence Vee-Jay signed with EMI was voided. A new licence was granted to the Swan label for the single \"She Loves You\". The record received some airplay in the Tidewater area of Virginia by Gene Loving of radio station WGH and was featured on the \"Rate-a-Record\" segment of \"American Bandstand\", but it failed to catch on nationally.\n\nEpstein arranged for a $40,000 US marketing campaign. American chart success began after disc jockey Carroll James of AM radio station WWDC in Washington, DC first played \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" in mid-December 1963. It was not until the end of the first week of January 1964 that their records were played in New York City (also accompanied by a major marketing campaign and with similar play frequency), and then the rest of the country, initiating their music's spread across US radio. This caused an increase in demand, leading Capitol to rush-release \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" later that month. Issued on 26 December 1963, with the band's previously scheduled debut there just weeks away, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" sold a million copies, becoming a number-one hit in the US by mid-January. In its wake, Vee-Jay released \"Introducing... The Beatles\" to go along with Capitol's debut album, \"Meet the Beatles!\", while Swan reactivated production of \"She Loves You\".\n\nOn 7 February 1964, the Beatles left the United Kingdom with an estimated 4,000 fans gathered at Heathrow, waving and screaming as the aircraft took off. Upon landing at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, an uproarious crowd estimated at 3,000 greeted them. They gave their first live US television performance two days later on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", watched by approximately 73 million viewers in over 23 million households, or 34 per cent of the American population. Biographer Jonathan Gould writes that, according to the Nielsen rating service, it was \"the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an American television \". The next morning, the Beatles awoke to a negative critical consensus in the US, but a day later their first US concert saw Beatlemania erupt at Washington Coliseum. Back in New York the following day, the Beatles met with another strong reception during two shows at Carnegie Hall. The band then flew to Florida and appeared on the weekly \"Ed Sullivan Show\" a second time, before another 70 million viewers, before returning to the UK on 22 February.\n\nCapitol Records' lack of interest throughout 1963 had not gone unnoticed, and a competitor, United Artists Records, encouraged their film division to offer the group a three-motion-picture deal, primarily for the commercial potential of the soundtracks. Directed by Richard Lester, \"A Hard Day's Night\" involved the band for six weeks in March–April 1964 as they played themselves in a mock-documentary. The film premiered in London and New York in July and August, respectively, and was an international success, with some critics drawing comparison with the Marx Brothers. According to Erlewine, the accompanying soundtrack album, \"A Hard Day's Night\", saw them \"truly coming into their own as a band. All of the disparate influences on their first two albums had coalesced into a bright, joyous, original sound, filled with ringing guitars and irresistible melodies.\" That \"ringing guitar\" sound was primarily the product of Harrison's 12-string electric Rickenbacker, a prototype given to him by the manufacturer, which made its debut on the record.\n\nDuring the week of 4 April 1964, the Beatles held twelve positions on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart, including the top five. Their popularity generated unprecedented interest in British music, and a number of other UK acts subsequently made their own American debuts, successfully touring over the next three years in what was termed the British Invasion. Their hairstyle, unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults, became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture.\n\nTouring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.\n\nIn August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\": Dylan's audience of \"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\" contrasted with their fans, \"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. They were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\" Within six months of the meeting, Gould writes, \"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\". Within a year, \"the distinctions between the folk and rock audiences would have nearly evaporated [and the group's] audience ... [was] showing signs of growing up.\"\n\nAccording to Gould, \"Beatles for Sale\", the Beatles' fourth studio LP, evidenced a growing conflict between the commercial pressures of their global success and their creative ambitions. They had intended the album, recorded between August and October 1964, to continue the format established by \"A Hard Day's Night\" which, unlike their first two LPs, contained only original songs. They had nearly exhausted their backlog of songs on the previous album, however, and given the challenges constant international touring posed to their songwriting efforts, Lennon admitted, \"Material's becoming a hell of a problem\". As a result, six covers from their extensive repertoire were chosen to complete the album. Released in early December, its eight original compositions stood out, demonstrating the growing maturity of the Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership.\nIn early 1965, while they were his guests for dinner, Lennon and Harrison's dentist secretly added LSD to their coffee. Lennon described the experience: \"It was just terrifying, but it was fantastic. I was pretty stunned for a month or two.\" He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one occasion. McCartney was initially reluctant to try it, but eventually did so in late 1966. He became the first Beatle to discuss LSD publicly, declaring in a magazine interview that \"it opened my eyes\" and \"made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society\".\n\nControversy erupted in June 1965 when Queen Elizabeth II appointed all four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) after Prime Minister Harold Wilson nominated them for the award. In protest – the honour was at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders – some conservative MBE recipients returned their own insignia.\n\nReleased in July, the Beatles' second film, \"Help!\", was again directed by Lester. Described as \"mainly a relentless spoof of Bond\", it inspired a mixed response among both reviewers and the band. McCartney said: \"\"Help!\" was great but it wasn't our film – we were sort of guest stars. It was fun, but basically, as an idea for a film, it was a bit wrong.\" The soundtrack was dominated by Lennon, who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs, including the two singles: \"Help!\" and \"Ticket to Ride\". The accompanying album, the group's fifth studio LP, contained all original material save for two covers, \"Act Naturally\" and \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\"; they were the last covers the band would include on an album, with the exception of \"Let It Be\" brief rendition of the traditional Liverpool folk song \"Maggie Mae\". The band expanded their use of vocal overdubs on \"Help!\" and incorporated classical instruments into some arrangements, including a string quartet on the pop ballad \"Yesterday\". Composed by McCartney, \"Yesterday\" would inspire the most recorded cover versions of any song ever written.\n\nThe group's third US tour opened with a performance before a world-record crowd of 55,600 at New York's Shea Stadium on 15 August 1965 – \"perhaps the most famous of all Beatles' concerts\", in Lewisohn's description. A further nine successful concerts followed in other American cities. At a show in Atlanta, the Beatles gave one of the first live performances ever to make use of a foldback system of on-stage monitor speakers. Towards the end of the tour, they met with Elvis Presley, a foundational musical influence on the band, who invited them to his home in Beverly Hills. September saw the launch of an American Saturday-morning cartoon series, \"The Beatles\", that echoed \"A Hard Day's Night\" slapstick antics over its two-year original run. The series was a historical milestone as the first weekly television series to feature animated versions of real, living people.\n\nIn mid-October 1965, the Beatles entered the recording studio; for the first time when making an album, they had an extended period without other major commitments. Until this time, according to George Martin, \"we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles. Now we were really beginning to think about albums as a bit of art on their own.\" Released in December, \"Rubber Soul\" was hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. Their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy. Biographers Peter Brown and Steven Gaines attribute the new musical direction to \"the Beatles' now habitual use of marijuana\", an assertion confirmed by the band – Lennon referred to it as \"the pot album\", and Starr said: \"Grass was really influential in a lot of our changes, especially with the writers. And because they were writing different material, we were playing differently.\" After \"Help!\"s foray into the world of classical music with flutes and strings, Harrison's introduction of a sitar on \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\" marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music. As their lyrics grew more artful, fans began to study them for deeper meaning. Of \"Norwegian Wood\" Lennon commented: \"I was trying to be sophisticated in writing about an affair ... but in such a smokescreen way that you couldn't tell.\"\n\nWhile many of \"Rubber Soul\"s prominent songs were the product of Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting, it also featured distinct compositions from each, though they continued to share official credit. The song \"In My Life\", of which each later claimed lead authorship, is considered a highlight of the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue. Harrison called \"Rubber Soul\" his \"favourite album\" and Starr referred to it as \"the departure record\". McCartney has said, \"We'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand.\" However, recording engineer Norman Smith later stated that the studio sessions revealed signs of growing conflict within the group – \"the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious\", he wrote, and \"as far as Paul was concerned, George could do no right\". In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Rubber Soul\" fifth among \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", and AllMusic's Richie Unterberger describes it as \"one of the classic folk-rock records\".\n\nCapitol Records, from December 1963 when it began issuing Beatles recordings for the US market, exercised complete control over format, compiling distinct US albums from the band's recordings and issuing songs of their choosing as singles. In June 1966, \"Yesterday and Today\", one of Capitol's compilation albums, caused an uproar with its cover, which portrayed the grinning Beatles dressed in butcher's overalls, accompanied by raw meat and mutilated plastic baby dolls. It has been incorrectly suggested that this was meant as a satirical response to the way Capitol had \"butchered\" the US versions of their albums. Thousands of copies of the LP had a new cover pasted over the original; an unpeeled \"first-state\" copy fetched $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. In England, meanwhile, Harrison met sitar maestro Ravi Shankar, who agreed to train him on the instrument.\n\nDuring a tour of the Philippines the month after the \"Yesterday and Today\" furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had expected them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations. They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty. Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.\n\nAlmost as soon as they returned home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. \"Christianity will go,\" Lennon had said. \"It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\" The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine \"Datebook\" printed it five months later – on the eve of the group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American \"Bible Belt\". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused \"Datebook\" of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, \"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\" Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\"\n\nAs preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.\n\n\"Rubber Soul\" had marked a major step forward; \"Revolver\", released in August 1966 a week before the Beatles' final tour, marked another. \"Pitchfork\"s Scott Plagenhoef identifies it as \"the sound of a band growing into supreme confidence\" and \"redefining what was expected from popular music\". \"Revolver\" featured sophisticated songwriting, studio experimentation, and a greatly expanded repertoire of musical styles, ranging from innovative classical string arrangements to psychedelic rock. Abandoning the customary group photograph, its cover – designed by Klaus Voormann, a friend of the band since their Hamburg days – \"was a stark, arty, black-and-white collage that caricatured the Beatles in a pen-and-ink style beholden to Aubrey Beardsley\", in Gould's description. The album was preceded by the single \"Paperback Writer\", backed by \"Rain\". Short promotional films were made for both songs; described by cultural historian Saul Austerlitz as \"among the first true music videos\", they aired on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and \"Top of the Pops\" in June 1966.\n\nAmong the experimental songs that \"Revolver\" featured was \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", the lyrics for which Lennon drew from Timothy Leary's \"\". Its creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the EMI building, each staffed by an engineer or band member, who randomly varied the movement of a tape loop while Martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data. McCartney's \"Eleanor Rigby\" made prominent use of a string octet; Gould describes it as \"a true hybrid, conforming to no recognisable style or genre of song\". Harrison was developing as a songwriter, and three of his compositions earned a place on the record. In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Revolver\" as the third greatest album of all time. During the US tour that followed its release, however, the band performed none of its songs. As Chris Ingham writes, they were very much \"studio creations ... and there was no way a four-piece rock 'n' roll group could do them justice, particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans' screams. 'Live Beatles' and 'Studio Beatles' had become entirely different beasts.\" The band's final concert at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on 29 August was their last commercial concert. It marked the end of a four-year period dominated by almost nonstop touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally.\n\nFreed from the burden of touring, the Beatles embraced an increasingly experimental approach as they recorded \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", beginning in late November 1966. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, the album's recording took over 700 hours. He recalled the band's insistence \"that everything on \"Sgt. Pepper\" had to be different. We had microphones right down in the bells of brass instruments and headphones turned into microphones attached to violins. We used giant primitive oscillators to vary the speed of instruments and vocals and we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together upside down and the wrong way around.\" Parts of \"A Day in the Life\" featured a 40-piece orchestra. The sessions initially yielded the non-album double A-side single \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"/\"Penny Lane\" in February 1967; the \"Sgt. Pepper\" LP followed in June. The musical complexity of the records, created using relatively primitive four-track recording technology, astounded contemporary artists. Among music critics, acclaim for the album was virtually universal. Gould writes:\n\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" was the first major pop/rock LP to include its complete lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album was the subject of a scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were \"listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy\". Poirier identified what he termed its \"mixed allusiveness\": \"It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style ... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough ... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives.\" McCartney said at the time: \"We write songs. We know what we mean by them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it. ... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs.\" The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their \"brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms\" as a knowingly \"anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment\" display. In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it number one on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".\n\nOn 25 June 1967, the Beatles performed their forthcoming single, \"All You Need Is Love\", to an estimated 350 million viewers on \"Our World\", the first live global television link. Released a week later, during the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power anthem. Two months later, the group suffered a loss that threw their career into turmoil. Having been introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi only the previous night in London, on 25 August they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat. Two days later, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein, only thirty-two years old, had died. The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide. Epstein had been in a fragile emotional state, stressed by personal issues. His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future. Lennon recalled: \"We collapsed. I knew that we were in trouble then. I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared. I thought, 'We've had it now.'\"\n\n\"Magical Mystery Tour\", the soundtrack to a forthcoming Beatles television film, was released in the UK as a six-track double extended play disc (EP) in early December 1967. In the United States, the six songs were issued on an identically titled LP that also included five tracks from the band's recent singles. Unterberger says of the US \"Magical Mystery Tour\", \"the psychedelic sound is very much in the vein of \"Sgt. Pepper\", and even spacier in parts (especially the sound collages of 'I Am the Walrus')\" and he calls its five songs culled from the band's 1967 singles \"huge, glorious, and innovative\". In its first three weeks, the album set a record for the highest initial sales of any Capitol LP, and it is the only Capitol compilation later to be adopted in the band's official canon of studio albums. First aired on Boxing Day, the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" film, largely directed by McCartney, brought the group their first major negative UK press. It was dismissed as \"blatant rubbish\" by the \"Daily Express\"; the \"Daily Mail\" called it \"a colossal conceit\"; and \"The Guardian\" labelled the film \"a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience\". Gould describes it as \"a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on, getting off, and riding on a bus\". Although the viewership figures were respectable, its slating in the press led US television networks to lose interest in broadcasting the film.\n\nIn January 1968, the Beatles filmed a cameo for the animated movie \"Yellow Submarine\", which featured cartoon versions of the band members and a soundtrack with eleven of their songs, including four unreleased studio recordings that made their debut in the film. Released in June 1968, the film was praised by critics for its music, humour and innovative visual style. It would be seven months, however, before its soundtrack album appeared.\n\nIn the interim came \"The Beatles\", a double LP commonly known as the White Album for its virtually featureless cover. Creative inspiration for the album came from a new direction: without Epstein's guiding presence, the group had briefly turned to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as their guru. At his ashram in Rishikesh, India, a \"Guide Course\" scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs including a majority of the 30 included on the album. However, Starr left after only ten days, likening it to Butlins, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to questioning when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them. When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled \"Maharishi\", renamed \"Sexy Sadie\" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, \"We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was.\"\n\nDuring recording sessions for the White Album, which stretched from late May to mid-October 1968, relations between the Beatles grew openly divisive. Starr quit for two weeks, and McCartney took over the drum kit for \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" (on which Harrison and Lennon drummed as well) and \"Dear Prudence\". Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney, whose contribution \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" he scorned as \"granny music shit\". Tensions were further aggravated by Lennon's romantic preoccupation with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, whom he insisted on bringing to the sessions despite the group's well-established understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in the studio. Describing the double album, Lennon later said: \"Every track is an individual track; there isn't any Beatle music on it. [It's] John and the band, Paul and the band, George and the band.\" McCartney has recalled that the album \"wasn't a pleasant one to make\". Both he and Lennon identified the sessions as the start of the band's break-up.\n\nIssued in November, the White Album was the band's first Apple Records album release, although EMI continued to own their recordings. The new label was a subsidiary of Apple Corps, which Epstein had formed as part of his plan to create a tax-effective business structure. The record attracted more than 2 million advance orders, selling nearly 4 million copies in the US in little over a month, and its tracks dominated the playlists of American radio stations. Despite its popularity, it did not receive flattering reviews at the time. According to Gould:\n\nGeneral critical opinion eventually turned in favour of the White Album, and in 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it as the tenth greatest album of all time. Pitchfork's Mark Richardson describes it as \"large and sprawling, overflowing with ideas but also with indulgences, and filled with a hugely variable array of material ... its failings are as essential to its character as its triumphs.\" Erlewine comments: \"The [band's] two main songwriting forces were no longer on the same page, but neither were George and Ringo\", yet \"Lennon turns in two of his best ballads\", McCartney's songs are \"stunning\", Harrison had become \"a songwriter who deserved wider exposure\", and Starr's composition was \"a delight\".\n\nThe \"Yellow Submarine\" LP, issued in January 1969, contained only the four previously unreleased songs that had debuted in the film, along with the title track (already issued on \"Revolver\"), \"All You Need Is Love\" (already issued as a single and on the US \"Magical Mystery Tour\" LP) and seven instrumental pieces composed by Martin. Because of the paucity of new Beatles music, AllMusic's Unterberger and Bruce Eder suggest the album might be \"inessential\" but for Harrison's \"It's All Too Much\": \"the jewel of the new songs ... resplendent in swirling Mellotron, larger-than-life percussion, and tidal waves of feedback guitar ... a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia\".\n\nAlthough \"Let It Be\" was the Beatles' final album release, it was largely recorded before \"Abbey Road\". The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they \"record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for the very first time – on record and on film\". Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called \"Beatles at Work\", much of the album's content came from extensive rehearsals filmed by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg at Twickenham Film Studios, beginning in January 1969. Martin has said that the project was \"not at all a happy recording experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb.\" Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as \"hell ... the most miserable ... on Earth\", and Harrison, \"the low of all-time\". Irritated by both McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they \"abandon[ed] all talk of live performance\" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled \"Get Back\", using songs recorded for the TV special. He also demanded they cease work at Twickenham and relocate to the newly finished Apple Studio. The other band members agreed, and the idea came about to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film.\n\nIn an effort to alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions. Preston received label billing on the \"Get Back\" single – the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release. At the conclusion of the rehearsals, the band could not agree on a location to film a concert, rejecting several ideas, including a boat at sea, a lunatic asylum, the Tunisian desert, and the Colosseum. Ultimately, what would be their final live performance was filmed on the rooftop of the Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row, London, on 30 January 1969. Five weeks later, engineer Glyn Johns, whom Lewisohn describes as \"Get Back\"s \"uncredited producer\", began work assembling an album, given \"free rein\" as the band \"all but washed their hands of the entire project\".\n\nNew strains developed between the band members regarding the appointment of a financial adviser, the need for which had become evident without Epstein to manage business affairs. Lennon, Harrison and Starr favoured Allen Klein, who had managed the Rolling Stones and Sam Cooke; McCartney wanted Lee and John Eastman – father and brother, respectively, of Linda Eastman, whom McCartney married on 12 March. Agreement could not be reached, so both Klein and the Eastmans were temporarily appointed: Klein as the Beatles' business manager and the Eastmans as their lawyers. Further conflict ensued, however, and financial opportunities were lost. On 8 May, Klein was named sole manager of the band, the Eastmans having previously been dismissed as the Beatles' attorneys. McCartney refused to sign the management contract with Klein, but he was out-voted by the other Beatles.\n\nMartin stated that he was surprised when McCartney asked him to produce another album, as the \"Get Back\" sessions had been \"a miserable experience\" and he had \"thought it was the end of the road for all of us\". The primary recording sessions for \"Abbey Road\" began on 2 July 1969. Lennon, who rejected Martin's proposed format of a \"continuously moving piece of music\", wanted his and McCartney's songs to occupy separate sides of the album. The eventual format, with individually composed songs on the first side and the second consisting largely of a medley, was McCartney's suggested compromise. On 4 July, the first solo single by a Beatle was released: Lennon's \"Give Peace a Chance\", credited to the Plastic Ono Band. The completion and mixing of \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" on 20 August 1969 was the last occasion on which all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September, but agreed to withhold a public announcement to avoid undermining sales of the forthcoming album.\n\nReleased six days after Lennon's declaration, \"Abbey Road\" sold 4 million copies within three months and topped the UK charts for a total of seventeen weeks. Its second track, the ballad \"Something\", was issued as a single – the only Harrison composition ever to appear as a Beatles A-side. \"Abbey Road\" received mixed reviews, although the medley met with general acclaim. Unterberger considers it \"a fitting swan song for the group\", containing \"some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record\". Musicologist and author Ian MacDonald calls the album \"erratic and often hollow\", despite the \"semblance of unity and coherence\" offered by the medley. Martin has singled it out as his personal favourite of all the band's albums; Lennon said it was \"competent\" but had \"no life in it\". Recording engineer Emerick notes that the replacement of the studio's valve mixing console with a transistorised one yielded a less punchy sound, leaving the group frustrated at the thinner tone and lack of impact and contributing to its \"kinder, gentler\" feel relative to their previous albums.\n\nFor the still unfinished \"Get Back\" album, one last song, Harrison's \"I Me Mine\", was recorded on 3 January 1970. Lennon, in Denmark at the time, did not participate. In March, rejecting the work Johns had done on the project, now retitled \"Let It Be\", Klein gave the session tapes to American producer Phil Spector, who had recently produced Lennon's solo single \"Instant Karma!\" In addition to remixing the material, Spector edited, spliced and overdubbed several of the recordings that had been intended as \"live\". McCartney was unhappy with the producer's approach and particularly dissatisfied with the lavish orchestration on \"The Long and Winding Road\", which involved a fourteen-voice choir and 36-piece instrumental ensemble. McCartney's demands that the alterations to the song be reverted were ignored, and he publicly announced his departure from the band on 10 April 1970, a week before the release of his first, self-titled solo album.\n\nOn 8 May, the Spector-produced \"Let It Be\" was released. Its accompanying single, \"The Long and Winding Road\", was the Beatles' last; it was released in the United States, but not in the UK. The \"Let It Be\" documentary film followed later that month, and would win the 1970 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. \"Sunday Telegraph\" critic Penelope Gilliatt called it \"a very bad film and a touching one ... about the breaking apart of this reassuring, geometrically perfect, once apparently ageless family of siblings\". Several reviewers stated that some of the performances in the film sounded better than their analogous album tracks. Describing \"Let It Be\" as the \"only Beatles album to occasion negative, even hostile reviews\", Unterberger calls it \"on the whole underrated\"; he singles out \"some good moments of straight hard rock in 'I've Got a Feeling' and 'Dig a Pony'\", and praises \"Let It Be\", \"Get Back\", and \"the folky 'Two of Us', with John and Paul harmonising together\". McCartney filed suit for the dissolution of the Beatles' contractual partnership on 31 December 1970. Legal disputes continued long after their break-up, and the dissolution was not formalised until 29 December 1974, when John Lennon signed the paperwork terminating the partnership while on vacation with his family at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.\n\nLennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr all released solo albums in 1970. Their solo records sometimes involved one or more of the others; Starr's \"Ringo\" (1973) was the only album to include compositions and performances by all four ex-Beatles, albeit on separate songs. With Starr's participation, Harrison staged the Concert for Bangladesh in New York City in August 1971. Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974, later bootlegged as \"A Toot and a Snore in '74\", Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.\n\nTwo double-LP sets of the Beatles' greatest hits, compiled by Klein, \"1962–1966\" and \"1967–1970\", were released in 1973, at first under the Apple Records imprint. Commonly known as the \"Red Album\" and \"Blue Album\", respectively, each have earned a Multi-Platinum certification in the United States and a Platinum certification in the United Kingdom. Between 1976 and 1982, EMI/Capitol released a wave of compilation albums without input from the ex-Beatles, starting with the double-disc compilation \"Rock 'n' Roll Music\". The only one to feature previously unreleased material was \"The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl\" (1977); the first officially issued concert recordings by the group, it contained selections from two shows they played during their 1964 and 1965 US tours.\n\nThe music and enduring fame of the Beatles was commercially exploited in various other ways, again often outside their creative control. In April 1974, the musical \"John, Paul, George, Ringo … and Bert\", written by Willy Russell and featuring singer Barbara Dickson, opened in London. It included, with permission from Northern Songs, eleven Lennon-McCartney compositions and one by Harrison, \"Here Comes the Sun\". Displeased with the production's use of his song, Harrison withdrew his permission to use it. Later that year, the off-Broadway musical \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road\" opened. \"All This and World War II\" (1976) was an unorthodox nonfiction film that combined newsreel footage with covers of Beatles songs by performers ranging from Elton John and Keith Moon to the London Symphony Orchestra. The Broadway musical \"Beatlemania\", an unauthorised nostalgia revue, opened in early 1977 and proved popular, spinning off five separate touring productions. In 1979, the band sued the producers, settling for several million dollars in damages. \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1978), a musical film starring the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton, was a commercial failure and an \"artistic fiasco\", according to Ingham.\n\nOn 24 April 1976, during a broadcast of \"Saturday Night Live\", producer Lorne Michaels offered the Beatles $3,000 to reunite on his show. Unbeknownst to him, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were watching the live broadcast at John's apartment at The Dakota in New York at the time, which was within walking distance of the studio where the show was being shot. The two men entertained the idea of hailing a cab to the studio and surprising Michaels by accepting his offer, but ultimately declined, for as Paul later said \"It would have been work, and we were having a night off, so we elected not to go. It was a nice idea – we nearly did it.\"\n\nAfter the murder of Lennon in December 1980, Harrison rewrote the lyrics to his song \"All Those Years Ago\" in Lennon's honour. With Starr on drums and McCartney and his wife, Linda, contributing backing vocals, the song was released as a single in May 1981. McCartney's own tribute, \"Here Today\", appeared on his \"Tug of War\" album in April 1982. In 1987, Harrison's \"Cloud Nine\" album included \"When We Was Fab\", a song about the Beatlemania era.\n\nWhen the Beatles' studio albums were released on CD by EMI and Apple Corps in 1987, their catalogue was standardised throughout the world, establishing a canon of the twelve original studio LPs as issued in the UK plus the US LP version of \"Magical Mystery Tour\" (1967). All the remaining material from the singles and EPs which had not appeared on the original studio albums was gathered on the two-volume compilation \"Past Masters\" (1988). Except for the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" albums, EMI deleted all its other Beatles compilations – including the \"Hollywood Bowl\" record – from its catalogue.\n\nIn 1988, the Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, their first year of eligibility. Harrison and Starr attended the ceremony with Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, and his two sons, Julian and Sean. McCartney declined to attend, citing unresolved \"business differences\" that would make him \"feel like a complete hypocrite waving and smiling with them at a fake reunion\". The following year, EMI/Capitol settled a decade-long lawsuit filed by the band over royalties, clearing the way to commercially package previously unreleased material.\n\n\"Live at the BBC\", the first official release of unissued Beatles performances in seventeen years, appeared in 1994. That same year McCartney, Harrison and Starr collaborated on the \"Anthology\" project. \"Anthology\" was the culmination of work begun in 1970, when Apple Corps director Neil Aspinall, their former road manager and personal assistant, had started to gather material for a documentary with the working title \"The Long and Winding Road\". Documenting their history in the band's own words, the \"Anthology\" project included the release of several unissued Beatles recordings. McCartney, Harrison and Starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to two songs recorded as demos by Lennon in the late 1970s.\n\nDuring 1995–96, the project yielded a television miniseries, an eight-volume video set, and three two-CD/three-LP box sets featuring artwork by Klaus Voormann. The two songs based on Lennon demos, \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\", were issued as new Beatles singles. The releases were commercially successful and the television series was viewed by an estimated 400 million people. In 1999, to coincide with the re-release of the 1968 film \"Yellow Submarine\", a new soundtrack compilation CD/LP, \"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\", was issued.\n\nThe Beatles' \"1\", a compilation album of the band's British and American number-one hits, was released on 13 November 2000. It became the fastest-selling album of all time, with 3.6 million sold in its first week and 13 million within a month. It topped albums charts in at least 28 countries, including the UK and US. , the compilation had sold 31 million copies globally, and is the best-selling album of that decade in the United States.\n\nHarrison died from metastatic lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr were among the musicians who performed at the Concert for George, organised by Eric Clapton and Harrison's widow, Olivia. The tribute event took place at the Royal Albert Hall on the first anniversary of Harrison's death. In addition to songs he composed for the group and during his solo career, the concert included a celebration of Indian classical music, which had significantly influenced Harrison.\n\nIn 2003, \"Let It Be... Naked\", a reconceived version of the \"Let It Be\" album, with McCartney supervising production, was released. One of the main differences with the Spector-produced version was the omission of the original string arrangements. It was a top ten hit in both Britain and America. The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 – \"The Capitol Albums, Volume 1\" and \"Volume 2\" included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of the music's original American release.\n\nAs a soundtrack for Cirque du Soleil's Las Vegas Beatles stage revue, \"Love\", George Martin and his son Giles remixed and blended 130 of the band's recordings to create what Martin called \"a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period\". The show premiered in June 2006, and the \"Love\" album was released that November when McCartney discussed his hope that \"Carnival of Light\", a fourteen-minute experimental recording made at Abbey Road in 1967, would receive an official release. A rare live performance involving two ex-Beatles took place in April 2009 at a benefit concert organised by McCartney at New York's Radio City Music Hall, where he was joined by Starr for three songs.\nOn 9 September 2009, the Beatles' entire back catalogue was reissued following an extensive digital remastering process that lasted four years. Stereo editions of all twelve original UK studio albums, along with \"Magical Mystery Tour\" and the \"Past Masters\" compilation, were released on compact disc both individually and as a box set. Comparing the new releases with the 1987 CDs, which had been widely criticised for their lack of clarity and dynamism, \"Mojo\"s Danny Eccleston wrote, \"the remastered vocals are purer, more natural-sounding and give the illusion of sitting slightly higher in the mix.\" A second collection, \"The Beatles in Mono\", included remastered versions of every Beatles album released in true mono along with the original 1965 stereo mixes of \"Help!\" and \"Rubber Soul\" (which Martin had remixed for the 1987 editions). \"\", a music video game in the \"Rock Band\" series, was issued on the same day. In December 2009, the band's catalogue was officially released in FLAC and MP3 format in a limited edition of 30,000 USB flash drives.\n\nOwing to a long-running royalty disagreement, the Beatles were among the last major artists to sign deals with online music services. Residual disagreement emanating from Apple Corps' dispute with Apple, Inc., iTunes' owners, over the use of the name \"Apple\" was also partly responsible for the delay, although in 2008, McCartney stated that the main obstacle to making the Beatles' catalogue available online was that EMI \"want[s] something we're not prepared to give them\". In 2010, the official canon of thirteen Beatles studio albums, \"Past Masters\", and the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" greatest-hits albums were made available on iTunes.\n\nIn 2012, EMI's recorded music operations were sold to Universal Music Group. In order for Universal Music to acquire EMI, the European Union, for antitrust reasons, forced EMI to spin off assets including Parlophone. Universal was allowed to keep the Beatles' recorded music catalogue, managed by Capitol Records under its Capitol Music Group division. Also in 2012, the entire original Beatles album catalogue was reissued on vinyl, available either individually or as a box set.\n\nIn 2013, a second volume of BBC recordings entitled \"On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2\" was released. December of that year saw the release of another 59 Beatles recordings on iTunes. The set, titled \"The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963\", had the opportunity to gain a 70-year copyright extension conditional on the songs being published at least once before the end of 2013. Apple Records released the recordings on 17 December to prevent them from going into the public domain and had them taken down from iTunes later that same day. Fan reactions to the release were mixed, with one blogger saying \"the hardcore Beatles collectors who are trying to obtain everything will already have these.\"\n\nOn 26 January 2014, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr performed McCartney's \"Queenie Eye\" in Los Angeles at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The following day, \"\" television special was taped in the Los Angeles Convention Center's West Hall. It aired on 9 February, the exact date of – and at the same time, and on the same network as – the original broadcast of the Beatles' first US television appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", 50 years earlier. The special included performances of Beatles songs by current artists as well as by McCartney and Starr, archival footage, and Paul and Ringo being interviewed by David Letterman at the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of \"The Ed Sullivan Show\".\n\nIn December 2015, the Beatles released their catalogue for streaming on various streaming music services. On 18 May 2017, Sirius XM Radio launched a 24/7 radio channel, The Beatles Channel. On 26 May 2017, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" was reissued with new stereo mixes and unreleased material for the album's 50th anniversary. The reissue is available in five different formats – digital format, a single CD, a double CD set, a double vinyl set, and a six-CD deluxe edition box set.\n\nIn \"Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever\", Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz describe the Beatles' musical evolution:\n\nIn \"The Beatles as Musicians\", Walter Everett describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: \"McCartney may be said to have constantly developed – as a means to entertain – a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility.\"\n\nIan MacDonald describes McCartney as \"a natural melodist – a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\". His melody lines are characterised as primarily \"vertical\", employing wide, consonant intervals which express his \"extrovert energy and optimism\". Conversely, Lennon's \"sedentary, ironic personality\" is reflected in a \"horizontal\" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: \"Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own.\" MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his \"characterful lines and textural colourings\" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts, and describes Starr as \"the father of modern pop/rock drumming\".\n\nThe band's earliest influences include Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Little Richard and Chuck Berry. During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the Star-Club in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs. Of Presley, Lennon said, \"Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles.\"\n\nOther early influences include Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, Roy Orbison and the Everly Brothers. The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries, including Bob Dylan, the Who, Frank Zappa, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Byrds and the Beach Boys, whose 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" amazed and inspired McCartney. Referring to the Beach Boys' creative leader, Martin later stated: \"No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian [Wilson].\" Ravi Shankar, with whom Harrison studied for six weeks in India in late 1966, had a significant effect on his musical development during the band's later years.\n\nOriginating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre, and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music. Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of \"Beatles for Sale\", \"You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP\", while Gould credits \"Rubber Soul\" as \"the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop\".\n\nAlthough the 1965 song \"Yesterday\" was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings, it marked the group's first recorded use of classical music elements. Gould observes: \"The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars.\" They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; \"Sgt. Pepper\"s \"She's Leaving Home\", for instance, is \"cast in the of a sentimental Victorian ballad\", Gould writes, \"its words and music filled with the clichés of musical melodrama\".\n\nThe band's stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 B-side \"Rain\", described by Martin Strong as \"the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record\". Other psychedelic numbers followed, such as \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" (recorded before \"Rain\"), \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" and \"I Am the Walrus\". The influence of Indian classical music was evident in Harrison's \"The Inner Light\", \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\" – Gould describes the latter two as attempts \"to replicate the raga form in miniature\".\n\nInnovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution, according to music historian and pianist Michael Campbell: \"'A Day in the Life' encapsulates the art and achievement of the Beatles as well as any single track can. It highlights key features of their music: the sound imagination, the persistence of tuneful melody, and the close coordination between words and music. It represents a new category of song – more sophisticated than pop ... and uniquely innovative. There literally had never before been a song – classical or vernacular – that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively.\" Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees: \"the Beatles ... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as Celtic music, rhythm and blues, and country and western could be put together in a new way.\"\n\nAuthor Dominic Pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles: \"Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another (as is sometimes conveniently suggested) the group maintained \"in parallel\" their mastery of the traditional, catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville. One of these threads was their take on folk music, which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy.\" As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained, their individual tastes became more apparent. The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music, which encompassed Lennon's \"Revolution 9\" (whose musique concrète approach was influenced by Yoko Ono), Starr's country song \"Don't Pass Me By\", Harrison's rock ballad \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", and the \" roar\" of McCartney's \"Helter Skelter\".\n\nGeorge Martin's close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the \"fifth Beatle\". He applied his classical musical training in various ways, and functioned as \"an informal music teacher\" to the progressing songwriters, according to Gould. Martin suggested to a sceptical McCartney that the arrangement of \"Yesterday\" should feature a string quartet accompaniment, thereby introducing the Beatles to a \"hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour\", in MacDonald's description. Their creative development was also facilitated by Martin's willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions, such as adding \"something baroque\" to a particular recording. In addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings, Martin often performed on them, playing instruments including piano, organ and brass.\n\nCollaborating with Lennon and McCartney required Martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording. MacDonald comments, \"while [he] worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate McCartney, the challenge of catering to Lennon's intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements, of which 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!' is an outstanding example.\" Martin said of the two composers' distinct songwriting styles and his own stabilising influence:\n\nHarrison echoed Martin's description of his stabilising role: \"I think we just grew through those years together, him as the straight man and us as the loonies; but he was always there for us to interpret our madness – we used to be slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week, and he would be there as the anchor person, to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape.\"\n\nMaking innovative use of technology while expanding the possibilities of recorded music, the Beatles urged experimentation by Martin and his recording engineers. Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use, accidental guitar feedback, a resonating glass bottle, a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards – any of these might be incorporated into their music. Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith, Ken Townsend and Geoff Emerick, all contributed significantly to their records from \"Rubber Soul\" and, especially, \"Revolver\" onwards. Along with innovative studio techniques such as sound effects, unconventional microphone placements, tape loops, double tracking and vari-speed recording, the Beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in \"Norwegian Wood\" and the swarmandal in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\". They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron, with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" intro, and the clavioline, an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\".\n\nFormer \"Rolling Stone\" associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, as \"artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original ... [I]n the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive ...\" The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as \"an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roĺl with their own adolescent romanticism\", and \"the first advance in popular music since the War\". They not only sparked the British Invasion of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. From the 1920s, the United States had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood movies, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee. The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people that they most associated with UK culture.\n\nTheir musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide. Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs. On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any \"pre-Beatles\" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio. They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with \"filler\", and they were primary innovators of the modern music video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a \"major breakthrough ... a giant step toward reshaping the concert business\". Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on fashion.\n\nAccording to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism. According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \"began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\".\n\nIn 1965, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). The film \"Let It Be\" (1970) won the 1971 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. The recipients of seven Grammy Awards and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards, the Beatles have been awarded six Diamond albums, as well as 24 Multi-Platinum albums, 39 Platinum albums and 45 Gold albums in the United States. In the UK, the Beatles have four Multi-Platinum albums, four Platinum albums, eight Gold albums and one Silver album. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nThe best-selling band in history, the Beatles have sold more than 800 million physical and digital albums as of 2013. They have had more number-one albums on the UK charts, fifteen, and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9 million, than any other act. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the Beatles as the best artist of all time. They ranked number one on \"Billboard\" magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary. , they hold the record for most number-one hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, with twenty. The Recording Industry Association of America certifies that the Beatles have sold 178 million units in the US, more than any other artist. They were collectively included in \"Time\" magazine's compilation of . In 2014, they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nPrincipal members\nEarly members\n\nTouring musician\nTimeline\n\n\nWhen the above albums were reissued on CD in 1988, the American \"Magical Mystery Tour\" album (1967) and the double-CD compilation set \"Past Masters\" were included so that the full set would contain every track commercially released in the band's lifetime.\n\nSee also\n\nThrough 1969, the Beatles' catalogue was published almost exclusively by Northern Songs Ltd., a company formed in February 1963 by music publisher Dick James specifically for Lennon and McCartney, though it later acquired songs by other artists. The company was organised with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share. McCartney had 20%. Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion – 19 or 20% – and Brian Epstein's – 9 or 10% – which he received in lieu of a 25% band management fee.\n\nIn 1965, the company went public. Five million shares were created, of which the original principals retained 3.75 million. James and Silver each received 937,500 shares (18.75% of 5 million); Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000 shares (15%); and Epstein's management company, NEMS Enterprises, received 375,000 shares (7.5%). Of the 1.25 million shares put up for sale, Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000. At the time of the stock offering, Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973.\n\nHarrison created Harrisongs to represent his Beatles compositions, but signed a three-year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work through March 1968, which included \"Taxman\" and \"Within You Without You\". The songs on which Starr received co-writing credit before 1968, such as \"What Goes On\" and \"Flying\", were also Northern Songs copyrights. Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended, signing instead with Apple Publishing while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on. Harrisongs thus owns the rights to his later Beatles songs such as \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Something\". That year, as well, Starr created Startling Music, which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions, \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\".\n\nIn March 1969, James arranged to sell his and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company Associated Television (ATV), founded by impresario Lew Grade, without first informing the Beatles. The band then made a bid to gain controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding. The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, \"I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in the City.\" By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973. In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969.\n\nIn 1981, financial losses by ATV's parent company, ACC, led it to attempt to sell its music division. According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry, Grade contacted McCartney, offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $30 million. According to an account McCartney gave in 1995, he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue, if Grade were ever willing to \"separate off\" that portion of ATV Music. Soon afterwards, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for £20 million, giving the ex-Beatle \"a week or so\" to decide. By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a £5 million bid that was rejected. According to reports at the time, Grade refused to separate Northern Songs, and turned down an offer of £21–25 million from McCartney and Ono for ATV Music. In 1982, ACC as a whole was sold to Australian business magnate Robert Holmes à Court for £60 million.\n\nThree years later, Michael Jackson purchased ATV for a reported $47.5 million. The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights. In 1995, in a deal that earned him a reported $110 million, Jackson merged his music publishing business with Sony, creating a new company, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he held a 50% stake. The merger made the new company, then valued at over half a billion dollars, the third largest music publisher in the world. In 2016, Sony acquired Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $750 million.\n\nDespite the lack of publishing rights to most of their songs, Lennon's estate and McCartney continue to receive their respective shares of the writers' royalties, which together are 33⅓% of total commercial proceeds in the US and which vary elsewhere around the world between 50 and 55%. Two of Lennon and McCartney's earliest songs – \"Love Me Do\" and \"P.S. I Love You\" – were published by an EMI subsidiary, Ardmore & Beechwood, before they signed with James. McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore in the mid-1980s, and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by McCartney's company MPL Communications.\n\nOn 18 January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in United States district court against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018. Under US copyright law, for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56 years. McCartney and Sony agreed to a confidential settlement in June 2017.\n\n\n",
                "Ringo Starr\n\nSir Richard Starkey, (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, songwriter, singer, and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", \"Yellow Submarine\", \"Good Night\", and their cover of \"Act Naturally\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \"What Goes On\" and \"Flying\".\n\nStarr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. In 1955, he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he cofounded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958.\n\nWhen the Beatles were formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success with that band in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, when he replaced Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number four hit \"It Don't Come Easy\", and number ones \"Photograph\" and \"You're Sixteen\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \"Back Off Boogaloo\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album \"Ringo\", which was a top ten release in both the UK and the US. He has been featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows. He also narrated the first two series of the children's television programme \"Thomas & Friends\" and portrayed \"Mr Conductor\" during the first season of the PBS children's television series \"Shining Time Station\". Since 1989, he has toured with twelve variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.\n\nStarr's creative contribution to music has received praise from other drummers such as Phil Collins, who described him as \"a great musician\", and Steve Smith, who commented: \"Before Ringo, drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity. Ringo's popularity brought forth a new paradigm ... we started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect ... His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song.\" He was inducted into the \"Modern Drummer\" Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2011, \"Rolling Stone\" readers named Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. Starr, who was previously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a Beatle in 1988, was inducted for his solo career in 2015, making him one of 21 performers inducted more than once. Starr was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music.\n\nRichard Starkey was born on 7 July 1940, at 9 Madryn Street, in the Dingle, Liverpool. He was the only child of confectioners Richard Starkey (1913–1981) and Elsie Gleave (1914–1987). Elsie enjoyed singing and dancing, a hobby that she shared with her husband, an avid fan of swing. Prior to the birth of their son – whom they nicknamed \"Ritchie\" – the couple had spent much of their free time on the local ballroom circuit, but their regular outings ended soon after his birth. Elsie adopted an overprotective approach to raising her son that bordered on fixation. Subsequently, \"Big Ritchie\", as Starkey's father became known, lost interest in his family, choosing instead to spend long hours drinking and dancing in pubs, sometimes for several consecutive days.\n\nIn an effort to reduce their housing costs, his family moved in 1944 to another neighbourhood in the Dingle, Admiral Grove; soon afterwards his parents separated, and they divorced within the year. Starkey later stated that he has \"no real memories\" of his father, who made little effort to bond with him, visiting as few as three times thereafter. Elsie found it difficult to survive on her ex-husband's support payments of thirty shillings a week, so she took on several menial jobs cleaning houses before securing a position as a local barmaid, an occupation that she held for twelve years.\nAt age six Starkey developed appendicitis. Following a routine appendectomy he contracted peritonitis, causing him to fall into a coma that lasted for days. His recovery spanned twelve months, which he spent away from his family at Liverpool's Myrtle Street children's hospital. Upon his discharge in May 1948, his mother allowed him to stay home, causing him to miss school. At age eight, he remained illiterate, with a poor grasp of mathematics. His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school, which resulted in his regularly playing truant at Sefton Park. After several years of twice-weekly tutoring from his surrogate sister and neighbour, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers academically, but in 1953, he contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium, where he remained for two years. During his stay the medical staff made an effort to stimulate motor activity and relieve boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band, leading to his first exposure to a percussion instrument: a makeshift mallet made from a cotton bobbin that he used to strike the cabinets next to his bed. Soon afterwards, he grew increasingly interested in drumming, receiving a copy of the Alyn Ainsworth song \"Bedtime for Drums\" as a convalescence gift from Crawford. Starkey commented: \"I was in the hospital band ... That's where I really started playing. I never wanted anything else from there on ... My grandparents gave me a mandolin and a banjo, but I didn't want them. My grandfather gave me a harmonica ... we had a piano – nothing. Only the drums.\"\n\nStarkey attended St Silas, a Church of England primary school near his house where his classmates nicknamed him \"Lazarus\", and later Dingle Vale Secondary modern school, where he showed an aptitude for art and drama, as well as practical subjects including mechanics. As a result of the prolonged hospitalisations, he fell behind his peers scholastically and was ineligible for the 11-plus qualifying examination required for attendance at a grammar school. On 17 April 1953, Starkey's mother married Harry Graves, an ex-Londoner who had moved to Liverpool following the failure of his first marriage. Graves, an impassioned fan of big band music and their vocalists, introduced Starkey to recordings by Dinah Shore, Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels. Graves stated that he and \"Ritchie\" never had an unpleasant exchange between them; Starkey later commented: \"He was great ... I learned gentleness from Harry.\" After the extended hospital stay following Starkey's recovery from tuberculosis, he did not return to school, preferring instead to stay at home and listen to music while playing along by beating biscuit tins with sticks.\n\nBeatles biographer Bob Spitz described Starkey's upbringing as \"a Dickensian chronicle of misfortune\". Houses in the area were \"poorly ventilated, postage-stamp-sized ... patched together by crumbling plaster walls, with a rear door that opened onto an outhouse.\" Crawford commented: \"Like all of the families who lived in the Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive.\" The children who lived there spent much of their time at Princes Park, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood. Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in one of the oldest and poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool. Starkey later commented: \"You kept your head down, your eyes open, and you didn't get in anybody's way.\"\n\nAfter his return home from the sanatorium in late 1955, Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation and discipline; his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful. In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a railway worker's job, which came with an employer-issued suit. He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and, unable to pass the physical examination, he was laid off and granted unemployment benefits. He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the Royal Navy the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work. In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music. Trafford introduced Starkey to skiffle, and he quickly became a fervent admirer.\n\nSoon after Trafford piqued Starkey's interest in skiffle, the two began rehearsing songs in the manufacturing plant's cellar during their lunch breaks. Trafford recalled: \"I played a guitar, and [Ritchie] just made a noise on a box ... Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged on the backs of chairs.\" The pair were joined by Starkey's neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark. The band performed popular skiffle songs such as \"Rock Island Line\" and \"Walking Cane\", with Starkey raking a thimble across a washboard, creating primitive, driving rhythms. Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools. Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town.\n\nOn Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a second-hand drum kit consisting of a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, who went on to book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.\n\nIn November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell's Texans, a skiffle group who were looking for someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could transition from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band. They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey. About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country and western influence. His drum solos were billed as \"Starr Time\".\n\nBy early 1960 the Hurricanes had become one of Liverpool's leading bands. In May, they were offered a three-month residency at a Butlins holiday camp in Wales. Although initially reluctant to accept the residency and end his five-year machinist apprenticeship that he had begun four years earlier, Starr eventually agreed to the arrangement. The Butlins gig led to other opportunities for the band, including an unpleasant tour of US Air Force bases in France about which Starr commented: \"The French don't like the British; at least I didn't like them.\" The Hurricanes became so successful that when initially offered a highly coveted residency in Hamburg, they turned it down because of their prior commitment with Butlins. They eventually accepted, joining the Beatles at Bruno Koschmiders Kaiserkeller on 1 October 1960, where Starr first met the band. Storm's Hurricanes were given top-billing over the Beatles, who also received less pay. Starr performed with the Beatles during a few stand-in engagements while in Hamburg. On 15 October 1960, he drummed with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, recording with them for the first time while backing Hurricanes singer Lu Walters on the George Gershwin/DuBose Heyward aria \"Summertime\". During Starr's first stay in Hamburg he also met Tony Sheridan, who valued his drumming abilities to the point of asking Starr to leave the Hurricanes and join his band.\n\nStarr quit Rory Storm and the Hurricanes in January 1962 and briefly joined Sheridan in Hamburg before returning to the Hurricanes for a third season at Butlins. On 14 August, Lennon asked Starr to join the Beatles; he accepted. On 16 August, Beatles manager Brian Epstein fired their drummer, Pete Best, who recalled: \"He said 'I've got some bad news for you. The boys want you out and Ringo in.' He said [Beatles producer] George Martin wasn't too pleased with my playing [and] the boys thought I didn't fit in.\" Starr first performed as a member of the band on 18 August 1962, at a horticultural society dance at Port Sunlight. After his appearance at the Cavern Club the following day, Best fans, upset by his firing, held vigils outside his house and at the club shouting \"Pete forever! Ringo never!\" Harrison received a black eye from one of the upset fans, and Epstein, whose car tyres they had flattened in anger, temporarily hired a bodyguard to ensure his safety.\n\nStarr's first recording session as a member of the Beatles took place on 4 September 1962. He stated that Martin had thought that he \"was crazy and couldn't play ... because I was trying to play the percussion and the drums at the same time, we were just a four piece band\". For their second recording session with Starr, which took place on 11 September 1962, Martin replaced him with session drummer Andy White while recording takes for what would be the two sides of the Beatles' first single, \"Love Me Do\", backed with \"P.S. I Love You\". Starr played tambourine on \"Love Me Do\" and maracas on \"P.S. I Love You\". Concerned about his status in the Beatles, he thought: \"That's the end, they're doing a Pete Best on me.\" Martin later clarified: \"I simply didn't know what Ringo was like and I wasn't prepared to take any risks.\"\n\nBy November 1962 Starr had been accepted by Beatles fans, who were now calling for him to sing songs. Soon afterwards, he began receiving an amount of fan mail equal to that of the others, which helped to secure his position within the band. Starr considered himself fortunate to be on the same \"wavelength\" as the other Beatles: \"I had to be, or I wouldn't have lasted. I had to join them as people [\"sic\"] as well as [as] a drummer.\" He was given a small percentage of Lennon and McCartney's publishing company, Northern Songs, but he derived his primary income during this period from a one-quarter share of Beatles Ltd, a corporation financed by the band's net concert earnings. He commented on the nature of his lifestyle after having achieved success with the Beatles: \"I lived in nightclubs for three years. It used to be a non-stop party.\" Like his father Starr became well known for his late-night dancing and he received considerable praise for his skills.\n\nDuring 1963, the Beatles enjoyed increasing popularity in Britain. In January, their second single, \"Please Please Me\", followed \"Love Me Do\" into the UK charts and a successful television appearance on \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" earned them favourable reviews, leading to a boost in sales and radio play. By the end of the year, the phenomenon known as Beatlemania had spread throughout the country, and by February 1964 the Beatles had become an international success, performing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" to a record 73 million viewers. Starr commented: \"In the States I know I went over well. It knocked me out to see and hear the kids waving for me. I'd made it as a personality ... Our appeal ... is that we're ordinary lads.\" He was a source of inspiration for several songs written at the time, including Penny Valentine's \"I Want to Kiss Ringo Goodbye\" and Rolf Harris's \"Ringo for President\". In 1964, \"I love Ringo\" lapel pins outsold all other Beatles merchandising. Furthermore, Starr's insistence on prominently placing the logo of the company that made his prize American import drum kit, Ludwig Drums, on his bass drum gave it such a burst of publicity that the company became a dominant manufacturer of drums for twenty years.\nDuring live performances, the Beatles continued the \"Starr Time\" routine that had been popular among his fans: Lennon would place a microphone in front of Starr's kit in preparation for his spotlight moment and audiences would erupt in screams. When the Beatles made their film debut in \"A Hard Day's Night\", Starr garnered much praise from critics, who considered both his delivery of deadpan one-liners and his non-speaking scenes highlights of the movie. The extended non-speaking sequences had to be arranged by director Richard Lester because of Starr's lack of sleep the previous night, Starr commented: \"Because I'd been drinking all night I was incapable of saying a line.\" Epstein attributed Starr's acclaim to \"the little man's quaintness\". After the release of the Beatles' second feature film, \"Help!\" (1965), Starr won a \"Melody Maker\" poll against his fellow Beatles for his performance as the central character in the film.\n\nDuring an interview with \"Playboy\" in 1964, Lennon explained that Starr had filled in with the Beatles when Best was ill; Starr replied: \"[Best] took little pills to make him ill\". Soon after Starr made the comment, a provoked Best filed a libel suit against him that lasted for four years before the court reached an undisclosed settlement in Best's favour. In June, the Beatles were scheduled to tour Denmark, the Netherlands, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, but Starr became ill the day before the start of the tour. Stricken with a high-grade fever, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, he was admitted to a local hospital where he briefly stayed followed by several days of recuperation at home. During this time, Starr was temporarily replaced for five concert dates by 24-year-old session drummer Jimmie Nicol. Starr was discharged from the hospital, and he rejoined the band in Melbourne on 15 June. He later admitted that he feared he would be permanently replaced during his illness. In August, when the Beatles were introduced to Bob Dylan, Starr was the first to try a cannabis cigarette offered to the band by Dylan, whereas Lennon, McCartney and Harrison were hesitant.\n\nOn 11 February 1965, Starr married Maureen Cox, whom he had first met in 1962. By this time the stress and pressure that went along with Beatlemania had reached a peak for him. He received a telephoned death threat before a show in Montreal, and resorted to positioning his cymbals vertically in an attempt to provide protection from would-be assassins. The constant pressure of the Beatles' fame affected their live performances; Starr commented: \"We were turning into such bad musicians ... there was no groove to it.\" He was also feeling increasingly isolated from the musical activities of his bandmates, who were moving past the traditional boundaries of rock music into territory that often did not require his accompaniment; during recording sessions he spent countless hours playing cards with their road manager Neil Aspinall and roadie Mal Evans while the other Beatles perfected tracks without him. In a letter published in \"Melody Maker\", a fan asked the Beatles to let Starr sing more; he replied: \"[I am] quite happy with my one little track on each album\".\n\nIn August 1966, the Beatles released \"Revolver\", their seventh UK LP. The album included the song \"Yellow Submarine\", which was the only British number one single with Starr as the lead singer. Later that month and owing to the increasing pressures of touring, the Beatles gave their final concert, a 30-minute performance at San Francisco Candlestick Park. Starr commented: \"We gave up touring at the right time. Four years of Beatlemania were enough for anyone.\" By December, he had moved into an upscale estate on three acres in Saint George's Hill called Sunny Heights. Although he had equipped the house with many luxury items, including numerous televisions, light machines, film projectors and stereo equipment, a billiard table, go-kart track and a bar named the Flying Cow, he did not include a drum kit; he explained: \"When we don't record, I don't play\".\n\nFor the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney composition \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". Although the Beatles had enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success with \"Sgt. Pepper\", the long hours they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: \"[It] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but for me it was a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play.\" His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: \"I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar\".\n\nEpstein's death in August 1967 left the Beatles without management; Starr remarked: \"[It was] a strange time for us, when it's someone who we've relied on in the business, where we never got involved.\" Soon afterwards, the band began an ill-fated film project, \"Magical Mystery Tour\". Starr's growing interest in photography at the time led to his billing as the movie's Director of Photography, and his participation in the film's editing was matched only by McCartney.\n\nIn February 1968, Starr became the first Beatle to sing on another artist's show without the other three present. He sang the Buck Owens hit \"Act Naturally\", and performed a duet with Cilla Black, \"Do You Like Me Just a Little Bit?\" on her BBC One television programme, \"Cilla\". Later that year Apple Records released \"The Beatles\", commonly known as the \"White Album\". Creative inspiration for the double LP came in part from the band's recent interactions with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. While attending an intermediate course at his ashram in Rishikesh, India, they enjoyed one of their most prolific writing periods, composing most of the album's songs there. Starr left after 10 days, but completed his first recorded Beatles song, \"Don't Pass Me By\". During the recording of the White Album, relations within the band became openly divisive. As the sessions progressed, their collective group dynamic began to decay; at times only one or two Beatles were involved in the recording for a track. Starr had grown weary of McCartney's increasingly overbearing approach and Lennon's passive-aggressive behaviour, which was exacerbated by Starr's resentment of Yoko Ono near-constant presence. After one particularly difficult session during which McCartney had harshly criticised his drumming, Starr quit the band for two weeks, taking a holiday with his family in Sardinia on a boat loaned by Peter Sellers. During a lunch break the chef served octopus, which Starr refused to eat. A subsequent conversation with the ship's captain regarding the behaviours of the animal served as the inspiration for his \"Abbey Road\" composition, \"Octopus's Garden\", which Starr wrote on guitar during the trip. He returned to the studio two weeks later, to find that Harrison had covered his drum kit in flowers as a welcome-back gesture.\n\nDespite a temporary return to congenial relations during the completion of the White Album, production of the Beatles' fourth feature film, \"Let It Be\", and its accompanying LP, strained the already tenuous cohesion within the band. On 20 August 1969, the Beatles gathered for the final time at Abbey Road Studios for a mixing session for \"I Want You\". At a business meeting on 20 September, Lennon told the others that he had quit the Beatles, although the band's break-up would not become public knowledge until McCartney's announcement on 10 April 1970 that he was leaving the Beatles.\n\nShortly before McCartney's announcement in April 1970, he and Starr fell out due to McCartney's refusal to cede the release date of his eponymous solo album to allow for Starr's debut, \"Sentimental Journey\", and the Beatles' \"Let It Be\". Starr's album – composed of renditions of pre-rock standards that included musical arrangements by Quincy Jones, Maurice Gibb, George Martin and McCartney – peaked at number seven in the UK and number 22 in the US. Starr followed \"Sentimental Journey\" with the country-inspired \"Beaucoups of Blues\", engineered by Scotty Moore and featuring renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake. Despite receiving some favourable reviews, the album failed to meet with commercial success. Starr subsequently combined his musical activities with developing a career as a film actor.\n\nStarr played drums on Lennon's \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" (1970), Ono's \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" (1970), and on Harrison's albums \"All Things Must Pass\" (1970), \"Living in the Material World\" (1973) and \"Dark Horse\" (1974). In 1971, Starr participated in the Concert for Bangladesh, organised by Harrison, and with him co-wrote the hit single \"It Don't Come Easy\", which reached number four in both the US and the UK. The following year he released his most successful UK hit, \"Back Off Boogaloo\" (again produced and co-written by Harrison), which peaked at number two (US number nine). Having become friends with the English singer Marc Bolan, Starr made his directorial debut with the 1972 T. Rex documentary \"Born to Boogie\".\n\nIn 1973, Starr earned two number one hits in the US: \"Photograph\", a UK number eight hit that he co-wrote with Harrison, and \"You're Sixteen\", written by the Sherman Brothers. Starr's third million-selling single, \"You're Sixteen\" was released in the UK in February 1974 where it peaked at number four in the charts. Both songs appeared on Starr's debut rock album, \"Ringo\", which was produced by Richard Perry and featured writing and musical contributions from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. A commercial and critical success, the LP also included \"Oh My My\", a US number five. The album reached number seven in the UK and number two in the US. Author Peter Doggett describes \"Ringo\" as a template for Starr's solo career, saying that, as a musician first rather than a songwriter, \"he would rely on his friends and his charm, and if both were on tap, then the results were usually appealing.\"\n\n\"Goodnight Vienna\" followed in 1974 and was also successful, reaching number eight in the US and number 30 in the UK. Featuring musical contributions from Lennon, Elton John and Harry Nilsson, the album included a cover of the Platters' \"Only You (And You Alone)\", which peaked at number six in the US and number 28 in the UK, and Hoyt Axton's \"No No Song\", which was a US number three and Starr's seventh consecutive top-ten hit. The John-written \"Snookeroo\" failed to chart in the UK, however, when issued there as the second single from the album. During this period Starr became romantically involved with Lynsey de Paul. He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for Vera Lynn, \"Don't You Remember When\", and he inspired another De Paul song, \"If I Don't Get You the Next One Will\", which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because he was asleep in his office.\n\nStarr founded the record label Ring O' Records in 1975. The company signed eleven artists and released fifteen singles and five albums between 1975 and 1978, including works by David Hentschel, Graham Bonnet and Rab Noakes. The commercial impact of Starr's own career diminished over the same period, however, although he continued to record and remained a familiar celebrity presence. Speaking in 2001, he attributed this downward turn to his \"[not] taking enough interest\" in music, saying of himself and friends such as Nilsson and Keith Moon: \"We weren't musicians dabbling in drugs and alcohol; now we were junkies dabbling in music.\" Starr, Nilsson and Moon were members of a drinking club, the Hollywood Vampires.\n\nIn November 1976 Starr appeared as a guest at the Band's farewell concert, featured in the 1978 Martin Scorsese documentary \"The Last Waltz\". Also in 1976, Starr issued \"Ringo's Rotogravure\", the first release under his new contract with Atlantic Records for the North American market and Polydor for all other territories. The album was produced by Arif Mardin and featured compositions by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Starr promoted the release heavily, yet \"Rotogravure\" and its accompanying singles failed to chart in the UK. In America, the LP produced two minor hits, \"A Dose of Rock 'n' Roll\" (number 26) and a cover of \"Hey! Baby\" (number 74), and achieved moderate sales, reaching a chart position of 28. Its disappointing performance inspired Atlantic to revamp Starr's formula; the result was a curious blend of disco and 1970s pop, titled \"Ringo the 4th\" (1977). The album was a commercial disaster, failing to chart in the UK and peaking at number 162 in the US. In 1978 Starr released \"Bad Boy\", which reached a disappointing number 129 in the US and again failed to place on the UK albums chart.\n\nFollowing Lennon's murder in December 1980, Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had originally written for Starr, \"All Those Years Ago\", as a tribute to their former bandmate. Released as a Harrison single in 1981, the track, which included Starr's drum part and overdubbed backing vocals by Paul and Linda McCartney, peaked at number two in the US charts and number 13 in the UK. Later that year, Starr released \"Stop and Smell the Roses\", featuring songs produced by Nilsson, McCartney, Harrison, Ronnie Wood and Stephen Stills. The album's lead single, the Harrison-composed \"Wrack My Brain\", reached number 38 in the US charts, but failed to chart in the UK. Lennon had offered a pair of songs for inclusion on the album – \"Nobody Told Me\" and \"Life Begins at 40\" – but following his death, Starr did not feel comfortable recording them. Soon after the murder, Starr and his girlfriend Barbara Bach flew to New York City to be with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono.\n\nFollowing \"Stop and Smell the Roses\", Starr's recording projects were beset with problems. After completing \"Old Wave\" in 1982 with producer Joe Walsh, he was unable to find a record company willing to release the album in the UK or the US. In 1987, he abandoned sessions in Memphis for a planned country album, produced by Chips Moman, after which Moman was blocked by a court injunction from issuing the recordings. Starr nevertheless maintained a high public profile through his narration over 1984–86 of the popular children's series \"Thomas & Friends\", a Britt Allcroft production based on the books by the Reverend W. Awdry. For a single season in 1989, Starr also portrayed the character Mr. Conductor in the programme's American spin-off, \"Shining Time Station\".\n\nIn 1985, Starr performed with his son Zak as part of Artists United Against Apartheid on the recording \"Sun City\", and, with Harrison and Eric Clapton, was among the special guests on Carl Perkins' TV special \"\". In 1987, he played drums on Harrison's Beatles pastiche \"When We Was Fab\" and also appeared in Godley & Creme's innovative video clip for the song. The same year, Starr joined Harrison, Clapton, Jeff Lynne and Elton John in a performance at London's Wembley Arena for the Prince's Trust charity. In January 1988, he attended the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in New York, with Harrison and Ono (the latter representing Lennon), to accept the Beatles' induction into the Hall of Fame.\n\nDuring October and November 1988, Starr and Bach attended a detox clinic in Tucson, Arizona, each receiving a six-week treatment for alcoholism. He later commented on his longstanding addiction: \"Years I've lost, absolute years … I've no idea what happened. I lived in a blackout.\" Having embraced sobriety, Starr focused on re-establishing his career by making a return to touring. On 23 July 1989, Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band gave their first performance to an audience of ten thousand in Dallas, Texas. Setting a pattern that would continue over the following decades, the band consisted of Starr and an assortment of musicians who had been successful in their own right with popular songs at different times. The concerts interchanged Starr's singing, including selections of his Beatles and solo songs, with performances of each of the other artists' well-known material, the latter incorporating either Starr or another musician as drummer.\n\nThe first All-Starr excursion led to the release of \"Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band\" (1990), a compilation of live performances from the 1989 tour. Also in 1990, Starr recorded a version of the song \"I Call Your Name\" for a television special marking the 10th anniversary of John Lennon's death and the 50th anniversary of Lennon's birth. The track, produced by Lynne, features a supergroup composed of Lynne, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh and Jim Keltner.\n\nThe following year, Starr made a cameo appearance on \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Brush with Greatness\" and contributed an original song, \"You Never Know\", to the soundtrack of the John Hughes film \"Curly Sue\". In 1992, Starr released his first studio album in nine years, \"Time Takes Time\", which was produced by Phil Ramone, Don Was, Lynne and Peter Asher and featured guest appearances by various stars including Brian Wilson and Harry Nilsson. The album failed to achieve commercial success, although the single \"Weight of the World\" peaked at number 74 in the UK, marking Starr's first appearance on the singles chart there since \"Only You\" in 1974.\n\nIn 1994, Starr began a collaboration with the surviving former Beatles for the \"Beatles Anthology\" project. They recorded two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon and gave lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career. Released in December 1995, \"Free as a Bird\" was the first new Beatles single since 1970. In March 1996, they released a second single, \"Real Love\". The temporary reunion ended when Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song. Starr then played drums on McCartney's 1997 album \"Flaming Pie\". Among the tracks to which he contributed, \"Little Willow\" was a song McCartney wrote about Starr's ex-wife Maureen, who died in 1994, while \"Really Love You\" was the first official release ever credited to McCartney–Starkey.\n\nIn 1998, Starr released two albums on the Mercury label. The studio album \"Vertical Man\" marked the beginning of a nine-year partnership with Mark Hudson, who produced the album and, with his band the Roundheads, formed the core of the backing group on the recordings. In addition, many famous guests joined on various tracks, including Martin, Petty, McCartney and, in his final appearance on a Starr album, Harrison. Most of the songs were written by Starr and the band. Joe Walsh and the Roundheads joined Starr for his appearance on \"VH1 Storytellers\", which was released as an album under the same name. During the show, he performed greatest hits and new songs and told anecdotes relating to them. Starr's final release for Mercury was the 1999 Christmas-themed \"I Wanna Be Santa Claus\". The album was a commercial failure, although the record company chose not to issue it in Britain.\n\nStarr was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2002, joining an elite group including Buddy Rich, William F. Ludwig Sr. and William F. Ludwig Jr. On 29 November 2002 (the first anniversary of Harrison's death), he performed \"Photograph\" and a cover of Carl Perkins' \"Honey Don't\" at the \"Concert for George\" held in the Royal Albert Hall, London. Early the following year, Starr released the album \"Ringo Rama\", which contained a song he co-wrote as a tribute to Harrison, \"Never Without You\". Also in 2003, Starr formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson. The label was not prolific, but their first signing was Liam Lynch, who produced a 2003 LP entitled \"Fake Songs\".\n\nStarr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas's annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program. According to NORAD officials, he was \"a Starr in the east\" who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa-tracking tradition.\n\nStarr's 2005 release \"Choose Love\" eschewed the star-guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US. That same year, Liverpool's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr's birthplace, 9Madryn Street, stating that it had \"no historical significance\". The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.\n\nStarr released the album \"Liverpool 8\" in January 2008, coinciding with the start of Liverpool's year as the European Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart.<ref name=\"Erlewine/Liverpool8\"></ref> Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool's appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth. Later that year, he was the object of further criticism in the press for posting a video on his website in which he harangued fans and autograph hunters for sending him items to sign.\n\nIn April 2009, Starr reunited with McCartney at the David Lynch Foundation's \"Change Begins Within\" benefit concert, held at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Having played his own set beforehand, Starr joined McCartney for the finale and performed \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", among other songs. Starr also appeared on-stage during Microsoft's June 2009 E3 press conference with Yoko Ono, McCartney and Olivia Harrison to promote \"\" video game. In November 2009, Starr once again performed the voice of Thomas the Tank Engine for \"The Official BBC Children in Need Medley\".\n\nIn 2010 Starr self-produced and released his fifteenth studio album, \"Y Not\", which included the track \"Walk with You\" and featured a vocal contribution from McCartney. Later that year, he appeared during \"\" as a celebrity phone operator. On 7 July 2010, Starr celebrated his 70th birthday at Radio City Music Hall with another All-Starr Band concert, topped with friends and family joining him on stage including Ono, his son Zak, and McCartney.\n\nStarr recorded a cover of Buddy Holly's \"Think It Over\" for the 2011 tribute album \"\". In January 2012, he released the album \"Ringo 2012\". Later that year, Starr announced that his All-Starr Band would tour the Pacific Rim during 2013 with select dates in New Zealand, Australia and Japan; it was his first performance in Japan since 1996, and his debut in both New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIn January 2014, Starr joined McCartney for a special performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, where they performed the song \"Queenie Eye\". That summer Starr toured Canada and the US with an updated version of the Twelfth All-Starr Band, featuring multi-instrumentalist Warren Ham instead of saxophonist Mark Rivera. In July, Starr became involved in \"#peacerocks\", an anti-violence campaign started by fashion designer John Varvatos, in conjunction with the David Lynch Foundation.<ref name=\"instyle7/14\"></ref> In September 2014, Starr won at the \"GQ\" Men of the Year Awards for his humanitarian work with the David Lynch Foundation.\n\nIn January 2015, Starr tweeted the title of his new 11-track studio album, \"Postcards from Paradise\". The album came just weeks in advance of Starr's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and was released on 31 March 2015 to mixed to positive reviews. Later that month, Ringo and his band announced a forthcoming Summer 2016 Tour of the US. Full production began in June 2016 in Syracuse.\n\nOn 7 July 2017 (his 77th birthday), he released a new single entitled \"Give More Love,\" followed by, on 15 September 2017 (by UM), his nineteenth studio album also entitled \"Give More Love\". The album features appearances by Starr's former Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney, as well as frequent collaborators such as Joe Walsh, Dave Stewart, Gary Nicholson, and members of the All-Starr Band.\n\nDuring his youth, Starr had been a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music, but by the time he joined the Texans in 1958, he had developed a preference for rock and roll. He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz artists such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves. While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: \"He does things with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone I talk to says 'What about Buddy Rich?' Well, what about him? Because he doesn't turn me on.\" He stated that he \"was never really into drummers\", but identified Cozy Cole 1958 cover of Benny Goodman \"Topsy Part Two\" as \"the one drum record\" he bought.\n\nStarr's first musical hero was Gene Autry, about whom he commented: \"I remember getting shivers up my back when he sang, 'South of the Border'\". By the early 1960s he had become an ardent fan of Lee Dorsey. In November 1964, Starr told \"Melody Maker\": \"Our music is second-hand versions of negro music ... Ninety per cent of the music I like is coloured.\"\n\nThe overall effect of Starr's drumming for the Beatles has received high praise from notable drummers. Starr commented: \"I'm no good on the technical things ... I'm your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills ... because I'm really left-handed playing a right-handed kit. I can't roll around the drums because of that.\" Beatles producer George Martin stated: \"Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn't do a roll to save his life\", although Martin later added, \"He's got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support – that rock-solid back-beat – that made the recording of all the Beatles' songs that much easier.\" Starr commented: \"I've always believed that the drummer is not there to interpret the song\"; comparing his drumming to painting, he stated: \"I am the foundation, and then I put a bit of glow here and there ... If there's a gap, I want to be good enough to fill it.\"\n\nIn 2011, readers of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine voted Starr as the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. Journalist Robyn Flans, writing for the Percussive Arts Society, stated: \"I cannot count the number of drummers who have told me that Ringo inspired their passion for drums\". Drummer Steve Smith commented on Starr's musical contribution:\n\nStarr has said that his favourite drummer is Jim Keltner, with whom he first played at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. The pair subsequently played together as a double-drumming team on some of Harrison's recordings during the 1970s, on \"Ringo\" and other albums by Starr, and on the early All-Starr Band tours. For \"Ringo's Rotogravure\" in 1976, Starr coined a term to describe their percussive combination, crediting himself as \"Thunder\" and Keltner as \"Lightnin'\".\n\nStarr influenced Phil Collins, the drummer for Genesis, who said: \"I think he's vastly underrated, Ringo. The drum fills on 'A Day in the Life' are very, very complex things. You could take a great drummer from today and say, 'I want it like that', and they really wouldn't know what to do.\" In September 1980, Lennon told \"Rolling Stone\":\n\nIn his extensive survey of the Beatles' recording sessions, historian Mark Lewisohn confirmed that Starr was both proficient and remarkably reliable and consistent. According to Lewisohn, there were fewer than a dozen occasions in the Beatles' eight-year recording career where session breakdowns were caused by Starr making a mistake, while the vast majority of takes were stopped owing to mistakes by the other three Beatles. Starr is considered to have influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings, as well as placing the drums on high risers for visibility as part of the band. According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall, co-authors of \"Classic Rock Drummers\": \"Ringo's fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers.\"\n\nStarr sang lead vocals for a song on most of the Beatles' studio albums as part of an attempt to establish a vocal personality for each band member. In many cases, Lennon or McCartney wrote the lyrics and melody especially for him, as they did for \"Yellow Submarine\" from \"Revolver\" and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" on \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". These melodies were tailored to Starr's limited baritone vocal range. Because of his distinctive voice, Starr rarely performed backing vocals during his time with the Beatles, but they can be heard on songs such as \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" and \"Carry That Weight\". He is also the lead vocalist on his compositions \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\". In addition, he sang lead on \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", \"Boys\", \"Matchbox\", \"Honey Don't\", \"Act Naturally\", \"Good Night\" and \"What Goes On\".\n\nStarr's idiosyncratic turns of phrase, or \"Ringoisms\" as they became known, such as \"a hard day's night\" and \"tomorrow never knows\", were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon. McCartney commented: \"Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic\". As well as inspiring his bandmates' creativity in this way, Starr occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon–McCartney songs, such as the line \"darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there\" from \"Eleanor Rigby\".\n\nStarr is credited as the sole composer of two Beatles songs: \"Octopus's Garden\" and \"Don't Pass Me By\". Starr is credited as a co-writer of \"What Goes On\", \"Flying\" and \"Dig It\". On material issued after the break-up, Starr received a writing credit for \"Taking a Trip to Carolina\" and received joint songwriting credits with the other three Beatles for \"12-Bar Original\", \"Los Paranoias\", \"Christmas Time (Is Here Again)\", \"Suzy Parker\", heard in the \"Let It Be\" film, and \"Jessie's Dream\" from the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" film.\n\nWhen Starr married Maureen Cox in 1965, Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best man, with Starr's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison as witnesses. Soon afterwards, the couple's matrimony became the subject of a US novelty song, \"Treat Him Tender, Maureen\", by the Chicklettes. Starr and Maureen had three children together: Zak (born 13 September 1965), Jason (born 19 August 1967) and Lee (born 11 November 1970). In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's former home, Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there. Following Starr's repeated infidelities, the couple divorced in 1975. Maureen died from leukaemia at age 48 in 1994.\n\nIn 1980, while on the set of the film \"Caveman\", Starr met actress Barbara Bach; they were married on 27 April 1981. In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak Starkey is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with The Who's Keith Moon. Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. In total, Ringo Starr has seven grandchildren – one from Zak, three from Jason and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather.\n\nStarr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh, Surrey; Los Angeles; and Monte Carlo. In the \"Sunday Times Rich List 2011\", Starr was listed at number 56 in the UK with an estimated personal wealth of £150 million. In 2012, Starr was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world. In 2014 Starr announced that his 200-acre Surrey estate at Rydinghurst, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house, was for sale. However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King's Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles.\n\nIn December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items to the public via Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Julien/Property\"></ref> Highlights of the collection included Starr's first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit; instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon and Marc Bolan; and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles' White Album numbered \"0000001\". The auction raised over $9 million, a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach.\n\nIn 2016, Starr expressed his support for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, explaining: \"I thought the European Union was a great idea, but I didn’t see it going anywhere lately.\" In 2017 he described his impatience for Britain to \"get on with\" Brexit, declaring that \"to be in control of your country is a good move.\"\n\nDuring the 1965 Birthday Honours for Queen Elizabeth II, Starr and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE); they received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. He and the other Beatles were cumulatively nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer for their performances in the 1964 film \"A Hard Day's Night\". In 1971, the Beatles received an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film \"Let It Be\". The minor planet 4150 Starr, discovered on 31 August 1984 by Brian A. Skiff at the Anderson Mesa Station of the Lowell Observatory, was named in Starr's honour. Starr was nominated for a 1989 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Children's Series for his role as Mr. Conductor in the television series \"Shining Time Station\".\n\nIn 2015, twenty-three years after he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the Beatles, Starr became the last Beatle to be inducted for a solo career. During the 50th Grammy Awards, Starr, George Martin and his son Giles accepted the Best Compilation Soundtrack award for \"Love\". On 9 November 2008, Starr accepted a Diamond Award on behalf of the Beatles during the 2008 World Music Awards ceremony in Monaco. On 8 February 2010, he was honoured with the 2,401st star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. It is located at 1750 North Vine Street, in front of the Capitol Records building, as are the stars for Lennon, McCartney and Harrison.\n\nStarr was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music.\n\nStarr has received praise from critics and movie industry professionals regarding his acting; director and producer Walter Shenson called him \"a superb actor, an absolute natural\". By the mid-1960s, Starr had become a connoisseur of film. In addition to his roles in \"A Hard Day's Night\" (1964), \"Help!\" (1965), \"Magical Mystery Tour\" (1967) and \"Let It Be\" (1970), Starr also acted in \"Candy\" (1968), \"The Magic Christian\" (1969), \"Blindman\" (1971), \"Son of Dracula\" (1974) and \"Caveman\" (1981). In 1971, he starred as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa's \"200 Motels\" and was featured in Harry Nilsson's animated film \"The Point!\" He co-starred in \"That'll Be the Day\" (1973) as a Teddy Boy and appeared in \"The Last Waltz\", the Martin Scorsese documentary film about the 1976 farewell concert of the Band.\n\nStarr played the Pope in Ken Russell's \"Lisztomania\" (1975), and a fictionalised version of himself in McCartney's \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" in 1984. Starr appeared as himself and a downtrodden alter-ego Ognir Rrats in \"Ringo\" (1978), an American-made television comedy film based loosely on \"The Prince and the Pauper\". For the 1979 documentary film on the Who, \"The Kids Are Alright\", Starr appeared in interview segments with fellow drummer Keith Moon.\n\nSince the breakup of the Beatles, Starr has released 19 solo studio albums:\n\n\n"

                "The Beatles\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential music band. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\"; as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the band were integral to pop music's evolution into an art form and to the development of the counterculture of the 1960s.\n\nThe Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960, with Stuart Sutcliffe initially serving as bass player. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding the group's popularity in the United Kingdom after their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the next year, and by early 1964 became international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 onwards, the Beatles produced increasingly innovative recordings, including the albums \"Rubber Soul\" (1965), \"Revolver\" (1966), \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1967), \"The Beatles\" (also known as the White Album, 1968) and \"Abbey Road\" (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active. \n\nThe Beatles are the best-selling band in history, with estimated sales of over 800 million physical and digital albums worldwide. They have had more number-one albums on the British charts and sold more singles in the UK than any other act. They are also the best-selling music artists in the United States, with 178 million certified units. In 2008, the group topped \"Billboard\" magazine's list of the all-time most successful artists; , they hold the record for most number-one hits on the Hot 100 chart with twenty. They have received seven Grammy Awards, an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. The group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four main members were inducted individually from 1994 to 2015. They were also collectively included in \"Time\" magazine's compilation of .\n\nIn March 1957, John Lennon, then aged sixteen, formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High School. They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young to join them. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting, arranged by McCartney, he performed the lead guitar part for the instrumental \"Raunchy\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist. By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had recently sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used the name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had changed their name to the Silver Beatles and by the middle of August to the Beatles.\n\nAllan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg, but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired Pete Best in mid-August 1960. The band, now a five-piece, left four days later, contracted to club owner Bruno Koschmider for what would be a 3½-month residency. Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn writes: \"They pulled into Hamburg at dusk on 17 August, the time when the red-light area comes to life ... flashing neon lights screamed out the various entertainment on offer, while scantily clad women sat unabashed in shop windows waiting for business opportunities.\"\n\nKoschmider had converted a couple of strip clubs in the district into music venues, and he initially placed the Beatles at the Indra Club. After closing the Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom in a concrete corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.\n\nDuring the next two years, the Beatles were resident for periods in Hamburg, where they used Preludin both recreationally and to maintain their energy through all-night performances. In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut Sutcliffe's hair in the \"exi\" (existentialist) style, later adopted by the other Beatles. When Sutcliffe decided to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies in Germany, McCartney took up the bass. Producer Bert Kaempfert contracted what was now a four-piece group until June 1962, and he used them as Tony Sheridan's backing band on a series of recordings for Polydor Records. As part of the sessions, the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one year. Credited to \"Tony Sheridan & the Beat Brothers\", the single \"My Bonnie\", recorded in June 1961 and released four months later, reached number 32 on the \"Musikmarkt\" chart.\n\nAfter the Beatles completed their second Hamburg residency, they enjoyed increasing popularity in Liverpool with the growing Merseybeat movement. However, they were also growing tired of the monotony of numerous appearances at the same clubs night after night. In November 1961, during one of the group's frequent performances at The Cavern Club, they encountered Brian Epstein, a local record-store owner and music columnist. He later recalled: \"I immediately liked what I heard. They were fresh, and they were honest, and they had what I thought was a sort of presence ... [a] star quality.\" Epstein courted the band over the next couple of months, and they appointed him as their manager in January 1962. Throughout early and mid-1962, Epstein sought to free the Beatles from their contractual obligations to Bert Kaempfert Productions. He eventually negotiated a one-month-early release from their contract in exchange for one last recording session in Hamburg. Tragedy greeted them on their return to Germany in April, when a distraught Kirchherr met them at the airport with news of Sutcliffe's death the previous day from what would later be determined to have been a brain hemorrhage. Epstein began negotiations with record labels for a recording contract. In order to secure a UK record contract, Epstein negotiated an early end to the band's contract with Polydor, in exchange for more recordings backing Tony Sheridan. After a New Year's Day audition, Decca Records rejected the band with the comment \"Guitar groups are on the way out, Mr. Epstein.\" However, three months later, producer George Martin signed the Beatles to EMI's Parlophone label.\n\nMartin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \"Love Me Do\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \"Love Me Do\", \"Please Please Me\" and \"P.S. I Love You\". Martin initially selected the Starr version of \"Love Me Do\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \"Love Me Do\" peaked at number seventeen on the \"Record Retailer\" chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme \"People and Places\". After Martin suggested rerecording \"Please Please Me\" at a faster tempo, a studio session in late November yielded that recording, of which Martin accurately predicted, \"You've just made your first No.1.\"\n\nIn December 1962, the Beatles concluded their fifth and final Hamburg residency. By 1963, they had agreed that all four band members would contribute vocals to their albums – including Starr, despite his restricted vocal range, to validate his standing in the group. Lennon and McCartney had established a songwriting partnership, and as the band's success grew, their dominant collaboration limited Harrison's opportunities as a lead vocalist. Epstein, in an effort to maximise the Beatles' commercial potential, encouraged them to adopt a professional approach to performing. Lennon recalled him saying, \"Look, if you really want to get in these bigger places, you're going to have to change – stop eating on stage, stop swearing, stop smoking ...\" Lennon said: \"We used to dress how we liked, on and off stage. He'd tell us that jeans were not particularly smart and could we possibly manage to wear proper trousers, but he didn't want us suddenly looking square. He'd let us have our own sense of individuality.\"\n\nOn 11 February 1963, the Beatles recorded ten songs during a single studio session for their debut LP, \"Please Please Me\". The album was supplemented by the four tracks already released on their first two singles. Martin originally considered recording the Beatles' debut LP live at The Cavern Club, but after deciding that the building's acoustics were inadequate, he elected to simulate a \"live\" album with minimal production in \"a single marathon session at Abbey Road\". After the moderate success of \"Love Me Do\", the single \"Please Please Me\" met with a more emphatic reception. Released in January 1963, two months ahead of the album of the same name, the song reached number one on every chart in London except \"Record Retailer\", where it peaked at number two. Recalling how the Beatles \"rushed to deliver a debut album, bashing out \"Please Please Me\" in a day\", AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine comments, \"Decades after its release, the album still sounds fresh, precisely because of its intense origins.\" Lennon said little thought went into composition at the time; he and McCartney were \"just writing songs \"à la\" Everly Brothers, \"à la\" Buddy Holly, pop songs with no more thought of them than that – to create a sound. And the words were almost irrelevant.\"\n\nReleased in March 1963, the album initiated a run during which eleven of their twelve studio albums released in the United Kingdom through 1970 reached number one. The band's third single, \"From Me to You\", came out in April and was also a chart-topping hit, starting an almost unbroken string of seventeen British number-one singles for the Beatles, including all but one of the eighteen they released over the next six years. Issued in August, the band's fourth single, \"She Loves You\", achieved the fastest sales of any record in the UK up to that time, selling three-quarters of a million copies in under four weeks. It became their first single to sell a million copies, and remained the biggest-selling record in the UK until 1978. Their commercial success brought increased media exposure, to which the Beatles responded with an irreverent and comical attitude that defied the expectations of pop musicians at the time, inspiring even more interest. The band toured the UK three times in the first half of the year: a four-week tour that began in February, the Beatles' first nationwide, preceded three-week tours in March and May–June. As their popularity spread, a frenzied adulation of the group took hold. Greeted with riotous enthusiasm by screaming fans, the press dubbed the phenomenon \"Beatlemania\". Although not billed as tour leaders, the Beatles overshadowed American acts Tommy Roe and Chris Montez during the February engagements and assumed top billing \"by audience demand\", something no British act had previously accomplished while touring with artists from the US. A similar situation arose during their May–June tour with Roy Orbison.\n\nIn late October, the Beatles began a five-day tour of Sweden, their first time abroad since the final Hamburg engagement of December 1962. On their return to the UK on 31 October several hundred screaming fans greeted them in heavy rain at Heathrow Airport. Around 50 to 100 journalists and photographers as well as representatives from the BBC also joined the airport reception, the first of more than 100 such events. The next day, the band began its fourth tour of Britain within nine months, this one scheduled for six weeks. In mid-November, as Beatlemania intensified, police resorted to using high-pressure water hoses to control the crowd before a concert in Plymouth.\n\n\"Please Please Me\" maintained the top position on the \"Record Retailer\" chart for 30 weeks, only to be displaced by its follow-up, \"With the Beatles\", which EMI released on 22 November to record advance orders of 270,000 copies. The LP topped a half-million albums sold in one week. Recorded between July and October, \"With the Beatles\" made better use of studio production techniques than its predecessor. It held the top spot for 21 weeks with a chart life of 40 weeks. Erlewine described the LP as \"a sequel of the highest order – one that betters the original\". In a reversal of then standard practice, EMI released the album ahead of the impending single \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\", with the song excluded to maximise the single's sales. The album caught the attention of music critic William Mann of \"The Times\", who suggested that Lennon and McCartney were \"the outstanding English composers of 1963\". The newspaper published a series of articles in which Mann offered detailed analyses of the music, lending it respectability. \"With the Beatles\" became the second album in UK chart history to sell a million copies, a figure previously reached only by the 1958 \"South Pacific\" soundtrack. When writing the sleeve notes for the album, the band's press officer, Tony Barrow, used the superlative the \"fabulous foursome\", which the media widely adopted as \"the Fab Four\".\n\nEMI's American subsidiary, Capitol Records, hindered the Beatles' releases in the United States for more than a year by initially declining to issue their music, including their first three singles. Concurrent negotiations with the independent US label Vee-Jay led to the release of some of the songs in 1963, but not all. Vee-Jay finished preparation for the album \"Introducing... The Beatles\", culled from most of the songs of Parlophone's \"Please Please Me\", but a management shake-up led to the album not being released. Then when it surfaced that the label did not report royalties on their sales, the licence Vee-Jay signed with EMI was voided. A new licence was granted to the Swan label for the single \"She Loves You\". The record received some airplay in the Tidewater area of Virginia by Gene Loving of radio station WGH and was featured on the \"Rate-a-Record\" segment of \"American Bandstand\", but it failed to catch on nationally.\n\nEpstein arranged for a $40,000 US marketing campaign. American chart success began after disc jockey Carroll James of AM radio station WWDC in Washington, DC first played \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" in mid-December 1963. It was not until the end of the first week of January 1964 that their records were played in New York City (also accompanied by a major marketing campaign and with similar play frequency), and then the rest of the country, initiating their music's spread across US radio. This caused an increase in demand, leading Capitol to rush-release \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" later that month. Issued on 26 December 1963, with the band's previously scheduled debut there just weeks away, \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" sold a million copies, becoming a number-one hit in the US by mid-January. In its wake, Vee-Jay released \"Introducing... The Beatles\" to go along with Capitol's debut album, \"Meet the Beatles!\", while Swan reactivated production of \"She Loves You\".\n\nOn 7 February 1964, the Beatles left the United Kingdom with an estimated 4,000 fans gathered at Heathrow, waving and screaming as the aircraft took off. Upon landing at New York's John F. Kennedy Airport, an uproarious crowd estimated at 3,000 greeted them. They gave their first live US television performance two days later on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", watched by approximately 73 million viewers in over 23 million households, or 34 per cent of the American population. Biographer Jonathan Gould writes that, according to the Nielsen rating service, it was \"the largest audience that had ever been recorded for an American television \". The next morning, the Beatles awoke to a negative critical consensus in the US, but a day later their first US concert saw Beatlemania erupt at Washington Coliseum. Back in New York the following day, the Beatles met with another strong reception during two shows at Carnegie Hall. The band then flew to Florida and appeared on the weekly \"Ed Sullivan Show\" a second time, before another 70 million viewers, before returning to the UK on 22 February.\n\nCapitol Records' lack of interest throughout 1963 had not gone unnoticed, and a competitor, United Artists Records, encouraged their film division to offer the group a three-motion-picture deal, primarily for the commercial potential of the soundtracks. Directed by Richard Lester, \"A Hard Day's Night\" involved the band for six weeks in March–April 1964 as they played themselves in a mock-documentary. The film premiered in London and New York in July and August, respectively, and was an international success, with some critics drawing comparison with the Marx Brothers. According to Erlewine, the accompanying soundtrack album, \"A Hard Day's Night\", saw them \"truly coming into their own as a band. All of the disparate influences on their first two albums had coalesced into a bright, joyous, original sound, filled with ringing guitars and irresistible melodies.\" That \"ringing guitar\" sound was primarily the product of Harrison's 12-string electric Rickenbacker, a prototype given to him by the manufacturer, which made its debut on the record.\n\nDuring the week of 4 April 1964, the Beatles held twelve positions on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 singles chart, including the top five. Their popularity generated unprecedented interest in British music, and a number of other UK acts subsequently made their own American debuts, successfully touring over the next three years in what was termed the British Invasion. Their hairstyle, unusually long for the era and mocked by many adults, became an emblem of rebellion to the burgeoning youth culture.\n\nTouring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.\n\nIn August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\": Dylan's audience of \"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\" contrasted with their fans, \"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion. They were seen as idolaters, not idealists.\" Within six months of the meeting, Gould writes, \"Lennon would be making records on which he openly imitated Dylan's nasal drone, brittle strum, and introspective vocal persona\". Within a year, \"the distinctions between the folk and rock audiences would have nearly evaporated [and the group's] audience ... [was] showing signs of growing up.\"\n\nAccording to Gould, \"Beatles for Sale\", the Beatles' fourth studio LP, evidenced a growing conflict between the commercial pressures of their global success and their creative ambitions. They had intended the album, recorded between August and October 1964, to continue the format established by \"A Hard Day's Night\" which, unlike their first two LPs, contained only original songs. They had nearly exhausted their backlog of songs on the previous album, however, and given the challenges constant international touring posed to their songwriting efforts, Lennon admitted, \"Material's becoming a hell of a problem\". As a result, six covers from their extensive repertoire were chosen to complete the album. Released in early December, its eight original compositions stood out, demonstrating the growing maturity of the Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership.\nIn early 1965, while they were his guests for dinner, Lennon and Harrison's dentist secretly added LSD to their coffee. Lennon described the experience: \"It was just terrifying, but it was fantastic. I was pretty stunned for a month or two.\" He and Harrison subsequently became regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one occasion. McCartney was initially reluctant to try it, but eventually did so in late 1966. He became the first Beatle to discuss LSD publicly, declaring in a magazine interview that \"it opened my eyes\" and \"made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society\".\n\nControversy erupted in June 1965 when Queen Elizabeth II appointed all four Beatles Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) after Prime Minister Harold Wilson nominated them for the award. In protest – the honour was at that time primarily bestowed upon military veterans and civic leaders – some conservative MBE recipients returned their own insignia.\n\nReleased in July, the Beatles' second film, \"Help!\", was again directed by Lester. Described as \"mainly a relentless spoof of Bond\", it inspired a mixed response among both reviewers and the band. McCartney said: \"\"Help!\" was great but it wasn't our film – we were sort of guest stars. It was fun, but basically, as an idea for a film, it was a bit wrong.\" The soundtrack was dominated by Lennon, who wrote and sang lead on most of its songs, including the two singles: \"Help!\" and \"Ticket to Ride\". The accompanying album, the group's fifth studio LP, contained all original material save for two covers, \"Act Naturally\" and \"Dizzy Miss Lizzy\"; they were the last covers the band would include on an album, with the exception of \"Let It Be\" brief rendition of the traditional Liverpool folk song \"Maggie Mae\". The band expanded their use of vocal overdubs on \"Help!\" and incorporated classical instruments into some arrangements, including a string quartet on the pop ballad \"Yesterday\". Composed by McCartney, \"Yesterday\" would inspire the most recorded cover versions of any song ever written.\n\nThe group's third US tour opened with a performance before a world-record crowd of 55,600 at New York's Shea Stadium on 15 August 1965 – \"perhaps the most famous of all Beatles' concerts\", in Lewisohn's description. A further nine successful concerts followed in other American cities. At a show in Atlanta, the Beatles gave one of the first live performances ever to make use of a foldback system of on-stage monitor speakers. Towards the end of the tour, they met with Elvis Presley, a foundational musical influence on the band, who invited them to his home in Beverly Hills. September saw the launch of an American Saturday-morning cartoon series, \"The Beatles\", that echoed \"A Hard Day's Night\" slapstick antics over its two-year original run. The series was a historical milestone as the first weekly television series to feature animated versions of real, living people.\n\nIn mid-October 1965, the Beatles entered the recording studio; for the first time when making an album, they had an extended period without other major commitments. Until this time, according to George Martin, \"we had been making albums rather like a collection of singles. Now we were really beginning to think about albums as a bit of art on their own.\" Released in December, \"Rubber Soul\" was hailed by critics as a major step forward in the maturity and complexity of the band's music. Their thematic reach was beginning to expand as they embraced deeper aspects of romance and philosophy. Biographers Peter Brown and Steven Gaines attribute the new musical direction to \"the Beatles' now habitual use of marijuana\", an assertion confirmed by the band – Lennon referred to it as \"the pot album\", and Starr said: \"Grass was really influential in a lot of our changes, especially with the writers. And because they were writing different material, we were playing differently.\" After \"Help!\"s foray into the world of classical music with flutes and strings, Harrison's introduction of a sitar on \"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\" marked a further progression outside the traditional boundaries of popular music. As their lyrics grew more artful, fans began to study them for deeper meaning. Of \"Norwegian Wood\" Lennon commented: \"I was trying to be sophisticated in writing about an affair ... but in such a smokescreen way that you couldn't tell.\"\n\nWhile many of \"Rubber Soul\"s prominent songs were the product of Lennon and McCartney's collaborative songwriting, it also featured distinct compositions from each, though they continued to share official credit. The song \"In My Life\", of which each later claimed lead authorship, is considered a highlight of the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue. Harrison called \"Rubber Soul\" his \"favourite album\" and Starr referred to it as \"the departure record\". McCartney has said, \"We'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand.\" However, recording engineer Norman Smith later stated that the studio sessions revealed signs of growing conflict within the group – \"the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious\", he wrote, and \"as far as Paul was concerned, George could do no right\". In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Rubber Soul\" fifth among \"The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time\", and AllMusic's Richie Unterberger describes it as \"one of the classic folk-rock records\".\n\nCapitol Records, from December 1963 when it began issuing Beatles recordings for the US market, exercised complete control over format, compiling distinct US albums from the band's recordings and issuing songs of their choosing as singles. In June 1966, \"Yesterday and Today\", one of Capitol's compilation albums, caused an uproar with its cover, which portrayed the grinning Beatles dressed in butcher's overalls, accompanied by raw meat and mutilated plastic baby dolls. It has been incorrectly suggested that this was meant as a satirical response to the way Capitol had \"butchered\" the US versions of their albums. Thousands of copies of the LP had a new cover pasted over the original; an unpeeled \"first-state\" copy fetched $10,500 at a December 2005 auction. In England, meanwhile, Harrison met sitar maestro Ravi Shankar, who agreed to train him on the instrument.\n\nDuring a tour of the Philippines the month after the \"Yesterday and Today\" furore, the Beatles unintentionally snubbed the nation's first lady, Imelda Marcos, who had expected them to attend a breakfast reception at the Presidential Palace. When presented with the invitation, Epstein politely declined on the band members' behalf, as it had never been his policy to accept such official invitations. They soon found that the Marcos regime was unaccustomed to taking no for an answer. The resulting riots endangered the group and they escaped the country with difficulty. Immediately afterwards, the band members visited India for the first time.\n\nAlmost as soon as they returned home, the Beatles faced a fierce backlash from US religious and social conservatives (as well as the Ku Klux Klan) over a comment Lennon had made in a March interview with British reporter Maureen Cleave. \"Christianity will go,\" Lennon had said. \"It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I will be proved right. ... Jesus was alright but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.\" The comment went virtually unnoticed in England, but when US teenage fan magazine \"Datebook\" printed it five months later – on the eve of the group's August US tour – it sparked a controversy with Christians in the American \"Bible Belt\". The Vatican issued a protest, and bans on Beatles' records were imposed by Spanish and Dutch stations and South Africa's national broadcasting service. Epstein accused \"Datebook\" of having taken Lennon's words out of context; at a press conference Lennon pointed out, \"If I'd said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it.\" Lennon claimed that he was referring to how other people viewed their success, but at the prompting of reporters, he concluded: \"If you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then okay, I'm sorry.\"\n\nAs preparations were made for the US tour, the Beatles knew that their music would hardly be heard. Having originally used Vox AC30 amplifiers, they later acquired more powerful 100-watt amplifiers, specially designed by Vox for them as they moved into larger venues in 1964, but these were still inadequate. Struggling to compete with the volume of sound generated by screaming fans, the band had grown increasingly bored with the routine of performing live. Recognising that their shows were no longer about the music, they decided to make the August tour their last.\n\n\"Rubber Soul\" had marked a major step forward; \"Revolver\", released in August 1966 a week before the Beatles' final tour, marked another. \"Pitchfork\"s Scott Plagenhoef identifies it as \"the sound of a band growing into supreme confidence\" and \"redefining what was expected from popular music\". \"Revolver\" featured sophisticated songwriting, studio experimentation, and a greatly expanded repertoire of musical styles, ranging from innovative classical string arrangements to psychedelic rock. Abandoning the customary group photograph, its cover – designed by Klaus Voormann, a friend of the band since their Hamburg days – \"was a stark, arty, black-and-white collage that caricatured the Beatles in a pen-and-ink style beholden to Aubrey Beardsley\", in Gould's description. The album was preceded by the single \"Paperback Writer\", backed by \"Rain\". Short promotional films were made for both songs; described by cultural historian Saul Austerlitz as \"among the first true music videos\", they aired on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and \"Top of the Pops\" in June 1966.\n\nAmong the experimental songs that \"Revolver\" featured was \"Tomorrow Never Knows\", the lyrics for which Lennon drew from Timothy Leary's \"\". Its creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the EMI building, each staffed by an engineer or band member, who randomly varied the movement of a tape loop while Martin created a composite recording by sampling the incoming data. McCartney's \"Eleanor Rigby\" made prominent use of a string octet; Gould describes it as \"a true hybrid, conforming to no recognisable style or genre of song\". Harrison was developing as a songwriter, and three of his compositions earned a place on the record. In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked \"Revolver\" as the third greatest album of all time. During the US tour that followed its release, however, the band performed none of its songs. As Chris Ingham writes, they were very much \"studio creations ... and there was no way a four-piece rock 'n' roll group could do them justice, particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans' screams. 'Live Beatles' and 'Studio Beatles' had become entirely different beasts.\" The band's final concert at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on 29 August was their last commercial concert. It marked the end of a four-year period dominated by almost nonstop touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally.\n\nFreed from the burden of touring, the Beatles embraced an increasingly experimental approach as they recorded \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", beginning in late November 1966. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, the album's recording took over 700 hours. He recalled the band's insistence \"that everything on \"Sgt. Pepper\" had to be different. We had microphones right down in the bells of brass instruments and headphones turned into microphones attached to violins. We used giant primitive oscillators to vary the speed of instruments and vocals and we had tapes chopped to pieces and stuck together upside down and the wrong way around.\" Parts of \"A Day in the Life\" featured a 40-piece orchestra. The sessions initially yielded the non-album double A-side single \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"/\"Penny Lane\" in February 1967; the \"Sgt. Pepper\" LP followed in June. The musical complexity of the records, created using relatively primitive four-track recording technology, astounded contemporary artists. Among music critics, acclaim for the album was virtually universal. Gould writes:\n\n\"Sgt. Pepper\" was the first major pop/rock LP to include its complete lyrics, which appeared on the back cover. Those lyrics were the subject of critical analysis; for instance, in late 1967 the album was the subject of a scholarly inquiry by American literary critic and professor of English Richard Poirier, who observed that his students were \"listening to the group's music with a degree of engagement that he, as a teacher of literature, could only envy\". Poirier identified what he termed its \"mixed allusiveness\": \"It's unwise ever to assume that they're doing only one thing or expressing themselves in only one style ... one kind of feeling about a subject isn't enough ... any single induced feeling must often exist within the context of seemingly contradictory alternatives.\" McCartney said at the time: \"We write songs. We know what we mean by them. But in a week someone else says something about it, and you can't deny it. ... You put your own meaning at your own level to our songs.\" The album's elaborate cover also attracted considerable interest and study. A collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, it depicted the group as the fictional band referred to in the album's title track standing in front of a crowd of famous people. The heavy moustaches worn by the group reflected the growing influence of hippie style, while cultural historian Jonathan Harris describes their \"brightly coloured parodies of military uniforms\" as a knowingly \"anti-authoritarian and anti-establishment\" display. In 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it number one on its list of the \"500 Greatest Albums of All Time\".\n\nOn 25 June 1967, the Beatles performed their forthcoming single, \"All You Need Is Love\", to an estimated 350 million viewers on \"Our World\", the first live global television link. Released a week later, during the Summer of Love, the song was adopted as a flower power anthem. Two months later, the group suffered a loss that threw their career into turmoil. Having been introduced to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi only the previous night in London, on 25 August they travelled to Bangor for his Transcendental Meditation retreat. Two days later, their manager's assistant, Peter Brown, phoned to inform them that Epstein, only thirty-two years old, had died. The coroner ruled the death an accidental carbitol overdose, although it was widely rumoured to be a suicide. Epstein had been in a fragile emotional state, stressed by personal issues. His death left the group disoriented and fearful about the future. Lennon recalled: \"We collapsed. I knew that we were in trouble then. I didn't really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music, and I was scared. I thought, 'We've had it now.'\"\n\n\"Magical Mystery Tour\", the soundtrack to a forthcoming Beatles television film, was released in the UK as a six-track double extended play disc (EP) in early December 1967. In the United States, the six songs were issued on an identically titled LP that also included five tracks from the band's recent singles. Unterberger says of the US \"Magical Mystery Tour\", \"the psychedelic sound is very much in the vein of \"Sgt. Pepper\", and even spacier in parts (especially the sound collages of 'I Am the Walrus')\" and he calls its five songs culled from the band's 1967 singles \"huge, glorious, and innovative\". In its first three weeks, the album set a record for the highest initial sales of any Capitol LP, and it is the only Capitol compilation later to be adopted in the band's official canon of studio albums. First aired on Boxing Day, the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" film, largely directed by McCartney, brought the group their first major negative UK press. It was dismissed as \"blatant rubbish\" by the \"Daily Express\"; the \"Daily Mail\" called it \"a colossal conceit\"; and \"The Guardian\" labelled the film \"a kind of fantasy morality play about the grossness and warmth and stupidity of the audience\". Gould describes it as \"a great deal of raw footage showing a group of people getting on, getting off, and riding on a bus\". Although the viewership figures were respectable, its slating in the press led US television networks to lose interest in broadcasting the film.\n\nIn January 1968, the Beatles filmed a cameo for the animated movie \"Yellow Submarine\", which featured cartoon versions of the band members and a soundtrack with eleven of their songs, including four unreleased studio recordings that made their debut in the film. Released in June 1968, the film was praised by critics for its music, humour and innovative visual style. It would be seven months, however, before its soundtrack album appeared.\n\nIn the interim came \"The Beatles\", a double LP commonly known as the White Album for its virtually featureless cover. Creative inspiration for the album came from a new direction: without Epstein's guiding presence, the group had briefly turned to Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as their guru. At his ashram in Rishikesh, India, a \"Guide Course\" scheduled for three months marked one of their most prolific periods, yielding numerous songs including a majority of the 30 included on the album. However, Starr left after only ten days, likening it to Butlins, and McCartney eventually grew bored and departed a month later. For Lennon and Harrison, creativity turned to questioning when an electronics technician known as Magic Alex suggested that the Maharishi was attempting to manipulate them. When he alleged that the Maharishi had made sexual advances to women attendees, a persuaded Lennon left abruptly just two months into the course, bringing an unconvinced Harrison and the remainder of the group's entourage with him. In anger, Lennon wrote a scathing song titled \"Maharishi\", renamed \"Sexy Sadie\" to avoid potential legal issues. McCartney said, \"We made a mistake. We thought there was more to him than there was.\"\n\nDuring recording sessions for the White Album, which stretched from late May to mid-October 1968, relations between the Beatles grew openly divisive. Starr quit for two weeks, and McCartney took over the drum kit for \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" (on which Harrison and Lennon drummed as well) and \"Dear Prudence\". Lennon had lost interest in collaborating with McCartney, whose contribution \"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\" he scorned as \"granny music shit\". Tensions were further aggravated by Lennon's romantic preoccupation with avant-garde artist Yoko Ono, whom he insisted on bringing to the sessions despite the group's well-established understanding that girlfriends were not allowed in the studio. Describing the double album, Lennon later said: \"Every track is an individual track; there isn't any Beatle music on it. [It's] John and the band, Paul and the band, George and the band.\" McCartney has recalled that the album \"wasn't a pleasant one to make\". Both he and Lennon identified the sessions as the start of the band's break-up.\n\nIssued in November, the White Album was the band's first Apple Records album release, although EMI continued to own their recordings. The new label was a subsidiary of Apple Corps, which Epstein had formed as part of his plan to create a tax-effective business structure. The record attracted more than 2 million advance orders, selling nearly 4 million copies in the US in little over a month, and its tracks dominated the playlists of American radio stations. Despite its popularity, it did not receive flattering reviews at the time. According to Gould:\n\nGeneral critical opinion eventually turned in favour of the White Album, and in 2003, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked it as the tenth greatest album of all time. Pitchfork's Mark Richardson describes it as \"large and sprawling, overflowing with ideas but also with indulgences, and filled with a hugely variable array of material ... its failings are as essential to its character as its triumphs.\" Erlewine comments: \"The [band's] two main songwriting forces were no longer on the same page, but neither were George and Ringo\", yet \"Lennon turns in two of his best ballads\", McCartney's songs are \"stunning\", Harrison had become \"a songwriter who deserved wider exposure\", and Starr's composition was \"a delight\".\n\nThe \"Yellow Submarine\" LP, issued in January 1969, contained only the four previously unreleased songs that had debuted in the film, along with the title track (already issued on \"Revolver\"), \"All You Need Is Love\" (already issued as a single and on the US \"Magical Mystery Tour\" LP) and seven instrumental pieces composed by Martin. Because of the paucity of new Beatles music, AllMusic's Unterberger and Bruce Eder suggest the album might be \"inessential\" but for Harrison's \"It's All Too Much\": \"the jewel of the new songs ... resplendent in swirling Mellotron, larger-than-life percussion, and tidal waves of feedback guitar ... a virtuoso excursion into otherwise hazy psychedelia\".\n\nAlthough \"Let It Be\" was the Beatles' final album release, it was largely recorded before \"Abbey Road\". The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they \"record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for the very first time – on record and on film\". Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called \"Beatles at Work\", much of the album's content came from extensive rehearsals filmed by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg at Twickenham Film Studios, beginning in January 1969. Martin has said that the project was \"not at all a happy recording experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb.\" Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as \"hell ... the most miserable ... on Earth\", and Harrison, \"the low of all-time\". Irritated by both McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they \"abandon[ed] all talk of live performance\" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled \"Get Back\", using songs recorded for the TV special. He also demanded they cease work at Twickenham and relocate to the newly finished Apple Studio. The other band members agreed, and the idea came about to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film.\n\nIn an effort to alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions. Preston received label billing on the \"Get Back\" single – the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release. At the conclusion of the rehearsals, the band could not agree on a location to film a concert, rejecting several ideas, including a boat at sea, a lunatic asylum, the Tunisian desert, and the Colosseum. Ultimately, what would be their final live performance was filmed on the rooftop of the Apple Corps building at 3 Savile Row, London, on 30 January 1969. Five weeks later, engineer Glyn Johns, whom Lewisohn describes as \"Get Back\"s \"uncredited producer\", began work assembling an album, given \"free rein\" as the band \"all but washed their hands of the entire project\".\n\nNew strains developed between the band members regarding the appointment of a financial adviser, the need for which had become evident without Epstein to manage business affairs. Lennon, Harrison and Starr favoured Allen Klein, who had managed the Rolling Stones and Sam Cooke; McCartney wanted Lee and John Eastman – father and brother, respectively, of Linda Eastman, whom McCartney married on 12 March. Agreement could not be reached, so both Klein and the Eastmans were temporarily appointed: Klein as the Beatles' business manager and the Eastmans as their lawyers. Further conflict ensued, however, and financial opportunities were lost. On 8 May, Klein was named sole manager of the band, the Eastmans having previously been dismissed as the Beatles' attorneys. McCartney refused to sign the management contract with Klein, but he was out-voted by the other Beatles.\n\nMartin stated that he was surprised when McCartney asked him to produce another album, as the \"Get Back\" sessions had been \"a miserable experience\" and he had \"thought it was the end of the road for all of us\". The primary recording sessions for \"Abbey Road\" began on 2 July 1969. Lennon, who rejected Martin's proposed format of a \"continuously moving piece of music\", wanted his and McCartney's songs to occupy separate sides of the album. The eventual format, with individually composed songs on the first side and the second consisting largely of a medley, was McCartney's suggested compromise. On 4 July, the first solo single by a Beatle was released: Lennon's \"Give Peace a Chance\", credited to the Plastic Ono Band. The completion and mixing of \"I Want You (She's So Heavy)\" on 20 August 1969 was the last occasion on which all four Beatles were together in the same studio. Lennon announced his departure to the rest of the group on 20 September, but agreed to withhold a public announcement to avoid undermining sales of the forthcoming album.\n\nReleased six days after Lennon's declaration, \"Abbey Road\" sold 4 million copies within three months and topped the UK charts for a total of seventeen weeks. Its second track, the ballad \"Something\", was issued as a single – the only Harrison composition ever to appear as a Beatles A-side. \"Abbey Road\" received mixed reviews, although the medley met with general acclaim. Unterberger considers it \"a fitting swan song for the group\", containing \"some of the greatest harmonies to be heard on any rock record\". Musicologist and author Ian MacDonald calls the album \"erratic and often hollow\", despite the \"semblance of unity and coherence\" offered by the medley. Martin has singled it out as his personal favourite of all the band's albums; Lennon said it was \"competent\" but had \"no life in it\". Recording engineer Emerick notes that the replacement of the studio's valve mixing console with a transistorised one yielded a less punchy sound, leaving the group frustrated at the thinner tone and lack of impact and contributing to its \"kinder, gentler\" feel relative to their previous albums.\n\nFor the still unfinished \"Get Back\" album, one last song, Harrison's \"I Me Mine\", was recorded on 3 January 1970. Lennon, in Denmark at the time, did not participate. In March, rejecting the work Johns had done on the project, now retitled \"Let It Be\", Klein gave the session tapes to American producer Phil Spector, who had recently produced Lennon's solo single \"Instant Karma!\" In addition to remixing the material, Spector edited, spliced and overdubbed several of the recordings that had been intended as \"live\". McCartney was unhappy with the producer's approach and particularly dissatisfied with the lavish orchestration on \"The Long and Winding Road\", which involved a fourteen-voice choir and 36-piece instrumental ensemble. McCartney's demands that the alterations to the song be reverted were ignored, and he publicly announced his departure from the band on 10 April 1970, a week before the release of his first, self-titled solo album.\n\nOn 8 May, the Spector-produced \"Let It Be\" was released. Its accompanying single, \"The Long and Winding Road\", was the Beatles' last; it was released in the United States, but not in the UK. The \"Let It Be\" documentary film followed later that month, and would win the 1970 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. \"Sunday Telegraph\" critic Penelope Gilliatt called it \"a very bad film and a touching one ... about the breaking apart of this reassuring, geometrically perfect, once apparently ageless family of siblings\". Several reviewers stated that some of the performances in the film sounded better than their analogous album tracks. Describing \"Let It Be\" as the \"only Beatles album to occasion negative, even hostile reviews\", Unterberger calls it \"on the whole underrated\"; he singles out \"some good moments of straight hard rock in 'I've Got a Feeling' and 'Dig a Pony'\", and praises \"Let It Be\", \"Get Back\", and \"the folky 'Two of Us', with John and Paul harmonising together\". McCartney filed suit for the dissolution of the Beatles' contractual partnership on 31 December 1970. Legal disputes continued long after their break-up, and the dissolution was not formalised until 29 December 1974, when John Lennon signed the paperwork terminating the partnership while on vacation with his family at Walt Disney World Resort in Florida.\n\nLennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr all released solo albums in 1970. Their solo records sometimes involved one or more of the others; Starr's \"Ringo\" (1973) was the only album to include compositions and performances by all four ex-Beatles, albeit on separate songs. With Starr's participation, Harrison staged the Concert for Bangladesh in New York City in August 1971. Other than an unreleased jam session in 1974, later bootlegged as \"A Toot and a Snore in '74\", Lennon and McCartney never recorded together again.\n\nTwo double-LP sets of the Beatles' greatest hits, compiled by Klein, \"1962–1966\" and \"1967–1970\", were released in 1973, at first under the Apple Records imprint. Commonly known as the \"Red Album\" and \"Blue Album\", respectively, each have earned a Multi-Platinum certification in the United States and a Platinum certification in the United Kingdom. Between 1976 and 1982, EMI/Capitol released a wave of compilation albums without input from the ex-Beatles, starting with the double-disc compilation \"Rock 'n' Roll Music\". The only one to feature previously unreleased material was \"The Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl\" (1977); the first officially issued concert recordings by the group, it contained selections from two shows they played during their 1964 and 1965 US tours.\n\nThe music and enduring fame of the Beatles was commercially exploited in various other ways, again often outside their creative control. In April 1974, the musical \"John, Paul, George, Ringo … and Bert\", written by Willy Russell and featuring singer Barbara Dickson, opened in London. It included, with permission from Northern Songs, eleven Lennon-McCartney compositions and one by Harrison, \"Here Comes the Sun\". Displeased with the production's use of his song, Harrison withdrew his permission to use it. Later that year, the off-Broadway musical \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band on the Road\" opened. \"All This and World War II\" (1976) was an unorthodox nonfiction film that combined newsreel footage with covers of Beatles songs by performers ranging from Elton John and Keith Moon to the London Symphony Orchestra. The Broadway musical \"Beatlemania\", an unauthorised nostalgia revue, opened in early 1977 and proved popular, spinning off five separate touring productions. In 1979, the band sued the producers, settling for several million dollars in damages. \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (1978), a musical film starring the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton, was a commercial failure and an \"artistic fiasco\", according to Ingham.\n\nOn 24 April 1976, during a broadcast of \"Saturday Night Live\", producer Lorne Michaels offered the Beatles $3,000 to reunite on his show. Unbeknownst to him, John Lennon and Paul McCartney were watching the live broadcast at John's apartment at The Dakota in New York at the time, which was within walking distance of the studio where the show was being shot. The two men entertained the idea of hailing a cab to the studio and surprising Michaels by accepting his offer, but ultimately declined, for as Paul later said \"It would have been work, and we were having a night off, so we elected not to go. It was a nice idea – we nearly did it.\"\n\nAfter the murder of Lennon in December 1980, Harrison rewrote the lyrics to his song \"All Those Years Ago\" in Lennon's honour. With Starr on drums and McCartney and his wife, Linda, contributing backing vocals, the song was released as a single in May 1981. McCartney's own tribute, \"Here Today\", appeared on his \"Tug of War\" album in April 1982. In 1987, Harrison's \"Cloud Nine\" album included \"When We Was Fab\", a song about the Beatlemania era.\n\nWhen the Beatles' studio albums were released on CD by EMI and Apple Corps in 1987, their catalogue was standardised throughout the world, establishing a canon of the twelve original studio LPs as issued in the UK plus the US LP version of \"Magical Mystery Tour\" (1967). All the remaining material from the singles and EPs which had not appeared on the original studio albums was gathered on the two-volume compilation \"Past Masters\" (1988). Except for the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" albums, EMI deleted all its other Beatles compilations – including the \"Hollywood Bowl\" record – from its catalogue.\n\nIn 1988, the Beatles were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, their first year of eligibility. Harrison and Starr attended the ceremony with Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, and his two sons, Julian and Sean. McCartney declined to attend, citing unresolved \"business differences\" that would make him \"feel like a complete hypocrite waving and smiling with them at a fake reunion\". The following year, EMI/Capitol settled a decade-long lawsuit filed by the band over royalties, clearing the way to commercially package previously unreleased material.\n\n\"Live at the BBC\", the first official release of unissued Beatles performances in seventeen years, appeared in 1994. That same year McCartney, Harrison and Starr collaborated on the \"Anthology\" project. \"Anthology\" was the culmination of work begun in 1970, when Apple Corps director Neil Aspinall, their former road manager and personal assistant, had started to gather material for a documentary with the working title \"The Long and Winding Road\". Documenting their history in the band's own words, the \"Anthology\" project included the release of several unissued Beatles recordings. McCartney, Harrison and Starr also added new instrumental and vocal parts to two songs recorded as demos by Lennon in the late 1970s.\n\nDuring 1995–96, the project yielded a television miniseries, an eight-volume video set, and three two-CD/three-LP box sets featuring artwork by Klaus Voormann. The two songs based on Lennon demos, \"Free as a Bird\" and \"Real Love\", were issued as new Beatles singles. The releases were commercially successful and the television series was viewed by an estimated 400 million people. In 1999, to coincide with the re-release of the 1968 film \"Yellow Submarine\", a new soundtrack compilation CD/LP, \"Yellow Submarine Songtrack\", was issued.\n\nThe Beatles' \"1\", a compilation album of the band's British and American number-one hits, was released on 13 November 2000. It became the fastest-selling album of all time, with 3.6 million sold in its first week and 13 million within a month. It topped albums charts in at least 28 countries, including the UK and US. , the compilation had sold 31 million copies globally, and is the best-selling album of that decade in the United States.\n\nHarrison died from metastatic lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr were among the musicians who performed at the Concert for George, organised by Eric Clapton and Harrison's widow, Olivia. The tribute event took place at the Royal Albert Hall on the first anniversary of Harrison's death. In addition to songs he composed for the group and during his solo career, the concert included a celebration of Indian classical music, which had significantly influenced Harrison.\n\nIn 2003, \"Let It Be... Naked\", a reconceived version of the \"Let It Be\" album, with McCartney supervising production, was released. One of the main differences with the Spector-produced version was the omission of the original string arrangements. It was a top ten hit in both Britain and America. The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006 – \"The Capitol Albums, Volume 1\" and \"Volume 2\" included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of the music's original American release.\n\nAs a soundtrack for Cirque du Soleil's Las Vegas Beatles stage revue, \"Love\", George Martin and his son Giles remixed and blended 130 of the band's recordings to create what Martin called \"a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period\". The show premiered in June 2006, and the \"Love\" album was released that November when McCartney discussed his hope that \"Carnival of Light\", a fourteen-minute experimental recording made at Abbey Road in 1967, would receive an official release. A rare live performance involving two ex-Beatles took place in April 2009 at a benefit concert organised by McCartney at New York's Radio City Music Hall, where he was joined by Starr for three songs.\nOn 9 September 2009, the Beatles' entire back catalogue was reissued following an extensive digital remastering process that lasted four years. Stereo editions of all twelve original UK studio albums, along with \"Magical Mystery Tour\" and the \"Past Masters\" compilation, were released on compact disc both individually and as a box set. Comparing the new releases with the 1987 CDs, which had been widely criticised for their lack of clarity and dynamism, \"Mojo\"s Danny Eccleston wrote, \"the remastered vocals are purer, more natural-sounding and give the illusion of sitting slightly higher in the mix.\" A second collection, \"The Beatles in Mono\", included remastered versions of every Beatles album released in true mono along with the original 1965 stereo mixes of \"Help!\" and \"Rubber Soul\" (which Martin had remixed for the 1987 editions). \"\", a music video game in the \"Rock Band\" series, was issued on the same day. In December 2009, the band's catalogue was officially released in FLAC and MP3 format in a limited edition of 30,000 USB flash drives.\n\nOwing to a long-running royalty disagreement, the Beatles were among the last major artists to sign deals with online music services. Residual disagreement emanating from Apple Corps' dispute with Apple, Inc., iTunes' owners, over the use of the name \"Apple\" was also partly responsible for the delay, although in 2008, McCartney stated that the main obstacle to making the Beatles' catalogue available online was that EMI \"want[s] something we're not prepared to give them\". In 2010, the official canon of thirteen Beatles studio albums, \"Past Masters\", and the \"Red\" and \"Blue\" greatest-hits albums were made available on iTunes.\n\nIn 2012, EMI's recorded music operations were sold to Universal Music Group. In order for Universal Music to acquire EMI, the European Union, for antitrust reasons, forced EMI to spin off assets including Parlophone. Universal was allowed to keep the Beatles' recorded music catalogue, managed by Capitol Records under its Capitol Music Group division. Also in 2012, the entire original Beatles album catalogue was reissued on vinyl, available either individually or as a box set.\n\nIn 2013, a second volume of BBC recordings entitled \"On Air – Live at the BBC Volume 2\" was released. December of that year saw the release of another 59 Beatles recordings on iTunes. The set, titled \"The Beatles Bootleg Recordings 1963\", had the opportunity to gain a 70-year copyright extension conditional on the songs being published at least once before the end of 2013. Apple Records released the recordings on 17 December to prevent them from going into the public domain and had them taken down from iTunes later that same day. Fan reactions to the release were mixed, with one blogger saying \"the hardcore Beatles collectors who are trying to obtain everything will already have these.\"\n\nOn 26 January 2014, Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr performed McCartney's \"Queenie Eye\" in Los Angeles at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, held at the Staples Center in Los Angeles. The following day, \"\" television special was taped in the Los Angeles Convention Center's West Hall. It aired on 9 February, the exact date of – and at the same time, and on the same network as – the original broadcast of the Beatles' first US television appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", 50 years earlier. The special included performances of Beatles songs by current artists as well as by McCartney and Starr, archival footage, and Paul and Ringo being interviewed by David Letterman at the Ed Sullivan Theater, site of \"The Ed Sullivan Show\".\n\nIn December 2015, the Beatles released their catalogue for streaming on various streaming music services. On 18 May 2017, Sirius XM Radio launched a 24/7 radio channel, The Beatles Channel. On 26 May 2017, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" was reissued with new stereo mixes and unreleased material for the album's 50th anniversary. The reissue is available in five different formats – digital format, a single CD, a double CD set, a double vinyl set, and a six-CD deluxe edition box set.\n\nIn \"Icons of Rock: An Encyclopedia of the Legends Who Changed Music Forever\", Scott Schinder and Andy Schwartz describe the Beatles' musical evolution:\n\nIn \"The Beatles as Musicians\", Walter Everett describes Lennon and McCartney's contrasting motivations and approaches to composition: \"McCartney may be said to have constantly developed – as a means to entertain – a focused musical talent with an ear for counterpoint and other aspects of craft in the demonstration of a universally agreed-upon common language that he did much to enrich. Conversely, Lennon's mature music is best appreciated as the daring product of a largely unconscious, searching but undisciplined artistic sensibility.\"\n\nIan MacDonald describes McCartney as \"a natural melodist – a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\". His melody lines are characterised as primarily \"vertical\", employing wide, consonant intervals which express his \"extrovert energy and optimism\". Conversely, Lennon's \"sedentary, ironic personality\" is reflected in a \"horizontal\" approach featuring minimal, dissonant intervals and repetitive melodies which rely on their harmonic accompaniment for interest: \"Basically a realist, he instinctively kept his melodies close to the rhythms and cadences of speech, colouring his lyrics with bluesy tone and harmony rather than creating tunes that made striking shapes of their own.\" MacDonald praises Harrison's lead guitar work for the role his \"characterful lines and textural colourings\" play in supporting Lennon and McCartney's parts, and describes Starr as \"the father of modern pop/rock drumming\".\n\nThe band's earliest influences include Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins, Little Richard and Chuck Berry. During the Beatles' co-residency with Little Richard at the Star-Club in Hamburg, from April to May 1962, he advised them on the proper technique for performing his songs. Of Presley, Lennon said, \"Nothing really affected me until I heard Elvis. If there hadn't been Elvis, there would not have been the Beatles.\"\n\nOther early influences include Buddy Holly, Eddie Cochran, Roy Orbison and the Everly Brothers. The Beatles continued to absorb influences long after their initial success, often finding new musical and lyrical avenues by listening to their contemporaries, including Bob Dylan, the Who, Frank Zappa, the Lovin' Spoonful, the Byrds and the Beach Boys, whose 1966 album \"Pet Sounds\" amazed and inspired McCartney. Referring to the Beach Boys' creative leader, Martin later stated: \"No one made a greater impact on the Beatles than Brian [Wilson].\" Ravi Shankar, with whom Harrison studied for six weeks in India in late 1966, had a significant effect on his musical development during the band's later years.\n\nOriginating as a skiffle group, the Beatles quickly embraced 1950s rock and roll and helped pioneer the Merseybeat genre, and their repertoire ultimately expanded to include a broad variety of pop music. Reflecting the range of styles they explored, Lennon said of \"Beatles for Sale\", \"You could call our new one a Beatles country-and-western LP\", while Gould credits \"Rubber Soul\" as \"the instrument by which legions of folk-music enthusiasts were coaxed into the camp of pop\".\n\nAlthough the 1965 song \"Yesterday\" was not the first pop record to employ orchestral strings, it marked the group's first recorded use of classical music elements. Gould observes: \"The more traditional sound of strings allowed for a fresh appreciation of their talent as composers by listeners who were otherwise allergic to the din of drums and electric guitars.\" They continued to experiment with string arrangements to various effect; \"Sgt. Pepper\"s \"She's Leaving Home\", for instance, is \"cast in the of a sentimental Victorian ballad\", Gould writes, \"its words and music filled with the clichés of musical melodrama\".\n\nThe band's stylistic range expanded in another direction with their 1966 B-side \"Rain\", described by Martin Strong as \"the first overtly psychedelic Beatles record\". Other psychedelic numbers followed, such as \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" (recorded before \"Rain\"), \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\" and \"I Am the Walrus\". The influence of Indian classical music was evident in Harrison's \"The Inner Light\", \"Love You To\" and \"Within You Without You\" – Gould describes the latter two as attempts \"to replicate the raga form in miniature\".\n\nInnovation was the most striking feature of their creative evolution, according to music historian and pianist Michael Campbell: \"'A Day in the Life' encapsulates the art and achievement of the Beatles as well as any single track can. It highlights key features of their music: the sound imagination, the persistence of tuneful melody, and the close coordination between words and music. It represents a new category of song – more sophisticated than pop ... and uniquely innovative. There literally had never before been a song – classical or vernacular – that had blended so many disparate elements so imaginatively.\" Philosophy professor Bruce Ellis Benson agrees: \"the Beatles ... give us a wonderful example of how such far-ranging influences as Celtic music, rhythm and blues, and country and western could be put together in a new way.\"\n\nAuthor Dominic Pedler describes the way they crossed musical styles: \"Far from moving sequentially from one genre to another (as is sometimes conveniently suggested) the group maintained \"in parallel\" their mastery of the traditional, catchy chart hit while simultaneously forging rock and dabbling with a wide range of peripheral influences from country to vaudeville. One of these threads was their take on folk music, which would form such essential groundwork for their later collisions with Indian music and philosophy.\" As the personal relationships between the band members grew increasingly strained, their individual tastes became more apparent. The minimalistic cover artwork for the White Album contrasted with the complexity and diversity of its music, which encompassed Lennon's \"Revolution 9\" (whose musique concrète approach was influenced by Yoko Ono), Starr's country song \"Don't Pass Me By\", Harrison's rock ballad \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\", and the \" roar\" of McCartney's \"Helter Skelter\".\n\nGeorge Martin's close involvement in his role as producer made him one of the leading candidates for the informal title of the \"fifth Beatle\". He applied his classical musical training in various ways, and functioned as \"an informal music teacher\" to the progressing songwriters, according to Gould. Martin suggested to a sceptical McCartney that the arrangement of \"Yesterday\" should feature a string quartet accompaniment, thereby introducing the Beatles to a \"hitherto unsuspected world of classical instrumental colour\", in MacDonald's description. Their creative development was also facilitated by Martin's willingness to experiment in response to their suggestions, such as adding \"something baroque\" to a particular recording. In addition to scoring orchestral arrangements for recordings, Martin often performed on them, playing instruments including piano, organ and brass.\n\nCollaborating with Lennon and McCartney required Martin to adapt to their different approaches to songwriting and recording. MacDonald comments, \"while [he] worked more naturally with the conventionally articulate McCartney, the challenge of catering to Lennon's intuitive approach generally spurred him to his more original arrangements, of which 'Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!' is an outstanding example.\" Martin said of the two composers' distinct songwriting styles and his own stabilising influence:\n\nHarrison echoed Martin's description of his stabilising role: \"I think we just grew through those years together, him as the straight man and us as the loonies; but he was always there for us to interpret our madness – we used to be slightly avant-garde on certain days of the week, and he would be there as the anchor person, to communicate that through the engineers and on to the tape.\"\n\nMaking innovative use of technology while expanding the possibilities of recorded music, the Beatles urged experimentation by Martin and his recording engineers. Seeking ways to put chance occurrences to creative use, accidental guitar feedback, a resonating glass bottle, a tape loaded the wrong way round so that it played backwards – any of these might be incorporated into their music. Their desire to create new sounds on every new recording, combined with Martin's arranging abilities and the studio expertise of EMI staff engineers Norman Smith, Ken Townsend and Geoff Emerick, all contributed significantly to their records from \"Rubber Soul\" and, especially, \"Revolver\" onwards. Along with innovative studio techniques such as sound effects, unconventional microphone placements, tape loops, double tracking and vari-speed recording, the Beatles augmented their songs with instruments that were unconventional in rock music at the time. These included string and brass ensembles as well as Indian instruments such as the sitar in \"Norwegian Wood\" and the swarmandal in \"Strawberry Fields Forever\". They also used novel electronic instruments such as the Mellotron, with which McCartney supplied the flute voices on the \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" intro, and the clavioline, an electronic keyboard that created the unusual oboe-like sound on \"Baby, You're a Rich Man\".\n\nFormer \"Rolling Stone\" associate editor Robert Greenfield compared the Beatles to Picasso, as \"artists who broke through the constraints of their time period to come up with something that was unique and original ... [I]n the form of popular music, no one will ever be more revolutionary, more creative and more distinctive ...\" The British poet Philip Larkin described their work as \"an enchanting and intoxicating hybrid of Negro rock-and-roĺl with their own adolescent romanticism\", and \"the first advance in popular music since the War\". They not only sparked the British Invasion of the US, they became a globally influential phenomenon as well. From the 1920s, the United States had dominated popular entertainment culture throughout much of the world, via Hollywood movies, jazz, the music of Broadway and Tin Pan Alley and, later, the rock and roll that first emerged in Memphis, Tennessee. The Beatles are regarded as British cultural icons, with young adults from abroad naming the band among a group of people that they most associated with UK culture.\n\nTheir musical innovations and commercial success inspired musicians worldwide. Many artists have acknowledged the Beatles' influence and enjoyed chart success with covers of their songs. On radio, their arrival marked the beginning of a new era; in 1968 the programme director of New York's WABC radio station forbade his DJs from playing any \"pre-Beatles\" music, marking the defining line of what would be considered oldies on American radio. They helped to redefine the album as something more than just a few hits padded out with \"filler\", and they were primary innovators of the modern music video. The Shea Stadium show with which they opened their 1965 North American tour attracted an estimated 55,600 people, then the largest audience in concert history; Spitz describes the event as a \"major breakthrough ... a giant step toward reshaping the concert business\". Emulation of their clothing and especially their hairstyles, which became a mark of rebellion, had a global impact on fashion.\n\nAccording to Gould, the Beatles changed the way people listened to popular music and experienced its role in their lives. From what began as the Beatlemania fad, the group's popularity grew into what was seen as an embodiment of sociocultural movements of the decade. As icons of the 1960s counterculture, Gould continues, they became a catalyst for bohemianism and activism in various social and political arenas, fuelling movements such as women's liberation, gay liberation and environmentalism. According to Peter Lavezzoli, after the \"more popular than Jesus\" controversy in 1966, the Beatles felt considerable pressure to say the right things and \"began a concerted effort to spread a message of wisdom and higher consciousness\".\n\nIn 1965, Queen Elizabeth II appointed Lennon, McCartney, Harrison and Starr Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE). The film \"Let It Be\" (1970) won the 1971 Academy Award for Best Original Song Score. The recipients of seven Grammy Awards and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards, the Beatles have been awarded six Diamond albums, as well as 24 Multi-Platinum albums, 39 Platinum albums and 45 Gold albums in the United States. In the UK, the Beatles have four Multi-Platinum albums, four Platinum albums, eight Gold albums and one Silver album. They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988.\n\nThe best-selling band in history, the Beatles have sold more than 800 million physical and digital albums as of 2013. They have had more number-one albums on the UK charts, fifteen, and sold more singles in the UK, 21.9 million, than any other act. In 2004, \"Rolling Stone\" ranked the Beatles as the best artist of all time. They ranked number one on \"Billboard\" magazine's list of the all-time most successful Hot 100 artists, released in 2008 to celebrate the US singles chart's 50th anniversary. , they hold the record for most number-one hits on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, with twenty. The Recording Industry Association of America certifies that the Beatles have sold 178 million units in the US, more than any other artist. They were collectively included in \"Time\" magazine's compilation of . In 2014, they received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.\n\nPrincipal members\nEarly members\n\nTouring musician\nTimeline\n\n\nWhen the above albums were reissued on CD in 1988, the American \"Magical Mystery Tour\" album (1967) and the double-CD compilation set \"Past Masters\" were included so that the full set would contain every track commercially released in the band's lifetime.\n\nSee also\n\nThrough 1969, the Beatles' catalogue was published almost exclusively by Northern Songs Ltd., a company formed in February 1963 by music publisher Dick James specifically for Lennon and McCartney, though it later acquired songs by other artists. The company was organised with James and his partner, Emmanuel Silver, owning a controlling interest, variously described as 51% or 50% plus one share. McCartney had 20%. Reports again vary concerning Lennon's portion – 19 or 20% – and Brian Epstein's – 9 or 10% – which he received in lieu of a 25% band management fee.\n\nIn 1965, the company went public. Five million shares were created, of which the original principals retained 3.75 million. James and Silver each received 937,500 shares (18.75% of 5 million); Lennon and McCartney each received 750,000 shares (15%); and Epstein's management company, NEMS Enterprises, received 375,000 shares (7.5%). Of the 1.25 million shares put up for sale, Harrison and Starr each acquired 40,000. At the time of the stock offering, Lennon and McCartney renewed their three-year publishing contracts, binding them to Northern Songs until 1973.\n\nHarrison created Harrisongs to represent his Beatles compositions, but signed a three-year contract with Northern Songs that gave it the copyright to his work through March 1968, which included \"Taxman\" and \"Within You Without You\". The songs on which Starr received co-writing credit before 1968, such as \"What Goes On\" and \"Flying\", were also Northern Songs copyrights. Harrison did not renew his contract with Northern Songs when it ended, signing instead with Apple Publishing while retaining the copyright to his work from that point on. Harrisongs thus owns the rights to his later Beatles songs such as \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\" and \"Something\". That year, as well, Starr created Startling Music, which holds the rights to his Beatles compositions, \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\".\n\nIn March 1969, James arranged to sell his and his partner's shares of Northern Songs to the British broadcasting company Associated Television (ATV), founded by impresario Lew Grade, without first informing the Beatles. The band then made a bid to gain controlling interest by attempting to work out a deal with a consortium of London brokerage firms that had accumulated a 14% holding. The deal collapsed over the objections of Lennon, who declared, \"I'm sick of being fucked about by men in suits sitting on their fat arses in the City.\" By the end of May, ATV had acquired a majority stake in Northern Songs, controlling nearly the entire Lennon–McCartney catalogue, as well as any future material until 1973. In frustration, Lennon and McCartney sold their shares to ATV in late October 1969.\n\nIn 1981, financial losses by ATV's parent company, ACC, led it to attempt to sell its music division. According to authors Brian Southall and Rupert Perry, Grade contacted McCartney, offering ATV Music and Northern Songs for $30 million. According to an account McCartney gave in 1995, he met with Grade and explained he was interested solely in the Northern Songs catalogue, if Grade were ever willing to \"separate off\" that portion of ATV Music. Soon afterwards, Grade offered to sell him Northern Songs for £20 million, giving the ex-Beatle \"a week or so\" to decide. By McCartney's account, he and Ono countered with a £5 million bid that was rejected. According to reports at the time, Grade refused to separate Northern Songs, and turned down an offer of £21–25 million from McCartney and Ono for ATV Music. In 1982, ACC as a whole was sold to Australian business magnate Robert Holmes à Court for £60 million.\n\nThree years later, Michael Jackson purchased ATV for a reported $47.5 million. The acquisition gave him control over the publishing rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, as well as 40,000 other copyrights. In 1995, in a deal that earned him a reported $110 million, Jackson merged his music publishing business with Sony, creating a new company, Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he held a 50% stake. The merger made the new company, then valued at over half a billion dollars, the third largest music publisher in the world. In 2016, Sony acquired Jackson's share of Sony/ATV from the Jackson estate for $750 million.\n\nDespite the lack of publishing rights to most of their songs, Lennon's estate and McCartney continue to receive their respective shares of the writers' royalties, which together are 33⅓% of total commercial proceeds in the US and which vary elsewhere around the world between 50 and 55%. Two of Lennon and McCartney's earliest songs – \"Love Me Do\" and \"P.S. I Love You\" – were published by an EMI subsidiary, Ardmore & Beechwood, before they signed with James. McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore in the mid-1980s, and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by McCartney's company MPL Communications.\n\nOn 18 January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in United States district court against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018. Under US copyright law, for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56 years. McCartney and Sony agreed to a confidential settlement in June 2017.\n\n\n",
                "Paul McCartney\n\nSir James Paul McCartney, (born 18 June 1942), is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and composer. He gained worldwide fame as the bass guitarist and singer for the rock band the Beatles, widely considered the most popular and influential group in the history of pop music. His songwriting partnership with John Lennon was the most successful of the post-war era. After the group disbanded in 1970, he pursued a solo career and formed the band Wings with his first wife, Linda, and Denny Laine.\n\nMcCartney is one of the most successful composers and performers of all time. More than 2,200 artists have covered his Beatles song \"Yesterday\", making it one of the most covered songs in popular music history. Wings' 1977 release \"Mull of Kintyre\" is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK. A two-time inductee into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (as a member of the Beatles in 1988, and as a solo artist in 1999), and an 18-time Grammy Award winner, McCartney has written, or co-written, 32 songs that have reached number one on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, and he has 25.5 million RIAA-certified units in the United States. McCartney, Lennon, George Harrison and Ringo Starr all received appointment as Members of the Order of the British Empire in 1965 and, in 1997, McCartney was knighted for services to music. McCartney is also one of the wealthiest musicians in the world, with an estimated net worth of US$1.2 billion.\n\nMcCartney has released an extensive catalogue of songs as a solo artist and has composed classical and electronic music. He has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as animal rights, seal hunting, land mines, vegetarianism, poverty, and music education. He has married three times and is the father of five children.\n\nJames Paul McCartney was born on 18 June 1942 in Walton Hospital, Liverpool, England, where his mother, Mary Patricia (née Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James (\"Jim\") McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War II. McCartney has one younger brother named Michael. Though the children were baptised in their mother's Catholic faith, their father was a former Protestant turned agnostic, and religion was not emphasised in the household.\n\nMcCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School in Speke from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School in Belle Vale because of overcrowding at Stockton. In 1953, with only three others out of ninety examinees, he passed the 11-Plus exam, meaning he could attend the Liverpool Institute, a grammar school rather than a secondary modern school. In 1954, he met schoolmate George Harrison on the bus from his suburban home in Speke. The two quickly became friends; McCartney later admitted: \"I tended to talk down to him because he was a year younger.\"\n\nMcCartney's mother, Mary, was a midwife and the family's primary wage earner; her earnings enabled them to move into 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, where they lived until 1964. She rode a bicycle to her patients; McCartney described an early memory of her leaving at \"about three in the morning [the] streets ... thick with snow\". On 31 October 1956, when McCartney was fourteen, his mother died of an embolism. McCartney's loss later became a point of connection with John Lennon, whose mother, Julia, had died when he was seventeen.\n\nMcCartney's father was a trumpet player and pianist, who had led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s. He kept an upright piano in the front room, encouraged his sons to be musical and advised Paul to take piano lessons, but Paul preferred to learn by ear. He gave Paul a nickel-plated trumpet for his fourteenth birthday, but when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg, McCartney traded it for a £15 Framus Zenith (model 17) acoustic guitar, since he wanted to be able to sing while playing. He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a Slim Whitman concert and realising that Whitman played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings. McCartney wrote his first song, \"I Lost My Little Girl\", on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" on the piano. American rhythm and blues influenced him, and Little Richard was his schoolboy idol; \"Long Tall Sally\" was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a Butlin's Filey holiday camp talent competition.\n\nAt the age of fifteen on 6 July 1957, McCartney met John Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in Woolton. The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and skiffle, a type of popular music with jazz, blues and folk influences. Soon afterwards, the members of the band invited McCartney to join as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon. Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe on bass, in 1960. By May 1960 the band had tried several names, including \"Johnny and the Moondogs\", \"Beatals\" and \"the Silver Beetles\". They adopted the name \"the Beatles\" in August 1960 and recruited drummer Pete Best shortly before a five-engagement residency in Hamburg.\n\nThe Beatles were informally represented by Allan Williams; in 1960, the group booked its first performance at a residency in Hamburg. In 1961, Sutcliffe left the band and McCartney reluctantly became their bass player. While in Hamburg, they recorded professionally for the first time and were credited as the Beat Brothers, who were the backing band for English singer Tony Sheridan on the single \"My Bonnie\". This resulted in attention from Brian Epstein, who was a key figure in their subsequent development and success. He became their manager in January 1962. Ringo Starr replaced Best in August, and the band had their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in October, becoming popular in the UK in 1963, and in the US a year later. The fan hysteria became known as \"Beatlemania\", and the press sometimes referred to McCartney as the \"cute Beatle\".\n\nIn August 1965, the Beatles released the McCartney composition \"Yesterday\", featuring a string quartet. Included on the \"Help!\" LP, the song was the group's first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member. \"Yesterday\" became one of the most covered songs in popular music history. Later that year, during recording sessions for the album \"Rubber Soul\", McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band. Musicologist Ian MacDonald wrote, \"from [1965] ... [McCartney] would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and \"de facto\" musical director of the Beatles.\" Critics described \"Rubber Soul\" as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band's music and lyrics. Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney said they had written the music for the song \"In My Life\". McCartney said of the album, \"we'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand.\" Recording engineer Norman Smith stated that the \"Rubber Soul\" sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: \"the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious ... [and] as far as Paul was concerned, George [Harrison] could do no right—Paul was absolutely finicky.\"\n\nIn 1966, the Beatles released the album \"Revolver\". Featuring sophisticated lyrics, studio experimentation, and an expanded repertoire of musical genres ranging from innovative string arrangements to psychedelic rock, the album marked an artistic leap for the Beatles. The first of three consecutive McCartney A-sides, the single \"Paperback Writer\" preceded the LP's release. The Beatles produced a short promotional film for the song, and another for its B-side, \"Rain\". The films, described by Harrison as \"the forerunner of videos\", aired on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" and \"Top of the Pops\" in June 1966. \"Revolver\" also included McCartney's \"Eleanor Rigby\", which featured a string octet. According to Gould, the song is \"a neoclassical tour de force ... a true hybrid, conforming to no recognizable style or genre of song\". Except for some backing vocals, the song included only McCartney's lead vocal and the strings arranged by producer George Martin.\n\nThe band gave their final commercial concert at the end of their 1966 US tour. Later that year, McCartney completed his first musical project apart from the group—a film score for the UK production \"The Family Way\". The score was a collaboration with Martin, who used two McCartney themes to write thirteen variations. The soundtrack failed to chart, but it won McCartney an Ivor Novello Award for Best Instrumental Theme.\n\nUpon the end of the Beatles' performing career, McCartney sensed unease in the band and wanted them to maintain creative productivity. He pressed them to start a new project, which became \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", widely regarded as rock's first concept album. McCartney was inspired to create a new persona for the group, to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to their fans that they had musically matured. He invented the fictional band of the album's title track. As McCartney explained, \"We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really hated that fucking four little mop-top approach. We were not boys we were men ... and [we] thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers.\"\n\nStarting in November 1966, the band adopted an experimental attitude during recording sessions for the album. According to engineer Geoff Emerick, \"the Beatles were looking to go out on a limb, both musically and sonically ... we were utilising a lot of tape varispeeding and other manipulation techniques ... limiters and ... effects like flanging and ADT.\" Their recording of \"A Day in the Life\" required a forty-piece orchestra, which Martin and McCartney took turns conducting. The sessions produced the double A-side single \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"/\"Penny Lane\" in February 1967, and the LP followed in June. McCartney's \"She's Leaving Home\" was an orchestral pop song. MacDonald described the track as \"[among] the finest work on \"Sgt. Pepper\"—imperishable popular art of its time\". Based on an ink drawing by McCartney, the LP's cover included a collage designed by pop artists Peter Blake and Jann Haworth, featuring the Beatles in costume as the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, standing with a host of celebrities. The heavy moustaches worn by the Beatles reflected the growing influence of hippie style trends on the band, while their clothing \"spoofed the vogue in Britain for military fashions\", wrote Gould. Scholar David Scott Kastan described \"Sgt. Pepper\" as \"the most important and influential rock-and-roll album ever recorded\".\n\nEpstein's death at age 32 in August 1967 created a void, which left the Beatles perplexed and concerned about their future. McCartney stepped in to fill that void and gradually became the \"de facto\" leader and business manager of the group that Lennon had once led. In his first creative suggestion after this change of leadership, McCartney proposed that the band move forward on their plans to produce a film for television, which was to become \"Magical Mystery Tour\". According to Beatles' historian Mark Lewisohn, the project was \"an administrative nightmare throughout\". McCartney largely directed the film, which brought the group their first unfavourable critical response. However, the film's soundtrack was more successful. It was released in the UK as a six-track double extended play disc (EP), and as an identically titled LP in the US, filled out with five songs from the band's recent singles. The only Capitol compilation later included in the group's official canon of studio albums, the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" LP achieved $8 million in sales within three weeks of its release, higher initial sales than any other Capitol LP up to that point.\n\nIn January 1968, EMI filmed the Beatles for a promotional trailer intended to advertise the animated film \"Yellow Submarine\", loosely based on the imaginary world evoked by McCartney's 1966 composition. Though critics admired the film for its visual style, humour and music, the soundtrack album issued seven months later received a less enthusiastic response. By late 1968, relations within the band were deteriorating. The tension grew during the recording of their self-titled double album, also known as the \"White Album\". Matters worsened the following year during the \"Let It Be\" sessions, when a camera crew filmed McCartney lecturing the group: \"We've been very negative since Mr. Epstein passed away ... we were always fighting [his] discipline a bit, but it's silly to fight that discipline if it's our own\".\n\nIn March 1969, McCartney married his first wife, Linda Eastman, and in August, the couple had their first child, Mary, named after his late mother. \"Abbey Road\" was the band's last recorded album, and Martin suggested \"a continuously moving piece of music\", urging the group to think symphonically. McCartney agreed, but Lennon did not. They eventually compromised, agreeing to McCartney's suggestion: an LP featuring individual songs on side one, and a long medley on side two. In October 1969, a rumour surfaced that McCartney had died in a car crash in 1966 and been replaced by a lookalike, but this was quickly refuted when a November \"Life\" magazine cover featured him and his family, accompanied by the caption \"Paul is still with us\".\n\nMcCartney was in the midst of business disagreements with his bandmates when he announced his departure from the group on 10 April 1970. He filed suit for the band's formal dissolution on 31 December 1970. More legal disputes followed as McCartney's attorneys– his in-laws John and Lee Eastman–fought the three remaining Beatles' business manager, Allen Klein, over royalties and creative control. An English court legally dissolved the Beatles on 9 January 1975, though sporadic lawsuits against their record company EMI, Klein, and each other persisted until 1989. They are widely regarded as one of the most popular and influential acts in the history of rock music.\n\nMcCartney suffered from depression prior to leaving the group and also after the group disbanded. His wife helped him pull out of that emotional crisis by praising his work as a songwriter and convincing him to continue writing and recording. In her honour, he later wrote \"Maybe I'm Amazed\", explaining that with the Beatles breaking up, \"that was my feeling: Maybe I'm amazed at what's going on... Maybe I'm a man and maybe you're the only woman who could ever help me; Baby won't you help me understand... Maybe I'm amazed at the way you pulled me out of time, hung me on the line, Maybe I'm amazed at the way I really need you.\" He added that \"every love song I write is for Linda.\"\n\nAfter the Beatles broke up in 1970, McCartney continued his musical career with his first solo release, \"McCartney\", a US number-one album. Apart from some vocal contributions from Linda, \"McCartney\" is a one-man album, with McCartney providing compositions, instrumentation and vocals. In 1971, he collaborated with Linda and drummer Denny Seiwell on a second album, \"Ram\". A UK number one and a US top five, \"Ram\" included the co-written US number-one hit single \"Uncle Albert/Admiral Halsey\". Later that year, ex-Moody Blues guitarist Denny Laine joined the McCartneys and Seiwell to form the band Wings. McCartney had this to say on the group's formation: \"Wings were always a difficult idea ... any group having to follow [the Beatles'] success would have a hard job ... I found myself in that very position. However, it was a choice between going on or finishing, and I loved music too much to think of stopping.\" In September 1971, the McCartneys' daughter Stella was born, named in honour of Linda's grandmothers, both of whom were named Stella.\n\nFollowing the addition of guitarist Henry McCullough, Wings' first concert tour began in 1972 with a debut performance in front of an audience of seven hundred at the University of Nottingham. Ten more gigs followed as they travelled across the UK in a van during an unannounced tour of universities, during which the band stayed in modest accommodation and received pay in coinage collected from students, while avoiding Beatles songs during their performances. McCartney later said, \"The main thing I didn't want was to come on stage, faced with the whole torment of five rows of press people with little pads, all looking at me and saying, 'Oh well, he is not as good as he was.' So we decided to go out on that university tour which made me less nervous ... by the end of that tour I felt ready for something else, so we went into Europe.\" During the seven-week, 25-show Wings Over Europe Tour, the band played almost solely Wings and McCartney solo material: the Little Richard cover \"Long Tall Sally\" was the only song that had previously been recorded by the Beatles. McCartney wanted the tour to avoid large venues; most of the small halls they played had capacities of fewer than 3,000 people. \n\nIn March 1973, Wings achieved their first US number-one single, \"My Love\", included on their second LP, \"Red Rose Speedway\", a US number one and UK top five. McCartney's collaboration with Linda and former Beatles producer Martin resulted in the song \"Live and Let Die\", which was the theme song for the James Bond film of the same name. Nominated for an Academy Award, the song reached number two in the US and number nine in the UK. It also earned Martin a Grammy for his orchestral arrangement. Music professor and author Vincent Benitez described the track as \"symphonic rock at its best\".\n\nAfter the departure of McCullough and Seiwell in 1973, the McCartneys and Laine recorded \"Band on the Run\". The album was the first of seven platinum Wings LPs. It was a US and UK number one, the band's first to top the charts in both countries and the first ever to reach \"Billboard\" magazine's charts on three separate occasions. One of the best-selling releases of the decade, it remained on the UK charts for 124 weeks. \"Rolling Stone\" named it one of the Best Albums of the Year for 1973, and in 1975 Paul McCartney and Wings won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Performance for the song \"Band on the Run\" and Geoff Emerick won the Grammy for Best Engineered Recording for the album. In 1974, Wings achieved a second US number-one single with the title track. The album also included the top-ten hits \"Jet\" and \"Helen Wheels\", and earned the 413th spot on \"Rolling Stone's\" list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.\n\nWings followed \"Band on the Run\" with the chart-topping albums \"Venus and Mars\" (1975) and \"Wings at the Speed of Sound\" (1976). In 1975, they began the fourteen-month Wings Over the World Tour, which included stops in the UK, Australia, Europe and the US. The tour marked the first time McCartney performed Beatles songs live with Wings, with five in the two-hour set list: \"I've Just Seen a Face\", \"Yesterday\", \"Blackbird\", \"Lady Madonna\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\". Following the second European leg of the tour and extensive rehearsals in London, the group undertook an ambitious US arena tour that yielded the US number-one live triple LP \"Wings over America\".\n\nIn September 1977, the McCartneys had a third child, a son they named James. In November, the Wings song \"Mull of Kintyre\", co-written with Laine, was quickly becoming one of the best-selling singles in UK chart history. The most successful single of McCartney's solo career, it achieved double the sales of the previous record holder, \"She Loves You\", and went on to sell 2.5 million copies and hold the UK sales record until the 1984 charity single, \"Do They Know It's Christmas?\"\n\n\"London Town\" (1978) spawned a US number-one single (\"With a Little Luck\"), and was Wings' best-selling LP since \"Band on the Run\", making the top five in both the US and the UK. Critical reception was unfavourable, and McCartney expressed disappointment with the album. \"Back to the Egg\" (1979) featured McCartney's collaboration with a rock supergroup dubbed \"the Rockestra\". Credited to Wings, the band included Pete Townshend, David Gilmour, Gary Brooker, John Paul Jones and John Bonham. Though certified platinum, critics panned the album. Wings completed their final concert tour in 1979, with twenty shows in the UK that included the live debut of the Beatles songs \"Got to Get You into My Life\", \"The Fool on the Hill\" and \"Let it Be\".\nIn 1980, McCartney released his second solo LP, the self-produced \"McCartney II\", which peaked at number one in the UK and number three in the US. As with his first album, he composed and performed it alone. The album contained the song \"Coming Up\", the live version of which, recorded in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1979 by Wings, became the group's last number-one hit. By 1981, McCartney felt he had accomplished all he could creatively with Wings and decided he needed a change. The group disbanded in April 1981 following disagreements over royalties and salaries.\n\nIn 1982 McCartney collaborated with Stevie Wonder on the Martin-produced number-one hit \"Ebony and Ivory\", included on McCartney's \"Tug of War\" LP, and with Michael Jackson on \"The Girl Is Mine\" from \"Thriller\". \"Ebony and Ivory\" was McCartney's record 28th single to hit number one on the \"Billboard\" 100. The following year, he and Jackson worked on \"Say Say Say\", McCartney's most recent US number one . McCartney earned his latest UK number one with the title track of his LP release that year, \"Pipes of Peace\".\n\nIn 1984, McCartney starred in the musical \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\", a feature film he also wrote and produced which included Starr in an acting role. Disparaged by critics, \"Variety\" described the film as \"characterless, bloodless, and pointless\". Roger Ebert awarded it a single star and wrote, \"you can safely skip the movie and proceed directly to the soundtrack\". The album fared much better, reaching number one in the UK and producing the US top-ten hit single \"No More Lonely Nights\", featuring David Gilmour on lead guitar. In 1985, Warner Brothers commissioned McCartney to write a song for the comedic feature film \"Spies Like Us\". He composed and recorded the track in four days, with Phil Ramone co-producing. McCartney participated in Live Aid, performing \"Let it Be\", but technical difficulties rendered his vocals and piano barely audible for the first two verses, punctuated by squeals of feedback. Equipment technicians resolved the problems and David Bowie, Alison Moyet, Pete Townshend and Bob Geldof joined McCartney on stage, receiving an enthusiastic crowd reaction.\n\nMcCartney collaborated with Eric Stewart on \"Press to Play\" (1986), with Stewart co-writing more than half the songs on the LP. In 1988, McCartney released \"Снова в СССР\", released only in the Soviet Union, which contained eighteen covers; recorded over the course of two days. In 1989, he joined forces with fellow Merseysiders Gerry Marsden and Holly Johnson to record an updated version of \"Ferry Cross the Mersey\", for the Hillsborough disaster appeal fund. That same year, he released \"Flowers in the Dirt\"; a collaborative effort with Elvis Costello that included musical contributions from Gilmour and Nicky Hopkins.\nMcCartney then formed a band consisting of himself and Linda, with Hamish Stuart and Robbie McIntosh on guitars, Paul \"Wix\" Wickens on keyboards and Chris Whitten on drums. In September 1989, they launched the Paul McCartney World Tour, his first in over a decade. During the tour, McCartney performed for the largest paying stadium audience in history on 21 April 1990, when 184,000 people attended his concert at Maracanã Stadium in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. That year, he released the triple album \"Tripping the Live Fantastic\", which contained select performances from the tour.\n\nMcCartney ventured into orchestral music in 1991, when the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Society commissioned a musical piece by him to celebrate its sesquicentennial. He collaborated with composer Carl Davis, producing \"Liverpool Oratorio\". The performance featured opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa, Sally Burgess, Jerry Hadley and Willard White, with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir of Liverpool Cathedral. Reviews were negative. \"The Guardian\" was especially critical, describing the music as \"afraid of anything approaching a fast tempo\", and adding that the piece has \"little awareness of the need for recurrent ideas that will bind the work into a whole\". The paper published a letter McCartney submitted in response in which he noted several of the work's faster tempos and added, \"happily, history shows that many good pieces of music were not liked by the critics of the time so I am content to ... let people judge for themselves the merits of the work.\" \"The New York Times\" was slightly more generous, stating, \"There are moments of beauty and pleasure in this dramatic miscellany ... the music's innocent sincerity makes it difficult to be put off by its ambitions\". Performed around the world after its London premiere, the \"Liverpool Oratorio\" reached number one on the UK classical chart, \"Music Week\".\n\nIn 1991, McCartney performed a selection of acoustic-only songs on \"MTV Unplugged\" and released a live album of the performance titled \"Unplugged (The Official Bootleg)\". During the 1990s, McCartney collaborated twice with Youth of Killing Joke as the musical duo \"the Fireman\". The two released their first electronica album together, \"Strawberries Oceans Ships Forest\", in 1993. McCartney released the rock album \"Off the Ground\" in 1993. The subsequent New World Tour followed, which led to the release of the \"Paul Is Live\" album later that year.\n\nStarting in 1994, McCartney took a four-year break from his solo career to work on Apple's \"Beatles Anthology\" project with Harrison, Starr and Martin. He recorded a radio series called \"Oobu Joobu\" in 1995 for the American network Westwood One, which he described as \"widescreen radio\". Also in 1995, Prince Charles presented him with an Honorary Fellowship of the Royal College of Music—\"kind of amazing for somebody who doesn't read a note of music\", commented McCartney.\n\nIn 1997, McCartney released the rock album \"Flaming Pie\". Starr appeared on drums and backing vocals in \"Beautiful Night\". Later that year, he released the classical work \"Standing Stone\", which topped the UK and US classical charts. In 1998, he released \"Rushes\", the second electronica album by the Fireman. In 1999, McCartney released \"Run Devil Run\". Recorded in one week, and featuring Ian Paice and David Gilmour, it was primarily an album of covers with three McCartney originals. He had been planning such an album for years, having been previously encouraged to do so by Linda, who had died of cancer in April 1998.\n\nMcCartney did an unannounced performance at the benefit tribute, \"Concert for Linda,\" his wife of 29 years who died a year earlier. It was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 10 April 1999, and was organised by two of her close friends, Chrissie Hynde and Carla Lane. Also during 1999, he continued his experimentation with orchestral music on \"Working Classical\".\n\nIn 2000, he released the electronica album \"Liverpool Sound Collage\" with Super Furry Animals and Youth, using the sound collage and musique concrète techniques that had fascinated him in the mid-1960s. He contributed the song \"Nova\" to a tribute album of classical, choral music called \"A Garland for Linda\" (2000), dedicated to his late wife.\n\nHaving witnessed the 11 September 2001 attacks from the JFK airport tarmac, McCartney was inspired to take a leading role in organising the Concert for New York City. His studio album release in November that year, \"Driving Rain\", included the song \"Freedom\", written in response to the attacks. The following year, McCartney went out on tour with a band that included guitarists Rusty Anderson and Brian Ray, accompanied by Paul \"Wix\" Wickens on keyboards and Abe Laboriel, Jr. on drums. They began the Driving World Tour in April 2002, which included stops in the US, Mexico and Japan. The tour resulted in the double live album \"Back in the US\", released internationally in 2003 as \"Back in the World\". The tour earned a reported $126.2 million, an average of over $2 million per night, and \"Billboard\" named it the top tour of the year. The team continued to play together and McCartney played live with Brian Ray, Rusty Anderson, Abe Laboriel Jr. and Wix Wickens longer than he played live with the Beatles.\n\nIn July 2002, McCartney married Heather Mills. In November, on the first anniversary of George Harrison's death, McCartney performed at the Concert for George. He participated in the National Football League's Super Bowl, performing \"Freedom\" during the pre-game show for Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002 and headlining the halftime show at Super Bowl XXXIX in 2005. The English College of Arms honoured McCartney in 2002 by granting him a coat of arms. His crest, featuring a Liver bird holding an acoustic guitar in its claw, reflects his background in Liverpool and his musical career. The shield includes four curved emblems which resemble beetles' backs. The arms' motto is \"Ecce Cor Meum\", Latin for \"Behold My Heart\". In 2003, the McCartneys had a child, Beatrice Milly.\n\nIn July 2005, he performed at the Live 8 event in Hyde Park, London, opening the show with \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" (with U2) and closing it with \"Drive My Car\" (with George Michael), \"Helter Skelter\", and \"The Long and Winding Road\". In September, he released the rock album \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\", for which he provided most of the instrumentation. In 2006, McCartney released the classical work \"Ecce Cor Meum\". The rock album \"Memory Almost Full\" followed in 2007. In 2008, he released his third Fireman album, \"Electric Arguments\". Also in 2008, he performed at a concert in Liverpool to celebrate the city's year as European Capital of Culture. In 2009, after a four-year break, he returned to touring and has since performed over 80 shows. More than forty-five years after the Beatles first appeared on American television during \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", he returned to the same New York theatre to perform on \"Late Show with David Letterman\". On 9 September 2009, EMI reissued the Beatles catalogue following a four-year digital remastering effort, releasing a music video game called \"\" the same day.\n\nMcCartney's enduring fame has made him a popular choice to open new venues. In 2009, he played to three sold-out concerts at the newly built Citi Field—a venue constructed to replace Shea Stadium in Queens, New York. These performances yielded the double live album \"Good Evening New York City\" later that year.\n\nIn 2010, McCartney opened the Consol Energy Center in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In July 2011, McCartney performed at two sold-out concerts at the new Yankee Stadium. A \"New York Times\" review of the first concert reported that McCartney was \"not saying goodbye but touring stadiums and playing marathon concerts.\" McCartney was commissioned by the New York City Ballet, and In September 2011 he released his first score for dance, a collaboration with Peter Martins called \"Ocean's Kingdom\". Also in 2011, McCartney married Nancy Shevell. He released \"Kisses on the Bottom\", a collection of standards, in February 2012; that same month the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences honoured him as the MusiCares Person of the Year, two days prior to his performance at the 54th Grammy Awards.\n\nMcCartney remains one of the world's top draws. He played to over 100,000 people during two performances in Mexico City in May, with the shows grossing nearly $6 million. In June 2012, McCartney closed Queen Elizabeth's Diamond Jubilee Concert held outside Buckingham Palace, performing a set that included \"Let It Be\" and \"Live and Let Die\". He closed the opening ceremony of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London on 27 July, singing \"The End\" and \"Hey Jude\" and inviting the audience to join in on the coda. Having donated his time, he received £1 from the Olympic organisers.\nOn 12 December, McCartney performed with three former members of Nirvana (Krist Novoselic, Dave Grohl, and Pat Smear) during the closing act of , seen by approximately two billion people worldwide. On 28 August 2013, McCartney released the title track of his upcoming studio album \"New\", which came out in October 2013. A primetime entertainment special was taped 27 January 2014 at the Ed Sullivan Theater with a 9 February 2014 CBS airing. The show featured Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, and celebrated the legacy of the seven-time Grammy-winning group the Beatles and their groundbreaking 1964 first performance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". The show, titled \"\", featured 22 classic Beatles songs as performed by various artists, which included original Beatles McCartney and Starr.\n\nOn 19 May 2014, the news reported that McCartney had been bedridden on doctor's orders due to an unspecified virus, which forced him to cancel a sold-out concert tour of Japan that was scheduled to begin later in the week. The tour would have included a stop at the famed Budokan Hall. McCartney also had to push his June US dates to October, as part of his doctor's order to take it easy to make a full recovery. However, he resumed the tour with a high-energy three hour appearance in Albany, New York, on 5 July 2014. On 14 August 2014, McCartney performed the final concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, California before its demolition. It was the same venue that the Beatles played their final concert in 1966. In 2014, McCartney wrote and performed \"Hope for the Future,\" the ending song for the video game \"Destiny\". In November 2014, a 42-song tribute album titled \"The Art of McCartney\" was released, which features a wide range of artists covering McCartney's solo and Beatles work. Also that year, McCartney collaborated with American recording artist Kanye West on the single \"Only One\", released on 31 December.\n\nIn January 2015, McCartney collaborated with West and Barbadian singer Rihanna on the single \"FourFiveSeconds\". They released a music video for the song in January and performed it live at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards on 8 February 2015. McCartney is a featured guest on West's 2015 single \"All Day\", which also features Theophilus London and Allan Kingdom. On 15 February 2015, McCartney appeared and performed with Paul Simon for the \"Saturday Night Live 40th Anniversary Special\". McCartney and Simon performed the first verse of \"I've Just Seen a Face\" on acoustic guitars, and McCartney later performed \"Maybe I'm Amazed\". McCartney shared lead vocals on the Alice Cooper-led \"Hollywood Vampires\" supergroup's cover of his song \"Come and Get It\" which appears on their debut album, released 11 September 2015. On 10 June 2016, McCartney released the career-spanning collection \"Pure McCartney\". The set includes songs from throughout McCartney's solo career and his work with Wings and the Fireman, and is available in three different formats (2-CD, 4-CD, 4-LP and Digital). The 4-CD version includes 67 tracks, the majority of which were top 40 hits. McCartney appeared in the adventure film \"\", which was released in 2017.\n\nOn 18 January 2017, McCartney filed a suit in United States district court against Sony/ATV Music Publishing seeking to reclaim ownership of his share of the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue beginning in 2018. Under US copyright law, for works published before 1978 the author can reclaim copyrights assigned to a publisher after 56 years.\n\nMcCartney was largely a self-taught musician, and his approach was described by musicologist Ian MacDonald as \"by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored ... [he] produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ... [A] natural melodist—a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony\". McCartney commented, \"I prefer to think of my approach to music as ... rather like the primitive cave artists, who drew without training.\"\n\nMcCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by other bassists, including Sting, Dr. Dre bassist Mike Elizondo, and Colin Moulding of XTC. Best known for primarily using a plectrum or pick, McCartney occasionally plays fingerstyle. He does not use slapping or muting techniques. He was strongly influenced by Motown artists, in particular James Jamerson, whom McCartney called a hero for his melodic style. He was also influenced by Brian Wilson, as he commented: \"because he went to very unusual places\". Another favourite bassist of his is Stanley Clarke.\n\nDuring McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a Höfner 500/1 bass, although from 1965, he favoured his Rickenbacker 4001S for recording. While typically using Vox amplifiers, by 1967 he had also begun using a Fender Bassman for amplification. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a Wal 5-String, which he said made him play more thick-sounding basslines, in contrast to the much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style. He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason. He uses Mesa Boogie bass amplifiers while performing live.\n\nMacDonald identified \"She's a Woman\" as the turning point when McCartney's bass playing began to evolve dramatically, and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out \"Rubber Soul\" as the moment when McCartney's playing exhibited significant progress, particularly on \"The Word\". Bacon and Morgan agreed, calling McCartney's groove on the track \"a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument.\" MacDonald inferred the influence of James Brown's \"Papa's Got a Brand New Bag\" and Wilson Pickett's \"In the Midnight Hour\", American soul tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he \"delivered his most spontaneous bass-part to date\".\n\nBacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song \"Rain\" as \"an astonishing piece of playing ... [McCartney] thinking in terms of both rhythm and 'lead bass' ... [choosing] the area of the neck ... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove.\" MacDonald identified the influence of Indian classical music in \"exotic melismas in the bass part\" on \"Rain\" and described the playing as \"so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track\". By contrast, he recognised McCartney's bass part on the Harrison-composed \"Something\" as creative but overly busy and \"too fussily extemporised\". McCartney identified \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing, particularly on \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\".\n\nMcCartney primarily flatpicks while playing acoustic guitar, though he also uses elements of fingerpicking. Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include \"Yesterday\", \"I'm Looking Through You\", \"Michelle\", \"Blackbird\", \"I Will\", \"Mother Nature's Son\" and \"Rocky Raccoon\". McCartney singled out \"Blackbird\" as a personal favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way: \"I got my own little sort of cheating way of [fingerpicking] ... I'm actually sort of pulling two strings at a time ... I was trying to emulate those folk players.\" He employed a similar technique for \"Jenny Wren\". He played an Epiphone Texan on many of his acoustic recordings, but also used a Martin D-28.\n\nMcCartney played lead guitar on several Beatles recordings, including what MacDonald described as a \"fiercely angular slide guitar solo\" on \"Drive My Car\", which McCartney played on an Epiphone Casino. McCartney said of the instrument, \"if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this.\" He contributed what MacDonald described as \"a startling guitar solo\" on the Harrison composition \"Taxman\" and the \"shrieking\" guitar on \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" and \"Helter Skelter\". MacDonald also praised McCartney's \"coruscating pseudo-Indian\" guitar solo on \"Good Morning Good Morning\". McCartney also played lead guitar on \"Another Girl\".\n\nDuring his years with Wings, McCartney tended to leave electric guitar work to other group members, though he played most of the lead guitar on \"Band on the Run\". In 1990, when asked who his favourite guitar players were he included Eddie Van Halen, Eric Clapton and David Gilmour, stating, \"but I still like Hendrix the best\". He has primarily used a Gibson Les Paul for electric work, particularly during live performances.\n\nOften renowned as one of the greatest singers in pop music, McCartney was ranked the 11th greatest singer of all time by \"Rolling Stone\", voted the 8th greatest singer ever by \"NME\" readers and number 10 by \"Music Radar\" readers in the list of \"the 30 greatest lead singers of all time\". He is known for his belting power, versatility and wide tenor vocal range, spanning over four octaves. Heavily influenced by Little Richard, McCartney's vocals would cross several musical genres throughout his career. On \"Call Me Back Again\", according to Benitez, \"McCartney shines as a bluesy solo vocalist\" while MacDonald called \"I'm Down\" \"a rock-and-roll classic\" that \"illustrates McCartney's vocal and stylistic versatility\". MacDonald described \"Helter Skelter\" as an early attempt at heavy metal, and \"Hey Jude\" as a \"pop/rock hybrid\", pointing out McCartney's \"use of gospel-style melismas\" in the song and his \"pseudo-soul shrieking in the fade-out\". Benitez identified \"Hope of Deliverance\" and \"Put It There\" as examples of McCartney's folk music efforts while musicologist Walter Everett considered \"When I'm Sixty-Four\" and \"Honey Pie\" attempts at vaudeville. MacDonald praised the \"swinging beat\" of the Beatles' twenty-four bar blues song, \"She's a Woman\" as \"the most extreme sound they had manufactured to date\", with McCartney's voice \"at the edge, squeezed to the upper limit of his chest register and threatening to crack at any moment.\" MacDonald described \"I've Got a Feeling\" as a \"raunchy, mid-tempo rocker\" with a \"robust and soulful\" vocal performance and \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\" as \"the last of [the Beatles'] up-tempo rockers\", McCartney's \"belting\" vocals among his best since \"Drive My Car\", recorded three years earlier.\n\nMcCartney also teasingly tried out classical singing, namely singing various renditions of \"Besame Mucho\" with the Beatles. He continued experimenting with various musical and vocal styles throughout his post-Beatles career. \"Monkberry Moon Delight\" was described by Pitchfork's Jayson Greene as \"an absolutely unhinged vocal take, Paul gulping and sobbing right next to your inner ear\", adding that \"it could be a latter-day Tom Waits performance\". Over the years, McCartney has been named a significant vocal influence by a number of renowned artists, including Chris Cornell, Billy Joel, Steven Tyler, Brad Delp and Axl Rose.\n\nMcCartney played piano on several Beatles songs, including \"She's a Woman\", \"For No One\", \"A Day in the Life\", \"Hello, Goodbye\", \"Lady Madonna\", \"Hey Jude\", \"Martha My Dear\", \"Let It Be\" and \"The Long and Winding Road\". MacDonald considered the piano part in \"Lady Madonna\" as reminiscent of Fats Domino, and \"Let It Be\" as having a gospel rhythm. MacDonald called McCartney's Mellotron intro on \"Strawberry Fields Forever\" an integral feature of the song's character. McCartney played a Moog synthesizer on the Beatles song \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" and the Wings track \"Loup (1st Indian on the Moon)\". Ingham described the Wings songs \"With a Little Luck\" and \"London Town\" as being \"full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches\".\n\nMcCartney played drums on the Beatles' songs \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", \"Dear Prudence\", \"Martha My Dear\", \"Wild Honey Pie\" and \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\". He also played all the drum parts on his first and second solo albums \"McCartney\" and \"McCartney II\", as well as on the Wings album \"Band on the Run\" and most of the drums on his solo LP \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\". McCartney also played drums on Paul Jones' rendition of \"And the Sun Will Shine\" in 1968. Using the pseudonym Paul Ramon, which he had first used during the Beatles first tour in Scotland in 1960, McCartney played drums on Steve Miller Band's 1969 tracks \"Celebration Song\" and \"My Dark Hour\".\n\nIn the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend John Dunbar's flat in London, McCartney brought tapes he had compiled at then-girlfriend Jane Asher's home. They included mixes of various songs, musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that Dick James made into a demo for him. Heavily influenced by American avant-garde musician John Cage, McCartney made tape loops by recording voices, guitars and bongos on a Brenell tape recorder and splicing the various loops. He referred to the finished product as \"electronic symphonies\". He reversed the tapes, speeded them up, and slowed them down to create the desired effects, some of which the Beatles later used on the songs \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"The Fool on the Hill\".\n\nMcCartney's earliest musical influences include Little Richard, Elvis Presley, Buddy Holly, Carl Perkins, and Chuck Berry. When asked why the Beatles did not include Presley on the \"Sgt. Pepper\" cover, McCartney replied, \"Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention ... so we didn't put him on the list because he was more than merely a ... pop singer, he was Elvis the King.\" McCartney stated that for his bassline for \"I Saw Her Standing There\", he directly quoted Berry's \"I'm Talking About You\".\n\nMcCartney called Little Richard an idol, whose falsetto vocalisations inspired McCartney's own vocal technique. McCartney said he wrote \"I'm Down\" as a vehicle for his Little Richard impersonation. In 1971, McCartney bought the publishing rights to Holly's catalogue, and in 1976, on the fortieth anniversary of Holly's birth, McCartney inaugurated the annual \"Buddy Holly Week\" in England. The festival has included guest performances by famous musicians, songwriting competitions, drawing contests and special events featuring performances by the Crickets.\n\nWhile at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top accolades for his visual work. However, his lack of discipline negatively affected his academic grades, preventing him from earning admission to art college. During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances. His first contact with the London avant-garde scene was through artist John Dunbar, who introduced McCartney to art dealer Robert Fraser. At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation and met Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, Peter Blake, and Richard Hamilton. McCartney later purchased works by Magritte, using his painting of an apple for the Apple Records logo. McCartney became involved in the renovation and publicising of the Indica Gallery in Mason's Yard, London, which Barry Miles had co-founded and where Lennon first met Yoko Ono. Miles also co-founded \"International Times\", an underground paper that McCartney helped to start with direct financial support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income. Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, \"Many Years From Now\" (1997).\n\nMcCartney became interested in painting after watching artist Willem de Kooning work in de Kooning's Long Island studio. McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in Siegen, Germany, in 1999. The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, Andy Warhol and David Bowie. Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartney's art. In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the Arnolfini Gallery in Bristol, England. In October 2000, McCartney's art debuted in his hometown of Liverpool. McCartney said, \"I've been offered an exhibition of my paintings at the Walker Art Gallery ... where John and I used to spend many a pleasant afternoon. So I'm really excited about it. I didn't tell anybody I painted for 15 years but now I'm out of the closet\". McCartney is lead patron of the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, a school in the building formerly occupied by the Liverpool Institute for Boys.\n\nWhen McCartney was a child, his mother read him poems and encouraged him to read books. His father invited Paul and his brother Michael to solve crosswords with him, to increase their \"word power\", as McCartney said. In 2001, McCartney published \"Blackbird Singing\", a volume of poems and lyrics to his songs for which he gave readings in Liverpool and New York City. In the foreword of the book, he explains: \"When I was a teenager ... I had an overwhelming desire to have a poem published in the school magazine. I wrote something deep and meaningful—which was promptly rejected—and I suppose I have been trying to get my own back ever since\". His first children's book was published by Faber & Faber in 2005, \"High in the Clouds: An Urban Furry Tail\", a collaboration with writer Philip Ardagh and animator Geoff Dunbar. Featuring a squirrel whose woodland home is razed by developers, it had been scripted and sketched by McCartney and Dunbar over several years, as an animated film. \"The Observer\" labelled it an \"anti-capitalist children's book\".\n\nIn 1981, McCartney asked Geoff Dunbar to direct a short animated film called \"Rupert and the Frog Song\"; McCartney was the writer and producer, and he also added some of the character voices. In 1992, he worked with Dunbar on an animated film about the work of French artist Honoré Daumier, which won them a BAFTA award. In 2004, they worked together on the animated short film \"Tropic Island Hum\". The accompanying single, \"Tropic Island Hum\"/\"We All Stand Together\", reached number 21 in the UK.\n\nMcCartney also produced and hosted \"The Real Buddy Holly Story\", a 1985 documentary featuring interviews with Keith Richards, Phil and Don Everly, the Holly family, and others. In 1995, he made a guest appearance on the \"Simpsons\" episode \"Lisa the Vegetarian\" and directed a short documentary about the Grateful Dead.\n\nSince the Rich List began in 1989, McCartney has been the UK's wealthiest musician, with an estimated fortune of £730 million in 2015. In addition to an interest in Apple Corps and MPL Communications, an umbrella company for his business interests, he owns a significant music publishing catalogue, with access to over 25,000 copyrights, including the publishing rights to the musicals \"Guys and Dolls\", \"A Chorus Line\", \"Annie\" and \"Grease\". He earned £40 million in 2003, the highest income that year within media professions in the UK. This rose to £48.5 million by 2005. McCartney's 18-date On the Run Tour grossed £37 million in 2012.\n\nMcCartney signed his first recording contract, as a member of the Beatles, with Parlophone Records, an EMI subsidiary, in June 1962. In the United States, the Beatles recordings were distributed by EMI subsidiary Capitol Records. The Beatles re-signed with EMI for another nine years in 1967. After forming their own record label, Apple Records, in 1968, the Beatles' recordings would be released through Apple although the masters were still owned by EMI. Following the break-up of the Beatles, McCartney's music continued to be released by Apple Records under the Beatles' 1967 recording contract with EMI which ran until 1976. Following the formal dissolution of the Beatles' partnership in 1975, McCartney re-signed with EMI worldwide and Capitol in the US, Canada and Japan, acquiring ownership of his solo catalogue from EMI as part of the deal. In 1979, McCartney signed with Columbia Records in the US and Canada—reportedly receiving the industry's most lucrative recording contract to date, while remaining with EMI for distribution throughout the rest of the world. As part of the deal, CBS offered McCartney ownership of Frank Music, publisher of the catalogue of American songwriter Frank Loesser. McCartney's album sales were below CBS' expectations and reportedly the company lost at least $9 million on the contract. McCartney returned to Capitol in the US in 1985, remaining with EMI until 2006. In 2007, McCartney signed with Hear Music, becoming the label's first artist. He remains there 's \"Kisses on the Bottom\".\n\nIn 1963, Dick James established Northern Songs to publish the songs of Lennon–McCartney. McCartney initially owned 20% of Northern Songs, which became 15% after a public stock offering in 1965. In 1969, James sold a controlling interest in Northern Songs to Lew Grade's Associated Television (ATV) after which McCartney and John Lennon sold their remaining shares although they remained under contract to ATV until 1973. In 1972, McCartney re-signed with ATV for seven years in a joint publishing agreement between ATV and McCartney Music. Since 1979, MPL Communications has published McCartney's songs.\n\nMcCartney and Yoko Ono attempted to purchase the Northern Songs catalogue in 1981, but Grade declined their offer and decided to sell ATV in its entirety to businessman Robert Holmes à Court. Michael Jackson subsequently purchased ATV in 1985. McCartney has criticised Jackson's purchase and handling of Northern Songs over the years. In 1995, Jackson merged his catalogue with Sony for a reported £59,052,000 ($95 million), establishing Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he retained half-ownership. Northern Songs was formally dissolved in 1995, and absorbed into the Sony/ATV catalogue. McCartney receives writers' royalties which together are 33⅓ percent of total commercial proceeds in the US, and which vary elsewhere between 50 and 55 percent. Two of the Beatles' earliest songs—\"Love Me Do\" and \"P.S. I Love You\"—were published by an EMI subsidiary, Ardmore & Beechwood, before signing with James. McCartney acquired their publishing rights from Ardmore in the mid-1980s, and they are the only two Beatles songs owned by MPL Communications.\n\nMcCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' Hamburg days, when they often used Preludin to maintain their energy while performing for long periods. Bob Dylan introduced them to marijuana in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting \"very high\" and \"giggling uncontrollably\". His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics \"another kind of mind\" in \"Got to Get You into My Life\" specifically as a reference to cannabis. During the filming of \"Help!\", McCartney occasionally smoked a joint in the car on the way to the studio during filming, and often forgot his lines. Director Richard Lester overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused. Introduced to cocaine by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", and for about a year total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards.\n\nInitially reluctant to try LSD, McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and took his second \"acid trip\" in March 1967, with Lennon, after a \"Sgt. Pepper\" studio session. He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring, \"It opened my eyes ... [and] made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society.\" He made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, along with the other Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in \"The Times\", which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses.\n\nIn 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney £1,000 for cannabis possession. Soon after, Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for illegal cultivation and a £100 fine. As a result of his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973. Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975, in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8 ounces (200 g) of cannabis in his luggage. They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, they released and deported him without charge. In 1984, while McCartney was on holiday in Barbados, authorities arrested him for possession of marijuana and fined him $200. Upon his return to England, he stated: \"cannabis is ... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are perfectly legal ... I don't think ... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever.\" In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of the drug: \"People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong.\" He did however, decide to quit cannabis in 2015, citing a desire to set a good example for his grandchildren.\n\nSince 1975, McCartney has been a vegetarian; he and his wife Linda were vegetarians for most of their 29-year marriage. They decided to stop consuming meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as they were eating a meal of lamb. Soon after, the couple became outspoken animal rights activists. In his first interview after Linda's death, he promised to continue working for animal rights, and in 1999 he spent £3,000,000 to ensure Linda McCartney Foods remained free of genetically engineered ingredients. In 1995, he narrated the documentary \"Devour the Earth\", written by Tony Wardle. McCartney is a supporter of the animal-rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. He has appeared in the group's campaigns, and in 2009 McCartney narrated a video for them titled \"Glass Walls\", which was harshly critical of slaughterhouses, the meat industry, and their effect on animal welfare. McCartney has also supported campaigns headed by the Humane Society of the United States, Humane Society International, World Animal Protection, and the David Shepherd Wildlife Foundation. As of 2013, McCartney is vegan.\n\nFollowing McCartney's marriage to Mills, he joined her in a campaign against land mines, becoming a patron of Adopt-A-Minefield. In 2006, the McCartneys travelled to Prince Edward Island to raise international awareness of seal hunting. The couple debated with Danny Williams, Newfoundland's then Premier, on \"Larry King Live\", stating that fishermen should stop hunting seals and start seal-watching businesses instead. McCartney also supports the Make Poverty History campaign.\n\nMcCartney has participated in several charity recordings and performances, including the Concerts for the People of Kampuchea, Ferry Aid, Band Aid, Live Aid, Live 8, and the recording of \"Ferry Cross the Mersey\". In 2004, he donated a song to an album to aid the \"US Campaign for Burma\", in support of Burmese Nobel Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi. In 2008, he donated a song to Aid Still Required's CD, organised as an effort to raise funds to assist with the recovery from the devastation caused in Southeast Asia by the 2004 tsunami.\n\nIn 2009, McCartney wrote to Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama, asking him why he was not a vegetarian. As McCartney explained, \"He wrote back very kindly, saying, 'my doctors tell me that I must eat meat'. And I wrote back again, saying, you know, I don't think that's right ... I think he's now being told ... that he can get his protein somewhere else ... It just doesn't seem right—the Dalai Lama, on the one hand, saying, 'Hey guys, don't harm sentient beings ... Oh, and by the way, I'm having a steak.'\"\n\nIn 2012, McCartney joined the anti-fracking campaign Artists Against Fracking.\n\nSave the Arctic is a campaign to protect the Arctic and an international outcry and a renewed focus concern on oil development in the Arctic, attracting the support of more than five million people. This includes McCartney, Archbishop Desmond Tutu and 11 Nobel Peace Prize winners.\n\nIn 2015, following British prime minister David Cameron's decision to give Members of Parliament a free vote on amending the law against fox hunting, McCartney was quoted: \"The people of Britain are behind this Tory government on many things but the vast majority of us will be against them if hunting is reintroduced. It is cruel and unnecessary and will lose them support from ordinary people and animal lovers like myself.\"\n\nIn August 1967, McCartney met the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi at the London Hilton and later went to Bangor in North Wales to attend a weekend initiation conference, where he and the other Beatles learned the basics of Transcendental Meditation. He said, \"The whole meditation experience was very good and I still use the mantra ... I find it soothing.\" In 2009, McCartney and Starr headlined a benefit concert at Radio City Music Hall, raising three million dollars for the David Lynch Foundation to fund instruction in Transcendental Meditation for at-risk youth.\n\nMcCartney has publicly professed support for Everton, and also shown favour for Liverpool. In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said, \"Here's the deal: my father was born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if it comes down to a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton. But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You know what? I am just going to support them both because it's all Liverpool.'\"\n\nMcCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dot Rhone, whom he met at the Casbah club in 1959. According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations. He often chose clothes and make-up for her, encouraging her to grow her hair out like Brigitte Bardot's, and at least once insisting she have it re-styled, to disappointing effect. When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied Cynthia Lennon to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962. The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage; according to Spitz, McCartney, now \"free of obligation\", ended the engagement.\n\nMcCartney first met British actress Jane Asher on 18 April 1963, when a photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the Royal Albert Hall in London. The two began a relationship, and in November of that year he took up residence with Asher at her parents' home at 57 Wimpole Street, London. They had lived there for more than two years before the couple moved to McCartney's own home in St. John's Wood, in March 1966. He wrote several songs while living at the Ashers', including \"Yesterday\", \"And I Love Her\", \"You Won't See Me\" and \"I'm Looking Through You\", the latter three having been inspired by their romance. They had a five-year relationship and planned to marry, but Asher broke off the engagement after she discovered he had become involved with Francie Schwartz.\n\nLinda Eastman was a music fan who once commented, \"all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio.\" At times, she played hookey to see artists such as Fabian, Bobby Darin and Chuck Berry. She became a popular photographer with several rock groups, including the Jimi Hendrix Experience, the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, \"It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked.\" The pair first properly met in 1967 at a Georgie Fame concert at The Bag O'Nails club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, \"The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to ... Pushiness worked for me that night!\" Linda said this about their meeting: \"I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else [that night] ... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up.\" The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, \"We had a lot of fun together ... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment.\" He added, \"We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off ... [it's] miraculous that we made it. But we did.\"\n\nAfter the Beatles' break-up, the two collaborated musically and formed Wings in 1971. They faced derision from some fans and critics, who questioned her inclusion. She was nervous about performing with Paul, who explained, \"she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy.\" Paul defended her musical ability: \"I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard ... She took a couple of lessons and learned some bluesy things ... she did very well and made it look easier than it was ... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic.\" He went on to say, \"We thought we were in it for the fun ... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves.\" Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, \"trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned.\"\n\nThey had four children—Linda's daughter Heather (legally adopted by Paul), Mary, Stella and James—and remained married until Linda's untimely death from breast cancer at age 56 in 1998. After Linda died, Paul stated in the \"Daily Mail\", \"I got a counsellor because I knew that I would need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [about wishing I'd been] perfect all the time ... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies.\"\n\nIn 2002, McCartney married Heather Mills, a former model and anti-landmines campaigner. In 2003, the couple had a child, Beatrice Milly, named in honour of Mills' late mother, and one of McCartney's aunts. They separated in April 2006 and divorced acrimoniously in March 2008. In 2004, he commented on media animosity toward his partners: \"[the British public] didn't like me giving up on Jane Asher ... I married [Linda], a New York divorcee with a child, and at the time they didn't like that\".\n\nMcCartney married New Yorker Nancy Shevell in a civil ceremony at Old Marylebone Town Hall, London, on 9 October 2011. The wedding was a modest event attended by a group of about 30 relatives and friends. The couple had been together since November 2007. Shevell is vice-president of a family-owned transportation conglomerate which owns New England Motor Freight. She is a former member of the board of the New York area's Metropolitan Transportation Authority.\n\nThough McCartney had a strained relationship with Lennon, they briefly became close again in early 1974, and played music together on one occasion. In later years, the two grew apart. While McCartney would often phone Lennon, he was apprehensive about the reception he would receive. During one call, Lennon told him, \"You're all pizza and fairytales!\" In an effort to avoid talking only about business, they often spoke of cats, babies, or baking bread.\n\nOn 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were watching an episode of \"Saturday Night Live\" together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the \"SNL\" studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film \"Two of Us\". McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released \"Double Fantasy\", was friendly; he said this about the call: \"[It is] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't have any kind of blow-up.\"\n\nOn 9 December 1980, McCartney followed the news that Lennon had been murdered the previous night; Lennon's death created a media frenzy around the surviving members of the band. McCartney was leaving an Oxford Street recording studio that evening when he was surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction; he responded: \"It's a drag\". The press quickly criticised him for what appeared to be a superficial response. He later explained, \"When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, \"It's a drag\".' It seemed a very flippant comment to make.\" He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon:\nI talked to Yoko the day after he was killed, and the first thing she said was, \"John was really fond of you.\" The last telephone conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, \"it's only me.\" They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.\nIn 1983, McCartney said, \"I would not have been as typically human and standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die. I would have made more of an effort to try and get behind his \"mask\" and have a better relationship with him.\" He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he said that Lennon's death made the remaining ex-Beatles nervous that they might also be murdered. He told \"Mojo\" magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero. In 1981, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, \"All Those Years Ago\", which featured Starr on drums. McCartney released \"Here Today\" in 1982, a song Everett described as \"a haunting tribute\" to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.\n\nDiscussing his relationship with McCartney, Harrison said, \"Paul would always help along when you'd done his ten songs—then when he got 'round to doing one of my songs, he would help. It was silly. It was very selfish, actually ... There were a lot of tracks, though, where I played bass ... because what Paul would do—if he'd written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say (sometimes he was very difficult): 'Do this'. He'd never give you the opportunity to come out with something.\"\n\nAfter Harrison's death in November 2001, McCartney said he was \"a lovely guy and a very brave man who had a wonderful sense of humour\". He went on to say, \"We grew up together and we just had so many beautiful times together – that's what I am going to remember. I'll always love him, he's my baby brother.\" On the first anniversary of his death, McCartney played Harrison's \"Something\" on a ukulele at the Concert for George. He also performed \"For You Blue\" and \"All Things Must Pass\", and played the piano on Eric Clapton's rendition of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".\n\nDuring a recording session for \"The Beatles\" in 1968, the two got into an argument over McCartney's critique of Starr's drum part for \"Back in the U.S.S.R.\", which contributed to Starr temporarily leaving the band. Starr later commented on working with McCartney: \"Paul is the greatest bass player in the world. But he is also very determined ... [to] get his own way ... [thus] musical disagreements inevitably arose from time to time.\"\n\nMcCartney and Starr collaborated on several post-Beatles projects starting in 1973, when McCartney contributed instrumentation and backing vocals for \"Six O'Clock\", a song McCartney wrote for Starr's album \"Ringo\". McCartney played a kazoo solo on another track from the album \"You're Sixteen\". Starr appeared (as a fictional version of himself) in McCartney's 1984 film \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\", and played drums on most tracks of the soundtrack album, which includes re-recordings of several McCartney-penned Beatles songs. Starr played drums and sang backing vocals on \"Beautiful Night\" from McCartney's 1997 album \"Flaming Pie\". The pair collaborated again in 1998, on Starr's \"Vertical Man\", which featured McCartney's backing vocals on three songs, and instrumentation on one. In 2009, the pair performed \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" at a benefit concert for the David Lynch Foundation. They collaborated on Starr's album \"Y Not\" in 2010. McCartney played bass on \"Peace Dream\", and sang a duet with Starr on \"Walk with You\". On 7 July 2010, Starr was performing at Radio City Music Hall in New York with his All-Starr Band in a concert celebrating his seventieth birthday. After the encores, McCartney made a surprise appearance, performing the Beatles' song \"Birthday\" with Starr's band. On 26 January 2014 McCartney and Starr performed \"Queenie Eye\" from McCartney's new album \"New\" at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. McCartney inducted Starr into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in April 2015, and plays bass on his 2017 album \"Give More Love\".\n\nMcCartney was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988 as a member of the Beatles and again as a solo artist in 1999. In 1979, the \"Guinness Book of World Records\" recognised McCartney as the \"most honored composer and performer in music\", with 60 gold discs (43 with the Beatles, 17 with Wings) and, as a member of the Beatles, sales of over 100 million singles and 100 million albums, and as the \"most successful song writer\", he wrote jointly or solo 43 songs which sold one million or more records between 1962 and 1978. In 2009, \"Guinness World Records\" again recognised McCartney as the \"most successful songwriter\" having written or co-written 188 charted records in the United Kingdom, of which 91 reached the top 10 and 33 made it to number one.\n\nMcCartney has written, or co-written 32 number-one singles on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100: twenty with the Beatles; seven solo or with Wings; one as a co-writer of \"A World Without Love\", a number-one single for Peter and Gordon; one as a co-writer on Elton John's cover of \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\"; one as a co-writer on Stars on 45's \"Medley\"; one as a co-writer with Michael Jackson on \"Say Say Say\"; and one as writer on \"Ebony and Ivory\" performed with Stevie Wonder. , he has 15.5 million RIAA certified units in the United States as a solo artist plus another 10 million with Wings.\n\nCredited with more number ones in the UK than any other artist, McCartney has participated in twenty-four chart topping singles: seventeen with the Beatles, one solo, and one each with Wings, Stevie Wonder, Ferry Aid, Band Aid, Band Aid 20 and \"The Christians et al.\" He is the only artist to reach the UK number one as a soloist (\"Pipes of Peace\"), duo (\"Ebony and Ivory\" with Wonder), trio (\"Mull of Kintyre\", Wings), quartet (\"She Loves You\", the Beatles), quintet (\"Get Back\", the Beatles with Billy Preston) and as part of a musical ensemble for charity (Ferry Aid).\n\n\"Yesterday\" is one of the most covered songs in history with more than 2,200 recorded versions, and according to the BBC, \"the track is the only one by a UK writer to have been aired more than seven million times on American TV and radio and is third in the all-time list ... [and] is the most played song by a British writer [last] century in the US\". His 1968 Beatles composition \"Hey Jude\" achieved the highest sales in the UK that year and topped the US charts for nine weeks, which is longer than any other Beatles single. It was also the longest single released by the band and, at seven minutes eleven seconds, was at that time the longest number one. \"Hey Jude\" is the best-selling Beatles single, achieving sales of over five million copies soon after its release.\n\nIn July 2005, McCartney's performance of \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" with U2 at Live 8 became the fastest-released single in history. Available within forty-five minutes of its recording, hours later it had achieved number one on the UK Official Download Chart.\n\n\nHe was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to music.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Ringo Starr\n\nSir Richard Starkey, (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, songwriter, singer, and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals, usually for one song on an album, including \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", \"Yellow Submarine\", \"Good Night\", and their cover of \"Act Naturally\". He also wrote the Beatles' songs \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \"What Goes On\" and \"Flying\".\n\nStarr was twice afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. In 1955, he entered the workforce and briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he cofounded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958.\n\nWhen the Beatles were formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success with that band in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, when he replaced Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number four hit \"It Don't Come Easy\", and number ones \"Photograph\" and \"You're Sixteen\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \"Back Off Boogaloo\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album \"Ringo\", which was a top ten release in both the UK and the US. He has been featured in a number of documentaries and hosted television shows. He also narrated the first two series of the children's television programme \"Thomas & Friends\" and portrayed \"Mr Conductor\" during the first season of the PBS children's television series \"Shining Time Station\". Since 1989, he has toured with twelve variations of Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band.\n\nStarr's creative contribution to music has received praise from other drummers such as Phil Collins, who described him as \"a great musician\", and Steve Smith, who commented: \"Before Ringo, drum stars were measured by their soloing ability and virtuosity. Ringo's popularity brought forth a new paradigm ... we started to see the drummer as an equal participant in the compositional aspect ... His parts are so signature to the songs that you can listen to a Ringo drum part without the rest of the music and still identify the song.\" He was inducted into the \"Modern Drummer\" Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2011, \"Rolling Stone\" readers named Starr the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. Starr, who was previously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a Beatle in 1988, was inducted for his solo career in 2015, making him one of 21 performers inducted more than once. Starr was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music.\n\nRichard Starkey was born on 7 July 1940, at 9 Madryn Street, in the Dingle, Liverpool. He was the only child of confectioners Richard Starkey (1913–1981) and Elsie Gleave (1914–1987). Elsie enjoyed singing and dancing, a hobby that she shared with her husband, an avid fan of swing. Prior to the birth of their son – whom they nicknamed \"Ritchie\" – the couple had spent much of their free time on the local ballroom circuit, but their regular outings ended soon after his birth. Elsie adopted an overprotective approach to raising her son that bordered on fixation. Subsequently, \"Big Ritchie\", as Starkey's father became known, lost interest in his family, choosing instead to spend long hours drinking and dancing in pubs, sometimes for several consecutive days.\n\nIn an effort to reduce their housing costs, his family moved in 1944 to another neighbourhood in the Dingle, Admiral Grove; soon afterwards his parents separated, and they divorced within the year. Starkey later stated that he has \"no real memories\" of his father, who made little effort to bond with him, visiting as few as three times thereafter. Elsie found it difficult to survive on her ex-husband's support payments of thirty shillings a week, so she took on several menial jobs cleaning houses before securing a position as a local barmaid, an occupation that she held for twelve years.\nAt age six Starkey developed appendicitis. Following a routine appendectomy he contracted peritonitis, causing him to fall into a coma that lasted for days. His recovery spanned twelve months, which he spent away from his family at Liverpool's Myrtle Street children's hospital. Upon his discharge in May 1948, his mother allowed him to stay home, causing him to miss school. At age eight, he remained illiterate, with a poor grasp of mathematics. His lack of education contributed to a feeling of alienation at school, which resulted in his regularly playing truant at Sefton Park. After several years of twice-weekly tutoring from his surrogate sister and neighbour, Marie Maguire Crawford, Starkey had nearly caught up to his peers academically, but in 1953, he contracted tuberculosis and was admitted to a sanatorium, where he remained for two years. During his stay the medical staff made an effort to stimulate motor activity and relieve boredom by encouraging their patients to join the hospital band, leading to his first exposure to a percussion instrument: a makeshift mallet made from a cotton bobbin that he used to strike the cabinets next to his bed. Soon afterwards, he grew increasingly interested in drumming, receiving a copy of the Alyn Ainsworth song \"Bedtime for Drums\" as a convalescence gift from Crawford. Starkey commented: \"I was in the hospital band ... That's where I really started playing. I never wanted anything else from there on ... My grandparents gave me a mandolin and a banjo, but I didn't want them. My grandfather gave me a harmonica ... we had a piano – nothing. Only the drums.\"\n\nStarkey attended St Silas, a Church of England primary school near his house where his classmates nicknamed him \"Lazarus\", and later Dingle Vale Secondary modern school, where he showed an aptitude for art and drama, as well as practical subjects including mechanics. As a result of the prolonged hospitalisations, he fell behind his peers scholastically and was ineligible for the 11-plus qualifying examination required for attendance at a grammar school. On 17 April 1953, Starkey's mother married Harry Graves, an ex-Londoner who had moved to Liverpool following the failure of his first marriage. Graves, an impassioned fan of big band music and their vocalists, introduced Starkey to recordings by Dinah Shore, Sarah Vaughan and Billy Daniels. Graves stated that he and \"Ritchie\" never had an unpleasant exchange between them; Starkey later commented: \"He was great ... I learned gentleness from Harry.\" After the extended hospital stay following Starkey's recovery from tuberculosis, he did not return to school, preferring instead to stay at home and listen to music while playing along by beating biscuit tins with sticks.\n\nBeatles biographer Bob Spitz described Starkey's upbringing as \"a Dickensian chronicle of misfortune\". Houses in the area were \"poorly ventilated, postage-stamp-sized ... patched together by crumbling plaster walls, with a rear door that opened onto an outhouse.\" Crawford commented: \"Like all of the families who lived in the Dingle, he was part of an ongoing struggle to survive.\" The children who lived there spent much of their time at Princes Park, escaping the soot-filled air of their coal-fuelled neighbourhood. Adding to their difficult circumstances, violent crime was an almost constant concern for people living in one of the oldest and poorest inner-city districts in Liverpool. Starkey later commented: \"You kept your head down, your eyes open, and you didn't get in anybody's way.\"\n\nAfter his return home from the sanatorium in late 1955, Starkey entered the workforce but was lacking in motivation and discipline; his initial attempts at gainful employment proved unsuccessful. In an effort to secure himself some warm clothes, he briefly held a railway worker's job, which came with an employer-issued suit. He was supplied with a hat but no uniform and, unable to pass the physical examination, he was laid off and granted unemployment benefits. He then found work as a waiter serving drinks on a day boat that travelled from Liverpool to North Wales, but his fear of conscription into military service led him to quit the job, not wanting to give the Royal Navy the impression that he was suitable for seafaring work. In mid-1956, Graves secured Starkey a position as an apprentice machinist at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. While working at the facility Starkey befriended Roy Trafford, and the two bonded over their shared interest in music. Trafford introduced Starkey to skiffle, and he quickly became a fervent admirer.\n\nSoon after Trafford piqued Starkey's interest in skiffle, the two began rehearsing songs in the manufacturing plant's cellar during their lunch breaks. Trafford recalled: \"I played a guitar, and [Ritchie] just made a noise on a box ... Sometimes, he just slapped a biscuit tin with some keys, or banged on the backs of chairs.\" The pair were joined by Starkey's neighbour and co-worker, the guitarist Eddie Miles, forming the Eddie Miles Band, later renamed Eddie Clayton and the Clayton Squares after a Liverpool landmark. The band performed popular skiffle songs such as \"Rock Island Line\" and \"Walking Cane\", with Starkey raking a thimble across a washboard, creating primitive, driving rhythms. Starkey enjoyed dancing as his parents had years earlier, and he and Trafford briefly took dance lessons at two schools. Though the lessons were short-lived, they provided Starkey and Trafford with an introduction that allowed them to dance competently while enjoying nights out on the town.\n\nOn Christmas Day 1957, Graves gave Starkey a second-hand drum kit consisting of a snare drum, bass drum and a makeshift cymbal fashioned from a rubbish bin lid. Although basic and crude, the kit facilitated his progression as a musician while increasing the commercial potential of the Eddie Clayton band, who went on to book prestigious local gigs before the skiffle craze faded in early 1958 as American rock and roll became popular in the UK.\n\nIn November 1959, Starkey joined Al Caldwell's Texans, a skiffle group who were looking for someone with a proper drum kit so that the group could transition from one of Liverpool's best-known skiffle acts to a full-fledged rock and roll band. They had begun playing local clubs as the Raging Texans, then Jet Storm and the Raging Texans before settling on Rory Storm and the Hurricanes soon before recruiting Starkey. About this time he adopted the stage name Ringo Starr; derived from the rings he wore and also because it implied a country and western influence. His drum solos were billed as \"Starr Time\".\n\nBy early 1960 the Hurricanes had become one of Liverpool's leading bands. In May, they were offered a three-month residency at a Butlins holiday camp in Wales. Although initially reluctant to accept the residency and end his five-year machinist apprenticeship that he had begun four years earlier, Starr eventually agreed to the arrangement. The Butlins gig led to other opportunities for the band, including an unpleasant tour of US Air Force bases in France about which Starr commented: \"The French don't like the British; at least I didn't like them.\" The Hurricanes became so successful that when initially offered a highly coveted residency in Hamburg, they turned it down because of their prior commitment with Butlins. They eventually accepted, joining the Beatles at Bruno Koschmiders Kaiserkeller on 1 October 1960, where Starr first met the band. Storm's Hurricanes were given top-billing over the Beatles, who also received less pay. Starr performed with the Beatles during a few stand-in engagements while in Hamburg. On 15 October 1960, he drummed with John Lennon, Paul McCartney and George Harrison, recording with them for the first time while backing Hurricanes singer Lu Walters on the George Gershwin/DuBose Heyward aria \"Summertime\". During Starr's first stay in Hamburg he also met Tony Sheridan, who valued his drumming abilities to the point of asking Starr to leave the Hurricanes and join his band.\n\nStarr quit Rory Storm and the Hurricanes in January 1962 and briefly joined Sheridan in Hamburg before returning to the Hurricanes for a third season at Butlins. On 14 August, Lennon asked Starr to join the Beatles; he accepted. On 16 August, Beatles manager Brian Epstein fired their drummer, Pete Best, who recalled: \"He said 'I've got some bad news for you. The boys want you out and Ringo in.' He said [Beatles producer] George Martin wasn't too pleased with my playing [and] the boys thought I didn't fit in.\" Starr first performed as a member of the band on 18 August 1962, at a horticultural society dance at Port Sunlight. After his appearance at the Cavern Club the following day, Best fans, upset by his firing, held vigils outside his house and at the club shouting \"Pete forever! Ringo never!\" Harrison received a black eye from one of the upset fans, and Epstein, whose car tyres they had flattened in anger, temporarily hired a bodyguard to ensure his safety.\n\nStarr's first recording session as a member of the Beatles took place on 4 September 1962. He stated that Martin had thought that he \"was crazy and couldn't play ... because I was trying to play the percussion and the drums at the same time, we were just a four piece band\". For their second recording session with Starr, which took place on 11 September 1962, Martin replaced him with session drummer Andy White while recording takes for what would be the two sides of the Beatles' first single, \"Love Me Do\", backed with \"P.S. I Love You\". Starr played tambourine on \"Love Me Do\" and maracas on \"P.S. I Love You\". Concerned about his status in the Beatles, he thought: \"That's the end, they're doing a Pete Best on me.\" Martin later clarified: \"I simply didn't know what Ringo was like and I wasn't prepared to take any risks.\"\n\nBy November 1962 Starr had been accepted by Beatles fans, who were now calling for him to sing songs. Soon afterwards, he began receiving an amount of fan mail equal to that of the others, which helped to secure his position within the band. Starr considered himself fortunate to be on the same \"wavelength\" as the other Beatles: \"I had to be, or I wouldn't have lasted. I had to join them as people [\"sic\"] as well as [as] a drummer.\" He was given a small percentage of Lennon and McCartney's publishing company, Northern Songs, but he derived his primary income during this period from a one-quarter share of Beatles Ltd, a corporation financed by the band's net concert earnings. He commented on the nature of his lifestyle after having achieved success with the Beatles: \"I lived in nightclubs for three years. It used to be a non-stop party.\" Like his father Starr became well known for his late-night dancing and he received considerable praise for his skills.\n\nDuring 1963, the Beatles enjoyed increasing popularity in Britain. In January, their second single, \"Please Please Me\", followed \"Love Me Do\" into the UK charts and a successful television appearance on \"Thank Your Lucky Stars\" earned them favourable reviews, leading to a boost in sales and radio play. By the end of the year, the phenomenon known as Beatlemania had spread throughout the country, and by February 1964 the Beatles had become an international success, performing on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" to a record 73 million viewers. Starr commented: \"In the States I know I went over well. It knocked me out to see and hear the kids waving for me. I'd made it as a personality ... Our appeal ... is that we're ordinary lads.\" He was a source of inspiration for several songs written at the time, including Penny Valentine's \"I Want to Kiss Ringo Goodbye\" and Rolf Harris's \"Ringo for President\". In 1964, \"I love Ringo\" lapel pins outsold all other Beatles merchandising. Furthermore, Starr's insistence on prominently placing the logo of the company that made his prize American import drum kit, Ludwig Drums, on his bass drum gave it such a burst of publicity that the company became a dominant manufacturer of drums for twenty years.\nDuring live performances, the Beatles continued the \"Starr Time\" routine that had been popular among his fans: Lennon would place a microphone in front of Starr's kit in preparation for his spotlight moment and audiences would erupt in screams. When the Beatles made their film debut in \"A Hard Day's Night\", Starr garnered much praise from critics, who considered both his delivery of deadpan one-liners and his non-speaking scenes highlights of the movie. The extended non-speaking sequences had to be arranged by director Richard Lester because of Starr's lack of sleep the previous night, Starr commented: \"Because I'd been drinking all night I was incapable of saying a line.\" Epstein attributed Starr's acclaim to \"the little man's quaintness\". After the release of the Beatles' second feature film, \"Help!\" (1965), Starr won a \"Melody Maker\" poll against his fellow Beatles for his performance as the central character in the film.\n\nDuring an interview with \"Playboy\" in 1964, Lennon explained that Starr had filled in with the Beatles when Best was ill; Starr replied: \"[Best] took little pills to make him ill\". Soon after Starr made the comment, a provoked Best filed a libel suit against him that lasted for four years before the court reached an undisclosed settlement in Best's favour. In June, the Beatles were scheduled to tour Denmark, the Netherlands, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, but Starr became ill the day before the start of the tour. Stricken with a high-grade fever, pharyngitis and tonsillitis, he was admitted to a local hospital where he briefly stayed followed by several days of recuperation at home. During this time, Starr was temporarily replaced for five concert dates by 24-year-old session drummer Jimmie Nicol. Starr was discharged from the hospital, and he rejoined the band in Melbourne on 15 June. He later admitted that he feared he would be permanently replaced during his illness. In August, when the Beatles were introduced to Bob Dylan, Starr was the first to try a cannabis cigarette offered to the band by Dylan, whereas Lennon, McCartney and Harrison were hesitant.\n\nOn 11 February 1965, Starr married Maureen Cox, whom he had first met in 1962. By this time the stress and pressure that went along with Beatlemania had reached a peak for him. He received a telephoned death threat before a show in Montreal, and resorted to positioning his cymbals vertically in an attempt to provide protection from would-be assassins. The constant pressure of the Beatles' fame affected their live performances; Starr commented: \"We were turning into such bad musicians ... there was no groove to it.\" He was also feeling increasingly isolated from the musical activities of his bandmates, who were moving past the traditional boundaries of rock music into territory that often did not require his accompaniment; during recording sessions he spent countless hours playing cards with their road manager Neil Aspinall and roadie Mal Evans while the other Beatles perfected tracks without him. In a letter published in \"Melody Maker\", a fan asked the Beatles to let Starr sing more; he replied: \"[I am] quite happy with my one little track on each album\".\n\nIn August 1966, the Beatles released \"Revolver\", their seventh UK LP. The album included the song \"Yellow Submarine\", which was the only British number one single with Starr as the lead singer. Later that month and owing to the increasing pressures of touring, the Beatles gave their final concert, a 30-minute performance at San Francisco Candlestick Park. Starr commented: \"We gave up touring at the right time. Four years of Beatlemania were enough for anyone.\" By December, he had moved into an upscale estate on three acres in Saint George's Hill called Sunny Heights. Although he had equipped the house with many luxury items, including numerous televisions, light machines, film projectors and stereo equipment, a billiard table, go-kart track and a bar named the Flying Cow, he did not include a drum kit; he explained: \"When we don't record, I don't play\".\n\nFor the Beatles' seminal 1967 album, \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\", Starr sang lead vocals on the Lennon–McCartney composition \"With a Little Help from My Friends\". Although the Beatles had enjoyed widespread commercial and critical success with \"Sgt. Pepper\", the long hours they spent recording the LP contributed to Starr's increased feeling of alienation within the band, he commented: \"[It] wasn't our best album. That was the peak for everyone else, but for me it was a bit like being a session musician ... They more or less direct me in the style I can play.\" His inability to compose new material led to his input being minimised during recording sessions; he often found himself relegated to adding minor percussion effects to songs by McCartney, Lennon and Harrison. During his down-time Starr worked on his guitar playing; he commented: \"I jump into chords that no one seems to get into. Most of the stuff I write is twelve-bar\".\n\nEpstein's death in August 1967 left the Beatles without management; Starr remarked: \"[It was] a strange time for us, when it's someone who we've relied on in the business, where we never got involved.\" Soon afterwards, the band began an ill-fated film project, \"Magical Mystery Tour\". Starr's growing interest in photography at the time led to his billing as the movie's Director of Photography, and his participation in the film's editing was matched only by McCartney.\n\nIn February 1968, Starr became the first Beatle to sing on another artist's show without the other three present. He sang the Buck Owens hit \"Act Naturally\", and performed a duet with Cilla Black, \"Do You Like Me Just a Little Bit?\" on her BBC One television programme, \"Cilla\". Later that year Apple Records released \"The Beatles\", commonly known as the \"White Album\". Creative inspiration for the double LP came in part from the band's recent interactions with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. While attending an intermediate course at his ashram in Rishikesh, India, they enjoyed one of their most prolific writing periods, composing most of the album's songs there. Starr left after 10 days, but completed his first recorded Beatles song, \"Don't Pass Me By\". During the recording of the White Album, relations within the band became openly divisive. As the sessions progressed, their collective group dynamic began to decay; at times only one or two Beatles were involved in the recording for a track. Starr had grown weary of McCartney's increasingly overbearing approach and Lennon's passive-aggressive behaviour, which was exacerbated by Starr's resentment of Yoko Ono near-constant presence. After one particularly difficult session during which McCartney had harshly criticised his drumming, Starr quit the band for two weeks, taking a holiday with his family in Sardinia on a boat loaned by Peter Sellers. During a lunch break the chef served octopus, which Starr refused to eat. A subsequent conversation with the ship's captain regarding the behaviours of the animal served as the inspiration for his \"Abbey Road\" composition, \"Octopus's Garden\", which Starr wrote on guitar during the trip. He returned to the studio two weeks later, to find that Harrison had covered his drum kit in flowers as a welcome-back gesture.\n\nDespite a temporary return to congenial relations during the completion of the White Album, production of the Beatles' fourth feature film, \"Let It Be\", and its accompanying LP, strained the already tenuous cohesion within the band. On 20 August 1969, the Beatles gathered for the final time at Abbey Road Studios for a mixing session for \"I Want You\". At a business meeting on 20 September, Lennon told the others that he had quit the Beatles, although the band's break-up would not become public knowledge until McCartney's announcement on 10 April 1970 that he was leaving the Beatles.\n\nShortly before McCartney's announcement in April 1970, he and Starr fell out due to McCartney's refusal to cede the release date of his eponymous solo album to allow for Starr's debut, \"Sentimental Journey\", and the Beatles' \"Let It Be\". Starr's album – composed of renditions of pre-rock standards that included musical arrangements by Quincy Jones, Maurice Gibb, George Martin and McCartney – peaked at number seven in the UK and number 22 in the US. Starr followed \"Sentimental Journey\" with the country-inspired \"Beaucoups of Blues\", engineered by Scotty Moore and featuring renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake. Despite receiving some favourable reviews, the album failed to meet with commercial success. Starr subsequently combined his musical activities with developing a career as a film actor.\n\nStarr played drums on Lennon's \"John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band\" (1970), Ono's \"Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band\" (1970), and on Harrison's albums \"All Things Must Pass\" (1970), \"Living in the Material World\" (1973) and \"Dark Horse\" (1974). In 1971, Starr participated in the Concert for Bangladesh, organised by Harrison, and with him co-wrote the hit single \"It Don't Come Easy\", which reached number four in both the US and the UK. The following year he released his most successful UK hit, \"Back Off Boogaloo\" (again produced and co-written by Harrison), which peaked at number two (US number nine). Having become friends with the English singer Marc Bolan, Starr made his directorial debut with the 1972 T. Rex documentary \"Born to Boogie\".\n\nIn 1973, Starr earned two number one hits in the US: \"Photograph\", a UK number eight hit that he co-wrote with Harrison, and \"You're Sixteen\", written by the Sherman Brothers. Starr's third million-selling single, \"You're Sixteen\" was released in the UK in February 1974 where it peaked at number four in the charts. Both songs appeared on Starr's debut rock album, \"Ringo\", which was produced by Richard Perry and featured writing and musical contributions from Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. A commercial and critical success, the LP also included \"Oh My My\", a US number five. The album reached number seven in the UK and number two in the US. Author Peter Doggett describes \"Ringo\" as a template for Starr's solo career, saying that, as a musician first rather than a songwriter, \"he would rely on his friends and his charm, and if both were on tap, then the results were usually appealing.\"\n\n\"Goodnight Vienna\" followed in 1974 and was also successful, reaching number eight in the US and number 30 in the UK. Featuring musical contributions from Lennon, Elton John and Harry Nilsson, the album included a cover of the Platters' \"Only You (And You Alone)\", which peaked at number six in the US and number 28 in the UK, and Hoyt Axton's \"No No Song\", which was a US number three and Starr's seventh consecutive top-ten hit. The John-written \"Snookeroo\" failed to chart in the UK, however, when issued there as the second single from the album. During this period Starr became romantically involved with Lynsey de Paul. He played tambourine on a song she wrote and produced for Vera Lynn, \"Don't You Remember When\", and he inspired another De Paul song, \"If I Don't Get You the Next One Will\", which she described as being about revenge after he missed a dinner appointment with her because he was asleep in his office.\n\nStarr founded the record label Ring O' Records in 1975. The company signed eleven artists and released fifteen singles and five albums between 1975 and 1978, including works by David Hentschel, Graham Bonnet and Rab Noakes. The commercial impact of Starr's own career diminished over the same period, however, although he continued to record and remained a familiar celebrity presence. Speaking in 2001, he attributed this downward turn to his \"[not] taking enough interest\" in music, saying of himself and friends such as Nilsson and Keith Moon: \"We weren't musicians dabbling in drugs and alcohol; now we were junkies dabbling in music.\" Starr, Nilsson and Moon were members of a drinking club, the Hollywood Vampires.\n\nIn November 1976 Starr appeared as a guest at the Band's farewell concert, featured in the 1978 Martin Scorsese documentary \"The Last Waltz\". Also in 1976, Starr issued \"Ringo's Rotogravure\", the first release under his new contract with Atlantic Records for the North American market and Polydor for all other territories. The album was produced by Arif Mardin and featured compositions by Lennon, McCartney and Harrison. Starr promoted the release heavily, yet \"Rotogravure\" and its accompanying singles failed to chart in the UK. In America, the LP produced two minor hits, \"A Dose of Rock 'n' Roll\" (number 26) and a cover of \"Hey! Baby\" (number 74), and achieved moderate sales, reaching a chart position of 28. Its disappointing performance inspired Atlantic to revamp Starr's formula; the result was a curious blend of disco and 1970s pop, titled \"Ringo the 4th\" (1977). The album was a commercial disaster, failing to chart in the UK and peaking at number 162 in the US. In 1978 Starr released \"Bad Boy\", which reached a disappointing number 129 in the US and again failed to place on the UK albums chart.\n\nFollowing Lennon's murder in December 1980, Harrison modified the lyrics of a song he had originally written for Starr, \"All Those Years Ago\", as a tribute to their former bandmate. Released as a Harrison single in 1981, the track, which included Starr's drum part and overdubbed backing vocals by Paul and Linda McCartney, peaked at number two in the US charts and number 13 in the UK. Later that year, Starr released \"Stop and Smell the Roses\", featuring songs produced by Nilsson, McCartney, Harrison, Ronnie Wood and Stephen Stills. The album's lead single, the Harrison-composed \"Wrack My Brain\", reached number 38 in the US charts, but failed to chart in the UK. Lennon had offered a pair of songs for inclusion on the album – \"Nobody Told Me\" and \"Life Begins at 40\" – but following his death, Starr did not feel comfortable recording them. Soon after the murder, Starr and his girlfriend Barbara Bach flew to New York City to be with Lennon's widow Yoko Ono.\n\nFollowing \"Stop and Smell the Roses\", Starr's recording projects were beset with problems. After completing \"Old Wave\" in 1982 with producer Joe Walsh, he was unable to find a record company willing to release the album in the UK or the US. In 1987, he abandoned sessions in Memphis for a planned country album, produced by Chips Moman, after which Moman was blocked by a court injunction from issuing the recordings. Starr nevertheless maintained a high public profile through his narration over 1984–86 of the popular children's series \"Thomas & Friends\", a Britt Allcroft production based on the books by the Reverend W. Awdry. For a single season in 1989, Starr also portrayed the character Mr. Conductor in the programme's American spin-off, \"Shining Time Station\".\n\nIn 1985, Starr performed with his son Zak as part of Artists United Against Apartheid on the recording \"Sun City\", and, with Harrison and Eric Clapton, was among the special guests on Carl Perkins' TV special \"\". In 1987, he played drums on Harrison's Beatles pastiche \"When We Was Fab\" and also appeared in Godley & Creme's innovative video clip for the song. The same year, Starr joined Harrison, Clapton, Jeff Lynne and Elton John in a performance at London's Wembley Arena for the Prince's Trust charity. In January 1988, he attended the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony in New York, with Harrison and Ono (the latter representing Lennon), to accept the Beatles' induction into the Hall of Fame.\n\nDuring October and November 1988, Starr and Bach attended a detox clinic in Tucson, Arizona, each receiving a six-week treatment for alcoholism. He later commented on his longstanding addiction: \"Years I've lost, absolute years … I've no idea what happened. I lived in a blackout.\" Having embraced sobriety, Starr focused on re-establishing his career by making a return to touring. On 23 July 1989, Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band gave their first performance to an audience of ten thousand in Dallas, Texas. Setting a pattern that would continue over the following decades, the band consisted of Starr and an assortment of musicians who had been successful in their own right with popular songs at different times. The concerts interchanged Starr's singing, including selections of his Beatles and solo songs, with performances of each of the other artists' well-known material, the latter incorporating either Starr or another musician as drummer.\n\nThe first All-Starr excursion led to the release of \"Ringo Starr and His All-Starr Band\" (1990), a compilation of live performances from the 1989 tour. Also in 1990, Starr recorded a version of the song \"I Call Your Name\" for a television special marking the 10th anniversary of John Lennon's death and the 50th anniversary of Lennon's birth. The track, produced by Lynne, features a supergroup composed of Lynne, Tom Petty, Joe Walsh and Jim Keltner.\n\nThe following year, Starr made a cameo appearance on \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Brush with Greatness\" and contributed an original song, \"You Never Know\", to the soundtrack of the John Hughes film \"Curly Sue\". In 1992, Starr released his first studio album in nine years, \"Time Takes Time\", which was produced by Phil Ramone, Don Was, Lynne and Peter Asher and featured guest appearances by various stars including Brian Wilson and Harry Nilsson. The album failed to achieve commercial success, although the single \"Weight of the World\" peaked at number 74 in the UK, marking Starr's first appearance on the singles chart there since \"Only You\" in 1974.\n\nIn 1994, Starr began a collaboration with the surviving former Beatles for the \"Beatles Anthology\" project. They recorded two new Beatles songs built around solo vocal and piano tapes recorded by Lennon and gave lengthy interviews about the Beatles' career. Released in December 1995, \"Free as a Bird\" was the first new Beatles single since 1970. In March 1996, they released a second single, \"Real Love\". The temporary reunion ended when Harrison refused to participate in the completion of a third song. Starr then played drums on McCartney's 1997 album \"Flaming Pie\". Among the tracks to which he contributed, \"Little Willow\" was a song McCartney wrote about Starr's ex-wife Maureen, who died in 1994, while \"Really Love You\" was the first official release ever credited to McCartney–Starkey.\n\nIn 1998, Starr released two albums on the Mercury label. The studio album \"Vertical Man\" marked the beginning of a nine-year partnership with Mark Hudson, who produced the album and, with his band the Roundheads, formed the core of the backing group on the recordings. In addition, many famous guests joined on various tracks, including Martin, Petty, McCartney and, in his final appearance on a Starr album, Harrison. Most of the songs were written by Starr and the band. Joe Walsh and the Roundheads joined Starr for his appearance on \"VH1 Storytellers\", which was released as an album under the same name. During the show, he performed greatest hits and new songs and told anecdotes relating to them. Starr's final release for Mercury was the 1999 Christmas-themed \"I Wanna Be Santa Claus\". The album was a commercial failure, although the record company chose not to issue it in Britain.\n\nStarr was inducted into the Percussive Arts Society Hall of Fame in 2002, joining an elite group including Buddy Rich, William F. Ludwig Sr. and William F. Ludwig Jr. On 29 November 2002 (the first anniversary of Harrison's death), he performed \"Photograph\" and a cover of Carl Perkins' \"Honey Don't\" at the \"Concert for George\" held in the Royal Albert Hall, London. Early the following year, Starr released the album \"Ringo Rama\", which contained a song he co-wrote as a tribute to Harrison, \"Never Without You\". Also in 2003, Starr formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson. The label was not prolific, but their first signing was Liam Lynch, who produced a 2003 LP entitled \"Fake Songs\".\n\nStarr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas's annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program. According to NORAD officials, he was \"a Starr in the east\" who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa-tracking tradition.\n\nStarr's 2005 release \"Choose Love\" eschewed the star-guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US. That same year, Liverpool's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr's birthplace, 9Madryn Street, stating that it had \"no historical significance\". The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.\n\nStarr released the album \"Liverpool 8\" in January 2008, coinciding with the start of Liverpool's year as the European Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart.<ref name=\"Erlewine/Liverpool8\"></ref> Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool's appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth. Later that year, he was the object of further criticism in the press for posting a video on his website in which he harangued fans and autograph hunters for sending him items to sign.\n\nIn April 2009, Starr reunited with McCartney at the David Lynch Foundation's \"Change Begins Within\" benefit concert, held at New York's Radio City Music Hall. Having played his own set beforehand, Starr joined McCartney for the finale and performed \"With a Little Help from My Friends\", among other songs. Starr also appeared on-stage during Microsoft's June 2009 E3 press conference with Yoko Ono, McCartney and Olivia Harrison to promote \"\" video game. In November 2009, Starr once again performed the voice of Thomas the Tank Engine for \"The Official BBC Children in Need Medley\".\n\nIn 2010 Starr self-produced and released his fifteenth studio album, \"Y Not\", which included the track \"Walk with You\" and featured a vocal contribution from McCartney. Later that year, he appeared during \"\" as a celebrity phone operator. On 7 July 2010, Starr celebrated his 70th birthday at Radio City Music Hall with another All-Starr Band concert, topped with friends and family joining him on stage including Ono, his son Zak, and McCartney.\n\nStarr recorded a cover of Buddy Holly's \"Think It Over\" for the 2011 tribute album \"\". In January 2012, he released the album \"Ringo 2012\". Later that year, Starr announced that his All-Starr Band would tour the Pacific Rim during 2013 with select dates in New Zealand, Australia and Japan; it was his first performance in Japan since 1996, and his debut in both New Zealand and Australia.\n\nIn January 2014, Starr joined McCartney for a special performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles, where they performed the song \"Queenie Eye\". That summer Starr toured Canada and the US with an updated version of the Twelfth All-Starr Band, featuring multi-instrumentalist Warren Ham instead of saxophonist Mark Rivera. In July, Starr became involved in \"#peacerocks\", an anti-violence campaign started by fashion designer John Varvatos, in conjunction with the David Lynch Foundation.<ref name=\"instyle7/14\"></ref> In September 2014, Starr won at the \"GQ\" Men of the Year Awards for his humanitarian work with the David Lynch Foundation.\n\nIn January 2015, Starr tweeted the title of his new 11-track studio album, \"Postcards from Paradise\". The album came just weeks in advance of Starr's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and was released on 31 March 2015 to mixed to positive reviews. Later that month, Ringo and his band announced a forthcoming Summer 2016 Tour of the US. Full production began in June 2016 in Syracuse.\n\nOn 7 July 2017 (his 77th birthday), he released a new single entitled \"Give More Love,\" followed by, on 15 September 2017 (by UM), his nineteenth studio album also entitled \"Give More Love\". The album features appearances by Starr's former Beatles bandmate Paul McCartney, as well as frequent collaborators such as Joe Walsh, Dave Stewart, Gary Nicholson, and members of the All-Starr Band.\n\nDuring his youth, Starr had been a devoted fan of skiffle and blues music, but by the time he joined the Texans in 1958, he had developed a preference for rock and roll. He was also influenced by country artists, including Hank Williams, Buck Owens and Hank Snow, and jazz artists such as Chico Hamilton and Yusef Lateef, whose compositional style inspired Starr's fluid and energetic drum fills and grooves. While reflecting on Buddy Rich, Starr commented: \"He does things with one hand that I can't do with nine, but that's technique. Everyone I talk to says 'What about Buddy Rich?' Well, what about him? Because he doesn't turn me on.\" He stated that he \"was never really into drummers\", but identified Cozy Cole 1958 cover of Benny Goodman \"Topsy Part Two\" as \"the one drum record\" he bought.\n\nStarr's first musical hero was Gene Autry, about whom he commented: \"I remember getting shivers up my back when he sang, 'South of the Border'\". By the early 1960s he had become an ardent fan of Lee Dorsey. In November 1964, Starr told \"Melody Maker\": \"Our music is second-hand versions of negro music ... Ninety per cent of the music I like is coloured.\"\n\nThe overall effect of Starr's drumming for the Beatles has received high praise from notable drummers. Starr commented: \"I'm no good on the technical things ... I'm your basic offbeat drummer with funny fills ... because I'm really left-handed playing a right-handed kit. I can't roll around the drums because of that.\" Beatles producer George Martin stated: \"Ringo hit good and hard and used the tom-tom well, even though he couldn't do a roll to save his life\", although Martin later added, \"He's got tremendous feel. He always helped us to hit the right tempo for a song, and gave it that support – that rock-solid back-beat – that made the recording of all the Beatles' songs that much easier.\" Starr commented: \"I've always believed that the drummer is not there to interpret the song\"; comparing his drumming to painting, he stated: \"I am the foundation, and then I put a bit of glow here and there ... If there's a gap, I want to be good enough to fill it.\"\n\nIn 2011, readers of \"Rolling Stone\" magazine voted Starr as the fifth-greatest drummer of all time. Journalist Robyn Flans, writing for the Percussive Arts Society, stated: \"I cannot count the number of drummers who have told me that Ringo inspired their passion for drums\". Drummer Steve Smith commented on Starr's musical contribution:\n\nStarr has said that his favourite drummer is Jim Keltner, with whom he first played at the Concert for Bangladesh in August 1971. The pair subsequently played together as a double-drumming team on some of Harrison's recordings during the 1970s, on \"Ringo\" and other albums by Starr, and on the early All-Starr Band tours. For \"Ringo's Rotogravure\" in 1976, Starr coined a term to describe their percussive combination, crediting himself as \"Thunder\" and Keltner as \"Lightnin'\".\n\nStarr influenced Phil Collins, the drummer for Genesis, who said: \"I think he's vastly underrated, Ringo. The drum fills on 'A Day in the Life' are very, very complex things. You could take a great drummer from today and say, 'I want it like that', and they really wouldn't know what to do.\" In September 1980, Lennon told \"Rolling Stone\":\n\nIn his extensive survey of the Beatles' recording sessions, historian Mark Lewisohn confirmed that Starr was both proficient and remarkably reliable and consistent. According to Lewisohn, there were fewer than a dozen occasions in the Beatles' eight-year recording career where session breakdowns were caused by Starr making a mistake, while the vast majority of takes were stopped owing to mistakes by the other three Beatles. Starr is considered to have influenced various modern drumming techniques, such as the matched grip, tuning the drums lower, and using muffling devices on tonal rings, as well as placing the drums on high risers for visibility as part of the band. According to Ken Micallef and Donnie Marshall, co-authors of \"Classic Rock Drummers\": \"Ringo's fat tom sounds and delicate cymbal work were imitated by thousands of drummers.\"\n\nStarr sang lead vocals for a song on most of the Beatles' studio albums as part of an attempt to establish a vocal personality for each band member. In many cases, Lennon or McCartney wrote the lyrics and melody especially for him, as they did for \"Yellow Submarine\" from \"Revolver\" and \"With a Little Help from My Friends\" on \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\". These melodies were tailored to Starr's limited baritone vocal range. Because of his distinctive voice, Starr rarely performed backing vocals during his time with the Beatles, but they can be heard on songs such as \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\" and \"Carry That Weight\". He is also the lead vocalist on his compositions \"Don't Pass Me By\" and \"Octopus's Garden\". In addition, he sang lead on \"I Wanna Be Your Man\", \"Boys\", \"Matchbox\", \"Honey Don't\", \"Act Naturally\", \"Good Night\" and \"What Goes On\".\n\nStarr's idiosyncratic turns of phrase, or \"Ringoisms\" as they became known, such as \"a hard day's night\" and \"tomorrow never knows\", were used as song titles by the Beatles, particularly by Lennon. McCartney commented: \"Ringo would do these little malapropisms, he would say things slightly wrong, like people do, but his were always wonderful, very lyrical ... they were sort of magic\". As well as inspiring his bandmates' creativity in this way, Starr occasionally contributed lyrics to unfinished Lennon–McCartney songs, such as the line \"darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there\" from \"Eleanor Rigby\".\n\nStarr is credited as the sole composer of two Beatles songs: \"Octopus's Garden\" and \"Don't Pass Me By\". Starr is credited as a co-writer of \"What Goes On\", \"Flying\" and \"Dig It\". On material issued after the break-up, Starr received a writing credit for \"Taking a Trip to Carolina\" and received joint songwriting credits with the other three Beatles for \"12-Bar Original\", \"Los Paranoias\", \"Christmas Time (Is Here Again)\", \"Suzy Parker\", heard in the \"Let It Be\" film, and \"Jessie's Dream\" from the \"Magical Mystery Tour\" film.\n\nWhen Starr married Maureen Cox in 1965, Beatles manager Brian Epstein served as best man, with Starr's stepfather Harry Graves and fellow Beatle George Harrison as witnesses. Soon afterwards, the couple's matrimony became the subject of a US novelty song, \"Treat Him Tender, Maureen\", by the Chicklettes. Starr and Maureen had three children together: Zak (born 13 September 1965), Jason (born 19 August 1967) and Lee (born 11 November 1970). In 1971, Starr purchased Lennon's former home, Tittenhurst Park at Sunninghill in Berkshire and moved his family there. Following Starr's repeated infidelities, the couple divorced in 1975. Maureen died from leukaemia at age 48 in 1994.\n\nIn 1980, while on the set of the film \"Caveman\", Starr met actress Barbara Bach; they were married on 27 April 1981. In 1985, he was the first of the Beatles to become a grandfather upon the birth of Zak's daughter, Tatia Jayne Starkey. Zak Starkey is also a drummer, and during his father's regular absences, he spent time with The Who's Keith Moon. Zak has performed with his father during some All-Starr Band tours. In total, Ringo Starr has seven grandchildren – one from Zak, three from Jason and three from Lee. In 2016, he was the first Beatle to become a great-grandfather.\n\nStarr and Bach split their time between homes in Cranleigh, Surrey; Los Angeles; and Monte Carlo. In the \"Sunday Times Rich List 2011\", Starr was listed at number 56 in the UK with an estimated personal wealth of £150 million. In 2012, Starr was estimated to be the wealthiest drummer in the world. In 2014 Starr announced that his 200-acre Surrey estate at Rydinghurst, with its Grade II-listed Jacobean house, was for sale. However, he retains a property in the London district of Chelsea off King's Road, and he and Bach continue to divide their time between London and Los Angeles.\n\nIn December 2015, Starr and Bach auctioned some of their personal and professional items to the public via Julien's Auctions in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"Julien/Property\"></ref> Highlights of the collection included Starr's first Ludwig Black Oyster Pearl drum kit; instruments given to him by Harrison, Lennon and Marc Bolan; and a first-pressing copy of the Beatles' White Album numbered \"0000001\". The auction raised over $9 million, a portion of which was set aside for the Lotus Foundation, a charity founded by Starr and Bach.\n\nIn 2016, Starr expressed his support for the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, explaining: \"I thought the European Union was a great idea, but I didn’t see it going anywhere lately.\" In 2017 he described his impatience for Britain to \"get on with\" Brexit, declaring that \"to be in control of your country is a good move.\"\n\nDuring the 1965 Birthday Honours for Queen Elizabeth II, Starr and the other Beatles were appointed Members of the Order of the British Empire (MBE); they received their insignia from the Queen at an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 26 October. He and the other Beatles were cumulatively nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Newcomer for their performances in the 1964 film \"A Hard Day's Night\". In 1971, the Beatles received an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score for the film \"Let It Be\". The minor planet 4150 Starr, discovered on 31 August 1984 by Brian A. Skiff at the Anderson Mesa Station of the Lowell Observatory, was named in Starr's honour. Starr was nominated for a 1989 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a Children's Series for his role as Mr. Conductor in the television series \"Shining Time Station\".\n\nIn 2015, twenty-three years after he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as one of the Beatles, Starr became the last Beatle to be inducted for a solo career. During the 50th Grammy Awards, Starr, George Martin and his son Giles accepted the Best Compilation Soundtrack award for \"Love\". On 9 November 2008, Starr accepted a Diamond Award on behalf of the Beatles during the 2008 World Music Awards ceremony in Monaco. On 8 February 2010, he was honoured with the 2,401st star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame by the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce. It is located at 1750 North Vine Street, in front of the Capitol Records building, as are the stars for Lennon, McCartney and Harrison.\n\nStarr was appointed a Knight Bachelor in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to music.\n\nStarr has received praise from critics and movie industry professionals regarding his acting; director and producer Walter Shenson called him \"a superb actor, an absolute natural\". By the mid-1960s, Starr had become a connoisseur of film. In addition to his roles in \"A Hard Day's Night\" (1964), \"Help!\" (1965), \"Magical Mystery Tour\" (1967) and \"Let It Be\" (1970), Starr also acted in \"Candy\" (1968), \"The Magic Christian\" (1969), \"Blindman\" (1971), \"Son of Dracula\" (1974) and \"Caveman\" (1981). In 1971, he starred as Larry the Dwarf in Frank Zappa's \"200 Motels\" and was featured in Harry Nilsson's animated film \"The Point!\" He co-starred in \"That'll Be the Day\" (1973) as a Teddy Boy and appeared in \"The Last Waltz\", the Martin Scorsese documentary film about the 1976 farewell concert of the Band.\n\nStarr played the Pope in Ken Russell's \"Lisztomania\" (1975), and a fictionalised version of himself in McCartney's \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" in 1984. Starr appeared as himself and a downtrodden alter-ego Ognir Rrats in \"Ringo\" (1978), an American-made television comedy film based loosely on \"The Prince and the Pauper\". For the 1979 documentary film on the Who, \"The Kids Are Alright\", Starr appeared in interview segments with fellow drummer Keith Moon.\n\nSince the breakup of the Beatles, Starr has released 19 solo studio albums:\n\n\n"

                "T-bone steak\n\nThe T-bone and porterhouse are steaks of beef cut from the short loin (called the sirloin in Commonwealth countries). Both steaks include a \"T-shaped\" bone with meat on each side. Porterhouse steaks are cut from the rear end of the short loin and thus include more tenderloin steak, along with (on the other side of the bone) a large strip steak. T-bone steaks are cut closer to the front, and contain a smaller section of tenderloin. The smaller portion of a T-bone, when sold alone, is known as a filet mignon, especially if it's cut from the small forward end of the tenderloin.\n\nThere is little agreement among experts on how large the tenderloin must be to differentiate a T-bone steak from porterhouse. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's \"Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications\" state that the tenderloin of a porterhouse must be at least thick at its widest, while that of a T-bone must be at least . However, steaks with a large tenderloin are often called a \"T-bone\" in restaurants and steakhouses despite technically being porterhouse.\n\nOwing to their large size and the fact that they contain meat from two of the most prized cuts of beef (the short loin and the tenderloin), T-bone steaks are generally considered one of the highest quality steaks, and prices at steakhouses are accordingly high. Porterhouse steaks are even more highly valued owing to their larger tenderloin.\n\nIn the United States, the T-bone has the meat-cutting classification IMPS 1174; the porterhouse is IMPS 1173.\n\nIn British usage, followed in Commonwealth countries, \"porterhouse\" often means a UK sirloin steak (i.e. US strip steak) on the bone, i.e. without the tenderloin on the other side of T-bone. However, nowadays some British on-line butchers also offer American style porterhouse steaks.\n\nThe origin of the term \"porterhouse\" is contentious, with several cities and establishments claiming to have coined it. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the etymology from proprietor Martin Morrison serving large T-bones in his Pearl Street (Manhattan) \"Porter House\" around 1814, while noting the lack of contemporary evidence to support the tale. This origin story gained traction in the late 19th century, but others contend a Cambridge, Massachusetts hotel and restaurant proprietor named Zachariah B. Porter lent his name to the cut of beef, and others claim the steak takes its name from various 19th Century U.S. hotels or restaurants called Porter House, such as the Porter House Hotel in Flowery Branch, Georgia.\n\nTo cut a T-bone from butchered cattle, a lumbar vertebra is sawn in half through the vertebral column. The downward prong of the 'T' is a transverse process of the vertebra, and the flesh surrounding it is the spinal muscles. The small semicircle at the top of the 'T' is half of the vertebral foramen.\n\nT-bone and porterhouse steaks are suited to fast, dry heat cooking methods, such as grilling or broiling. Since they contain a small amount of collagen relative to other cuts, longer cooking times are not necessary to tenderize the meat. The bone also conducts heat within the meat so that it cooks more evenly and prevents meat drying out and shrinking during cooking. The meat near the bone will cook more slowly than the rest of the steak, and the tenderloin will tend to reach the desired temperature before the strip.\n\n\"Bistecca alla fiorentina\", or 'beefsteak Florentine style', consists of a T-bone traditionally sourced from either the Chianina or Maremmana breeds of cattle. A favorite of Tuscan cuisine, the steak is grilled over a wood or charcoal fire, seasoned with salt, sometimes with black pepper, and olive oil, applied immediately after the meat is retired from the heat. Thickly cut and very large, \"Bistecca\" are often shared between two or more persons, and traditionally served very rare, sometimes garnished with lemon wedges, if not accompanied by red wine, and accompanied by Tuscan beans as a side dish.\n\nThe same cut of meat, but from a calf, is used for \"Cotoletta alla milanese\", which consists of 1.5 cm-thick cuts which are battered in breadcrumbs and fried in clarified butter with salt.\n\n\n",
                "Strip steak\n\nThe strip steak is a cut of beef steaks from the short loin from a cow. It consists of a muscle that does little work, the longissimus, making the meat particularly tender; although not as tender as the nearby psoas major or tenderloin. Fat content of the strip is somewhere between the two cuts. Unlike the tenderloin, the longissimus is a sizable muscle, allowing it to be cut into larger portions.\n\nAccording to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the steak is marketed in the United States under various names, including Ambassador Steak, Boneless Club Steak, Hotel-Style Steak, Kansas City Steak, New York Steak, Top Loin, and Veiny Steak.\n\nIn New Zealand and Australia, it is known as Porterhouse and Sirloin (striploin steak) and can be found in the \"Handbook of Australian Meat\" under codes 2140 to 2143.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland it is called sirloin.\n\nIn Canada, most meat purveyors refer to this cut as a strip loin; in French it is known as \"contre-filet\".\n\nDelmonico's Restaurant, an operation opened in New York City in 1827, offered as one of its signature dishes a cut from the short loin called a Delmonico steak. Due to its association with the city, it is often referred to as a New York strip steak.\n\nWhen still attached to the bone, and with a piece of the tenderloin also included, the strip steak becomes a T-bone steak or a porterhouse steak, the difference being that the porterhouse has a larger portion of tenderloin included. The strip steak may be sold with or without the bone. Strip steaks may be substituted for most recipes calling for T-bone and porterhouse steaks, and sometimes for fillet and rib eye steaks.\n\nA bone-in strip steak with no tenderloin attached is sometimes referred to as a shell steak.\n\n",
                "Sirloin steak\n\nThe sirloin steak is cut from the back of the animal.\n\nIn a common U.S. butchery, the steak is cut from the rear back portion of the animal, continuing off the short loin from which T-bone, porterhouse, and club steaks are cut. The sirloin is actually divided into several types of steak. The top sirloin is the most prized of these and is specifically marked for sale under that name. The bottom sirloin, which is less tender and much larger, is typically marked for sale simply as \"sirloin steak\". The bottom sirloin in turn connects to the sirloin tip roast.\n\nIn a common British, South African, and Australian butchery, the word \"sirloin\" refers to cuts of meat from the upper middle of the animal, similar to the American short loin, while the American \"sirloin\" is called the rump. Because of this difference in terminology, in these countries, the T-bone steak is regarded as a cut of the sirloin.\n\nThe word sirloin derives from the Middle English \"surloine\", itself derived from the Old French word \"surloigne\" (variant of \"surlonge\"), that is, \"sur\" for 'above' and \"longe\" for 'loin'. In Modern French, the cut of meat is called \"aloyau\" or \"faux-filet\".\nA commonly-repeated anecdote claims that the name is derived from an occasion when King James I of England, while being entertained at Hoghton Tower during his return from Scotland in 1617, was so impressed by the quality of his steak that he knighted the loin of beef, which was referred to thereafter as \"Sir loin\". There is no reliable evidence for this explanation and scholars generally hold it to be a myth.\n\n"

                "Strip steak\n\nThe strip steak is a cut of beef steaks from the short loin from a cow. It consists of a muscle that does little work, the longissimus, making the meat particularly tender; although not as tender as the nearby psoas major or tenderloin. Fat content of the strip is somewhere between the two cuts. Unlike the tenderloin, the longissimus is a sizable muscle, allowing it to be cut into larger portions.\n\nAccording to the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, the steak is marketed in the United States under various names, including Ambassador Steak, Boneless Club Steak, Hotel-Style Steak, Kansas City Steak, New York Steak, Top Loin, and Veiny Steak.\n\nIn New Zealand and Australia, it is known as Porterhouse and Sirloin (striploin steak) and can be found in the \"Handbook of Australian Meat\" under codes 2140 to 2143.\n\nIn the UK and Ireland it is called sirloin.\n\nIn Canada, most meat purveyors refer to this cut as a strip loin; in French it is known as \"contre-filet\".\n\nDelmonico's Restaurant, an operation opened in New York City in 1827, offered as one of its signature dishes a cut from the short loin called a Delmonico steak. Due to its association with the city, it is often referred to as a New York strip steak.\n\nWhen still attached to the bone, and with a piece of the tenderloin also included, the strip steak becomes a T-bone steak or a porterhouse steak, the difference being that the porterhouse has a larger portion of tenderloin included. The strip steak may be sold with or without the bone. Strip steaks may be substituted for most recipes calling for T-bone and porterhouse steaks, and sometimes for fillet and rib eye steaks.\n\nA bone-in strip steak with no tenderloin attached is sometimes referred to as a shell steak.\n\n",
                "T-bone steak\n\nThe T-bone and porterhouse are steaks of beef cut from the short loin (called the sirloin in Commonwealth countries). Both steaks include a \"T-shaped\" bone with meat on each side. Porterhouse steaks are cut from the rear end of the short loin and thus include more tenderloin steak, along with (on the other side of the bone) a large strip steak. T-bone steaks are cut closer to the front, and contain a smaller section of tenderloin. The smaller portion of a T-bone, when sold alone, is known as a filet mignon, especially if it's cut from the small forward end of the tenderloin.\n\nThere is little agreement among experts on how large the tenderloin must be to differentiate a T-bone steak from porterhouse. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's \"Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications\" state that the tenderloin of a porterhouse must be at least thick at its widest, while that of a T-bone must be at least . However, steaks with a large tenderloin are often called a \"T-bone\" in restaurants and steakhouses despite technically being porterhouse.\n\nOwing to their large size and the fact that they contain meat from two of the most prized cuts of beef (the short loin and the tenderloin), T-bone steaks are generally considered one of the highest quality steaks, and prices at steakhouses are accordingly high. Porterhouse steaks are even more highly valued owing to their larger tenderloin.\n\nIn the United States, the T-bone has the meat-cutting classification IMPS 1174; the porterhouse is IMPS 1173.\n\nIn British usage, followed in Commonwealth countries, \"porterhouse\" often means a UK sirloin steak (i.e. US strip steak) on the bone, i.e. without the tenderloin on the other side of T-bone. However, nowadays some British on-line butchers also offer American style porterhouse steaks.\n\nThe origin of the term \"porterhouse\" is contentious, with several cities and establishments claiming to have coined it. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the etymology from proprietor Martin Morrison serving large T-bones in his Pearl Street (Manhattan) \"Porter House\" around 1814, while noting the lack of contemporary evidence to support the tale. This origin story gained traction in the late 19th century, but others contend a Cambridge, Massachusetts hotel and restaurant proprietor named Zachariah B. Porter lent his name to the cut of beef, and others claim the steak takes its name from various 19th Century U.S. hotels or restaurants called Porter House, such as the Porter House Hotel in Flowery Branch, Georgia.\n\nTo cut a T-bone from butchered cattle, a lumbar vertebra is sawn in half through the vertebral column. The downward prong of the 'T' is a transverse process of the vertebra, and the flesh surrounding it is the spinal muscles. The small semicircle at the top of the 'T' is half of the vertebral foramen.\n\nT-bone and porterhouse steaks are suited to fast, dry heat cooking methods, such as grilling or broiling. Since they contain a small amount of collagen relative to other cuts, longer cooking times are not necessary to tenderize the meat. The bone also conducts heat within the meat so that it cooks more evenly and prevents meat drying out and shrinking during cooking. The meat near the bone will cook more slowly than the rest of the steak, and the tenderloin will tend to reach the desired temperature before the strip.\n\n\"Bistecca alla fiorentina\", or 'beefsteak Florentine style', consists of a T-bone traditionally sourced from either the Chianina or Maremmana breeds of cattle. A favorite of Tuscan cuisine, the steak is grilled over a wood or charcoal fire, seasoned with salt, sometimes with black pepper, and olive oil, applied immediately after the meat is retired from the heat. Thickly cut and very large, \"Bistecca\" are often shared between two or more persons, and traditionally served very rare, sometimes garnished with lemon wedges, if not accompanied by red wine, and accompanied by Tuscan beans as a side dish.\n\nThe same cut of meat, but from a calf, is used for \"Cotoletta alla milanese\", which consists of 1.5 cm-thick cuts which are battered in breadcrumbs and fried in clarified butter with salt.\n\n\n",
                "Beef tenderloin\n\nA beef tenderloin, known as an eye fillet in Australasia, filet in France, and fillet in the United Kingdom and South Africa, is cut from the loin of beef.\n\nAs with all quadrupeds, the tenderloin refers to the psoas major muscle ventral to the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae, near the kidneys.\n\nThe tenderloin is an oblong shape spanning two primal cuts: the short loin (called the \"sirloin\" in Commonwealth countries) and the sirloin (called the rump in Commonwealth countries). The tenderloin sits beneath the ribs, next to the backbone. It has two ends: the butt and the \"tail\". The smaller, pointed end—the \"tail\"—starts a little past the ribs, growing in thickness until it ends in the \"sirloin\" \"primal cut\", which is closer to the butt of the cow. This muscle does very little work, so it is the most tender part of the beef.\n\nWhole tenderloins are sold as either \"unpeeled\" (meaning the fat and silver skin remain), \"peeled\" (meaning that the fat is removed, but silver skin remains), or as PSMOs (\"pismos\"), which is short for peeled, silver skin removed, and side muscle (the \"chain\") left on. While the most expensive option pound-for-pound, PSMOs offer considerable savings over other tenderloin options as they require little handling by the chef, since the fat and trimmings have already been removed. Since it is the tenderest part of the animal, beef dishes requiring exceptionally tender meat, such as steak tartare, are ideally made from the tenderloin.\n\nThe three main \"cuts\" of the tenderloin are the butt, the center-cut, and the tail. The butt end is usually suitable for carpaccio, as the eye can be quite large; cutting a whole tenderloin into steaks of equal weight will yield proportionally very thin steaks from the butt end. The center-cut is suitable for portion-controlled steaks, as the diameter of the eye remains relatively consistent. The center-cut can yield the traditional filet mignon or tenderloin steak, as well as the Chateaubriand steak and beef Wellington. The tail, which is generally unsuitable for steaks due to size inconsistency, can be used in recipes where small pieces of a tender cut are called for, such as beef Stroganoff.\n"

                "Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)\n\n\"Get Lucky\" is a song by French house music duo Daft Punk, featuring Pharrell Williams and co-written by the duo, Williams, and Nile Rodgers. It is the lead single from Daft Punk's fourth studio album, \"Random Access Memories\". Before its release as a single, \"Get Lucky\" was featured in television advertisements broadcast during \"Saturday Night Live\", after which Rodgers and Williams announced their involvement in the track. Small excerpts also appear throughout the promotional video series \"The Collaborators\".\n\n\"Get Lucky\" is a disco song with lyrics that, according to Williams, are about the good fortune of connecting with someone, as well as sexual chemistry. After it leaked in mid-April, the single was released as a digital download on 19 April 2013. \"Get Lucky\" has since received acclaim from critics, and has spawned numerous cover versions and parodies. The single reached the top ten in the music charts of over 32 countries, and has sold more than 9.3 million copies, making it one of the best-selling songs of all time. The song won awards for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, during which Stevie Wonder joined Rodgers, Williams and Daft Punk onstage to perform the song.\n\n\"Get Lucky\" was completed over the course of approximately 18 months. Daft Punk first met Rodgers at a listening party in New York City for the duo's 1997 debut album \"Homework\", and became friends thereafter. The duo acknowledged Chic's influence in the song \"Around the World\" and had great respect for Rodgers. He noted however that a series of near misses and scheduling conflicts had delayed their chance of collaborating. The duo eventually invited Rodgers to the \"Random Access Memories\" sessions at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. This coincidentally was the studio where the first Chic single had been recorded, in the neighborhood in which Rodgers grew up.\n\nAfter listening to Daft Punk's demo of what would become \"Get Lucky\", Rodgers asked that all of the elements except the drum track be muted so that he could create a suitable guitar part; he recalled that he experimented until the duo were visibly pleased. Once he completed his contribution, Daft Punk re-recorded the bass part with Nathan East to fit Rodgers' performance. Rodgers further elaborated that, \"Everybody else wound up re-playing to me\". Mixer and engineer Mick Guzauski recalled that the rhythm guitar fit easily into the production: \"I experimented with balancing and other positioning, and working other stuff around it. He didn’t have to be processed – Nile just sounded great the way he is.\" The song as it appears on the album also features a synthesizer part by Daft Punk, keyboards by Chris Caswell and additional guitar performed by Paul Jackson, Jr.\n\nWilliams first heard about the project from Daft Punk \"at a Madonna party\" and offered his services for a collaboration. He had joked that, \"If you just want me to play tambourine, I'll do it.\" The duo and Williams later met in Paris, where he shared some of his own material; Williams explained that he had been inspired by Rodgers, not knowing that Daft Punk had coincidentally been recording with him. Williams noted that the duo adopted a perfectionist approach during the recording of the vocals for \"Get Lucky\", as he was asked to perform several takes and multiple instances of specific phrases. As a member of The Neptunes production team, Williams had previously provided a remix of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" that appeared on the 2003 album \"Daft Club\". Daft Punk also served as co-writers and producers for the 2010 single \"Hypnotize U\" by N.E.R.D, Williams's band.\n\n\"Get Lucky\" is composed in the key of [[F sharp minor) It follows the [[chord progression]] of Bm– D -F♯m–E rf name=\"Musicnotes\" /> The song runs at [[common time]] with a tempo of 116 [[beats per minute|BPM]].\n\nPrior to Rodgers' involvement, the song existed in rough form that centered on [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] with [[Omar Hakim]] on drums and East performing bass guitar. Rodgers' presence on the completed song consists of two layered guitar parts: One layer features [[rhythm guitar]]ing while the other is a melodic [[riff]]. Rodgers considered the minimal number of layers to be a characteristic of early [[Chic (band)|Chic]] recordings due to the technical production limitations his band had at the time. Hakim demonstrated that the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] pattern of \"Get Lucky\" was devised as a way to provide variety whilst maintaining a minimal [[four on the floor (music)|four on the floor]] rhythm.\n\nWilliams noted that upon returning to the United States after his vocals were recorded, he had \"forgotten everything\" regarding the composition of \"Get Lucky\"; he attributed this to [[jet lag]], but jokingly wondered if Daft Punk had tampered with his memory. The duo responded by explaining that Williams's lyrics and performance had come about in a very spontaneous way, which was the likely reason he had trouble recalling the song.\n\nUpon hearing \"Get Lucky\" later in its developed form, Williams remarked that the music evoked the sense of being on an exotic island during a \"peachy color[ed]\" sunrise. He elaborated that the title does not simply refer to sexual acts, but to the good fortune of meeting with and immediately connecting to someone. Williams' vocal and Daft Punk's vocoder performance jointly span three [[octave]]s: D-D. Friend and occasional collaborator [[Chilly Gonzales]] also observed that Daft Punk had previously used the chord progression in \"Around the World\" and that the verse, bridge and chorus of \"Get Lucky\" are largely defined by the melodic phrasing of the vocal.\n\nThe duo noted that their own ten-minute remix of \"Get Lucky\" is more akin to extended mixes of the 1970s and 80s, rather than a conventional reworking. At the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]] ceremony, Daft Punk appeared on stage with Rodgers, Williams, and [[Stevie Wonder]] alongside \"Random Access Memories\" session players Hakim, Caswell and Jackson, Jr. Together they performed a medley of \"Get Lucky\", \"[[Le Freak]]\", \"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\", \"[[Another Star]]\", \"[[Lose Yourself to Dance]]\", and \"Around the World\".\n\n\"Get Lucky\" was first publicly revealed via two 15-second television advertisements on \"[[Saturday Night Live]]\". Rodgers announced his contribution to the song shortly afterward, and noted that various fan remixes of the clips have appeared online since the airing. The third trailer, which was shown at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], officially announced Williams's involvement in the song and features Daft Punk, Rodgers, and Williams performing together. The promotional web series \"The Collaborators\" featured excerpts of \"Get Lucky\", culminating in the Williams-focused episode in which the song was first referred to by name.\n\nDays prior to the single release, the song had been leaked and broadcast on various radio stations. In the United Kingdom the song joined the playlists of [[BBC Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2]] and [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]. Upon the official release, Williams performed \"Get Lucky\" live for the first time at an [[HTC One (2013)|HTC One]] launch party in Brooklyn.\n\nSince the release of \"Get Lucky\", Daft Punk have encouraged the reworking of their latest musical works and a series of \"Get Lucky\" remixes have been released from acts such as PV Nova and TBM. A 12\" [[gramophone record|vinyl]] single was released on 16 July 2013, featuring a ten-minute remix by Daft Punk, the album version and the radio edit. The Daft Punk remix was first released on [[Spotify]] and, as of 27 June 2013, was streamed 64 million times. In late June 2013, an unofficial remix album \"Random Access Memories Memories\" was released by Darkside (under the pseudonym Daftside), the musical partnership of producer Nicolas Jaar and musician Dave Harrington. Jaar has previously released remixes of [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]] and [[Brian Eno]].\n\nRodgers stated in an interview with \"The Guardian\" that a video for \"Get Lucky\" was shot in March 2013 that is distinct from the Coachella trailer, featuring a group of dancing extras. In an interview with French music magazine \"[[Rock & Folk]]\" in April however, Daft Punk stated that a music video was not part of the immediate promotional plans for the single. A trailer for the official \"Get Lucky\" remix was released via the Columbia Records [[YouTube]] channel on 25 June 2013, featuring a group of dancers. Rodgers later stated that video footage for \"[[Lose Yourself to Dance]]\" had been shot simultaneously with footage for \"Get Lucky\".\n\nDaft Punk were scheduled to appear on 6 August episode of \"[[The Colbert Report]]\" to promote \"Random Access Memories\", but were unable to do so because of contractual obligations regarding the duo's future appearance at the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]]. According to [[Stephen Colbert]], Daft Punk were unaware of any exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. Colbert nevertheless performed a pre-recorded elaborate dance number to \"Get Lucky\" featuring appearances from [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Jimmy Fallon]], [[The Rockettes]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Jon Stewart]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Charlie Rose]] and [[Henry Kissinger]]. Earlier on the program, Colbert had declared that the song was \"The Song of the Summer of the Century\".\n\n\"Get Lucky\" is a featured song in the video game \"[[Just Dance 2014]]\" and is also included on the video game soundtrack for \"[[NBA 2K14]]\". A remix of the song was also used in the dance number choreographed and performed by the 2013 nominees of the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography]] during the [[65th Primetime Emmy Awards]].\n\nThe song was used in the 2014 films \"[[Boyhood (film)|Boyhood]]\" and \"[[The Inbetweeners 2]]\" and advertisements for the [[ITV2]] reality TV show \"[[The Only Way is Essex]]\".\n\nThe song was also used in \"[[The Simpsons]]\" episode \"[[Bull-E]]\".\n\n\"Get Lucky\" received widespread acclaim from media outlets and music critics. Michael Cragg from \"[[The Guardian]]\" said the song \"eschews the crunching electronics of their last album and the vocoder-lead future-disco of \"Discovery\"\", and it was the \"best thing Pharrell Williams has been involved with for a long time\". \"[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]\" listed \"Get Lucky\" as a Best New Track, stating that the song's \"real elegance lies in the hands of [[Nile Rodgers]]\". Lewis Corner from \"[[Digital Spy]]\" gave the single 5 stars and said although Daft Punk's \"creative methods may be unorthodox, the final result is a legal rush we can all enjoy\". [[BBC Radio 1]] host [[Annie Mac]] played \"Get Lucky\" on the day of its release, and gave it a positive review. She remarked that Daft Punk are not making [[electronic dance music]], but rather \"real music to dance to\". Music critic [[Sasha Frere-Jones]] of \"[[The New Yorker]]\" wrote that Rodgers' performance in the song was \"as close to magic as pop comes.\" \"[[Rolling Stone]]\" reviewer [[Will Hermes]] giving the song a four-star rating out of five, described it as \"an old-school disco jam\" and called it \"formidable\". Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush also welcomed the song, she called it an \"intoxicating track\" and wrote it \"represents all that’s right with electronic music.\"\n\nFellow musicians have also publicly commented on the song. British DJ and producer [[Norman Cook]] (better known as Fatboy Slim) expressed high praise for the song and stated in an interview with the \"[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]\": \"I'm so impressed by them. It's a breath of fresh old-skool air\". Cook had felt that recent popular electronic dance music had started to become bland and that \"Daft Punk have given us [electronic musicians] all a kick up the arse.\"\n\nThe song broke records with the highest number of plays of any song in a single day on music streaming application [[Spotify]]. British journalist [[Caitlin Moran]] has speculated that the song's attractiveness is due to its combination of minor chords and regular disco-type \"up\" beats throughout the song, with the former creating an unresolved feeling. \"Get Lucky\" was nominated for Best Song of the Summer at the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The song received awards for both [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]]. \"Get Lucky\" was voted the number one song of 2013 in a [[Digital Spy]] reader poll.\nOn 26 January 2014, \"Get Lucky\" reached #3 in Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2013, the world's largest musical democracy. \"[[The Village Voice]]\"s [[Pazz & Jop]] annual critics' poll ranked \"Get Lucky\" at number one to find the best music of 2013. The aggregation website [[Acclaimed Music]] currently ranks \"Get Lucky\" as the greatest song of 2013, the greatest song of the 2010s decade, and the 107th greatest song of all time.\n\nIn France, \"Get Lucky\" debuted at number one on the [[French Singles Chart]] on 24 April 2013, becoming Daft Punk's first chart-topping single in their home country since \"[[One More Time (Daft Punk song)|One More Time]]\" in 2000. The song sold 38,887 copies in three days, making \"Get Lucky\" the best-selling digital single in a one-week period. In Belgium, where two independent official charts are published weekly (one for Flanders, one for Wallonia), \"Get Lucky\" entered in the top position on both charts, making it Daft Punk's highest Belgian chart entry ever and their first No. 1 song in the country.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Get Lucky\" entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number three on 21 April 2013―only 48 hours after its release—selling more than 50,000 copies and becoming Daft Punk's first top ten hit in the UK since \"One More Time\" in 2000. The song then peaked at number one the following week, with sales of over 155,000 copies, and became Daft Punk's first ever number one single in Britain. The song remained in the top position during the following week, selling over 163,000. \"Get Lucky\" remained atop the chart for a third and fourth consecutive week, selling over 100,000 copies within each of them. By late May 2013, over 600,000 copies of the song had been sold in just over four weeks and sales had exceeded those of [[Macklemore]] and [[Ryan Lewis]]' \"[[Thrift Shop]]\", making \"Get Lucky\" the country's best-selling single of the year thus far.\n\nOn 27 June 2013, the [[Official Charts Company]] announced that \"Get Lucky\" [[List of million-selling singles in the United Kingdom|had sold over a million copies in the UK]]; only the 136th single and first released in 2013 to do so. The song was the first involving Daft Punk, Williams or Rodgers to achieve this feat as well as being the second by a French act (after [[David Guetta]]'s \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\"). Both Martin Talbot, chief executive of the Official Charts Company, and Rodgers were impressed by the quick time (69 days) the single took to cross the million sales barrier. It was the second best-selling song in the UK in 2013, with sales of over 1,308,000, and the most streamed track of 2013 in the UK. As of June 2015, \"Get Lucky\" has sold 1,436,000 copies in the UK, making it the [[List of best-selling singles of the 2000s (century) in the United Kingdom|sixth best-selling single of the 2010s]] and the [[List of best-selling singles of the 2010s in the United Kingdom|eighth best-selling single of the century]].\n\nIn the United States, the song debuted at number five on the \"Billboard\" [[Dance/Electronic Singles Sales|Dance/Electronic Songs]] chart for the week ending 4 May 2013. By the week ending 25 May, the song had reached the number 2 position and its peak position of number one was eventually reached during the week ending of 1 June 2013 remaining on top for 13 weeks. The song debuted at number 19 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\"Billboard\" Hot 100]] on 24 April 2013, selling 113,000 downloads—this placement resulted in the song becoming the duo's first ever top 40 hit on the chart. \"Get Lucky\" eventually peaked at number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for five weeks, behind [[Robin Thicke]]'s \"[[Blurred Lines]]\" featuring [[T.I.]] and Williams. Since both songs feature Williams, he became the first artist to simultaneously occupy the top two slots of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart since 2009, when [[The Black Eyed Peas]] achieved the same feat. \"Get Lucky\" also reached the number one position on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart, their first song to achieve this feat since \"[[Face to Face (Daft Punk song)|Face to Face]]\" in 2004. As of April 2014, the song has sold over 3,475,000 copies in the United States, the most for any Daft Punk song.\n\nIn Australia, \"Get Lucky\" debuted at number two on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Singles Chart]] on the week ending 5 May 2013. The song is Daft Punk's highest-placing entry on the chart since \"One More Time\" peaked at number 10 in April 2001. The song attained the [[List of number-one singles of 2013 (Australia)|top position]] on the ARIA chart in the second week after its release. The song reached number one on the week ending of 19 May and remained at the position for two more weeks. Besides appearing at [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]], Daft Punk, Williams, and Rodgers were nominated for Best Song of the Summer, but lost by a very large margin to [[One Direction]]'s \"[[Best Song Ever (song)|Best Song Ever]]\".\n\nNumerous cover versions of \"Get Lucky\" have been published since the single's release. In April 2013, English folk band [[Daughter (band)|Daughter]] recorded an indie version of the song for BBC Radio 1's [[Live Lounge]]. In the same month, Dutch reggae and hip hop band the [[Postmen]] recorded an English-language version for Giel Beelen's program on the [[3FM]] radio station. Israeli musician [[Noy Alooshe]] made a mashup of the song with [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Billie Jean]]\". The song was also covered by George Barnett, [[Postmen]], [[Igor Presnyakov]], [[The Stepkids]], [[Sam Sparro]] and [[Skylar Grey]]. In May 2013, [[Peter Serafinowicz]] uploaded a video of him, featuring the song. The same month, English bands [[Peace (band)|Peace]] and the [[Mystery Jets]] performed the song together during a concert. Australian band [[San Cisco]] recorded a cover version for the radio station [[Triple J]], incorporating slap bass and bongo drums as well as elements of the N.E.R.D song \"[[Hypnotize U]]\". [[Joe McElderry]] has performed the song a number of times at his gigs, the first being at London's Pizza Express Jazz Club on 28 May.\n\nThe song was covered by British record producer [[Naughty Boy]], for his debut album \"[[Hotel Cabana]]\"; it features as a bonus track with vocals by Tanika. In June 2013, [[The Roots]] covered the song as fictional duo \"Black Simon & Garfunkel\" on \"[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]\". [[Wilco]] performed a version at the opening night of the Solid Sound Festival in [[North Adams, Massachusetts|North Adams]], [[Massachusetts]], U.S. on 21 June 2013, In July 2013, [[Florence Welch]] sang the song in London. Arié Elmaleh, brother of [[Gad Elmaleh]], performed an adapted Dutch version on \"[[Le Grand Journal (Canal+)|Le Grand Journal]]\" in August 2013. In the same month a [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish Orthodox]] organization [[Aish HaTorah]] published a [[Rosh Hashanah]]'s (\"Jewish New Year\") version of this song, called \"Get Clarity\". In September 2013, [[Fall Out Boy]] performed the song during a concert in [[Uncasville, Connecticut]]. A reggae cover version was released by Antiguan singer Asher Otto and her band Itchyfeet. Rock band [[Halestorm]] recorded a cover for their EP \"ReAniMate 2.0\". Rapper [[Kellee Maize]] recorded a cover and remix of and created a video for the song entitled \"Do Something\".

In the [[The Voice UK (series 3)|third series]] of \"The Voice\", the song was sung by contestant Anna McLuckie, who also played the harp to the song. This video on [[YouTube]] went viral, with over 18 million views. In February 2014, [[Pomplamoose]] released a Williams-themed cover medley combining \"Get Lucky\", Daft Punk's \"[[Lose Yourself to Dance]]\" and Williams' \"[[Happy (Pharrell Williams song)|Happy]]\".

                "Random Access Memories\n\nRandom Access Memories is the fourth studio album by French electronic music duo Daft Punk. It was released on 17 May 2013, by the duo's imprint Daft Life and Columbia Records. The album pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 1980s American music, particularly from Los Angeles. This theme is reflected in the album's packaging, as well as its promotional campaign, which included billboards, television advertisements and a web series.\n\nUnlike their previous albums, Daft Punk recruited session musicians to perform live instrumentation and limited the use of electronic instruments to drum machines, a custom-built modular synthesizer, and vintage vocoders. The album features collaborations with Giorgio Moroder, Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams and Pharrell Williams. It is the first Daft Punk album released by Columbia Records.\n\n\"Random Access Memories\" received critical acclaim, scoring an 87 out of 100 on review aggregator site Metacritic and appearing on many music critics' year-end lists. It is one of Daft Punk's most commercially successful albums, topping the charts in more than 25 countries worldwide. It was their first album to top the United States \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling more than 339,000 copies within its first week. The lead single \"Get Lucky\" was a critical and commercial success, topping the charts in more than 30 countries and becoming one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014, the album won Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, Best Dance/Electronica Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, and \"Get Lucky\" won for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.\n\nShortly after finishing off their Alive 2006/2007 tour, Daft Punk began working on new material in 2008. Thomas Bangalter of the duo recalled, \"the two of us would go in with a lot of keyboards, guitars, drums, and stuff and started to do demos for six, seven months.\" Daft Punk were pleased with the work in terms of composition, but were dissatisfied with the production aspect, as they relied on samples and loops of their own performances: \"We could play some riffs and stuff but not keep it [up] for four minutes straight.\" Daft Punk put these demos aside and started work on the \"\" film soundtrack later in 2008. As Bangalter mentioned after the film's release in 2010: \"Making music for a movie is very humbling. We’ve been working on some of our music concurrently.\" Daft Punk then decided to work extensively with live musicians on what would become \"Random Access Memories\": \"We wanted to do what we used to do with machines and samplers, but with people.\" They avoided the use of samples on the album, with the exception of the closing track \"Contact\".\nThe album features Chic frontman Nile Rodgers, who commented that a collaboration was \"something we've [Daft Punk and Rodgers] talked about for a long time. We've respected each other endlessly.\" Daft Punk eventually visited Rodgers' home for an informal jam session, and an official collaboration was later confirmed and completed. Musician Paul Williams announced in a 2010 interview that he had worked with the group, after Daft Punk had been introduced to Williams by a sound engineer with whom they were mutually acquainted.\n\nIn May 2012 Daft Punk's collaboration with Giorgio Moroder was announced—Moroder had recorded a monologue about his life for use in a track on the album. Rodgers was also present during the Moroder recording session. Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer: \"They did not let me get involved at all. Thomas asked me if I wanted to tell the story of my life. Then they would know what to do with it.\" Daft Punk had been in contact with Moroder in relation to a possible contribution for the \"Tron: Legacy\" score, but this never happened.\n\nChilly Gonzales stated in an interview that his contribution was recorded in a one-day session: \"I played for hours and they're gonna grab what they grab and turn it into whatever.\" He explained that Daft Punk prompted him at the piano in the same manner that a film director coaches an actor, and Gonzales left the Los Angeles studio without knowledge of what the final product would sound like. He had previously recorded a cover version of Daft Punk's song \"Too Long\" that appeared on the duo's 2003 album \"Daft Club\".\n\nPharrell Williams collaborated with Daft Punk and Rodgers by providing vocals for two tracks on \"Random Access Memories\". As a member of the Neptunes, Pharrell had previously provided a remix of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" that appeared on \"Daft Club\". The Neptunes and Daft Punk also co-produced N.E.R.D.'s song \"Hypnotize U\".\n\nRecording took place at Henson Recording Studios, Conway Recording Studios and Capitol Studios in California, Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and Gang Recording Studio in Paris, France. Having worked with keyboardist and arranger Chris Caswell on \"Tron: Legacy\", the duo enlisted him and connected with engineers and other session players for their next album. Daft Punk recalled that they wished to avoid the more compressed sounds of drum machines in favor of \"airy open\" drum sets of the 1970s and 80s, which the duo consider the most appealing era. Bangalter clarified that \"it's not that we can't make crazy futuristic sounding stuff, but we wanted to play with the past\". The duo noted that the session players were enthusiastic to reunite in the context of the new album and the perceived prestige of the studio locations.\n\nDrummer Omar Hakim recalled being asked by Daft Punk to perform on the album, and was surprised by what they wanted of him. He at first assumed that the duo wanted electronic drum work, since Hakim had done some drum programming in his career. Daft Punk instead specified that they were looking to record Hakim performing acoustic drum riffs that the duo had conceived. Rather than play out the entire structure of a song, Hakim would perform individual patterns for extended periods, thus creating a library for the duo to cull from. Daft Punk conveyed their ideas to session musicians via sheet music and in some instances by humming melodies. Bangalter recalled an example in which he hummed a complex drum and bass line to Hakim, who replicated and improved upon it for the track \"Giorgio by Moroder\".\n\nMost of the vocal sessions took place in Paris, whereas the rhythm sections were recorded in the United States. The album incorporates a variety of accompanying performances including a horn section, woodwind instruments, a string orchestra and choir. Orchestral parts in particular were recorded for almost every track, but were only included on a few songs in the final product. The use of such performers and places came at great monetary expense, as noted by Bangalter: \"There used to be a time where people that had means to experiment would do it, you know? That's what this record is about.\" He estimated a cost of over one million dollars, but felt that the number was not important. Bangalter stated that the sessions were financed by Daft Punk themselves, which allowed them the luxury of abandoning the project if they had so wished. He also specified that \"there are songs on the album that traveled into five studios over two and a half years.\"\n\nVarious sound effects were newly recorded with the help of film experts from Warner Bros. Bangalter noted one example in which the sound of a busy restaurant was achieved by placing microphones in front of the forks of a group of people. In another instance, the effect of dripping water was recorded on a soundstage. Use of electronics was limited to drum machines that appear on only two tracks, a large custom-built Modcan modular synthesizer performed live by the duo, and vintage vocoders. When asked which of the two Daft Punk members performed the robotic vocals on the album, Bangalter expressed that it did not matter. The duo produced most of the vocoder tracks in their own private studio in Paris, with later processing done by Mick Guzauski at Capitol. Moroder elaborated that Daft Punk would take \"a week or so\" to find an adequate vocoder sound, and an additional few days to record the lyrics.\n\nAlthough the duo felt that the presets and parameters of digital tools would inhibit creativity and innovation, they admitted that \"Random Access Memories\" could not have been made in the complete absence of computer technology. The sessions were recorded simultaneously onto Ampex reels and as Pro Tools tracks; Daft Punk and Guzauski would then listen to each recording in both analogue and digital iterations, deciding which of the two they preferred. Subsequently, the elements were edited by the duo with Pro Tools in a manner similar to how they would work with samples.\n\nIn an interview conducted in November 2012 by \"Guitar World\" magazine, Fourplay member Nathan East mentioned that he had contributed to the project. The percussionist Quinn also stated that he performed on \"every drum [he] own[s]\" for the album. Pedal steel guitar work on the record was performed by Greg Leisz. Daft Punk sought to use the instrument in a way that bordered between electronic and acoustic. Additional session players include John \"J.R.\" Robinson, Paul Jackson, Jr., James Genus, Thomas Bloch and Chris Caswell.\n\nBangalter described the album's title as encapsulating Daft Punk's interest in the past, referencing both random-access memory technology and the human experience: \"We were drawing a parallel between the brain and the hard drive – the random way that memories are stored.\" Daft Punk felt that while current technology allows for an unlimited capacity to store recorded material, the content produced by contemporary artists had diminished in quality. Their goal was therefore to maximize the potential of infinite storage by recording a sprawling amount of elements. The duo pointed to the process as being further inspiration for the album's title, as they sought to make connections out of the random series of ideas.\n\n\"Random Access Memories\" has been noted by music critics as a disco album. Regarding the style of the album, they sought a \"west coast vibe\", referencing such acts as Fleetwood Mac, the Doobie Brothers and the Eagles. Daft Punk also acknowledged that the record pays homage to Michael Jackson, the Cars and Steely Dan. The recording of live synthesizer parts was done in a progressive rock fashion, with the pop sensibilities of Wizzard and the Move. Daft Punk specifically looked to the albums \"Rumours\" by Fleetwood Mac and \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" by Pink Floyd as models. Bangalter felt that \"the most important records in music, whether it's Led Zeppelin [...] or \"The White Album\" or \"Sgt. Pepper's...\" or \"Quadrophenia\" or \"Tommy\", are the ones that take you on a journey for miles and miles.\"\n\nThe initial demos of \"Random Access Memories\" were created without a clear plan for an album. Over the course of the sessions, numerous tracks were created and discarded. At one point Daft Punk had considered sorting the entire album into one continuous track, similar to the Prince record \"Lovesexy\". They had also considered releasing it as a four-disc box set to accommodate the large volume of content produced. Thus the album lacked structure until the final months of production.\n\nThe opening track, \"Give Life Back to Music\", features guitar work by Rodgers and Paul Jackson, Jr., drums by John \"J.R.\" Robinson, and lyrics performed by Daft Punk using vocoders. The song reflects the duo's goal to create a light yet polished and elegant record. As stated by \"NME\", the album begins with \"a stupendously vast rock intro that obliterates any trace of \"Human After All\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s brittle techno\". The following track, \"The Game of Love\", also features vocoder singing by the duo. Bangalter said, \"There’s this thing today where the recorded human voice is processed to try to feel robotic.\" He explained that the duo's intention was to produce robotic vocals with expressiveness and emotion. \"Giorgio by Moroder\" was created to serve as a metaphor about musical freedom. The duo believed that a monologue by Moroder about his career would be an analogue for music's history regarding exploration of genres and tastes.\n\"Within\" was one of the first tracks to be recorded for the album. It features Gonzales on piano with minimal accompaniment consisting of bass and a percussion track, as well as vocoder. In the context of the album, \"Within\" marks the transition from the key of A minor of the previous three songs, to the key of B-flat minor of subsequent tracks. Regarding the lyrics, critic Nick Stevenson observed, \"A deep vocoder sings about not understanding the world, being lost and not even remembering his own name.\" Jeremy Abbott of \"Mixmag\" added, \"\"So many things I don't understand\" is the prominent lyric and Chilly's chords combined with grazing cymbals make for a beautiful summer lullaby.\"\n\"Instant Crush\" was based on a demo that Daft Punk presented to Julian Casablancas; he became enthused upon hearing it and provided vocals. The song contains rock influences and a guitar solo. Critic John Balfe considered it \"appropriately Strokes-ish, even if [Casablancas'] trademark drawl is fed quite substantially through a vocoder.\" De Homem-Christo noted, \"It is true that it is not his usual register, it is the way Julian reacted to the track so for us it is even more exciting.\" \"Lose Yourself to Dance\" features Pharrell Williams and was the result of a desire to create dance music with live drummers. To that end, Robinson appears as session player. A vocoder chant of \"come on\" appears in the song alongside Pharrell Williams's singing.\n\n\"Touch\" features lyrics written and performed by Paul Williams. Daft Punk noted that the song is the most complex piece on the record, being composed of over 250 elements. As \"Pitchfork\" observed, \"the song warps and bends, floating through genres, epochs, and emotions with a sense of hallucinatory wonder\" and recalls the Beatles song \"A Day in the Life\". In \"Rolling Stone\", Will Hermes observes, \"It's completely ridiculous. It's also remarkably beautiful and affecting.\" Louis Lepron of Kombini believed the multitude of styles and science fiction aesthetics on the track is an homage to musical films including \"Phantom of the Paradise\", the soundtrack of which Williams had composed. The song's opening is a specific reference to a scene in the film in which the title character's voice is gradually enhanced in a studio booth. De Homem-Christo stated that \"Touch\" is \"like the core of the record, and the memories of the other tracks are revolving around it.\"\n\n\"Get Lucky\" is the second song on the album to feature Pharrell Williams, who clarified that the title phrase does not simply refer to a sexual act, but to the potential fortune of finding chemistry with another person. When he had first heard the song, Pharrell Williams said it evoked the image of a \"peachy color[ed]\" sunrise on an exotic island. Daft Punk discussed the concept of the song \"Beyond\" with Paul Williams, who then translated the ideas into lyrics for it. The track begins with an orchestral string section and timpani before settling into what \"NME\" called \"reupholstered Warren G 'Regulate' grooves\". Stevenson similarly described \"Beyond\" as \"a lot like the sample used in Nate Dogg and Warren G’s ‘Regulate’\", Michael McDonald's song \"I Keep Forgettin'\", which he noted as \"no bad thing\", and stated that the vocoder-affected lyrics detail \"the existential world beyond oceans and mountains – a land beyond love.\"\n\n\"Motherboard\" was described by Daft Punk as being \"a futuristic composition that could be from the year 4000\". A review elaborated that the instrumental piece can \"carry you away like a track by Sébastien Tellier\". Todd Edwards commented that the lyrics of \"Fragments of Time\" were inspired by his desire to capture the moments he experienced during his visit to the duo's studio sessions in California. \"Doin' It Right\" was the last song to be recorded and features vocals performed by Panda Bear. The duo referred to it as the only purely electronic piece on the album, with a modern style. The closing track, \"Contact\", is co-produced by DJ Falcon and features a sample of the song \"We Ride Tonight\" by Australian rock band the Sherbs.\n\nThe Japan-exclusive bonus track \"Horizon\", written by Bangalter and de Homem Christo, is a slow-tempo composition reminiscent of Pink Floyd. It is characterized by a consistent guitar strum while several additional instruments are progressively layered over, including a bass guitar and drums. The song is stylistically different from other tracks on the album, and is one of the few to feature no lyrics.\n\nIn January 2013, de Homem-Christo first revealed that Daft Punk was in the process of signing with Sony Music Entertainment through the Columbia Records label, and that the album would have a spring release. A report from \"The Guardian\" followed specifying a release date of May 2013. On 26 February 2013, Daft Punk's official website and Facebook page announced the signing to Columbia with a picture of the duo's helmets, and a \"Columbia\" logo in the corner. Billboards and posters featuring the helmets and logo then appeared in several major cities.\n\nOn 2 March, a 15-second television ad aired during \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"SNL\") depicting an animated, stylized version of the band's logo and the aforementioned image of the helmets. The music featured in the ad was a result of the collaboration with Rodgers, who noted that various fan remixes of the clip appeared online after the airing. A second TV ad also premiered that was similar to the first on \"Saturday Night Live\", but with a different music clip and the title \"Random Access Memories\" in place of the stylized Daft Punk logo. During the first night of Coachella Festival 2013, a third trailer debuted that featured Daft Punk, Pharrell Williams and Rodgers performing, as well as a list of collaborators on the album. The trailer also aired during \"Saturday Night Live\" the following evening, but without a list of collaborators.\n\nThe gradual rollout of promotion was inspired by advertising of the past, reflecting the theme of the album. Daft Punk approached Columbia with a specific agenda for the campaign; Rob Stringer of the label recalled that the duo had showed him the book \"Rock 'n' Roll Billboards of the Sunset Strip\" as an example of what they wanted. Bangalter felt that physical billboards are more affecting than banner ads and that \"\"SNL\" is this part of American culture with a certain timelessness to it.\" The campaign was handled by a small group led by Daft Punk and manager Paul Hahn, with assistance from Kathryn Frazier of the public-relations firm Biz 3. The duo had pursued Columbia in particular because of its long-standing history, as expressed by Bangalter: \"It felt interesting conceptually to write this story with a record company like Columbia, with a 125-year legacy.\" Furthermore, the vinyl labels of the album feature the classic yellow on red Columbia label used on records during said time period.\n\nCentral to the promotion was the limiting of exposure to the album's content, as well as a focus on face-to-face contact for press previews. As Hahn stated, \"There is a minimalism in our approach that creates an absence of information, and we notice our fans tend to throw themselves into the breach, or try to fill the empty spaces.\" The album's track titles were initially withheld from online retailers and later revealed through Columbia's Vine account on 16 April 2013 as a video relaying a series of images. Following a reported leak of the song days earlier, \"Get Lucky\" was released as a digital download single on 19 April 2013. On 13 May, Daft Punk's official Vevo channel posted a video revealing the artwork packaging of the vinyl version of the album, as well as the first few seconds of the opening track. Later that day, a limited-time preview stream of the full album was launched via the iTunes Store.\n\nDaft Punk were scheduled to appear on 6 August episode of \"The Colbert Report\" to promote \"Random Access Memories\", but were unable to do so because of conflicting obligations regarding the duo's future appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk were unaware of any exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. Colbert nevertheless broadcast an elaborate sketch of himself dancing to \"Get Lucky\" with various celebrities, including Hugh Laurie, Jeff Bridges, Jimmy Fallon, Bryan Cranston, Jon Stewart, Henry Kissinger, Matt Damon, and the Rockettes.\n\nColumbia released a deluxe box set of \"Random Access Memories\" containing a 56-page hardcover book, the vinyl edition of the album, a partial 70 mm film strip of the \"Lose Yourself to Dance\" video, and USB drives containing bonus audio as well as video content.\n\nThe \"Random Access Memories\" official website features a video series called \"The Collaborators\", directed by Ed Lachman and produced by \"The Creators Project\", a partnership between Intel and \"Vice\". Eight episodes were released in the series, which features interviews with participant artists that were involved in the making of the album. All featured album artists appear in the series with the exception of Casablancas, who would go on to appear prominently in the music video for \"Instant Crush\". Excerpts of the lead single \"Get Lucky\" appear in the opening and ending of each \"Collaborators\" episode as well as excerpts of other songs from the album, corresponding to each featured musician.\n\nThe first episode features disco pioneer Moroder speaking about his experiences with the genre such as his records with Donna Summer and experimenting with synthesizers. Moroder also talks about his visit with Daft Punk in their recording studio. When asked how he first found out about the duo, he replied that he first heard their 2000 single \"One More Time\" and especially liked the breakdown middle section. He concluded that he views Daft Punk as \"perfectionists\" and described the album's style as \"something [...] different. Still dance, still electronic; but [they] give that human touch back\".\n\nEpisode two revealed that Edwards had contributed to the album; he expressed that it was difficult keeping his involvement a secret. Edwards had previously collaborated with Daft Punk to create the song \"Face to Face\" on the 2001 album \"Discovery\". He summarized his experience in the studio recording \"Fragments of Time\" as being life-changing, as the sessions inspired him to move from New Jersey to California on a permanent basis. Edwards also pointed out the irony of \"two androids [...] bringing soul back to music\".\n\nThe third episode features Rodgers, who spoke of his background as a founding member of Chic, as well as his numerous collaborations with other artists throughout his career, such as David Bowie, Madonna, and Duran Duran. He expressed that working with Daft Punk \"[felt] like [...] working with contemporaries\" and that they motivated each other to excel when collaborating on the album. At the end of the episode, Rodgers played a portion of a then-unspecified song in which he participated, which was later identified as \"Lose Yourself to Dance\", and remarked that the duo's style has evolved whilst simultaneously exploring music's past, suggesting that \"they went back to go forward.\"\n\nPharrell Williams participated in the fourth episode in which he elaborated on his experience with the creation of the album. Pharrell remarked upon the organic sound of the album, surmising that it \"feels like the only click track they had was [...] the human heartbeat\". He felt that the record can be enjoyed by people of all ages due to the accessible nature of music, and concluded that Daft Punk \"could just get back on the spaceship that brought them here and go, and leave us. But they're gracious, they're nice robots. They chose to stay\".\nEpisode five features Noah Lennox, better known by his stage name Panda Bear, who spoke about his contribution to the album as well as his history with the band Animal Collective. He had first heard of Daft Punk through the music video of the song \"Around the World\", which introduced him to many aspects of electronic dance music. He added that \"Homework\" was one of the few albums he and his older brother both enjoyed. Regarding \"Random Access Memories\", Lennox remarked upon the approach of having live musicians, but structuring their performances in a minimal, sample-like fashion.\n\nFor the sixth episode, Gonzales spoke about his contribution to the album. He recalled Daft Punk's visible joy in listening to the raw session recordings made early in the production of the album, as well as the impending years-long challenge that would be faced in completing the record. Gonzales expressed that the duo were aware of how the keys of each song would contribute to the emotional progression of the album as a whole. He therefore performed the piano in the song \"Within\" to accommodate the cycle. Gonzales concluded by pointing out that Daft Punk rarely collaborate with others, and thus felt that they did so on \"Random Access Memories\" to \"make the work be transcendent\".\n\nThe seventh episode features Stéphane Quême, otherwise known as DJ Falcon, who spoke of first meeting Daft Punk when the duo began recording their debut album \"Homework\". Quême noted that the group's sound had changed since their debut, and that each of their albums had had a distinct influence. He also felt that the recording of \"Random Access Memories\" was such that a producer could potentially sample a track from it in the same way that Daft Punk themselves had sampled older records in their previous albums. Quême concluded that the duo were always sincere and although their first single was released 20 years ago, it still felt modern.\n\nEpisode eight features Paul Williams, who likened Daft Punk's personas to a character from the film \"Phantom of the Paradise\", in which he starred. He also added that their masks hide who they are from the public and allow the listeners to enjoy the music for what it is. Paul Williams worked with the duo at Henson Recording Studios, the former studio of A&M Records where he had worked previously, including his compositions for Jim Henson's films featuring the Muppets, such as \"Rainbow Connection\". He also stated that the song he penned was to be sung from the point of view of an unidentified first person, setting the emotion, but the lyrics came from the music itself. Paul Williams said that he felt vulnerable while writing the record, and said he writes best when he is allowed to be honest and vulnerable, a situation that Daft Punk allowed. He also stated that his sobriety added a sense of wonder to the song he wrote, as every day for him being sober has been wonderful compared to his prior life of excess.\n\nThe 79th Annual Wee Waa Show, held on 17 May 2013 in the rural Australian town of Wee Waa, was selected as the venue for the worldwide album launch. The tickets for the Wee Waa album launch were completely sold within thirteen minutes of release, even though it was widely understood that Daft Punk would not be in attendance at the launch—the album launch details revealed that the album would be streamed live to the 4,000 audience members. Australian police in the local Wee Waa area initiated Operation Hadrian to prevent alcohol-related problems and anti-social behaviour at the launch event.\n\nSony commissioned the design and construction of a custom-built stage for the Wee Waa album launch event, and the Daft Arts production house assembled a LED circular music space that became Australia's biggest-ever outdoor dance floor. The record label described the creation, which was illuminated by a giant disco ball and complemented by four speaker towers and flood lights, as \"\"Saturday Night Fever\" meets \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"\". The prelude to the streaming of the album was a pyrotechnic show provided by Father Anthony Koppman and his company \"Holy Smoke\" from Guyra, New South Wales.\n\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album gained an average score of 87, based on 47 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\" and scoring higher than any other album by the duo. \"Q\" referred to it as \"by some margin Daft Punk's best album in a career that's already redefined dance music at least twice. It is, in short, a mind blower.\" \"The Independent\" stated, \"\"Random Access Memories\" breathes life into the safe music that dominates today’s charts, with its sheer ambition…It's an exciting journey, and one that, for all its musical twists and turns, has its feet planted on the dancefloor.\" Melissa Maerz of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it \"a headphones album in an age of radio singles; a bravura live performance that stands out against pro forma knob-twiddling; a jazzy disco attack on the basic house beat; a full collaboration at a time when the superstar DJ stands alone.\" She concluded her review by saying that \"if EDM is turning humans into robots, Daft Punk are working hard to make robot pop feel human again.\"\n\nSeveral critics commented on the variety of content on the album. \"NME\" said, \"There's a creeping notion that every musical idea that's ever been so much as thought up is on this album.\" In addition, \"Random Access Memories\" is ranked #497 on \"NME\"'s list, \"The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\". Mark Richardson of \"Pitchfork\" echoed this sentiment, calling the record \"a mix of disco, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast and even a few pinches of their squelching stadium-dance aesthetic\". Richardson praised the engineering and recording on the album, but did say that \"though everything about \"RAM\", from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production, is meant to sound more 'human,' the album at points sounds more sterile, almost too perfect.\" \"Pitchfork\" deemed the album the seventh best of 2013. \"DJ Magazine\" commented on the shift in Daft Punk's musical style: \"While Daft Punk clearly want to move on and evolve, ditching the electronic beats, house and techno that first elevated them to fame, it's that music that forms the bedrock of their best tunes, and still, that's what they're best at making.\" \"Resident Advisor\" stated that \"it's an album rooted in a now-ancient aesthetic: '70s staples, like crisply recorded California studio music, or the kind of deceptively sophisticated New York disco that , one of the album's key guest artists, popularized with Chic.\" In a four-and-a-half star review, Heather Phares of AllMusic said that the record \"taps into the wonder and excitement\" of music from the 1970s and early 1980s. Phares concluded her review by saying, \"\"Random Access Memories\" is also Daft Punk's most personal work, and richly rewarding for listeners willing to spend time with it.\"\n\nAaron Payne of musicOMH wrote, \"Daft Punk somehow misplace the wit and the light touch that's pretty much their trademark. Instead, these long epics become somewhat tedious and there is a strong whiff of egoism and self-indulgence.…At over 70 minutes, the album feels rather bloated. Quite a few of the songs are too long, or too empty of ideas, or too willing to repeat themselves, or too willing to play to type\". Dan Weiss of \"Paste\" noted that \"none of the admittedly eclectic pilferings of \"Random Access Memories\" challenge or defy anything. They all evoke specific eras of film soundtrack or disco trend. The beats have grown less, not more, complex over time.\"\n\n\"Random Access Memories\" received Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, Best Dance/Electronica Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical for the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. The lead single, \"Get Lucky\", also won for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. \"Get Lucky\" had previously been nominated for Best Song of the Summer at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and Best Song at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards. In January 2015, the album was placed at number 9 on \"Billboard\"'s list of \"The 20 Best Albums of 2010s (so far)\".\n\n\"Random Access Memories\" debuted at number one on the French Albums Chart with first-week sales of 195,013 copies (127,361 physical sales and 67,652 digital sales), earning Daft Punk their first number-one album in France. The next week, it sold 49,600 copies to remain at the top spot with a 75% sales decrease. The album secured a third consecutive week atop the French chart, withstanding a 29% sales drop to 35,500 copies.\n\n\"Random Access Memories\" debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with 165,091 copies sold in its first week, becoming the duo's first UK number-one album, as well as the second fastest-selling artist album of 2013 after One Direction's \"Midnight Memories\". The album remained at number one on the UK chart the following week, selling 52,801 copies. In its third week, it fell to number three on sales of 28,182 copies.\n\nIn the United States, the album debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 339,000 copies, the duo's first number one album on the chart. The album maintained the number one spot in its second week, selling 93,000 copies. In the album's third week of release, it sold an additional 62,000 copies, while falling to number two on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album's vinyl LP format also proved popular; it was 2013's top-selling LP, with 49,000 US copies shifted. The album had sold 922,000 copies in the US as of January 2014. On 6 February 2014, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Following the duo's Album of the Year win at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, \"Random Access Memories\" jumped from number 39 to number 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200 with a 300% sales increase, selling 30,000 copies that week.\n\n\"Random Access Memories\" entered the Canadian Albums Chart at number one with 46,000 copies sold, the biggest one-week sales total in Canada of 2013. The album remained at number one the next week, selling 17,000 copies. In Japan, the album debuted at number three on the Oricon Weekly Albums Chart, selling 25,970 copies.\n\nThe album debuted at number one in several countries across continental Europe, including Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark (where the album sold 5,392 copies in its first week), Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. In Oceania, \"Random Access Memories\" debuted at number one in Australia and New Zealand; it was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) in its first week.\n\nAs of 2014, \"Random Access Memories\" has sold 3.2 million copies worldwide.\n\nAdapted from the liner notes.\n\n\nOn 23 March, the album became available for pre-order on the iTunes Store via digital download, revealing a release date of 17 May in Australia, 20 May in the United Kingdom, and 21 May in the United States. It later appeared as an Amazon.com pre-order on CD, vinyl and directly from the \"Random Access Memories\" official website. The album became available for preview streaming via the iTunes Store on 13 May 2013. It was also released for streaming on Spotify, with the lead single, \"Get Lucky\", topping Spotify's first digital streaming chart in the process.\n"

                "Get Lucky (Daft Punk song)\n\n\"Get Lucky\" is a song by French house music duo Daft Punk, featuring Pharrell Williams and co-written by the duo, Williams, and Nile Rodgers. It is the lead single from Daft Punk's fourth studio album, \"Random Access Memories\". Before its release as a single, \"Get Lucky\" was featured in television advertisements broadcast during \"Saturday Night Live\", after which Rodgers and Williams announced their involvement in the track. Small excerpts also appear throughout the promotional video series \"The Collaborators\".\n\n\"Get Lucky\" is a disco song with lyrics that, according to Williams, are about the good fortune of connecting with someone, as well as sexual chemistry. After it leaked in mid-April, the single was released as a digital download on 19 April 2013. \"Get Lucky\" has since received acclaim from critics, and has spawned numerous cover versions and parodies. The single reached the top ten in the music charts of over 32 countries, and has sold more than 9.3 million copies, making it one of the best-selling songs of all time. The song won awards for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, during which Stevie Wonder joined Rodgers, Williams and Daft Punk onstage to perform the song.\n\n\"Get Lucky\" was completed over the course of approximately 18 months. Daft Punk first met Rodgers at a listening party in New York City for the duo's 1997 debut album \"Homework\", and became friends thereafter. The duo acknowledged Chic's influence in the song \"Around the World\" and had great respect for Rodgers. He noted however that a series of near misses and scheduling conflicts had delayed their chance of collaborating. The duo eventually invited Rodgers to the \"Random Access Memories\" sessions at Electric Lady Studios in New York City. This coincidentally was the studio where the first Chic single had been recorded, in the neighborhood in which Rodgers grew up.\n\nAfter listening to Daft Punk's demo of what would become \"Get Lucky\", Rodgers asked that all of the elements except the drum track be muted so that he could create a suitable guitar part; he recalled that he experimented until the duo were visibly pleased. Once he completed his contribution, Daft Punk re-recorded the bass part with Nathan East to fit Rodgers' performance. Rodgers further elaborated that, \"Everybody else wound up re-playing to me\". Mixer and engineer Mick Guzauski recalled that the rhythm guitar fit easily into the production: \"I experimented with balancing and other positioning, and working other stuff around it. He didn’t have to be processed – Nile just sounded great the way he is.\" The song as it appears on the album also features a synthesizer part by Daft Punk, keyboards by Chris Caswell and additional guitar performed by Paul Jackson, Jr.\n\nWilliams first heard about the project from Daft Punk \"at a Madonna party\" and offered his services for a collaboration. He had joked that, \"If you just want me to play tambourine, I'll do it.\" The duo and Williams later met in Paris, where he shared some of his own material; Williams explained that he had been inspired by Rodgers, not knowing that Daft Punk had coincidentally been recording with him. Williams noted that the duo adopted a perfectionist approach during the recording of the vocals for \"Get Lucky\", as he was asked to perform several takes and multiple instances of specific phrases. As a member of The Neptunes production team, Williams had previously provided a remix of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" that appeared on the 2003 album \"Daft Club\". Daft Punk also served as co-writers and producers for the 2010 single \"Hypnotize U\" by N.E.R.D, Williams's band.\n\n\"Get Lucky\" is composed in the key of [[F sharp minor) It follows the [[chord progression]] of Bm– D -F♯m–E rf name=\"Musicnotes\" /> The song runs at [[common time]] with a tempo of 116 [[beats per minute|BPM]].\n\nPrior to Rodgers' involvement, the song existed in rough form that centered on [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] with [[Omar Hakim]] on drums and East performing bass guitar. Rodgers' presence on the completed song consists of two layered guitar parts: One layer features [[rhythm guitar]]ing while the other is a melodic [[riff]]. Rodgers considered the minimal number of layers to be a characteristic of early [[Chic (band)|Chic]] recordings due to the technical production limitations his band had at the time. Hakim demonstrated that the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] pattern of \"Get Lucky\" was devised as a way to provide variety whilst maintaining a minimal [[four on the floor (music)|four on the floor]] rhythm.\n\nWilliams noted that upon returning to the United States after his vocals were recorded, he had \"forgotten everything\" regarding the composition of \"Get Lucky\"; he attributed this to [[jet lag]], but jokingly wondered if Daft Punk had tampered with his memory. The duo responded by explaining that Williams's lyrics and performance had come about in a very spontaneous way, which was the likely reason he had trouble recalling the song.\n\nUpon hearing \"Get Lucky\" later in its developed form, Williams remarked that the music evoked the sense of being on an exotic island during a \"peachy color[ed]\" sunrise. He elaborated that the title does not simply refer to sexual acts, but to the good fortune of meeting with and immediately connecting to someone. Williams' vocal and Daft Punk's vocoder performance jointly span three [[octave]]s: D-D. Friend and occasional collaborator [[Chilly Gonzales]] also observed that Daft Punk had previously used the chord progression in \"Around the World\" and that the verse, bridge and chorus of \"Get Lucky\" are largely defined by the melodic phrasing of the vocal.\n\nThe duo noted that their own ten-minute remix of \"Get Lucky\" is more akin to extended mixes of the 1970s and 80s, rather than a conventional reworking. At the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]] ceremony, Daft Punk appeared on stage with Rodgers, Williams, and [[Stevie Wonder]] alongside \"Random Access Memories\" session players Hakim, Caswell and Jackson, Jr. Together they performed a medley of \"Get Lucky\", \"[[Le Freak]]\", \"[[Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger]]\", \"[[Another Star]]\", \"[[Lose Yourself to Dance]]\", and \"Around the World\".\n\n\"Get Lucky\" was first publicly revealed via two 15-second television advertisements on \"[[Saturday Night Live]]\". Rodgers announced his contribution to the song shortly afterward, and noted that various fan remixes of the clips have appeared online since the airing. The third trailer, which was shown at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], officially announced Williams's involvement in the song and features Daft Punk, Rodgers, and Williams performing together. The promotional web series \"The Collaborators\" featured excerpts of \"Get Lucky\", culminating in the Williams-focused episode in which the song was first referred to by name.\n\nDays prior to the single release, the song had been leaked and broadcast on various radio stations. In the United Kingdom the song joined the playlists of [[BBC Radio 1]], [[BBC Radio 2]] and [[BBC Radio 6 Music]]. Upon the official release, Williams performed \"Get Lucky\" live for the first time at an [[HTC One (2013)|HTC One]] launch party in Brooklyn.\n\nSince the release of \"Get Lucky\", Daft Punk have encouraged the reworking of their latest musical works and a series of \"Get Lucky\" remixes have been released from acts such as PV Nova and TBM. A 12\" [[gramophone record|vinyl]] single was released on 16 July 2013, featuring a ten-minute remix by Daft Punk, the album version and the radio edit. The Daft Punk remix was first released on [[Spotify]] and, as of 27 June 2013, was streamed 64 million times. In late June 2013, an unofficial remix album \"Random Access Memories Memories\" was released by Darkside (under the pseudonym Daftside), the musical partnership of producer Nicolas Jaar and musician Dave Harrington. Jaar has previously released remixes of [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]] and [[Brian Eno]].\n\nRodgers stated in an interview with \"The Guardian\" that a video for \"Get Lucky\" was shot in March 2013 that is distinct from the Coachella trailer, featuring a group of dancing extras. In an interview with French music magazine \"[[Rock & Folk]]\" in April however, Daft Punk stated that a music video was not part of the immediate promotional plans for the single. A trailer for the official \"Get Lucky\" remix was released via the Columbia Records [[YouTube]] channel on 25 June 2013, featuring a group of dancers. Rodgers later stated that video footage for \"[[Lose Yourself to Dance]]\" had been shot simultaneously with footage for \"Get Lucky\".\n\nDaft Punk were scheduled to appear on 6 August episode of \"[[The Colbert Report]]\" to promote \"Random Access Memories\", but were unable to do so because of contractual obligations regarding the duo's future appearance at the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]]. According to [[Stephen Colbert]], Daft Punk were unaware of any exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. Colbert nevertheless performed a pre-recorded elaborate dance number to \"Get Lucky\" featuring appearances from [[Hugh Laurie]], [[Jeff Bridges]], [[Jimmy Fallon]], [[The Rockettes]], [[Bryan Cranston]], [[Jon Stewart]], [[Matt Damon]], [[Charlie Rose]] and [[Henry Kissinger]]. Earlier on the program, Colbert had declared that the song was \"The Song of the Summer of the Century\".\n\n\"Get Lucky\" is a featured song in the video game \"[[Just Dance 2014]]\" and is also included on the video game soundtrack for \"[[NBA 2K14]]\". A remix of the song was also used in the dance number choreographed and performed by the 2013 nominees of the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Choreography]] during the [[65th Primetime Emmy Awards]].\n\nThe song was used in the 2014 films \"[[Boyhood (film)|Boyhood]]\" and \"[[The Inbetweeners 2]]\" and advertisements for the [[ITV2]] reality TV show \"[[The Only Way is Essex]]\".\n\nThe song was also used in \"[[The Simpsons]]\" episode \"[[Bull-E]]\".\n\n\"Get Lucky\" received widespread acclaim from media outlets and music critics. Michael Cragg from \"[[The Guardian]]\" said the song \"eschews the crunching electronics of their last album and the vocoder-lead future-disco of \"Discovery\"\", and it was the \"best thing Pharrell Williams has been involved with for a long time\". \"[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]\" listed \"Get Lucky\" as a Best New Track, stating that the song's \"real elegance lies in the hands of [[Nile Rodgers]]\". Lewis Corner from \"[[Digital Spy]]\" gave the single 5 stars and said although Daft Punk's \"creative methods may be unorthodox, the final result is a legal rush we can all enjoy\". [[BBC Radio 1]] host [[Annie Mac]] played \"Get Lucky\" on the day of its release, and gave it a positive review. She remarked that Daft Punk are not making [[electronic dance music]], but rather \"real music to dance to\". Music critic [[Sasha Frere-Jones]] of \"[[The New Yorker]]\" wrote that Rodgers' performance in the song was \"as close to magic as pop comes.\" \"[[Rolling Stone]]\" reviewer [[Will Hermes]] giving the song a four-star rating out of five, described it as \"an old-school disco jam\" and called it \"formidable\". Amy Sciarretto of PopCrush also welcomed the song, she called it an \"intoxicating track\" and wrote it \"represents all that’s right with electronic music.\"\n\nFellow musicians have also publicly commented on the song. British DJ and producer [[Norman Cook]] (better known as Fatboy Slim) expressed high praise for the song and stated in an interview with the \"[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]\": \"I'm so impressed by them. It's a breath of fresh old-skool air\". Cook had felt that recent popular electronic dance music had started to become bland and that \"Daft Punk have given us [electronic musicians] all a kick up the arse.\"\n\nThe song broke records with the highest number of plays of any song in a single day on music streaming application [[Spotify]]. British journalist [[Caitlin Moran]] has speculated that the song's attractiveness is due to its combination of minor chords and regular disco-type \"up\" beats throughout the song, with the former creating an unresolved feeling. \"Get Lucky\" was nominated for Best Song of the Summer at the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]]. The song received awards for both [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]]. \"Get Lucky\" was voted the number one song of 2013 in a [[Digital Spy]] reader poll.\nOn 26 January 2014, \"Get Lucky\" reached #3 in Triple J's Hottest 100 of 2013, the world's largest musical democracy. \"[[The Village Voice]]\"s [[Pazz & Jop]] annual critics' poll ranked \"Get Lucky\" at number one to find the best music of 2013. The aggregation website [[Acclaimed Music]] currently ranks \"Get Lucky\" as the greatest song of 2013, the greatest song of the 2010s decade, and the 107th greatest song of all time.\n\nIn France, \"Get Lucky\" debuted at number one on the [[French Singles Chart]] on 24 April 2013, becoming Daft Punk's first chart-topping single in their home country since \"[[One More Time (Daft Punk song)|One More Time]]\" in 2000. The song sold 38,887 copies in three days, making \"Get Lucky\" the best-selling digital single in a one-week period. In Belgium, where two independent official charts are published weekly (one for Flanders, one for Wallonia), \"Get Lucky\" entered in the top position on both charts, making it Daft Punk's highest Belgian chart entry ever and their first No. 1 song in the country.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Get Lucky\" entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number three on 21 April 2013―only 48 hours after its release—selling more than 50,000 copies and becoming Daft Punk's first top ten hit in the UK since \"One More Time\" in 2000. The song then peaked at number one the following week, with sales of over 155,000 copies, and became Daft Punk's first ever number one single in Britain. The song remained in the top position during the following week, selling over 163,000. \"Get Lucky\" remained atop the chart for a third and fourth consecutive week, selling over 100,000 copies within each of them. By late May 2013, over 600,000 copies of the song had been sold in just over four weeks and sales had exceeded those of [[Macklemore]] and [[Ryan Lewis]]' \"[[Thrift Shop]]\", making \"Get Lucky\" the country's best-selling single of the year thus far.\n\nOn 27 June 2013, the [[Official Charts Company]] announced that \"Get Lucky\" [[List of million-selling singles in the United Kingdom|had sold over a million copies in the UK]]; only the 136th single and first released in 2013 to do so. The song was the first involving Daft Punk, Williams or Rodgers to achieve this feat as well as being the second by a French act (after [[David Guetta]]'s \"[[Titanium (song)|Titanium]]\"). Both Martin Talbot, chief executive of the Official Charts Company, and Rodgers were impressed by the quick time (69 days) the single took to cross the million sales barrier. It was the second best-selling song in the UK in 2013, with sales of over 1,308,000, and the most streamed track of 2013 in the UK. As of June 2015, \"Get Lucky\" has sold 1,436,000 copies in the UK, making it the [[List of best-selling singles of the 2000s (century) in the United Kingdom|sixth best-selling single of the 2010s]] and the [[List of best-selling singles of the 2010s in the United Kingdom|eighth best-selling single of the century]].\n\nIn the United States, the song debuted at number five on the \"Billboard\" [[Dance/Electronic Singles Sales|Dance/Electronic Songs]] chart for the week ending 4 May 2013. By the week ending 25 May, the song had reached the number 2 position and its peak position of number one was eventually reached during the week ending of 1 June 2013 remaining on top for 13 weeks. The song debuted at number 19 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|\"Billboard\" Hot 100]] on 24 April 2013, selling 113,000 downloads—this placement resulted in the song becoming the duo's first ever top 40 hit on the chart. \"Get Lucky\" eventually peaked at number two on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 for five weeks, behind [[Robin Thicke]]'s \"[[Blurred Lines]]\" featuring [[T.I.]] and Williams. Since both songs feature Williams, he became the first artist to simultaneously occupy the top two slots of the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 chart since 2009, when [[The Black Eyed Peas]] achieved the same feat. \"Get Lucky\" also reached the number one position on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart, their first song to achieve this feat since \"[[Face to Face (Daft Punk song)|Face to Face]]\" in 2004. As of April 2014, the song has sold over 3,475,000 copies in the United States, the most for any Daft Punk song.\n\nIn Australia, \"Get Lucky\" debuted at number two on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Singles Chart]] on the week ending 5 May 2013. The song is Daft Punk's highest-placing entry on the chart since \"One More Time\" peaked at number 10 in April 2001. The song attained the [[List of number-one singles of 2013 (Australia)|top position]] on the ARIA chart in the second week after its release. The song reached number one on the week ending of 19 May and remained at the position for two more weeks. Besides appearing at [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards]], Daft Punk, Williams, and Rodgers were nominated for Best Song of the Summer, but lost by a very large margin to [[One Direction]]'s \"[[Best Song Ever (song)|Best Song Ever]]\".\n\nNumerous cover versions of \"Get Lucky\" have been published since the single's release. In April 2013, English folk band [[Daughter (band)|Daughter]] recorded an indie version of the song for BBC Radio 1's [[Live Lounge]]. In the same month, Dutch reggae and hip hop band the [[Postmen]] recorded an English-language version for Giel Beelen's program on the [[3FM]] radio station. Israeli musician [[Noy Alooshe]] made a mashup of the song with [[Michael Jackson]]'s \"[[Billie Jean]]\". The song was also covered by George Barnett, [[Postmen]], [[Igor Presnyakov]], [[The Stepkids]], [[Sam Sparro]] and [[Skylar Grey]]. In May 2013, [[Peter Serafinowicz]] uploaded a video of him, featuring the song. The same month, English bands [[Peace (band)|Peace]] and the [[Mystery Jets]] performed the song together during a concert. Australian band [[San Cisco]] recorded a cover version for the radio station [[Triple J]], incorporating slap bass and bongo drums as well as elements of the N.E.R.D song \"[[Hypnotize U]]\". [[Joe McElderry]] has performed the song a number of times at his gigs, the first being at London's Pizza Express Jazz Club on 28 May.\n\nThe song was covered by British record producer [[Naughty Boy]], for his debut album \"[[Hotel Cabana]]\"; it features as a bonus track with vocals by Tanika. In June 2013, [[The Roots]] covered the song as fictional duo \"Black Simon & Garfunkel\" on \"[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]\". [[Wilco]] performed a version at the opening night of the Solid Sound Festival in [[North Adams, Massachusetts|North Adams]], [[Massachusetts]], U.S. on 21 June 2013, In July 2013, [[Florence Welch]] sang the song in London. Arié Elmaleh, brother of [[Gad Elmaleh]], performed an adapted Dutch version on \"[[Le Grand Journal (Canal+)|Le Grand Journal]]\" in August 2013. In the same month a [[Orthodox Judaism|Jewish Orthodox]] organization [[Aish HaTorah]] published a [[Rosh Hashanah]]'s (\"Jewish New Year\") version of this song, called \"Get Clarity\". In September 2013, [[Fall Out Boy]] performed the song during a concert in [[Uncasville, Connecticut]]. A reggae cover version was released by Antiguan singer Asher Otto and her band Itchyfeet. Rock band [[Halestorm]] recorded a cover for their EP \"ReAniMate 2.0\". Rapper [[Kellee Maize]] recorded a cover and remix of and created a video for the song entitled \"Do Something\".

In the [[The Voice UK (series 3)|third series]] of \"The Voice\", the song was sung by contestant Anna McLuckie, who also played the harp to the song. This video on [[YouTube]] went viral, with over 18 million views. In February 2014, [[Pomplamoose]] released a Williams-themed cover medley combining \"Get Lucky\", Daft Punk's \"[[Lose Yourself to Dance]]\" and Williams' \"[[Happy (Pharrell Williams song)|Happy]]\".

                "Random Access Memories\n\nRandom Access Memories is the fourth studio album by French electronic music duo Daft Punk. It was released on 17 May 2013, by the duo's imprint Daft Life and Columbia Records. The album pays tribute to the late 1970s and early 1980s American music, particularly from Los Angeles. This theme is reflected in the album's packaging, as well as its promotional campaign, which included billboards, television advertisements and a web series.\n\nUnlike their previous albums, Daft Punk recruited session musicians to perform live instrumentation and limited the use of electronic instruments to drum machines, a custom-built modular synthesizer, and vintage vocoders. The album features collaborations with Giorgio Moroder, Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams and Pharrell Williams. It is the first Daft Punk album released by Columbia Records.\n\n\"Random Access Memories\" received critical acclaim, scoring an 87 out of 100 on review aggregator site Metacritic and appearing on many music critics' year-end lists. It is one of Daft Punk's most commercially successful albums, topping the charts in more than 25 countries worldwide. It was their first album to top the United States \"Billboard\" 200 chart, selling more than 339,000 copies within its first week. The lead single \"Get Lucky\" was a critical and commercial success, topping the charts in more than 30 countries and becoming one of the best-selling digital singles of all time. At the 56th Annual Grammy Awards in 2014, the album won Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, Best Dance/Electronica Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, and \"Get Lucky\" won for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.\n\nShortly after finishing off their Alive 2006/2007 tour, Daft Punk began working on new material in 2008. Thomas Bangalter of the duo recalled, \"the two of us would go in with a lot of keyboards, guitars, drums, and stuff and started to do demos for six, seven months.\" Daft Punk were pleased with the work in terms of composition, but were dissatisfied with the production aspect, as they relied on samples and loops of their own performances: \"We could play some riffs and stuff but not keep it [up] for four minutes straight.\" Daft Punk put these demos aside and started work on the \"\" film soundtrack later in 2008. As Bangalter mentioned after the film's release in 2010: \"Making music for a movie is very humbling. We’ve been working on some of our music concurrently.\" Daft Punk then decided to work extensively with live musicians on what would become \"Random Access Memories\": \"We wanted to do what we used to do with machines and samplers, but with people.\" They avoided the use of samples on the album, with the exception of the closing track \"Contact\".\nThe album features Chic frontman Nile Rodgers, who commented that a collaboration was \"something we've [Daft Punk and Rodgers] talked about for a long time. We've respected each other endlessly.\" Daft Punk eventually visited Rodgers' home for an informal jam session, and an official collaboration was later confirmed and completed. Musician Paul Williams announced in a 2010 interview that he had worked with the group, after Daft Punk had been introduced to Williams by a sound engineer with whom they were mutually acquainted.\n\nIn May 2012 Daft Punk's collaboration with Giorgio Moroder was announced—Moroder had recorded a monologue about his life for use in a track on the album. Rodgers was also present during the Moroder recording session. Moroder clarified that he was not involved in the composition of the track or its use of a synthesizer: \"They did not let me get involved at all. Thomas asked me if I wanted to tell the story of my life. Then they would know what to do with it.\" Daft Punk had been in contact with Moroder in relation to a possible contribution for the \"Tron: Legacy\" score, but this never happened.\n\nChilly Gonzales stated in an interview that his contribution was recorded in a one-day session: \"I played for hours and they're gonna grab what they grab and turn it into whatever.\" He explained that Daft Punk prompted him at the piano in the same manner that a film director coaches an actor, and Gonzales left the Los Angeles studio without knowledge of what the final product would sound like. He had previously recorded a cover version of Daft Punk's song \"Too Long\" that appeared on the duo's 2003 album \"Daft Club\".\n\nPharrell Williams collaborated with Daft Punk and Rodgers by providing vocals for two tracks on \"Random Access Memories\". As a member of the Neptunes, Pharrell had previously provided a remix of \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" that appeared on \"Daft Club\". The Neptunes and Daft Punk also co-produced N.E.R.D.'s song \"Hypnotize U\".\n\nRecording took place at Henson Recording Studios, Conway Recording Studios and Capitol Studios in California, Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and Gang Recording Studio in Paris, France. Having worked with keyboardist and arranger Chris Caswell on \"Tron: Legacy\", the duo enlisted him and connected with engineers and other session players for their next album. Daft Punk recalled that they wished to avoid the more compressed sounds of drum machines in favor of \"airy open\" drum sets of the 1970s and 80s, which the duo consider the most appealing era. Bangalter clarified that \"it's not that we can't make crazy futuristic sounding stuff, but we wanted to play with the past\". The duo noted that the session players were enthusiastic to reunite in the context of the new album and the perceived prestige of the studio locations.\n\nDrummer Omar Hakim recalled being asked by Daft Punk to perform on the album, and was surprised by what they wanted of him. He at first assumed that the duo wanted electronic drum work, since Hakim had done some drum programming in his career. Daft Punk instead specified that they were looking to record Hakim performing acoustic drum riffs that the duo had conceived. Rather than play out the entire structure of a song, Hakim would perform individual patterns for extended periods, thus creating a library for the duo to cull from. Daft Punk conveyed their ideas to session musicians via sheet music and in some instances by humming melodies. Bangalter recalled an example in which he hummed a complex drum and bass line to Hakim, who replicated and improved upon it for the track \"Giorgio by Moroder\".\n\nMost of the vocal sessions took place in Paris, whereas the rhythm sections were recorded in the United States. The album incorporates a variety of accompanying performances including a horn section, woodwind instruments, a string orchestra and choir. Orchestral parts in particular were recorded for almost every track, but were only included on a few songs in the final product. The use of such performers and places came at great monetary expense, as noted by Bangalter: \"There used to be a time where people that had means to experiment would do it, you know? That's what this record is about.\" He estimated a cost of over one million dollars, but felt that the number was not important. Bangalter stated that the sessions were financed by Daft Punk themselves, which allowed them the luxury of abandoning the project if they had so wished. He also specified that \"there are songs on the album that traveled into five studios over two and a half years.\"\n\nVarious sound effects were newly recorded with the help of film experts from Warner Bros. Bangalter noted one example in which the sound of a busy restaurant was achieved by placing microphones in front of the forks of a group of people. In another instance, the effect of dripping water was recorded on a soundstage. Use of electronics was limited to drum machines that appear on only two tracks, a large custom-built Modcan modular synthesizer performed live by the duo, and vintage vocoders. When asked which of the two Daft Punk members performed the robotic vocals on the album, Bangalter expressed that it did not matter. The duo produced most of the vocoder tracks in their own private studio in Paris, with later processing done by Mick Guzauski at Capitol. Moroder elaborated that Daft Punk would take \"a week or so\" to find an adequate vocoder sound, and an additional few days to record the lyrics.\n\nAlthough the duo felt that the presets and parameters of digital tools would inhibit creativity and innovation, they admitted that \"Random Access Memories\" could not have been made in the complete absence of computer technology. The sessions were recorded simultaneously onto Ampex reels and as Pro Tools tracks; Daft Punk and Guzauski would then listen to each recording in both analogue and digital iterations, deciding which of the two they preferred. Subsequently, the elements were edited by the duo with Pro Tools in a manner similar to how they would work with samples.\n\nIn an interview conducted in November 2012 by \"Guitar World\" magazine, Fourplay member Nathan East mentioned that he had contributed to the project. The percussionist Quinn also stated that he performed on \"every drum [he] own[s]\" for the album. Pedal steel guitar work on the record was performed by Greg Leisz. Daft Punk sought to use the instrument in a way that bordered between electronic and acoustic. Additional session players include John \"J.R.\" Robinson, Paul Jackson, Jr., James Genus, Thomas Bloch and Chris Caswell.\n\nBangalter described the album's title as encapsulating Daft Punk's interest in the past, referencing both random-access memory technology and the human experience: \"We were drawing a parallel between the brain and the hard drive – the random way that memories are stored.\" Daft Punk felt that while current technology allows for an unlimited capacity to store recorded material, the content produced by contemporary artists had diminished in quality. Their goal was therefore to maximize the potential of infinite storage by recording a sprawling amount of elements. The duo pointed to the process as being further inspiration for the album's title, as they sought to make connections out of the random series of ideas.\n\n\"Random Access Memories\" has been noted by music critics as a disco album. Regarding the style of the album, they sought a \"west coast vibe\", referencing such acts as Fleetwood Mac, the Doobie Brothers and the Eagles. Daft Punk also acknowledged that the record pays homage to Michael Jackson, the Cars and Steely Dan. The recording of live synthesizer parts was done in a progressive rock fashion, with the pop sensibilities of Wizzard and the Move. Daft Punk specifically looked to the albums \"Rumours\" by Fleetwood Mac and \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" by Pink Floyd as models. Bangalter felt that \"the most important records in music, whether it's Led Zeppelin [...] or \"The White Album\" or \"Sgt. Pepper's...\" or \"Quadrophenia\" or \"Tommy\", are the ones that take you on a journey for miles and miles.\"\n\nThe initial demos of \"Random Access Memories\" were created without a clear plan for an album. Over the course of the sessions, numerous tracks were created and discarded. At one point Daft Punk had considered sorting the entire album into one continuous track, similar to the Prince record \"Lovesexy\". They had also considered releasing it as a four-disc box set to accommodate the large volume of content produced. Thus the album lacked structure until the final months of production.\n\nThe opening track, \"Give Life Back to Music\", features guitar work by Rodgers and Paul Jackson, Jr., drums by John \"J.R.\" Robinson, and lyrics performed by Daft Punk using vocoders. The song reflects the duo's goal to create a light yet polished and elegant record. As stated by \"NME\", the album begins with \"a stupendously vast rock intro that obliterates any trace of \"Human After All\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s brittle techno\". The following track, \"The Game of Love\", also features vocoder singing by the duo. Bangalter said, \"There’s this thing today where the recorded human voice is processed to try to feel robotic.\" He explained that the duo's intention was to produce robotic vocals with expressiveness and emotion. \"Giorgio by Moroder\" was created to serve as a metaphor about musical freedom. The duo believed that a monologue by Moroder about his career would be an analogue for music's history regarding exploration of genres and tastes.\n\"Within\" was one of the first tracks to be recorded for the album. It features Gonzales on piano with minimal accompaniment consisting of bass and a percussion track, as well as vocoder. In the context of the album, \"Within\" marks the transition from the key of A minor of the previous three songs, to the key of B-flat minor of subsequent tracks. Regarding the lyrics, critic Nick Stevenson observed, \"A deep vocoder sings about not understanding the world, being lost and not even remembering his own name.\" Jeremy Abbott of \"Mixmag\" added, \"\"So many things I don't understand\" is the prominent lyric and Chilly's chords combined with grazing cymbals make for a beautiful summer lullaby.\"\n\"Instant Crush\" was based on a demo that Daft Punk presented to Julian Casablancas; he became enthused upon hearing it and provided vocals. The song contains rock influences and a guitar solo. Critic John Balfe considered it \"appropriately Strokes-ish, even if [Casablancas'] trademark drawl is fed quite substantially through a vocoder.\" De Homem-Christo noted, \"It is true that it is not his usual register, it is the way Julian reacted to the track so for us it is even more exciting.\" \"Lose Yourself to Dance\" features Pharrell Williams and was the result of a desire to create dance music with live drummers. To that end, Robinson appears as session player. A vocoder chant of \"come on\" appears in the song alongside Pharrell Williams's singing.\n\n\"Touch\" features lyrics written and performed by Paul Williams. Daft Punk noted that the song is the most complex piece on the record, being composed of over 250 elements. As \"Pitchfork\" observed, \"the song warps and bends, floating through genres, epochs, and emotions with a sense of hallucinatory wonder\" and recalls the Beatles song \"A Day in the Life\". In \"Rolling Stone\", Will Hermes observes, \"It's completely ridiculous. It's also remarkably beautiful and affecting.\" Louis Lepron of Kombini believed the multitude of styles and science fiction aesthetics on the track is an homage to musical films including \"Phantom of the Paradise\", the soundtrack of which Williams had composed. The song's opening is a specific reference to a scene in the film in which the title character's voice is gradually enhanced in a studio booth. De Homem-Christo stated that \"Touch\" is \"like the core of the record, and the memories of the other tracks are revolving around it.\"\n\n\"Get Lucky\" is the second song on the album to feature Pharrell Williams, who clarified that the title phrase does not simply refer to a sexual act, but to the potential fortune of finding chemistry with another person. When he had first heard the song, Pharrell Williams said it evoked the image of a \"peachy color[ed]\" sunrise on an exotic island. Daft Punk discussed the concept of the song \"Beyond\" with Paul Williams, who then translated the ideas into lyrics for it. The track begins with an orchestral string section and timpani before settling into what \"NME\" called \"reupholstered Warren G 'Regulate' grooves\". Stevenson similarly described \"Beyond\" as \"a lot like the sample used in Nate Dogg and Warren G’s ‘Regulate’\", Michael McDonald's song \"I Keep Forgettin'\", which he noted as \"no bad thing\", and stated that the vocoder-affected lyrics detail \"the existential world beyond oceans and mountains – a land beyond love.\"\n\n\"Motherboard\" was described by Daft Punk as being \"a futuristic composition that could be from the year 4000\". A review elaborated that the instrumental piece can \"carry you away like a track by Sébastien Tellier\". Todd Edwards commented that the lyrics of \"Fragments of Time\" were inspired by his desire to capture the moments he experienced during his visit to the duo's studio sessions in California. \"Doin' It Right\" was the last song to be recorded and features vocals performed by Panda Bear. The duo referred to it as the only purely electronic piece on the album, with a modern style. The closing track, \"Contact\", is co-produced by DJ Falcon and features a sample of the song \"We Ride Tonight\" by Australian rock band the Sherbs.\n\nThe Japan-exclusive bonus track \"Horizon\", written by Bangalter and de Homem Christo, is a slow-tempo composition reminiscent of Pink Floyd. It is characterized by a consistent guitar strum while several additional instruments are progressively layered over, including a bass guitar and drums. The song is stylistically different from other tracks on the album, and is one of the few to feature no lyrics.\n\nIn January 2013, de Homem-Christo first revealed that Daft Punk was in the process of signing with Sony Music Entertainment through the Columbia Records label, and that the album would have a spring release. A report from \"The Guardian\" followed specifying a release date of May 2013. On 26 February 2013, Daft Punk's official website and Facebook page announced the signing to Columbia with a picture of the duo's helmets, and a \"Columbia\" logo in the corner. Billboards and posters featuring the helmets and logo then appeared in several major cities.\n\nOn 2 March, a 15-second television ad aired during \"Saturday Night Live\" (\"SNL\") depicting an animated, stylized version of the band's logo and the aforementioned image of the helmets. The music featured in the ad was a result of the collaboration with Rodgers, who noted that various fan remixes of the clip appeared online after the airing. A second TV ad also premiered that was similar to the first on \"Saturday Night Live\", but with a different music clip and the title \"Random Access Memories\" in place of the stylized Daft Punk logo. During the first night of Coachella Festival 2013, a third trailer debuted that featured Daft Punk, Pharrell Williams and Rodgers performing, as well as a list of collaborators on the album. The trailer also aired during \"Saturday Night Live\" the following evening, but without a list of collaborators.\n\nThe gradual rollout of promotion was inspired by advertising of the past, reflecting the theme of the album. Daft Punk approached Columbia with a specific agenda for the campaign; Rob Stringer of the label recalled that the duo had showed him the book \"Rock 'n' Roll Billboards of the Sunset Strip\" as an example of what they wanted. Bangalter felt that physical billboards are more affecting than banner ads and that \"\"SNL\" is this part of American culture with a certain timelessness to it.\" The campaign was handled by a small group led by Daft Punk and manager Paul Hahn, with assistance from Kathryn Frazier of the public-relations firm Biz 3. The duo had pursued Columbia in particular because of its long-standing history, as expressed by Bangalter: \"It felt interesting conceptually to write this story with a record company like Columbia, with a 125-year legacy.\" Furthermore, the vinyl labels of the album feature the classic yellow on red Columbia label used on records during said time period.\n\nCentral to the promotion was the limiting of exposure to the album's content, as well as a focus on face-to-face contact for press previews. As Hahn stated, \"There is a minimalism in our approach that creates an absence of information, and we notice our fans tend to throw themselves into the breach, or try to fill the empty spaces.\" The album's track titles were initially withheld from online retailers and later revealed through Columbia's Vine account on 16 April 2013 as a video relaying a series of images. Following a reported leak of the song days earlier, \"Get Lucky\" was released as a digital download single on 19 April 2013. On 13 May, Daft Punk's official Vevo channel posted a video revealing the artwork packaging of the vinyl version of the album, as well as the first few seconds of the opening track. Later that day, a limited-time preview stream of the full album was launched via the iTunes Store.\n\nDaft Punk were scheduled to appear on 6 August episode of \"The Colbert Report\" to promote \"Random Access Memories\", but were unable to do so because of conflicting obligations regarding the duo's future appearance at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. According to Stephen Colbert, Daft Punk were unaware of any exclusivity agreement and were halted by MTV executives the morning prior to the taping. Colbert nevertheless broadcast an elaborate sketch of himself dancing to \"Get Lucky\" with various celebrities, including Hugh Laurie, Jeff Bridges, Jimmy Fallon, Bryan Cranston, Jon Stewart, Henry Kissinger, Matt Damon, and the Rockettes.\n\nColumbia released a deluxe box set of \"Random Access Memories\" containing a 56-page hardcover book, the vinyl edition of the album, a partial 70 mm film strip of the \"Lose Yourself to Dance\" video, and USB drives containing bonus audio as well as video content.\n\nThe \"Random Access Memories\" official website features a video series called \"The Collaborators\", directed by Ed Lachman and produced by \"The Creators Project\", a partnership between Intel and \"Vice\". Eight episodes were released in the series, which features interviews with participant artists that were involved in the making of the album. All featured album artists appear in the series with the exception of Casablancas, who would go on to appear prominently in the music video for \"Instant Crush\". Excerpts of the lead single \"Get Lucky\" appear in the opening and ending of each \"Collaborators\" episode as well as excerpts of other songs from the album, corresponding to each featured musician.\n\nThe first episode features disco pioneer Moroder speaking about his experiences with the genre such as his records with Donna Summer and experimenting with synthesizers. Moroder also talks about his visit with Daft Punk in their recording studio. When asked how he first found out about the duo, he replied that he first heard their 2000 single \"One More Time\" and especially liked the breakdown middle section. He concluded that he views Daft Punk as \"perfectionists\" and described the album's style as \"something [...] different. Still dance, still electronic; but [they] give that human touch back\".\n\nEpisode two revealed that Edwards had contributed to the album; he expressed that it was difficult keeping his involvement a secret. Edwards had previously collaborated with Daft Punk to create the song \"Face to Face\" on the 2001 album \"Discovery\". He summarized his experience in the studio recording \"Fragments of Time\" as being life-changing, as the sessions inspired him to move from New Jersey to California on a permanent basis. Edwards also pointed out the irony of \"two androids [...] bringing soul back to music\".\n\nThe third episode features Rodgers, who spoke of his background as a founding member of Chic, as well as his numerous collaborations with other artists throughout his career, such as David Bowie, Madonna, and Duran Duran. He expressed that working with Daft Punk \"[felt] like [...] working with contemporaries\" and that they motivated each other to excel when collaborating on the album. At the end of the episode, Rodgers played a portion of a then-unspecified song in which he participated, which was later identified as \"Lose Yourself to Dance\", and remarked that the duo's style has evolved whilst simultaneously exploring music's past, suggesting that \"they went back to go forward.\"\n\nPharrell Williams participated in the fourth episode in which he elaborated on his experience with the creation of the album. Pharrell remarked upon the organic sound of the album, surmising that it \"feels like the only click track they had was [...] the human heartbeat\". He felt that the record can be enjoyed by people of all ages due to the accessible nature of music, and concluded that Daft Punk \"could just get back on the spaceship that brought them here and go, and leave us. But they're gracious, they're nice robots. They chose to stay\".\nEpisode five features Noah Lennox, better known by his stage name Panda Bear, who spoke about his contribution to the album as well as his history with the band Animal Collective. He had first heard of Daft Punk through the music video of the song \"Around the World\", which introduced him to many aspects of electronic dance music. He added that \"Homework\" was one of the few albums he and his older brother both enjoyed. Regarding \"Random Access Memories\", Lennox remarked upon the approach of having live musicians, but structuring their performances in a minimal, sample-like fashion.\n\nFor the sixth episode, Gonzales spoke about his contribution to the album. He recalled Daft Punk's visible joy in listening to the raw session recordings made early in the production of the album, as well as the impending years-long challenge that would be faced in completing the record. Gonzales expressed that the duo were aware of how the keys of each song would contribute to the emotional progression of the album as a whole. He therefore performed the piano in the song \"Within\" to accommodate the cycle. Gonzales concluded by pointing out that Daft Punk rarely collaborate with others, and thus felt that they did so on \"Random Access Memories\" to \"make the work be transcendent\".\n\nThe seventh episode features Stéphane Quême, otherwise known as DJ Falcon, who spoke of first meeting Daft Punk when the duo began recording their debut album \"Homework\". Quême noted that the group's sound had changed since their debut, and that each of their albums had had a distinct influence. He also felt that the recording of \"Random Access Memories\" was such that a producer could potentially sample a track from it in the same way that Daft Punk themselves had sampled older records in their previous albums. Quême concluded that the duo were always sincere and although their first single was released 20 years ago, it still felt modern.\n\nEpisode eight features Paul Williams, who likened Daft Punk's personas to a character from the film \"Phantom of the Paradise\", in which he starred. He also added that their masks hide who they are from the public and allow the listeners to enjoy the music for what it is. Paul Williams worked with the duo at Henson Recording Studios, the former studio of A&M Records where he had worked previously, including his compositions for Jim Henson's films featuring the Muppets, such as \"Rainbow Connection\". He also stated that the song he penned was to be sung from the point of view of an unidentified first person, setting the emotion, but the lyrics came from the music itself. Paul Williams said that he felt vulnerable while writing the record, and said he writes best when he is allowed to be honest and vulnerable, a situation that Daft Punk allowed. He also stated that his sobriety added a sense of wonder to the song he wrote, as every day for him being sober has been wonderful compared to his prior life of excess.\n\nThe 79th Annual Wee Waa Show, held on 17 May 2013 in the rural Australian town of Wee Waa, was selected as the venue for the worldwide album launch. The tickets for the Wee Waa album launch were completely sold within thirteen minutes of release, even though it was widely understood that Daft Punk would not be in attendance at the launch—the album launch details revealed that the album would be streamed live to the 4,000 audience members. Australian police in the local Wee Waa area initiated Operation Hadrian to prevent alcohol-related problems and anti-social behaviour at the launch event.\n\nSony commissioned the design and construction of a custom-built stage for the Wee Waa album launch event, and the Daft Arts production house assembled a LED circular music space that became Australia's biggest-ever outdoor dance floor. The record label described the creation, which was illuminated by a giant disco ball and complemented by four speaker towers and flood lights, as \"\"Saturday Night Fever\" meets \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\"\". The prelude to the streaming of the album was a pyrotechnic show provided by Father Anthony Koppman and his company \"Holy Smoke\" from Guyra, New South Wales.\n\nAt Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album gained an average score of 87, based on 47 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\" and scoring higher than any other album by the duo. \"Q\" referred to it as \"by some margin Daft Punk's best album in a career that's already redefined dance music at least twice. It is, in short, a mind blower.\" \"The Independent\" stated, \"\"Random Access Memories\" breathes life into the safe music that dominates today’s charts, with its sheer ambition…It's an exciting journey, and one that, for all its musical twists and turns, has its feet planted on the dancefloor.\" Melissa Maerz of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called it \"a headphones album in an age of radio singles; a bravura live performance that stands out against pro forma knob-twiddling; a jazzy disco attack on the basic house beat; a full collaboration at a time when the superstar DJ stands alone.\" She concluded her review by saying that \"if EDM is turning humans into robots, Daft Punk are working hard to make robot pop feel human again.\"\n\nSeveral critics commented on the variety of content on the album. \"NME\" said, \"There's a creeping notion that every musical idea that's ever been so much as thought up is on this album.\" In addition, \"Random Access Memories\" is ranked #497 on \"NME\"'s list, \"The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\". Mark Richardson of \"Pitchfork\" echoed this sentiment, calling the record \"a mix of disco, soft rock, and prog-pop, along with some Broadway-style pop bombast and even a few pinches of their squelching stadium-dance aesthetic\". Richardson praised the engineering and recording on the album, but did say that \"though everything about \"RAM\", from the session musicians to the guests to the means of production, is meant to sound more 'human,' the album at points sounds more sterile, almost too perfect.\" \"Pitchfork\" deemed the album the seventh best of 2013. \"DJ Magazine\" commented on the shift in Daft Punk's musical style: \"While Daft Punk clearly want to move on and evolve, ditching the electronic beats, house and techno that first elevated them to fame, it's that music that forms the bedrock of their best tunes, and still, that's what they're best at making.\" \"Resident Advisor\" stated that \"it's an album rooted in a now-ancient aesthetic: '70s staples, like crisply recorded California studio music, or the kind of deceptively sophisticated New York disco that , one of the album's key guest artists, popularized with Chic.\" In a four-and-a-half star review, Heather Phares of AllMusic said that the record \"taps into the wonder and excitement\" of music from the 1970s and early 1980s. Phares concluded her review by saying, \"\"Random Access Memories\" is also Daft Punk's most personal work, and richly rewarding for listeners willing to spend time with it.\"\n\nAaron Payne of musicOMH wrote, \"Daft Punk somehow misplace the wit and the light touch that's pretty much their trademark. Instead, these long epics become somewhat tedious and there is a strong whiff of egoism and self-indulgence.…At over 70 minutes, the album feels rather bloated. Quite a few of the songs are too long, or too empty of ideas, or too willing to repeat themselves, or too willing to play to type\". Dan Weiss of \"Paste\" noted that \"none of the admittedly eclectic pilferings of \"Random Access Memories\" challenge or defy anything. They all evoke specific eras of film soundtrack or disco trend. The beats have grown less, not more, complex over time.\"\n\n\"Random Access Memories\" received Grammy Awards for Album of the Year, Best Dance/Electronica Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical for the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. The lead single, \"Get Lucky\", also won for Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance. \"Get Lucky\" had previously been nominated for Best Song of the Summer at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards and Best Song at the 2013 MTV Europe Music Awards. In January 2015, the album was placed at number 9 on \"Billboard\"'s list of \"The 20 Best Albums of 2010s (so far)\".\n\n\"Random Access Memories\" debuted at number one on the French Albums Chart with first-week sales of 195,013 copies (127,361 physical sales and 67,652 digital sales), earning Daft Punk their first number-one album in France. The next week, it sold 49,600 copies to remain at the top spot with a 75% sales decrease. The album secured a third consecutive week atop the French chart, withstanding a 29% sales drop to 35,500 copies.\n\n\"Random Access Memories\" debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with 165,091 copies sold in its first week, becoming the duo's first UK number-one album, as well as the second fastest-selling artist album of 2013 after One Direction's \"Midnight Memories\". The album remained at number one on the UK chart the following week, selling 52,801 copies. In its third week, it fell to number three on sales of 28,182 copies.\n\nIn the United States, the album debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 339,000 copies, the duo's first number one album on the chart. The album maintained the number one spot in its second week, selling 93,000 copies. In the album's third week of release, it sold an additional 62,000 copies, while falling to number two on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album's vinyl LP format also proved popular; it was 2013's top-selling LP, with 49,000 US copies shifted. The album had sold 922,000 copies in the US as of January 2014. On 6 February 2014, the album was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Following the duo's Album of the Year win at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards, \"Random Access Memories\" jumped from number 39 to number 10 on the \"Billboard\" 200 with a 300% sales increase, selling 30,000 copies that week.\n\n\"Random Access Memories\" entered the Canadian Albums Chart at number one with 46,000 copies sold, the biggest one-week sales total in Canada of 2013. The album remained at number one the next week, selling 17,000 copies. In Japan, the album debuted at number three on the Oricon Weekly Albums Chart, selling 25,970 copies.\n\nThe album debuted at number one in several countries across continental Europe, including Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark (where the album sold 5,392 copies in its first week), Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland. In Oceania, \"Random Access Memories\" debuted at number one in Australia and New Zealand; it was certified platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) and gold by the Recording Industry Association of New Zealand (RIANZ) in its first week.\n\nAs of 2014, \"Random Access Memories\" has sold 3.2 million copies worldwide.\n\nAdapted from the liner notes.\n\n\nOn 23 March, the album became available for pre-order on the iTunes Store via digital download, revealing a release date of 17 May in Australia, 20 May in the United Kingdom, and 21 May in the United States. It later appeared as an Amazon.com pre-order on CD, vinyl and directly from the \"Random Access Memories\" official website. The album became available for preview streaming via the iTunes Store on 13 May 2013. It was also released for streaming on Spotify, with the lead single, \"Get Lucky\", topping Spotify's first digital streaming chart in the process.\n"

                "Isaiah Rashad\n\nIsaiah Rashad McClain (born May 16, 1991), is an American hip hop recording artist and record producer from Chattanooga, Tennessee. Rashad began taking rapping seriously in tenth grade, where he and his friends would record on laptops. He spent the next few years recording at local recording studios. His first big break would be touring with rappers Juicy J, Joey Badass and Smoke DZA among others, on the 2012 Smoker's Club Tour. He is also a founding member of the Chattanooga hip hop collective The House along with fellow Chattanooga rapper TUT and a member of the Chicago hip hop collective The Village along with artist Kembe X, Alex Wiley and more.\n\nIn March 2013, Rashad signed to Carson, California-based independent record label Top Dawg Entertainment. On January 28, 2014, he released \"Cilvia Demo\", his first extended play, via digital distribution. \"Cilvia Demo\" was met with widespread acclaim from music critics and debuted at number 40 on the US \"Billboard\" 200. Off the buzz from the release of the EP, Rashad was named to the 2014 \"XXL\" freshman class. On September 2, 2016, he released his debut studio album, \"The Sun's Tirade\", to widespread critical acclaim. The album peaked at number 17 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nIsaiah Rashad McClain was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was raised primarily by his mother, who is a hairdresser. His father would let Rashad stay up late with him while they listened to Too $hort and Scarface, when he was young. Then one day when Rashad was three, his father left. Rashad briefly had ambitions of becoming a preacher, until his stepbrother lent him a copy of OutKast's \"ATLiens\" in junior high, and his mindset shifted. Shortly after, Rashad started spending most of his time rapping.\n\nRashad first began rapping seriously in tenth grade, while he and his friends would record on laptops. After high school, he went to Middle Tennessee State University. Then his friend who went to school for music production introduced Rashad to a friend who had a recording studio. As it turned out, the man happened to be his cousin and he let Rashad record there for free. Once his cousin moved on to a different job, Rashad bounced around a couple of local studios. He stopped going to school and lived wherever he could record.\n\nHe began getting industry connects, forging relationships with DJ Z from DJBooth.net and Jeff Weiss who writes for \"Rolling Stone\". From that his music begun getting passed around to various A&R's. From July 13 to August 23, 2012, Isaiah Rashad toured with Juicy J, Joey Badass and Smoke DZA among others, on the 2012 Smoker's Club Tour. In December 2012, Rashad begun getting attention from various record labels, most of which he showed no interest in. He also released many free singles on Soundcloud teaming up with well known producers such as MF Doom and Flying Lotus, which also helped increase his reputation.\n\nIn March 2013, Rashad met production team Digi+Phonics' Dave Free, who then introduced him to Anthony Tiffith the CEO of a Carson, California-based independent record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). On June 3, 2013, it was reported that Rashad was the recent buzz about signing to Top Dawg Entertainment, home to rappers such as Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Jay Rock. However, the label did not release an official statement. Over the following months the label and Rashad remained coy about the signing, not confirming anything.\nThen on September 20, 2013, Top Dawg Entertainment made the signing official with Top Dawg announcing it over Twitter. However, he revealed he had been signed to the label since March. Following the signing, Rashad moved to Los Angeles, California and began living and recording at the TDE Red Room Studio. To celebrate the signing announcement, a music video for a new song titled \"Shot You Down\" was released. It was his first new song released in over a year. The video had been recently shot in his hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee. On October 1, 2013, a video was released of Rashad signing his contract with TDE.\n\nOn October 15, 2013, Isaiah Rashad made his national television debut when he participated in the TDE Cypher during the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards, alongside his label-mates Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, ScHoolboy Q and Jay Rock. \"XXL\" praised the verse as strong, even due to the high pressure Rashad had to impress the masses. \"Entertainment Weekly\" also praised his verse during the cypher. On October 18, 2013, the remix to \"Shot You Down\" featuring ScHoolboy Q and Jay Rock was released via SoundCloud. On November 7, 2013, Rashad told \"Revolt\" that he would be releasing his very first official project \"Cilvia\" during December 2013. Closing out 2013, HipHopDX named Rashad a runner-up for their award for \"Rising Star of the Year\". In early January 2014, \"Complex\" named him one of the new rappers most likely to \"blow up\" during 2014. In mid-January 2014, Rashad revealed that the mixtape \"Cilvia\" would now be his debut extended play (EP) and would not contain many featured artists. On January 17, CEO Top Dawg revealed the cover artwork for the EP and that \"Cilvia Demo\" would be released digitally on January 28, 2014. It revealed features from TDE's SZA and Jay Rock and ScHoolboy Q on the remix of \"Shot You Down\". The day before the EP's release, Rashad released the music video for the \"Cilvia Demo\" song, \"Soliloquy\".\n\nAs promised, \"Cilvia Demo\" was released on January 28, 2014 via digital download retailers and was made available in CD format exclusively from Top Dawg Entertainment's website. \"Cilvia Demo\" received widespread acclaim upon its release especially with respect to his artistic collaborations with some members of London's \"thewokecollective\", namely Umar Sabat, Kais Al-Kaisi, Tristan Lescault and Yemi Fenuyi. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 82, which indicates \"universal acclaim\", based on 13 reviews. Rob Markman of MTV gave the EP a positive review saying, \"By the time the 14-track project winds down, Rashad slowly doles out his own coming-of-age story using introspective raps, melodies and, at times, good old southern bounce.\" The EP debuted at number 40 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart and sold 8,500 copies in the United States, during its first week of release.\n\nFrom March 1 to June 1, 2014, Rashad toured with ScHoolboy Q for the entirety of his international tour supporting his third studio album \"Oxymoron\".

The album debuted at number 17 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling 19,000 copies its first week.\n\nOn October 24, 2016, Rashad announced his first U.S. headlining tour, the \"Lil Sunny Tour\", via Twitter, stopping in 22 cities and set to begin in January 2017.

Then in a later interview with \"XXL\" he said his main influences are also OutKast, Erykah Badu, Gnarls Barkley, ScHoolboy Q, T.I. and Lil Wayne.\n\nJason Moore of \"Complex\" discussed him saying, \"Rashad spits thoughtfully, intelligently, and with precision, morphing his delivery to fit different production styles and making each line count.\" Rashad's debut EP \"Cilvia Demo\" is a concept album, which according to Rashad, sums up his adolescent life and mindset in a short period of time.\n\nRashad has a son with his long-time girlfriend, their son was born in 2013. Upon signing to Top Dawg Entertainment he got a tattoo to commemorate the partnership.\" In August 2015, Rashad had a second child with a different woman.\n\nDuring promotion of \"The Sun's Tirade\", Rashad revealed that he was addicted to Xanax and alcohol, and was suffering from depression, anxiety and isolation during the time between the release of \"Cilvia Demo\" and \"The Sun's Tirade\".

                "The Sun's Tirade\n\nThe Sun's Tirade is the debut studio album by American rapper Isaiah Rashad. It was released on September 2, 2016, and is his second release with Top Dawg Entertainment, following \"Cilvia Demo\" (2014). The album features guest appearances from SiR, Zacari, Kendrick Lamar, Deacon Blues, Kari Faux, Syd tha Kyd, Hugh Augustine, Jay Rock and SZA. The album's production was handled by several producers, including Mike Will Made It, D. Sanders, Cam O'bi, J. LBS, The Antydote and Chris Calor. \n\n\"The Sun's Tirade\" was met with critical acclaim from music critics, and appeared on numerous end-of-year best album lists from various publications. The album debuted at number 17 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling 19,000 copies its first week. The album was supported by the critically acclaimed lead single, \"Free Lunch\".\n\nOn August 26, 2016, Isaiah Rashad announced the album's title, release date and the reveal of the artwork. On August 30, he shared the album's track listing, which features guest appearances from Kari Faux, Syd and SiR, along with Top Dawg label-mates such as SZA, Jay Rock and Kendrick Lamar. Rashad released \"The Sun's Tirade\" on September 2, 2016. While talking about the album in an interview with \"XXL\" magazine, he said;\n\n\"Free Lunch\" was released as the album's lead single on August 7, 2016. The music video for the single, directed by APLUS Filmz, was uploaded to Top Dawg Entertainment's YouTube channel on August 10.\n\nOn August 27, 2016, Rashad performed \"Free Lunch\" with Kendrick Lamar during Lamar's headlining set at FYF Fest. On September 17, 2016, he performed \"Tity and Dolla\" at the BET Hip Hop Awards, which aired in the next month. Rashad also released music videos for the songs \"4r da Squaw\" and \"Park\", which have not been released as singles.\n\nDuring promotion of \"The Sun's Tirade\", Rashad revealed that he was addicted to Xanax and alcohol, and was suffering from depression, anxiety and isolation during the time between the release of \"Cilvia Demo\" and \"The Sun's Tirade\". He further stated that he \"fucked up\", and almost got dropped from Top Dawg Entertainment a total of three times during the recording of his album.\n\n\"The Sun's Tirade\", much like its predecessor, is a loose concept album. The project is characterized by its personal themes, such as substance abuse, depression, and Rashad's personal struggles with alcohol and Xanax addiction. The album incorporates stylistic and production elements of southern hip hop, Jazz, Neo Soul, Trap music, and progressive hip hop. Musically, the project has been noted by publications for its diversity and unique sonic palate, and for being \"much more jazzy and upbeat\" than \"Cilvia Demo\". Rashad's vocals are layered and textured. His voice throughout the record displays a \"heavy rasp\" and \"sing-songy flow\".\n\n\"The Sun's Tirade\" received critical acclaim from music critics upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 80, which indicates \"generally positive reviews,\" based on 11 reviews. Sheldon Pearce of Pitchfork Media praised \"The Sun's Tirade\", dubbing the album \"a complex portrait of a man in transition\", and further applauded Rashad for \"wear[ing] his anxieties\" on his sleeve. Ryan Lunn of Line of Best Fit lauded the album, saying \"while the album may have been crafted during a two-year tsunami of struggle, Isaiah Rashad still manages to sound as calm as an ocean’s gentle waves; sounding so effortless has never taken so much effort.\" Andy Kellman of Allmusic similarly praised the album, citing its creativity and production as a highlight, while also directing praise at Rashad's rapping, stating \"Rashad's voice is dispirited, on the brink of disintegration\". \n\nStephen Kearse of Consequence of Sound reviewed the album favorably, noting the album's \"experimental aesthetic\" as more refined than on Rashad's previous efforts. In a less positive review, Michael G. Barilleaux of No Ripcord found the album to be boring, stating \"Each song on this album makes its own point, but does it in exactly the same tone as the last. The end result is 17 tracks of one sound in a row, all bleeding into each other.\"\n\n\"The Sun's Tirade\" appeared on numerous end-of-year best album lists from various publications.\nThe album debuted at number 17 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling 19,000 copies its first week.\n",
                "Top Dawg Entertainment\n\nTop Dawg Entertainment (TDE) is an American record label founded in 2004, by CEO Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith. Dave Free and Punch are both presidents of the TDE. There are currently eight artists signed to the label: Isaiah Rashad, SZA, Lance Skiiiwalker, and SiR, as well as the flagship artists, Black Hippy members Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul. The label also houses a production division that includes Digi+Phonics, THC, King Blue and Derek \"MixedByAli\" Ali.\n\nIn 1997, Anthony Tiffith began as a record producer, who had produced for rappers such as The Game and Juvenile, among others. In 2003, Tiffith found a then 15-year-old Kendrick Lamar, a Compton native, who at the time went by K-Dot and had just released his first mixtape, which gained recognition and earned the young rapper a buzz in his local area. Tiffith saw potential in Lamar, signing him onto the label from the strength of the rapper's debut mixtape. It wasn't until 2005 that TDE started to gain success with another California-based rapper, Jay Rock. Following Rock's signing, TDE signed joint venture deals with Warner Bros. and later Asylum Records. However, following the merger, TDE began planning an exit strategy after the labels failed to handle Rock's debut \"Follow Me Home\" properly.\n\nIn 2007, Carson-based rapper Ab-Soul was added to the Top Dawg roster. On May 10, 2008 the label released a compilation mixtape titled \"Do It Nigga Squad, Volume 1\", which features songs by members of the label's roster, with other appearances coming from fellow American rappers Schoolboy Q, Lil Wayne and will.i.am. All songs on the mixtape were mixed by Top Dawg's resident engineer Derek \"MixedByAli\" Ali, much like a majority of their releases are. In October 2008, Jay Rock released his commercial debut single \"All My Life (In the Ghetto),\" which was included as the last track on the aforementioned mixtape and features Lil Wayne and will.i.am.\n\nIn 2009, Los Angeles-based rapper Schoolboy Q signed with TDE after being affiliated with the label since 2006. In 2009, once they were all signed to the label, Schoolboy Q suggested that he, Lamar, Rock and Ab-Soul form a rap group. They all agreed and all four artists formed the hip hop group Black Hippy.\n\nIn 2010, TDE issued Kendrick Lamar's fourth mixtape \"Overly Dedicated\" exclusively to digital retailers, such as iTunes. Four more projects followed route, Jay Rock's mixtape \"Black Friday\" (2010), Schoolboy Q's \"Setbacks\" (2011), Ab-Soul's \"Longterm Mentality\" (2011) and Kendrick Lamar's \"Section.80\" (2011); the latter of which was critically acclaimed and peaked at number 113 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The first studio album released to stores as well as online retailers was Jay Rock's often delayed debut studio album \"Follow Me Home\", released on July 26, 2011, with Tech N9ne's Strange Music. The album debuted at number 83 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 5,300 copies in its first week.\n\nIn March 2012, MTV reported that TDE closed a joint venture deal with Interscope Records and Aftermath Entertainment. Under the new deal, Kendrick Lamar's debut studio album, \"good kid, m.A.A.d city\" would be jointly released via Top Dawg, Interscope and Aftermath. In August 2012, during \"TDEFamAppreciationWeek\", they released solo tracks from each of the Black Hippy members and a video of Lamar and Q acting out on the tour bus. Kendrick Lamar was the first to release his major-label debut, with \"good kid, m.A.A.d city\" hitting stores on October 22, 2012. The album was highly acclaimed and went on to become certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Schoolboy Q subsequently began recording his major-label debut \"Oxymoron\".\n\nIn June 2013, Top Dawg announced they were planning to sign two more artists, with the first being reported as Tennessee native, Isaiah Rashad. On July 14, it was revealed Top Dawg had signed an up-and-coming female singer named SZA, to the label. In August 2013, during an interview with \"Vibe\", CEO Anthony Tiffith spoke on comparisons to Death Row Records, another label based in Southern California, run by Comptonite Marion \"Suge\" Knight, that had released albums from Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Tupac Shakur and others during the 1990s. Tiffith also said that he learned several lessons from his first major-label contract; a deal with Warner Bros. Records for Jay Rock, that lasted from 2006 until 2010. Tennessee-based rapper Isaiah Rashad's signing to TDE was officially announced on September 20, 2013.\n\nIn October 2013, at the BET Hip Hop Awards, Kendrick Lamar won five awards, including Album of the Year and Lyricist of the Year, the latter of which he also won the year before. At the award ceremony, Schoolboy Q performed his debut album's lead single \"Collard Greens\", with Lamar following him, performing \"Money Trees\", alongside Jay Rock. Lamar, Rock and Schoolboy Q were also featured in a cypher, along with Ab-Soul and newcomer Isaiah Rashad, which was presented by BET, in an annual effort to showcase a specific label's roster, with GOOD Music in 2010, Shady Records and MMG in 2011, as well as Grand Hustle and Ruff Ryders in 2012. In an October 2013 interview with \"XXL\", co-president Terrence \"Punch\" Henderson confirmed that the original reports of the record label being distributed by Interscope Records were incorrect. He said only Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar ever had solo record deals with Interscope Records, while the label was currently looking for a distribution deal for the entire label.\nIn November 2013, Kendrick Lamar was named \"GQ\"'s \"Rapper of the Year,\" and was featured on the cover of the magazine's \"Men of the Year\" issue. Following the issue's release, TDE's CEO Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith, pulled Kendrick Lamar from performing at \"GQ\"s party that accompanies the issue, calling out writer Steve Marsh's profile, \"Kendrick Lamar: Rapper of the Year,\" for its \"racial overtones,\" such as comparisons to Suge Knight and Death Row Records. \"GQ\" editor-in-chief Jim Nelson, responded saying: \"Kendrick Lamar is one of the most talented new musicians to arrive on the scene in years,\" the EIC said in a statemet that was posted to the magazine's website. \"That's the reason we chose to celebrate him, wrote an incredibly positive article declaring him the next King of Rap, and gave him our highest honor: putting him on the cover of our Men of the Year issue. I'm not sure how you can spin that into a bad thing, and I encourage anyone interested to read the story and see for themselves.\"\n\nAfter not releasing an album the entire year, on December 21, 2013, CEO Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith revealed that he plans on the entire label's roster releasing solo albums in 2014, starting with Schoolboy Q's \"Oxymoron\" on February 25, 2014. However, it was later confirmed that Isaiah Rashad would make his debut with \"Cilvia Demo\" on January 28, 2014. \"Cilvia Demo\" was later released on January 28, 2014. The EP received widespread acclaim from music critics.\n\nOn March 26, 2014, R&B artist SZA released the single \"Child's Play\" featuring Chance The Rapper and produced by XXYYXX. The song is taken off of her third Extended Play \"Z\" which was released on April 8. On June 24, 2014, Ab-Soul released his third studio album \"These Days...\". The album received critical acclaim and saw a rise in commercial performance compared to his previous albums.\n\nOn March 15, 2015, TDE released Kendrick Lamar's fourth retail release, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\". In its first week of release, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 and sold 325,000 copies in the United States. Later in the year, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" received two nominations at the 58th Grammy Awards: Album of the Year and Best Rap Album; while the song \"Alright\" was nominated for Song of the Year, Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song, its visuals for Best Music Video, and \"These Walls\" received a nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Previously, the lead single \"i\" won Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance at the 2015 ceremony.\n\nOn September 11, 2015, the label released Jay Rock's second album, \"90059\". The album debuted at number 16 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling 18,713 equivalent album units copies in its first week. On February 29, 2016, Top Dawg hinted at two new label signees, as well as scheduled releases for each of the label's artists' for 2016. On March 4, 2016, Kendrick Lamar released \"untitled unmastered.\" in a surprise release via Twitter. On May 20, Top Dawg officially announced the signing of Lance Skiiiwalker, who had initially been featured on Jay Rock's \"90059\".\n\nIn May 2016, TDE CEO Anthony Tiffith confirmed the release of several of the Top Dawg members' albums. On May 31, 2016, after turning in his album, Schoolboy Q announced the released date for July 8. On July 1, 2016, TDE CEO Anthony Tiffith announced the label will be touring as a group after the four artists album releases in 2016. The TDE tour featured Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, Isaiah Rashad, SZA, Lance Skiiiwalker and co-president/occasional rapper Punch. Following the release of ScHoolboy Q's \"Blank Face LP\" on July 8, Ab-Soul revealed he had turned his album in for mixing. Isaiah Rashad released his debut album \"The Sun's Tirade\", on September 2, 2016. Lance Skiiiwalker released \"Introverted Intuition\" on October 18. Ab-Soul released \"Do What Thou Wilt.\" on December 9.\n\nA sequel to SiR's 2016 \"HER\" EP, titled \"Her Too\" was released on February 10, 2017. Kendrick Lamar released \"DAMN.\" on April 14, 2017. On April 28, 2017, SZA announced she signed her first major-label recording contract with RCA Records. \nOn June 9, 2017 SZA released her debut album Ctrl. Ctrl was released and peaked at no.3 on the billboard 200. The album received critical acclaim, and some critics praising SZA's voice and music which spawned hits like love galore and the weekend. In November SZA's Ctrl album received a Grammy nomination at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Urban Contemporary Album. It lost to the Weekend's Album Starboy.\n\n\nTop Dawg Entertainment houses a production team named Digi+Phonics, composed of music producers Dave Free, Willie B, Tae Beast and Sounwave. They have composed the majority of the production on many of the TDE releases.\n\nKing Blue, also known as Blue The Misfit, was once half of the musical duo Sore Losers and is also signed to Top Dawg as a producer, producing songs such as Kendrick Lamar's \"P&P\", Schoolboy Q's \"To tha Beat (F’d Up)\", Mac Miller's \"Down them.\"\n\nProduction team THC, a duo of producers, have produced several songs by members of Black Hippy, including Kendrick Lamar's \"Cartoon & Cereal\" and \"m.A.A.d City\", as well as Schoolboy Q's \"Collard Greens\", among several other tracks.\n\n\nThe discography of Top Dawg Entertainment consists of 17 studio albums, one compilation album, four extended plays (EPs) and 17 mixtapes. Overall the label has sold more than four million records in the US alone.\n"

Rashad began taking rapping seriously in tenth grade, where he and his friends would record on laptops. He spent the next few years recording at local recording studios. His first big break would be touring with rappers Juicy J, Joey Badass and Smoke DZA among others, on the 2012 Smoker's Club Tour. He is also a founding member of the Chattanooga hip hop collective The House along with fellow Chattanooga rapper TUT and a member of the Chicago hip hop collective The Village along with artist Kembe X, Alex Wiley and more.\n\nIn March 2013, Rashad signed to Carson, California-based independent record label Top Dawg Entertainment.

Off the buzz from the release of the EP, Rashad was named to the 2014 \"XXL\" freshman class. On September 2, 2016, he released his debut studio album, \"The Sun's Tirade\", to widespread critical acclaim. The album peaked at number 17 on the \"Billboard\" 200.\n\nIsaiah Rashad McClain was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was raised primarily by his mother, who is a hairdresser. His father would let Rashad stay up late with him while they listened to Too $hort and Scarface, when he was young. Then one day when Rashad was three, his father left. Rashad briefly had ambitions of becoming a preacher, until his stepbrother lent him a copy of OutKast's \"ATLiens\" in junior high, and his mindset shifted. Shortly after, Rashad started spending most of his time rapping.\n\nRashad first began rapping seriously in tenth grade, while he and his friends would record on laptops. After high school, he went to Middle Tennessee State University. Then his friend who went to school for music production introduced Rashad to a friend who had a recording studio. As it turned out, the man happened to be his cousin and he let Rashad record there for free. Once his cousin moved on to a different job, Rashad bounced around a couple of local studios. He stopped going to school and lived wherever he could record.\n\nHe began getting industry connects, forging relationships with DJ Z from DJBooth.net and Jeff Weiss who writes for \"Rolling Stone\". From that his music begun getting passed around to various A&R's. From July 13 to August 23, 2012, Isaiah Rashad toured with Juicy J, Joey Badass and Smoke DZA among others, on the 2012 Smoker's Club Tour. In December 2012, Rashad begun getting attention from various record labels, most of which he showed no interest in. He also released many free singles on Soundcloud teaming up with well known producers such as MF Doom and Flying Lotus, which also helped increase his reputation.\n\nIn March 2013, Rashad met production team Digi+Phonics' Dave Free, who then introduced him to Anthony Tiffith the CEO of a Carson, California-based independent record label Top Dawg Entertainment (TDE). On June 3, 2013, it was reported that Rashad was the recent buzz about signing to Top Dawg Entertainment, home to rappers such as Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, Ab-Soul and Jay Rock. However, the label did not release an official statement. Over the following months the label and Rashad remained coy about the signing, not confirming anything.\nThen on September 20, 2013, Top Dawg Entertainment made the signing official with Top Dawg announcing it over Twitter. However, he revealed he had been signed to the label since March. Following the signing, Rashad moved to Los Angeles, California and began living and recording at the TDE Red Room Studio. To celebrate the signing announcement, a music video for a new song titled \"Shot You Down\" was released. It was his first new song released in over a year. The video had been recently shot in his hometown of Chattanooga, Tennessee. On October 1, 2013, a video was released of Rashad signing his contract with TDE.\n\nOn October 15, 2013, Isaiah Rashad made his national television debut when he participated in the TDE Cypher during the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards, alongside his label-mates Kendrick Lamar, Ab-Soul, ScHoolboy Q and Jay Rock. \"XXL\" praised the verse as strong, even due to the high pressure Rashad had to impress the masses. \"Entertainment Weekly\" also praised his verse during the cypher. On October 18, 2013, the remix to \"Shot You Down\" featuring ScHoolboy Q and Jay Rock was released via SoundCloud. On November 7, 2013, Rashad told \"Revolt\" that he would be releasing his very first official project \"Cilvia\" during December 2013. Closing out 2013, HipHopDX named Rashad a runner-up for their award for \"Rising Star of the Year\". In early January 2014, \"Complex\" named him one of the new rappers most likely to \"blow up\" during 2014. In mid-January 2014, Rashad revealed that the mixtape \"Cilvia\" would now be his debut extended play (EP) and would not contain many featured artists. On January 17, CEO Top Dawg revealed the cover artwork for the EP and that \"Cilvia Demo\" would be released digitally on January 28, 2014. It revealed features from TDE's SZA and Jay Rock and ScHoolboy Q on the remix of \"Shot You Down\".

At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 82, which indicates \"universal acclaim\", based on 13 reviews. Rob Markman of MTV gave the EP a positive review saying, \"By the time the 14-track project winds down, Rashad slowly doles out his own coming-of-age story using introspective raps, melodies and, at times, good old southern bounce.\" The EP debuted at number 40 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart and sold 8,500 copies in the United States, during its first week of release.\n\nFrom March 1 to June 1, 2014, Rashad toured with ScHoolboy Q for the entirety of his international tour supporting his third studio album \"Oxymoron\".

                "Top Dawg Entertainment\n\nTop Dawg Entertainment (TDE) is an American record label founded in 2004, by CEO Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith. Dave Free and Punch are both presidents of the TDE. There are currently eight artists signed to the label: Isaiah Rashad, SZA, Lance Skiiiwalker, and SiR, as well as the flagship artists, Black Hippy members Kendrick Lamar, Jay Rock, ScHoolboy Q and Ab-Soul. The label also houses a production division that includes Digi+Phonics, THC, King Blue and Derek \"MixedByAli\" Ali.\n\nIn 1997, Anthony Tiffith began as a record producer, who had produced for rappers such as The Game and Juvenile, among others. In 2003, Tiffith found a then 15-year-old Kendrick Lamar, a Compton native, who at the time went by K-Dot and had just released his first mixtape, which gained recognition and earned the young rapper a buzz in his local area. Tiffith saw potential in Lamar, signing him onto the label from the strength of the rapper's debut mixtape. It wasn't until 2005 that TDE started to gain success with another California-based rapper, Jay Rock. Following Rock's signing, TDE signed joint venture deals with Warner Bros. and later Asylum Records. However, following the merger, TDE began planning an exit strategy after the labels failed to handle Rock's debut \"Follow Me Home\" properly.\n\nIn 2007, Carson-based rapper Ab-Soul was added to the Top Dawg roster. On May 10, 2008 the label released a compilation mixtape titled \"Do It Nigga Squad, Volume 1\", which features songs by members of the label's roster, with other appearances coming from fellow American rappers Schoolboy Q, Lil Wayne and will.i.am. All songs on the mixtape were mixed by Top Dawg's resident engineer Derek \"MixedByAli\" Ali, much like a majority of their releases are. In October 2008, Jay Rock released his commercial debut single \"All My Life (In the Ghetto),\" which was included as the last track on the aforementioned mixtape and features Lil Wayne and will.i.am.\n\nIn 2009, Los Angeles-based rapper Schoolboy Q signed with TDE after being affiliated with the label since 2006. In 2009, once they were all signed to the label, Schoolboy Q suggested that he, Lamar, Rock and Ab-Soul form a rap group. They all agreed and all four artists formed the hip hop group Black Hippy.\n\nIn 2010, TDE issued Kendrick Lamar's fourth mixtape \"Overly Dedicated\" exclusively to digital retailers, such as iTunes. Four more projects followed route, Jay Rock's mixtape \"Black Friday\" (2010), Schoolboy Q's \"Setbacks\" (2011), Ab-Soul's \"Longterm Mentality\" (2011) and Kendrick Lamar's \"Section.80\" (2011); the latter of which was critically acclaimed and peaked at number 113 on the US \"Billboard\" 200 chart. The first studio album released to stores as well as online retailers was Jay Rock's often delayed debut studio album \"Follow Me Home\", released on July 26, 2011, with Tech N9ne's Strange Music. The album debuted at number 83 on the \"Billboard\" 200, selling 5,300 copies in its first week.\n\nIn March 2012, MTV reported that TDE closed a joint venture deal with Interscope Records and Aftermath Entertainment. Under the new deal, Kendrick Lamar's debut studio album, \"good kid, m.A.A.d city\" would be jointly released via Top Dawg, Interscope and Aftermath. In August 2012, during \"TDEFamAppreciationWeek\", they released solo tracks from each of the Black Hippy members and a video of Lamar and Q acting out on the tour bus. Kendrick Lamar was the first to release his major-label debut, with \"good kid, m.A.A.d city\" hitting stores on October 22, 2012. The album was highly acclaimed and went on to become certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Schoolboy Q subsequently began recording his major-label debut \"Oxymoron\".\n\nIn June 2013, Top Dawg announced they were planning to sign two more artists, with the first being reported as Tennessee native, Isaiah Rashad. On July 14, it was revealed Top Dawg had signed an up-and-coming female singer named SZA, to the label. In August 2013, during an interview with \"Vibe\", CEO Anthony Tiffith spoke on comparisons to Death Row Records, another label based in Southern California, run by Comptonite Marion \"Suge\" Knight, that had released albums from Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Tupac Shakur and others during the 1990s. Tiffith also said that he learned several lessons from his first major-label contract; a deal with Warner Bros. Records for Jay Rock, that lasted from 2006 until 2010. Tennessee-based rapper Isaiah Rashad's signing to TDE was officially announced on September 20, 2013.\n\nIn October 2013, at the BET Hip Hop Awards, Kendrick Lamar won five awards, including Album of the Year and Lyricist of the Year, the latter of which he also won the year before. At the award ceremony, Schoolboy Q performed his debut album's lead single \"Collard Greens\", with Lamar following him, performing \"Money Trees\", alongside Jay Rock. Lamar, Rock and Schoolboy Q were also featured in a cypher, along with Ab-Soul and newcomer Isaiah Rashad, which was presented by BET, in an annual effort to showcase a specific label's roster, with GOOD Music in 2010, Shady Records and MMG in 2011, as well as Grand Hustle and Ruff Ryders in 2012. In an October 2013 interview with \"XXL\", co-president Terrence \"Punch\" Henderson confirmed that the original reports of the record label being distributed by Interscope Records were incorrect. He said only Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar ever had solo record deals with Interscope Records, while the label was currently looking for a distribution deal for the entire label.\nIn November 2013, Kendrick Lamar was named \"GQ\"'s \"Rapper of the Year,\" and was featured on the cover of the magazine's \"Men of the Year\" issue. Following the issue's release, TDE's CEO Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith, pulled Kendrick Lamar from performing at \"GQ\"s party that accompanies the issue, calling out writer Steve Marsh's profile, \"Kendrick Lamar: Rapper of the Year,\" for its \"racial overtones,\" such as comparisons to Suge Knight and Death Row Records. \"GQ\" editor-in-chief Jim Nelson, responded saying: \"Kendrick Lamar is one of the most talented new musicians to arrive on the scene in years,\" the EIC said in a statemet that was posted to the magazine's website. \"That's the reason we chose to celebrate him, wrote an incredibly positive article declaring him the next King of Rap, and gave him our highest honor: putting him on the cover of our Men of the Year issue. I'm not sure how you can spin that into a bad thing, and I encourage anyone interested to read the story and see for themselves.\"\n\nAfter not releasing an album the entire year, on December 21, 2013, CEO Anthony \"Top Dawg\" Tiffith revealed that he plans on the entire label's roster releasing solo albums in 2014, starting with Schoolboy Q's \"Oxymoron\" on February 25, 2014. However, it was later confirmed that Isaiah Rashad would make his debut with \"Cilvia Demo\" on January 28, 2014. \"Cilvia Demo\" was later released on January 28, 2014. The EP received widespread acclaim from music critics.\n\nOn March 26, 2014, R&B artist SZA released the single \"Child's Play\" featuring Chance The Rapper and produced by XXYYXX. The song is taken off of her third Extended Play \"Z\" which was released on April 8. On June 24, 2014, Ab-Soul released his third studio album \"These Days...\". The album received critical acclaim and saw a rise in commercial performance compared to his previous albums.\n\nOn March 15, 2015, TDE released Kendrick Lamar's fourth retail release, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\". In its first week of release, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 and sold 325,000 copies in the United States. Later in the year, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" received two nominations at the 58th Grammy Awards: Album of the Year and Best Rap Album; while the song \"Alright\" was nominated for Song of the Year, Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song, its visuals for Best Music Video, and \"These Walls\" received a nomination for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Previously, the lead single \"i\" won Best Rap Song and Best Rap Performance at the 2015 ceremony.\n\nOn September 11, 2015, the label released Jay Rock's second album, \"90059\". The album debuted at number 16 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling 18,713 equivalent album units copies in its first week. On February 29, 2016, Top Dawg hinted at two new label signees, as well as scheduled releases for each of the label's artists' for 2016. On March 4, 2016, Kendrick Lamar released \"untitled unmastered.\" in a surprise release via Twitter. On May 20, Top Dawg officially announced the signing of Lance Skiiiwalker, who had initially been featured on Jay Rock's \"90059\".\n\nIn May 2016, TDE CEO Anthony Tiffith confirmed the release of several of the Top Dawg members' albums. On May 31, 2016, after turning in his album, Schoolboy Q announced the released date for July 8. On July 1, 2016, TDE CEO Anthony Tiffith announced the label will be touring as a group after the four artists album releases in 2016. The TDE tour featured Kendrick Lamar, ScHoolboy Q, Jay Rock, Ab-Soul, Isaiah Rashad, SZA, Lance Skiiiwalker and co-president/occasional rapper Punch.

Isaiah Rashad released his debut album \"The Sun's Tirade\", on September 2, 2016. Lance Skiiiwalker released \"Introverted Intuition\" on October 18.

On April 28, 2017, SZA announced she signed her first major-label recording contract with RCA Records. \nOn June 9, 2017 SZA released her debut album Ctrl. Ctrl was released and peaked at no.3 on the billboard 200. The album received critical acclaim, and some critics praising SZA's voice and music which spawned hits like love galore and the weekend. In November SZA's Ctrl album received a Grammy nomination at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards for Best Urban Contemporary Album. It lost to the Weekend's Album Starboy.\n\n\nTop Dawg Entertainment houses a production team named Digi+Phonics, composed of music producers Dave Free, Willie B, Tae Beast and Sounwave.

The EP debuted at number 40 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling 8,500 copies its first week.\n\n\"Cilvia Demo\" is a loose concept album that, according to Rashad, sums up his emotional struggle, from his teenage to adolescent years. The project is characterized by its personal themes, such as substance abuse, fatherhood, coming of age, and police brutality. Its music incorporates stylistic and production elements of southern, experimental, and progressive hip hop. The production consists of smooth, old school influenced, downbeat southern hip hop, with elements of experimental soul and trip hop. The project features hazy and atmospheric soundscapes of low, mid, to high-tempo beats with chopped and screwed background vocals; its abrasive main vocal set against smooth, slow burning southern-styled production.\n\n\"Cilvia Demo\" was met with universal acclaim from music critics upon its release. Praise was directed at the album's unconventional and experimental production, cohesiveness, and Rashad's unique style and thoughtful lyrics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 82, which indicates \"universal acclaim\", based on 13 reviews. Rob Markman of MTV gave the project a positive review saying, \"By the time the 14-track project winds down, Isaiah Rashad slowly doles out his own coming-of-age story using introspective raps, melodies and, at times, good old southern bounce.\" Marcus Dowling of \"HipHopDX\" said, \"Every story and hook on Isaiah Rashad's \"Cilvia Demo\" connects on a human level. What it lacks in depth is covered by excellent production and raw talent.\" Michael Madden of \"Consequence of Sound\" gave the project a positive review saying, \"At any rate, Rashad sounds like he belongs. He’s touched down on his own terms, and he’ll be sticking around for a while.\" Sheldon Pearce of \"XXL\" gave the project an overwhelmingly positive review, directing praise at the album's production, lyrical content, and replay value.\n\n\"Cilvia Demo\" appeared on multiple year end lists of the best hip-hop albums of that year. Genius hailed it as the seventh best hip hop release that year, while \"Rolling Stone\" placed it at number twenty-one on it year-end hip hop albums list. SPIN included the album on its list of the 40 best hip hop releases of 2014.\n\nBased on the buzz generated by Rashad's signing in 2013 and the EP, \"XXL\" revealed Rashad was included in their annual freshman class, alongside fellow up-and-comers Chance the Rapper, Ty Dolla $ign, Rich Homie Quan, Vic Mensa, August Alsina, Troy Ave, Kevin Gates, Lil Bibby, Jon Connor, Lil Durk and Jarren Benton.\n\nOn June 29, 2016, Pitchfork Media published a list of \"The 50 Best Rap Mixtapes of the Millennium\". \"Cilvia Demo\" was included on the list, placed at the 35th position, despite officially being billed as an EP.\n\nThe EP debuted at number 40 on the US \"Billboard\" 200, selling 8,500 copies its first week. In its second week, the EP completely fell off the \"Billboard\" 200. As of May 2016, the EP sold around 28,000 copies domestically.\n"

                "List of Green Lanterns\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps that appear in fictional stories published by DC Comics has at least 7200 members, two per sector (originally 3600 with one per sector), in addition to assorted other members who fulfill roles other than patrolling. Although seven characters—Alan Scott, Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, John Stewart, Simon Baz, Kyle Rayner, and Jessica Cruz—are primarily associated with the name, a number of other members of the Corps have appeared in DC's comics.\n\nThese seven characters are most closely associated with the \"Green Lantern\" name, and have been the title characters of \"Green Lantern\" comics.\n\nAlan Scott was the original Green Lantern character created in the Golden Age of comics. Alan created the mantle and identity of Green Lantern by himself and is not associated with the Green Lantern Corps, since his power ring was de-authorized by the Guardians even before his obtaining it. Prior to the Crisis Scott's ring ran on magic, and not the Central Power Battery of Oa. Today he is the modern day Green Lantern for New 52's Earth 2.\n\nHal Jordan, known as Green Lantern, is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created in 1959 by writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane, and first appeared in \"Showcase\" #22 (October 1959). Hal Jordan is a reinvention of a previous character called Green Lantern that had appeared in 1940s comic books as the character Alan Scott. Hal Jordan is a member and occasionally leader of the intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps, as well as a founding member of the Justice League. He fights evil across the Universe with a ring that grants him a variety of superpowers.\n\nGuy Gardner is a comic book superhero published by DC Comics. He is a core member of the Green Lantern family of characters, and for a time (late 1980s through mid 1990s) was also a significant member of the Justice League family of characters. He was created by John Broome and Gil Kane (who patterned him after actor Martin Milner) in \"Green Lantern\" #59 (March 1968), although the character was changed significantly in the 1980s by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton who turned him into a jingoistic parody of an ultra-macho \"red-blooded American male.\" This latter remains the character's archetype to this date.\n\nJohn Stewart, known as Green Lantern, is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics and was the first African-American superhero to appear in DC Comics. The character was created by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams, and first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" vol. 2, #87 (December 1971), when artist Neal Adams came up with the idea of a substitute Green Lantern.\n\nKyle Rayner is a fictional comic book superhero appearing in books published by DC Comics, usually in those starring the Green Lantern Corps, an extraterrestrial police force of which Rayner was a member. Created by writer Ron Marz and artist Darryl Banks, Rayner first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" vol. 3, #48 (1994), as part of the \"Emerald Twilight\" storyline, in which DC Comics replaced Green Lantern Hal Jordan with Rayner, who was the sole Green Lantern for years until the late 1990s. He was DC's star Green Lantern into the mid-2000s. During this period he was also briefly known as Ion.\n\nSimon Baz is a fictional comic book superhero appearing in books published by DC Comics, usually in those starring the Green Lantern Corps, an extraterrestrial police force of which Simon is a member. Created by writer Geoff Johns and artist Doug Mahnke, Simon first appeared in 2012 following DC's 2011 company-wide relaunch as part of its Green Lantern story arc \"Rise of the Third Army\", in which Baz replaces Silver Age hero Hal Jordan as the Green Lantern of Earth's sector. Prior to this, the character made an unnamed cameo in The New 52 \"Free Comic Book Day Special Edition\" #1. At the time, Baz debuted to a positive critical reaction and over time gained a sizable fanbase. DC later added Baz to its flagship team-up title \"Justice League of America\" in 2013.\n\nJessica Cruz is a fictional comic book superhero appearing in books published by DC Comics. Created by Geoff Johns, she is a member of the Green Lantern Corps and the Justice League. Jessica Cruz appears briefly in the 2013 issue of \"Green Lantern\" #20 (July 2013) but does not makes her official debut until the last pages of \"Justice League\" vol. 2 #30, when the Ring of Volthoom locates her. She was dubbed \"Power Ring\" while she was host to the Ring of Volthoom but is not a member of the Crime Syndicate of America. Cruz becomes an official member of the Green Lantern Corps at the end of \"The Darkseid War\" storyline.\n\nWith the exception of Yalan Gur, these characters have also served as the Green Lantern for Sector 2814 (which includes Mars).\n\nYalan Gur is a Green Lantern introduced as part of an effort to reconcile the Golden Age Green Lantern's origin with the later introduction of the Green Lantern Corps. He is a red-scaled, reptilian humanoid, assigned to sector 2814 (Earth's sector) in the 10th century. He first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 3) #19 (December 1991).\n\nWhile Alan Scott, along with the rest of the Justice Society of America, is trapped in Limbo, his mystic lantern sends a projection to Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, and John Stewart (the Green Lanterns of Earth at the time). After tracing the projection to Scott's home, the lantern tells the story of its origin (effectively retconning the origin of Alan Scott's power).\n\nIn the lantern's story, Yalan Gur was once one of the greatest of the Green Lantern Corps, and, in the 10th century by Earth reckoning, the Guardians of the Universe chose to remove the customary weakness to the color yellow from his power ring. Without this limitation, however, he was corrupted by his power, and he came to Earth and enslaved the people of China. The Guardians of the Universe thwarted Yalan by adding a new weakness of wood to his ring, which allowed the club-wielding villagers to overwhelm their oppressor and mortally wound him. The dying Yalan Gur fled into Earth's upper atmosphere, where he merged with his lantern-shaped power battery as he died. His lantern then collided with a fragment of the Starheart and was merged with its magical essence, turning into the Green Flame that becomes the source of Alan Scott's power. The retcon involving the true reason behind the yellow impurity may mean these events have been retconned out of existence. In the film \"Justice League\" there is a character who has resemblance to him, but it is not clear whether it is Yalan Gur or not.\n\nJong Li is a Green Lantern introduced in \"Green Lantern, Dragon Lord\" #1 (June 2001), written by Doug Moench and drawn by Paul Gulacy. He is actually Earth's first Green Lantern, and was a monk raised in the Temple of the Dragon Lords in China. When Jong Li was growing up, he was taught of the Dragon Lords, beings who ruled in the \"Golden Age\" of man, and that under these lords, man prospered. He was taught to renounce all earthly possessions and to live a life of peace and discipline, but then one day a concubine named Jade Moon came to him in his temple, begging for help in trying to escape her bonds. Jong Li tried to help her but failed, and his temple and fellow monks were ravaged by the emperor's troops and their commander. Jong Li later encountered a representative of the Guardians of the Universe who gave him a power ring and a Lantern to \"Oppose Evil, Ease Suffering and Protect the Innocent.\" Jong Li later rescued Jade and learned of Lung Mountain, where the last Dragon Lords supposedly lived. He set out to seek their higher authority and with their Blessing of Fire became the last Dragon Lord of the Earth, finally defeating the evil emperor's forces and saving his people.\n\nLaham of Scylla is introduced in \"Green Lantern Corps Quarterly\" #2 (Autumn 1992). He is killed off-panel during a surprise invasion of his home planet. Upon his death, his ring passes to Waverly Sayre, who becomes good friends with Laham's widow. Laham first physically appears as a statue in the Crypts on Oa.\n\nWaverly Sayre is a pioneer living on the frontier in the early years of the United States. Hoping to start a family, Waverly falls into depression when his wife dies in childbirth, taking their newborn son with her. As he contemplates suicide, the late Laham's ring appears to him and selects him as Laham's successor. Initially believing the ring a manifestation of Satan, Sayre quickly grows into his new role, taking his faithful dog with him on every mission.\n\nDaniel Young was a sheriff in Montana, in 1873. During his chase of a band of outlaws, Daniel was summoned by Abin Sur, wounded in a battle in deep space. While Abin Sur convalesced in his ship, healed by its machines, Young was a temporary replacement, and he used the power of the ring to bring the outlaws to justice. Afterward, the ring returned to Abin Sur.\n\nStarkadr first appeared in \"Legends of the DC Universe\" #20 (September 1999). He is a hulking orange alien who is mortally wounded defending the planet Ungara from the forces of the Traitor. Though he succeeds in driving the Traitor from the planet, Starkadr dies and passes his ring to the Ungaran Abin Sur. He rises as an undead Black Lantern and fights the living Green Lanterns.\n\nAnya Savenlovich first appeared in \"Green Lantern: The New Corps\" #1 (March 1999). She is a lieutenant colonel from Soviet Air Forces who was in suspended animation after participating in a space mission back in 1964. Kyle Rayner recruited her as a member of the New Corps in a bid to rebuild the Green Lantern Corps. However, finding his attempt was a failure, Kyle took Anya's ring. Aware that the Soviet Union no longer exists, Anya decides to stay in space to find a new purpose.\n\nThese Green Lanterns were stationed on Earth to safeguard the planet after the events of the Crisis on Infinite Earths.\n\nDuring Emerald Twilight, many of the Corps members were stripped of their rings and left to die out in space. A few of them, however, were captured by the Manhunters and were used as energy sources for the Manhunters until their eventual rescue. They are known as \"the Lost Lanterns.\"\n\nChaselon is the Green Lantern of sector 1416; he first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 2) #9 (November–December 1961) in a story written by John Broome and drawn by Gil Kane. Chaselon is a native of Barrio III, a planet inhabited by silicon based crystalline beings with thirteen senses. Barrio III was one of the planets that the mad Guardian Appa Ali Apsa \"harvested\" to create the planet Mosaic. Chaselon is one of the many Lanterns apparently killed when a maddened Hal Jordan attacks and destroys Oa. Although his shattered body is depicted floating in space, he later is found to be one of the many Lanterns captured by the Cyborg Superman to provide a power source for the new Manhunters. Chaselon and the captured Lanterns are eventually rescued by a revived Hal Jordan.\n\nChaselon becomes one of the first Alpha Lanterns. He is later smashed to bits by several Black Lanterns, his remains are then immolated when Kyle Rayner ignites his dislodged internal power battery to deal a suicide attack to the assembled Black Lanterns.\n\nChaselon makes a cameo appearance with other members of the Green Lantern Corps in \"The Green Loontern\", an episode of the animated television series \"Duck Dodgers\". He also appeared in cameos in \"Justice League Unlimited\" and the animated films \"\" and \"\". The character also appears in \"\", guarding the Guardians' laboratory. Hal distracts him with conversation so Ch'p can rescue Aya before she is dissected.\n\nThe Green Lannter of Sector 2, he first appeared in \"Green Lantern\", vol. 3, #49 (Feb 1994), in a story written by Ron Marz. Hannu is among several Lanterns called to defend Oa from the then renegade Hal Jordan. Jordan made short work of him and added his power to his own and left him for dead. He was later found alive on Biot. He is from Ovacron 6 and on his world it is considered disgraceful and dishonorable to use weapons. He is never seen using his ring in battle (except for life support and travel), preferring his brute strength and fists instead (which prompted Kyle and John to summon him for aid when up against Alpha Lantern Boodikka while under the control of the Cyborg Superman, reasoning that her draining Hannu's ring wouldn't matter as he didn't use it). He finally activates his ring in battle against the Anti-Monitor. Sector 2 is also the home sector of the Reach, creators of the Blue Beetle scarab and sworn enemies of the Guardians. According to their treaty with the Guardians no Green Lantern is allowed in Sector 2 as long as the Reach stays within pre-treaty boundaries. He appears in a cameo in the \"Green Lantern\" live-action film and is also a part of the film toyline.\n\nLaira is a female humanoid Green Lantern with purple skin and auburn hair. She first appeared in \"Green Lantern Corps Quarterly\" #6 (Fall 1993) in the story entitled \"What Price Honor?\", written by Ruben Diaz.\n\nLaira is from the planet Jayd in space sector 112. She is trained by her father Kentor Omoto to take over his role as a soldier of the Guardians of the Universe; a Green Lantern of her sector. After the disappearance of her father during the Crisis on Infinite Earths and the proclamation by the Guardians that he is dead, she is considered for the post of ring bearer and Green Lantern of her sector. Her instructor turns out to be Ke'Haan of Varva: Kilowog's second in command, known for his tough as nails training. Eager to please and finding a kindred spirit of honor within her teacher, she becomes his prized pupil.\n\nTo complete her training, Laira is sent to the city of X'ol on her home planet, where she must confront her father, who is not actually dead.\nShe is later discovered by a reformed Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner being held captive by the Manhunters with the other \"Lost Lanterns\" including Kreon and Tomar-Tu. With the help of Jordan and Gardner, the Lost Lanterns put an end to the Manhunter planet of Biot and return to Oa. She then resumes her duties as Green Lantern of her sector.\nDuring the \"Sinestro Corps War\" event, Laira and the Lost Lanterns come to Hal Jordan's aid on Qward. The group splits up, with Laira, Ke'Haan and Boodikka searching for Ion, and Hal, Graf Toren, and Tomar-Tu looking for John Stewart and Guy Gardner. Laira's group encounters the Anti-Monitor, who kills Ke'Haan in an instant, but they are able to recover Ion and return to Oa.\n\nAfter preventing the invasion of Coast City by the Sinestro Corps, Laira visits the Crypt of the Green Lanterns to mourn Ke'Haan's death. Hannu reveals their attraction to one another to Boodikka, but explains that (before his death) Ke'Haan refuses Laira because he has a family on his home planet. Laira and the Lost Lanterns set out to his homeworld to deliver news of his death, only to find that his family has been murdered by Sinestro Corps member Amon Sur. The killer willingly submits to the Lanterns, so that news of his actions will spread. Enraged by this, Laira kills Amon. Afterwards, Laira is held in custody on Oa, while the Lanterns who had seen her crime testify against her. She is placed in the custody of the newly founded Alpha Lanterns, and tried by the Guardians, who find her guilty and strip her of her power ring.\n\nAfter her trial, Laira is arranged to be transported back to her homeworld, Jayd, by Hannu. However, a red power ring attacks their ship and chooses Laira as its bearer; making her the second Red Lantern. Under the influence of the red light, Laira's personality degenerates to the point where she is little more than a snarling beast; obsessed with revenge against Sinestro and showing no recognition when confronted by Hal Jordan and John Stewart. During a skirmish on the prison planet Ysmault with multiple Lanterns, Hal managed to reach Laira who was able to see past her rage, and regained some control even asking Jordan for help, but she is nevertheless killed by Sinestro. Learning of her demise, the Guardians view her as dying in disgrace as a Red Lantern and renegade despite Jordan's protests.\n\nFollowing the rise of Nekron and the Black Lantern Corps a Black Lantern Ring attached itself to Laira's corpse and she was revived as a Black Lantern. After Nekron's defeat at the hands Hal Jordan and his newly formed White Lantern Corps, Laira's ring was destroyed reverting her to a corpse.\n\nLaira's trial is referred to in The New 52, in \"Green Lantern Corps\" #9.\n\nLaira is featured in the 2011 anthology film, \"\" voiced by Kelly Hu.\n\nThe Green Lantern of Sector 3453, she first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" vol. 4, #12 (July 2006) in a story written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Ivan Reis. Lashorr had a fling with a younger Salaak before she vanished in combat with the Dominators. She is discovered alive on the Manhunter homeworld of Biot and returned to her sector, albeit with a case of post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nSector 173; First appeared in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 4) #12. Relok is a centaur-like barbarian who leads a crusade against the Dominators for experimenting on his people. He vanished in battle with them alongside #Lashorr and others, only to be found alive on Biot.\n\nThe Honor Guard is an elite group of Lanterns who serve as troubleshooters and special operatives.\n\nThe Green Lantern of Sector 3. Apros first appeared in \"Tales of the Green Lantern Corps\" #1 (May 1981) in a story written by Mike W. Barr and Len Wein, with pencils by Joe Staton. Apros is a sentient plant from the planet -7pi. It is one of the Corps' oldest and most decorated veterans. Apros serves in the Honor Guard during the war with Krona and Nekron, but appears to have returned to a sector patrol position following the rebuilding of the Corps.\n\nSector 1890; First appeared in \"Tales of the Green Lantern Corps\" #1. K'ryssma is an insectoid alien resembling a human-like butterfly. She is trapped in a chrysalis state during the rampage of the mad Guardian Appa Ali Apsa. She emerges in a completely different form on the Mosaic world. After the destruction of the Corps at the hands of Parallax, K'ryssma joined the Darkstars, and as such she was murdered by Grayven.\n\nGuy Gardner and Kyle Rayner have also served as Honor Guard members.\n\nThe Alpha Lanterns are Corps members who have been transformed into cyborgs and act as the Corps' Internal Affairs officers.\n\nSee description above in The Lost Lanterns.\n\nPart of the duo (with Raker Qarrigat) dedicated to bringing peace to their homeworld of Apokolips, she becomes an Alpha Lantern to further this goal, unaware of the toll it will take on her emotions. Later, in \"Final Crisis\", she is possessed by the malevolent spirit of the New God Granny Goodness, who uses her to subdue the Green Lanterns of Earth, Hal Jordan and John Stewart, and capture Batman for use as a scientific test subject by her master, Darkseid. When Jordan is put on trial for an attempted murder actually performed by Kraken/Goodness herself, she is unmasked by Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner before sentence can be passed, and attempts at her primary mission, to obtain the central Green Lantern Power Battery for Darkseid. She is then defeated by Jordan and taken into custody by the other Alpha Lanterns. Following the restoration of reality at the closing of the Crisis, she is not seen among the other Alpha Lanterns, and her current status is not made apparent.\n\nSector 69; First appeared in \"Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual\" #2. Varix comes from the planet Naktos, which was devastated by a yellow plague. This and the fact that his predecessor died of a mysterious brain disease has led Varix to become a hypochondriac. Varix is described by Vurytt as his religion being his uniform, and in Varix's own words, as living for \"justice and justice alone\". Varix states that his people live to obey the law, and there has not been a murder on his planet for over 74 years (however, murderers on his world cannot be sentenced to more than two years of imprisonment). His dedication to justice came to a head when the Alpha Lanterns attempted to execute John Stewart when he killed another Green Lantern while the two were being held captive by enemies of the Corps and the other Lantern was about to reveal crucial information. Recognising that John's actions had been committed for the right reasons even if they were questionable on the surface, Varix assisted the Green Lanterns in destroying the other Alpha Lanterns before he destroyed himself.\n\nDuring the rise of the First Lantern, 10 billion years ago, before the creation of the Manhunters and the Green Lantern Corps per se, Rami, the most brilliant of the Guardians of the Universe and Volthoom's closest friend, created seven Green Power Rings to seek out worthy wielders using the Great Heart for guidance. Those chosen became The First Seven, charged with bringing Volthoom to justice, however the rings are also extremely dangerous as they were untested and had no safeguards which does not guarantee the survival of its bearers. The first seven Green Lanterns are as follow:\n\nAlitha of Galatica was an Old God warrior from the Third World, the world that pre-dates the Fourth World with Mister Miracle and Darkseid and Orion. The Third World was a universe consumed by war but Alitha stood out and made a very courageous decision that not only alters the future of her people but also puts her on the path to becoming one of the Original Seven Green Lanterns. She became Green Lantern 001 and was killed in battle by Volthoom and her body is currently located in the Vault of Shadows.\n\nZ'Kran Z'Rann of Mars was a White Martian that, as a child, saw his entire village been massacred by a bunch of White Martians vagabonds and he was the only one to survive but not without scars. Ten years later, an elder Z'Kran Z'Rann now known as the Stranger and wearing the same style of costume as the Martian Manhunters use currently today, tracked the vagabonds and killed them all. With his vengeance concluded he is reached by one of the seven Original Seven Green Lanterns. He became Green Lantern 002 and was killed in battle by Volthoom- His body is currently located in the Vault of Shadows.\n\nTyran'r of Tamaran is a tiger-man and apparently a thief among his peers. He was eventually caught and delivered to Mrak'r the Wizard King of Tamaran, who brooke Tyran'r's mighty sword.

It was from Ermey that Kilowog picked up the term \"Poozer\" which means \"Useless Rookie\". Ermey's name (and physical appearance) is a reference to the actor R. Lee Ermey, who has portrayed Drill Sergeants/figures of military authority in films such as \"Full Metal Jacket\".\n\nErmey is later resurrected as a Black Lantern, with a more militaristic costume (and using his ring to create a black energy construct of a ceremonial sabre), in a gamble to stir powerful emotions in Kilowog by berating and abusing him for having once saved Sinestro's life and for having failed to train the now dead rookies.

Despite the absolute darkness of the Deeps, Katma's power ring led her unerringly to a completely fearless and honest resident of the Deeps: Rot Lop Fan. However, as Rot Lop Fan's species had evolved in darkness, they had no concept of light and color, and thus Katma Tui was unable to explain how the power ring worked (it projects solid rays of light manifested by the bearer's will power).\n\nRealizing that his species operates by hearing, Katma coaches him to create a hand bell with the ring, and describes the Green Lantern Corps as the \"F-Sharp Bell Corps\" — \"F-Sharp\" being a reassuring note for Rot Lop Fan's race in the same manner that green is a reassuring color, and the ring's powers in terms of sound instead of light. She also composes a new oath for him to recite:\n\nHaving solved this dilemma, Katma leaves Rot Lop Fan to protect his people, not mentioning the ring's weakness to yellow as the colourless space made it relatively pointless; although, she privately notes that in some ways, Rot Lop Fan cannot be counted as a member of the \"Green Lantern\" Corps as he has truthfully never heard of them.\n\nRot Lop Fan later appears in several group scenes, including in the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" storyline when the Guardians of the Universe depart this plane of existence with the Zamarons, at the trial of Sinestro, on page 3 of the bar scene in Green Lantern #56 (volume 3/Nov 94) and in a group of ex-Green Lanterns freed from slavers by Warrior.\n\nRot Lop Fan has apparently been reinstated as a Green Lantern after the rebirth of the Corps.

Venizz is the partner of Green Lantern Tagort. Noted for her opposition to eugenics.\n\nVoz is close to Graf Toren, having been a fellow captive for a long time before Guy Gardener rescued them. Voz is assigned to be the warden of the Sciencells. It is a great honor to him and he takes it very seriously. The Red Lantern Corps member Vice breaks free of his prison with the help of Scar and starts a riot. He breaks free many Sinestro Corps members too and Voz attempts to quell the riot singlehandedly, however Vice easily overpowers him. Voz is badly injured but survives. He appears in a cameo in the Green Lantern live-action film and is also a part of the film toyline.\n\nSector 1915; First appeared in \"Tales of the Green Lantern Corps Annual\" #3 (1987). Wissen used his powers as a Green Lantern to end a thousand-year civil war on the planet Veltre. Wissen is eventually regarded by the natives of Veltre as a god, and under his benevolent rule the planet becomes peaceful but stagnant. After many years as the planet's ruler, a trio of Green Lanterns arrive to stabilize Veltre's core before it explodes like the planet Krypton. At first humbled by his failure, Wissen is persuaded to remain on Veltre to continue to act as its protector.\n\nXax of Xaos is a grasshopper-like alien from a planet ruled by insects. He first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 2) #9 and becomes one of Hal Jordan's good friends in the Corps. He was slain during a battle on the moon of Qward during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Another grasshopper shaped Lantern named Xax is later slain and worn as an earring by Lady Styx. It's interesting to note that in his first appearance Xax does not use a ring but a variation called a \"power device\" built into the insignia of his costume. Recharging it requires pressing the lantern shaped battery to his chest. All subsequent appearances show him wearing a ring. Xax appears in several scenes in both animated films, \"First Flight\" and \"Emerald Knights\".\n\nZale of Bellatrix was Boodikka's replacement on the Bellatrix Bombers, and the next of her kind judged worthy by the Guardians to wield a GL ring. She first appeared in \"Green Lantern Corps\" #21. As a rookie Lantern who kept ignoring her call to duty, Zale was brought under investigation by her former sister Boodikka, now an Alpha-Lantern. After a lengthy confrontation, it was revealed that it was the Bombers who kept Zale from fulfilling her duties, by deceiving her into thinking she was needed with them. The Guardians punished Zale by making her Boodikka's sector partner and removing her power battery, making her dependent on Boodikka for recharges.\n\nSector 3599; First appeared in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 2) #190 (July 1985). Zqhithii is a snake-like alien that helped fellow Green Lantern Xax fight off the Spider Guild invasion of Xaox.\n\nAppearing in the animated film \"Green Lantern: Emerald Knights\" in the segment \"The First Lantern\", a former scribe for the Guardians and one of the first four chosen Green Lanterns, when the Corps was formed. He was the first to discover the natural ability of the green light to create constructs, as it is the manifestation of willpower. Because of this he is considered the very first Green Lantern. And the knowledge of his discovery was passed down to every newly recruited Green Lantern during the ages until today.\n\nAppearing in the animated film \"Green Lantern: Emerald Knights\" in the segment \"The First Lantern\", a blue-skinned humanoid female alien, also one of the first four chosen Green Lanterns. She died in battle against a massive army, as she hadn't discovered yet how to use the full power of her ring by means of her willpower. In the film, she is the first Green Lantern to die in the line of duty.\n\nIn the Elseworlds title \"In Darkest Knight\", Bruce Wayne succeeded Abin Sur as Green Lantern of Sector 2814. His version of the Lantern uniform is darker than others and includes a cowl and a black scalloped cape.\n\nAppearing in the animated film \"Green Lantern: Emerald Knights\" in the segment \"The First Lantern\", Wachet is a semi-translucent, planar alien, nominally female, who was one of the first four chosen as Green Lanterns, and the second to use the full power of her ring following Avra's discovery.\n\nAppearing only in the \"Green Lantern\" live-action film, Ngila G'rnt is a native of the planet Inguanzo, and a recently recruited teenaged Green Lantern. She is endowed with an extraordinary sense of hearing, natural to her race, and is named after the costume designer of the film, Ngila Dickson.\n\nAppearing only in the animated film \"Green Lantern: Emerald Knights\" during the introduction sequence, she is a female Green Lantern who dies after being assaulted by Krona's shadow demons. She is remembered by Ganthet as a brave and gallant Green Lantern.\n\nAlthough not \"official\" members of the Green Lantern Corps, four teenagers — Frankie (male), Kelly (female), Jaclyn (female), and Samosa (male) — are given simplified Green Lantern rings by John Stewart after their homes are abducted to Oa by the Mad Guardian in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 3) (1992) and \"\" (1992–1993)..\n\nAble to create simple objects, translate languages, synthesize atmosphere, and empower flight, these rings enabled the youngsters to explore Oa in the hopes that their youthful ways of looking at the Mosaic (and the other beings trapped there) would help ease relations between the Earthlings and other races.\n\nHaving a moderate degree of success, the four helped where they could until the Mosaic was torn apart when dozens of space fleets appeared over Oa, each planet determined to bring their people home.\n\nPresumably the four are back on Earth readjusting to a \"normal\" life. At this time, it is unknown how the destruction of the Central Power Battery and subsequent reconstruction by Ion/Kyle Rayner affected the teenagers' rings. It is possible they still exist and can be recharged if given access to a Lantern.\n\nAnother Teen Lantern, unrelated to the others and out-of-continuity is Jordana Gardner, future descendant of Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner, called in such way due to her early recruitment into the Green Lantern Corps of the alternate future detailed in \"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st Century\".\n\nAppearing in the opening minutes of the \"\" episode \"Beware my Power,\" M'ten was the Green Lantern of an unknown sector who was assigned to Frontier Space. After being ambushed and murdered by Zilius Zox of the Red Lantern Corps, M'ten's ring returned to Oa, setting the events of the series in motion.\n\nAppearing in the \"\" episode \"Beware My Power,\" Shyir Rev was a Green Lantern assigned to Frontier Space. He was ambushed and severely injured by members of the Red Lantern Corps, but was rescued by Hal Jordan and Kilowog. Shyir ultimately ended up sacrificing his life to save his home world from a massive bomb planted by the Red Lanterns, and was honored by his comrades.\n\nAppearing in the \"\" episode \"Heir Apparent,\" Dulok was a Green Lantern from the planet of Betrassus. Dulok had planned to join a band of Green Lanterns tasked with fighting off the Red Lantern Corps, but was murdered by Ragnar, the planet's crown prince. After Dulok's death, his ring passed to Iolande, the young queen of Betrassus.\n\nProbert was a mercenary who met up with a few Lanterns and conversed with Guy Gardner at the scene of a huge spaceborne battle. A few of the newer Lanterns pointed out that Probert had once been a Lantern and was described to Guy as having been \"worse than you.\"\n\nKai-Ro is Green Lantern in the future DC animated universe voiced by Lauren Tom, first appearing in the \"Batman Beyond\" two-part episode \"The Call\" (2000). An eight-year-old child mature beyond his age, Kai-Ro possesses the standard Green Lantern power ring and assists Terry McGinnis, the Batman of the future, in finding a supposed traitor within the ranks of the Justice League Unlimited.\n\nKai-Ro later appears as a young adult in the 2005 \"Justice League Unlimited\" episode \"Epilogue\" in Terry's daydream. Still a member of the future \"JLU\", he defeats a group of supervillains with McGinnis' help and pleads with McGinnis to stay with the team despite the Batman's growing animosity and disillusion upon the discovery of his true origins.\n\nA two-issue story in the \"Batman Beyond\" comic reveals that Kai-Ro had been raised in a Buddhist monastery prior to receiving the ring. In this story he returns there to battle Black Light, a character with a black power ring, somewhat similar to Sinestro. The story mentions that Kai-Ro's ring had no yellow weakness.\n\nA character named Kairo is Green Lantern's alien sidekick in the 1967 Filmation animated series \"The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure\".\n\nIssue #3 of the miniseries \"Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold\" (December 2000) has Flash, Kid Flash, and Green Lantern in pursuit of Mirror Master and Black Hand. The villains attempt to steal Flash's speed but Kid Flash loses his powers instead. Green Lantern creates a temporary power ring for Wally to use, dubbing him Kid Lantern. Wally's Lantern costume is palette swap of his Kid Flash costume, with black pants, green top/boots, white gloves, and a Green Lantern insignia in place of his lightning insignia.\n\nIn episode #9 (\"The Green Loontern\") of the 2003 \"Duck Dodgers\" animated series, Duck Dodgers claims his laundry at the dry-cleaners, but mistakenly takes a Green Lantern uniform instead of his usual outfit.\n\nAfter discovering that with the aid of his power ring he can fly, he has a few mishaps involving flight (including a confrontation with a dog while trying to romance a girl in a \"Romeo and Juliet\" spoof), before he is summoned to Oa: in a memorable scene, he zooms uncontrollably through outer space, dragged by the power of his ring.\n\nThe entire Green Lantern Corps is kidnapped by Sinestro; as a last resort, Duck Dodgers is dispatched by the Guardians to save the Corps. Through various flukes, he manages to do so, before Hal Jordan returns (dressed in Dodgers' normal spacesuit) to demand the return of his ring and uniform. The lanterns then flew off, unintentionally leaving Duck Dodgers behind.\n\nWhile asked by Kilowog to recite the Green Lantern power oath at the Corps Central Battery, a flustered Dodgers gabbles a random rhyme in desperation:\n\nThis episode made use of discarded character concepts for a proposed Green Lantern Corps animated series. The series would have focused on the adventures of Kyle Rayner with a slightly comical version of the Corps. The episode included the first animated versions of Guy Gardner, Ch'p, and Boodikka.\n\nA Green Guardsman is featured on the \"Justice League\" animated series' season one two-part episode \"Legends\" (2002) as an homage to the original Alan Scott. He appears as a Justice Guild of America member on an alternate Earth that had been devastated by nuclear war, but reconstructed as a vast mental illusion by a psychic, Ray Thompson. This is a reference to the pre-\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" crossovers between DC Comics' Multiverse (which began in September 1961 \"Flash of Two Worlds\"). To mirror the Golden Age Green Lantern ring's vulnerability to wood, the Green Guardsman's ring has no power over aluminum. However, the Green Guardsman proves to be a loyal superhero of a bygone era, and willingly sacrifices himself to defend the Earth he protects.\n\nSonya Blade's ending in the video game \"Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe\" depicts her becoming the Green Lantern of Earthrealm after finding the ring of an unnamed Corps member who died offscreen during the game's Story Mode.\n\nPower Ring is the name of several DC Comics supervillains — counterparts of Green Lanterns Hal Jordan, Kyle Rayner, and John Stewart. Originally residing on Earth-Three, which was subsequently destroyed during the 12-issue limited series \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", Power Ring along with the other Syndicators ended up being recreated in the Anti-Matter Universe's Earth.\n\nIron Lantern is a fictional character and an Amalgam Comics superhero, whose true debut was in \"Iron Lantern\" #1 (June 1997), though his first (metafictional) appearance in the Amalgam universe was in \"Showcase of Suspense\" #1. He is a combination of Marvel Comics' Iron Man and DC Comics' Green Lantern. Iron Lantern was created by writer Kurt Busiek.\n\nIron Lantern's origin is revealed in \"Iron Lantern\" #1. Hal Stark is the millionaire owner of Stark Aviation. While working on a prototype flight simulator, Stark is pulled to the site of a space ship by a beam of green energy. The simulator crashes, badly injuring Stark. The spaceship contains the corpse of an alien named Rhomann Sur (an amalgamation of Marvel's Rhomann Dey and DC's Abin Sur). Stark is able to use parts of the spaceship to build a superpowered suit of armor (powered by Sur's lantern) to keep himself alive. Stark then defeats the aliens responsible for Sur's death, and decides to fight evil as Iron Lantern.\n\nIron Lantern's other foes include Madame Sapphire (Pepper Ferris — Marvel's Madame Masque and DC's Star Sapphire), H.E.C.T.O.R. (Marvel's MODOK and DC's Hector Hammond), Oa the Living Planet (Ego the Living Planet mixed with Oa, the home planet of the Guardians of the Universe), and Mandarinestro (Marvel's Mandarin and DC's Sinestro).\n\nKyle O'Brien / Green Guardsman is an Amalgam Comics superhero whose true debut was in \"Iron Lantern\" #1, though his first (metafictional) appearance in the Amalgam universe was \"Showcase of Suspense\" #84, in a story entitled \"The Other Iron Lantern\". He was an amalgamation of Kevin O'Brien, the Guardsman, and Kyle Rayner, the then current Green Lantern.\n\nBased off Jennifer-Lynn Hayden, Jade Yifei is the Green Lantern of Sector 2814 in the \"Ame-Comi\" universe. A teenager from China, she was chosen as the first Green Lantern of Earth in this continuity rather than Hal Jordan.\n\nDoctor Spectrum is the name of five different fictional comic book characters in the Marvel Comics multiverse. There have been five versions of the character to date — three supervillains from the mainstream Marvel Universe belonging to the team Squadron Sinister (Earth-616) and two heroes from different alternate universes. The two heroes each belong to a version of the team Squadron Supreme (the Squadron Supreme of Earth-712 and the Squadron Supreme of Earth-31916, respectively).\n\nAfter long experimentation the Guardians equipped and loosely oversaw the Green Lantern Corps, over 7200 diverse beings from throughout the universe. Each was granted a battery and a ring. Thinly scattered among uncounted trillions of stars, each was assigned a sector of space which was vaster than anyone can comprehend.\n\nThe sectors are shaped as four-sided pyramid-shaped sections of a sphere, with their point meeting at Oa, which is located at the center of the universe. Oa is technically in each Lantern's sector, and while on Oa, the Lantern is still in his home sector\n\nThere are 3600 standard space sectors, plus three \"special\" sectors: 0 (Oa itself), -1 (Anti-matter universe), and 3601 (proscribed sector of space populated by the Manhunters).\n\n\n",
                "Green Lantern\n\nGreen Lantern is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. They fight evil with the aid of rings that grant them a variety of extraordinary powers.\n\nThe first Green Lantern character, Alan Scott, was created in 1940 by Martin Nodell during the initial popularity of superheroes. Alan Scott usually fought common criminals in New York City with the aid of his magic ring.\n\nThe Green Lanterns are among DC Comics' longer lasting sets of characters. They have been adapted to television, video games, and motion pictures.\n\nMartin Nodell (using the name Mart Dellon) created the first Green Lantern. He first appeared in the Golden Age of comic books in \"All-American Comics\" #16 (July 1940), published by All-American Publications, one of three companies that would eventually merge to form DC Comics.\n\nThis Green Lantern's real name was Alan Scott, a railroad engineer who, after a railway crash, came into possession of a magic lantern which spoke to him and said it would bring power. From this, he crafted a magic ring which gave him a wide variety of powers. The limitations of the ring were that it had to be \"charged\" every 24 hours by touching it to the lantern for a time, and that it could not directly affect objects made of wood. Alan Scott fought mostly ordinary human villains, but he did have a few paranormal ones such as the immortal Vandal Savage and the zombie Solomon Grundy. Most stories took place in New York.\n\nAs a popular character in the 1940s, the Green Lantern featured both in anthology books such as \"All-American Comics\" and \"Comic Cavalcade\", as well as his own book, \"Green Lantern\". He also appeared in \"All Star Comics\" as a member of the superhero team known as the Justice Society of America.\n\nAfter World War II the popularity of superheroes in general declined. The \"Green Lantern\" comic book was cancelled with issue #38 (May–June 1949), and \"All Star Comics\" #57 (1951) was the character's last Golden Age appearance. When superheroes came back in fashion in later decades, the character Alan Scott was revived, but he was forever marginalized by the new Hal Jordan character who had been created to supplant him (see below). Initially, he made guest appearances in other superheroes' books, but eventually got regular roles in books featuring the Justice Society. He never got another solo series. Between 1995 and 2003, DC Comics changed Alan Scott's superhero codename to \"Sentinel\" in order to distinguish him from the newer and more popular science fiction Green Lanterns.\n\nIn 2011, the Alan Scott character was revamped. His costume was redesigned and the source of his powers was changed to that of the mystical power of nature (referred to in the stories as \"the Green\").\n\nIn 1959, Julius Schwartz reinvented the Green Lantern character as a science fiction hero named Hal Jordan. Hal Jordan's powers were more or less the same as Alan Scott's, but otherwise this character was completely different than the Green Lantern character of the 1940s. He had a new name, a redesigned costume, and a rewritten origin story. Hal Jordan received his ring from a dying alien and was commissioned as an officer of the Green Lantern Corps, an interstellar law enforcement agency overseen by the Guardians of the Universe.\n\nHal Jordan was introduced in \"Showcase\" #22 (September–October 1959). Gil Kane and Sid Greene were the art team most notable on the title in its early years, along with writer John Broome.\n\nWith issue #76 (April 1970), the series made a radical stylistic departure. Editor Schwartz, in one of the company's earliest efforts to provide more than fantasy, worked with the writer-artist team of Denny O'Neil and Neal Adams to spark new interest in the comic book series and address a perceived need for social relevance. They added the character Green Arrow (with the cover, but not the official name, retitled \"Green Lantern Co-Starring Green Arrow\") and had the pair travel through America encountering \"real world\" issues, to which they reacted in different ways — Green Lantern as fundamentally a lawman, Green Arrow as a liberal iconoclast. Additionally during this run, the groundbreaking \"Snowbirds Don't Fly\" story was published (issues #85 and #86) in which Green Arrow's teen sidekick Speedy (the later grown-up hero Red Arrow) developed a heroin addiction that he was forcibly made to quit. The stories were critically acclaimed, with publications such as \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and \"Newsweek\" citing it as an example of how comic books were \"growing up\". However, the O'Neil/Adams run was not a commercial success, and the series was cancelled after only 14 issues, though an additional unpublished three installments were finally published as backups in \"The Flash\" #217-219.\n\nThe title would know a number of revivals and cancellations. Its title would change to \"Green Lantern Corps\" at one point as the popularity rose and waned. During a time there were two regular titles, each with a Green Lantern, and a third member in the Justice League. A new character, Kyle Rayner, was created to become the feature while Hal Jordan first became the villain Parallax, then died and came back as the Spectre.\n\nIn the wake of \"\", writer Geoff Johns returned Hal Jordan as Green Lantern in \"\" (2004–05). Johns began to lay groundwork for \"Blackest Night\" (released July 13, 2010), viewing it as the third part of the trilogy started by \"Rebirth\". Expanding on the Green Lantern mythology in the second part, \"Sinestro Corps War\" (2007), Johns, with artist Ethan van Sciver, found wide critical acclaim and commercial success with the series, which promised the introduction of a spectrum of colored \"lanterns\".\n\nThe series and its creators have received several awards over the years, including the 1961 Alley Award for Best Adventure Hero/Heroine with Own Book and the Academy of Comic Book Arts Shazam Award for Best Continuing Feature in 1970, for Best Individual Story (\"No Evil Shall Escape My Sight\", \"Green Lantern\" vol. 2, #76, by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams), and in 1971 for Best Individual Story (\"Snowbirds Don't Fly\", \"Green Lantern\" vol. 2, #85 by O'Neil and Adams).\n\nWriter O'Neil received the Shazam Award for Best Writer (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on \"Green Lantern\", \"Batman\", \"Superman\", and other titles, while artist Adams received the Shazam for Best Artist (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on \"Green Lantern\" and \"Batman\". Inker Dick Giordano received the Shazam Award for Best Inker (Dramatic Division) for his work on \"Green Lantern\" and other titles.\n\nIn Judd Winick's first regular writing assignment on Green Lantern, he wrote a storyline in which an assistant of Kyle Rayner's emerged as a gay character in Green Lantern #137 (June 2001). In Green Lantern #154 (November 2001) the story entitled \"Hate Crime\" gained media recognition when Terry was brutally beaten in a homophobic attack. Winick was interviewed on Phil Donahue's show on MSNBC for that storyline on August 15, 2002 and received two GLAAD Media Awards for his Green Lantern work.\n\nIn May 2011, \"Green Lantern\" placed 7th on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time.\n\nAlan Scott's Green Lantern history originally began thousands of years ago when a mystical \"green flame\" meteor fell to Earth in ancient China. The voice of the flame prophesied that it would act three times: once to bring death (a lamp-maker named Luke Fairclough crafted the green metal of the meteor into a lamp; in fear and as punishment for what they thought sacrilege, the local villagers killed him, only to be destroyed by a sudden burst of the green flame), once to bring life (in modern times, the lamp came into the hands of a patient in a mental institution who fashioned the lamp into a modern lantern; the green flame restored him to sanity and gave him a new life), and once to bring power. By 1940, the lantern passed into the possession of Alan Scott, a young engineer. Following a railroad-bridge collapse of which he was the only survivor, the flame instructed Scott how to fashion a ring from its metal to give him fantastic powers as the superhero Green Lantern. He adopted a colorful costume and became a crime-fighter. Alan was a founding member of the Justice Society of America.\n\nAfter the Crisis on Infinite Earths (although the original origin story was still in continuity), a later \"Tales of the Green Lantern Corps\" story was published that brought Scott even closer to the Corps' ranks, when it was revealed that Alan Scott was predated as Earth's Green Lantern by a Green Lantern named Yalan Gur, a resident of China. Not only had the Corps' now-familiar green, black and white uniform motif not yet been adopted, but Yalan Gur altered the basic red uniform to more closely resemble the style of clothing worn by his countrymen. Power ultimately corrupted this early Green Lantern, as he attempted to rule over mankind, which forced the Guardians to cause his ring to manifest a weakness to wood, the material from which most Earth weapons of the time were fashioned. This allowed the Chinese peasants to ultimately defeat their corrupted \"champion\". His ring and lantern were burned and it was during this process that the “intelligence” inhabiting the ring and the lantern and linking them to the Guardians was damaged. Over time, when it had occasion to manifest itself, this \"intelligence\" became known as the mystical 'Starheart' of fable. But that was long gone. He later fought Superman which gave him superhuman powers. Then Deathstroke killed him and ruled the world.\n\nCenturies later, it was explained, when Scott found the mystical lantern, it had no memory of its true origins, save a vague recollection of the uniform of its last master. This was the origin of Scott’s distinctive costume. Due to its damaged link to them, the Guardians presumed the ring and lantern to be lost in whatever cataclysm overcame their last owner of record, thus Scott was never noticed by the Guardians and went on to carve a history of his own apart from that of the Corps, sporting a ring with an artificially induced weakness against anything made of wood. Honoring this separate history, the Guardians never moved to force Scott to relinquish the ring, formally join the Corps, or adopt its colors. Some sort of link between Scott and the Corps, however, was hinted at in a Silver Age crossover story which depicts Scott and Hal Jordan charging their rings at the same Power Battery while both reciting the \"Brightest Day\" oath. During the Rann-Thanagar War, it was revealed that Scott is an honorary member of the Corps.\n\nOn June 1, 2012, DC Comics announced that it would be introducing an alternate version of Alan Scott as a gay man in the title \"Earth 2.\" The New 52 issue was released on June 6, 2012. In its story, Alan Scott and his partner Sam were both passengers aboard a train, but the latter was killed when their train was wrecked in the railroad-bridge collapse that Scott alone survived; a magical green flame found Alan amongst the rubble. Telling him he is to become an avatar of the flame's great power and that he must channel this power through an item of importance to his heart, Alan chooses the engagement ring he was to give his boyfriend, becoming Green Lantern. This alternate version is not a member of the Green Lantern Corps, which doesn't exist in Earth 2, but rather adopts the name Green Lantern for himself, for his powers derives his mystical powers from the Green, the elemental force which connects plant life on Earth.\n\nThe character of Harold \"Hal\" Jordan was a second-generation test pilot, having followed in the footsteps of his father. He was given the power ring and battery (lantern) by a dying alien named Abin Sur, whose spaceship crashed on Earth. Abin Sur used his ring to seek out an individual who was \"utterly honest and born without fear\" to take his place as a member of the corps. At one point, when Hal Jordan was incapacitated, it was revealed that there were two individuals matching the specified criteria on Earth, the other being Guy Gardner, and the ring chose Jordan solely because of his proximity to Abin Sur. Gardner then became listed as Hal's \"backup\", even though he had a strong friendship with Barry Allen (The Flash). Gardner would fill in if Jordan was unavailable or otherwise incapacitated. Later, when Gardner was put into a coma, it turned out that by then there was a third human suitable for the task, John Stewart, who was designated as the Earth Sector's \"backup\" Lantern. Jordan, as Green Lantern, became a founding member of the Justice League of America and as of the mid-2000s is, along with John Stewart, one of the two active-duty Lanterns in Earth's sector of space.\n\nJordan also automatically became a member of the Green Lantern Corps, a galactic \"police\" force which bears some similarities to the \"Lensmen\" from the science fiction series written by E.E. Smith, although both creators Julius Schwartz and John Broome denied ever reading Smith's stories. Nevertheless, the early 1980s miniseries \"Green Lantern Corps\" honors the similarity with two characters in the corps: Eddore of Tront and Arisia. A different interpretation of Jordan and the Corps appears in \"\".\n\nFollowing the rebirth of Superman and the destruction of Green Lantern's hometown of Coast City in the early 1990s, Hal Jordan seemingly went insane and destroyed the Green Lantern Corps and the Central Power Battery. Now calling himself Parallax, Hal Jordan would devastate the DC Universe off and on for the next several years. However, after Earth's sun was threatened by a Sun-Eater, Jordan sacrificed his life, expending the last of his vast power to reignite the dying star. Jordan subsequently returned from beyond the grave as the Spectre, the divine Spirit of God's Vengeance, whom Jordan attempted to transform into a Spirit of Redemption, which ended in failure.\n\nIn \"\", it is revealed that Jordan was under the influence of a creature known as Parallax when he turned renegade. Parallax was a creature of pure fear that had been imprisoned in the Central Power Battery by the Guardians of the Universe in the distant past. Imprisonment had rendered the creature dormant and it was eventually forgotten, becoming known merely as the \"yellow impurity\" in the power rings. Sinestro was able to wake Parallax and encourage it to seek out Hal Jordan as a host. Although Parallax had been trying to corrupt Jordan (via his ring) for some time, it was not until after the destruction of Coast City that it was able to succeed. It took advantage of Jordan's weakened emotional state to lure him to Oa and cause him to attack anyone who stood in his way. After killing several Green Lanterns, Jordan finally entered the Central Power Battery and absorbed all the power, unwittingly freeing the Parallax entity and allowed it to graft onto his soul.\n\nThe Spectre bonded with Jordan in the hopes of freeing the former Green Lantern's soul from Parallax's taint, but was not strong enough to do so. In \"Green Lantern: Rebirth\", Parallax began to assert control of the Parallax-Spectre-Jordan composite. Thanks to a supreme effort of will, Jordan was able to free himself from Parallax, rejoin his soul to his body and reclaim his power ring. The newly revived (and rejuvenated) Jordan awoke just in time to save Kyle Rayner and Green Arrow from Sinestro. After the Korugarian's defeat, Jordan was able to successfully lead his fellow Green Lanterns in battle against Parallax and with help from Guardians Sayd and Ganthet, imprisoned it within the personal power batteries of Earth's Lanterns, rendering the Green Lantern's rings free of the yellow impurity, provided they had the power of will to do so.\nHal Jordan is once again a member of both the Justice League and the Green Lantern Corps, and along with John Stewart is one of the two Corps members assigned to Sector 2814, personally defeating Sinestro in the Sinestro Corps War. Jordan is designated as Green Lantern 2814.1.\n\nPost-\"Sinestro Corps War\", DC Comics revisited the origin of Hal Jordan as a precursor to \"Blackest Night\" storyline, the next chapter in the Geoff Johns era on \"Green Lantern\".\nHal Jordan is the Green Lantern portrayed by Ryan Reynolds in the 2011 \"Green Lantern\" film.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Guy Gardner appeared as the second choice to replace Abin Sur as Green Lantern of sector 2814. Gardner was a candidate to receive Abin Sur's ring, but Jordan was closer. This placed him as the \"backup\" Green Lantern for Jordan. But early in his career as a Green Lantern, tragedy struck Gardner as a power battery blew up in his face, putting him in a coma for years. During the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", the Guardians split into factions, one of which appointed a newly revived Gardner as their champion. As a result of his years in a coma, Guy was emotionally unstable, although he still mostly managed to fight valiantly. He has gone through many changes, including wielding Sinestro's yellow Guardian power ring, then gaining and losing Vuldarian powers, and readmission to the Corps during \"\". He later became part of the Green Lantern Honor Guard, and oversees the training of new Green Lanterns. Gardner is designated as Green Lantern 2814.2 within the Corps.\n\nGuy Gardner helped lead the defense of Oa during the events of \"Blackest Night\".\n\nFollowing his outstanding acts of valour, the Guardians appoint Guy to a unique role and highest rank in the Green Lantern Corps-Sentinel, answering directly to the Guardians themselves.\n\nIn the early 1970s, John Stewart, an architect from Detroit, was selected by the Guardians to replace a comatose Guy Gardner as the backup Green Lantern for Jordan. When Jordan resigned from the Corps for an extended period of time, Stewart served as the regular Lantern, coming into his own as he battled numerous Green Lantern villains and played a key role during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. During that time the Guardians of the Universe assigned Katma Tui to train Stewart, and the two developed romantic feelings for each other. They married, but Katma was soon murdered by longtime Green Lantern villain, Star Sapphire. Stewart was crushed by this, and his life began to unravel. He reached his lowest point when he failed to save the planet Xanshi from destruction during the Cosmic Odyssey.\n\nJohn Stewart redeemed himself during the crisis, when an insane Guardian abducted cities from all over the universe and placed them together on Oa. When the Guardian was defeated, the cities remained, as the other Guardians claimed to not have enough energy in the Central Power Battery to send them home. While they gathered the resources, John Stewart was assigned to oversee the jammed together communities. Using his intellect and unconventional thinking, he formed the warring communities into a cohesive society. He was aided by Rose Hardin, a farmer from West Virginia who was trapped on Oa, due to her town being abducted. Stewart once again found love with Rose, and the two of them came to feel more comfortable on their new world than they did back on Earth.\n\nStewart eventually deduced that the Guardians had the energy to send the cities home whenever they wanted, and that they let them remain on Oa as an experiment in cosmic integration, and also as a test for John Stewart. Stewart passed the test, and discovered that he was a figure in Oan prophecy. That was why the Guardians directly chose him instead of allowing a Power Ring to do it, as is standard procedure. John Stewart rose to a new level of awareness and became the first mortal Guardian of the Universe. He was also rewarded with the resurrection of Katma Tui, which caused him to break up with Rose.\n\nStewart's new powers and resurrected wife were taken from him when Hal Jordan went mad and became Parallax, absorbing the power from the Central Power Battery. During this time, the Green Lantern Corps was disbanded, and Stewart went on to lead the Darkstars, a new organization of universal peacekeepers led by the Controllers, offshoots of the Guardians of the Universe. During a battle, Stewart was badly injured and left paralyzed from the waist down. Hal Jordan eventually restored his ability to walk before sacrificing himself to save Earth's sun. Soon after, John Stewart found himself hunted by a serial killer from Xanshi called Fatality. She sought out any remnants of the Green Lantern Corps so that she may kill them in the name of avenging her doomed planet. Stewart fended off Fatality with residual energy he blasted from his body, which was in him due to Hal Jordan healing his crippling condition, however, this left him unable to walk again.\n\nStewart later visited Fatality while she was in custody, and she revealed to him that his back was fine, and he had the ability to walk if he wanted to. Stewart had imposed a psychological block upon himself due to feeling guilty over his sister's death. Stewart overcame this condition and was given a power ring by Kyle Rayner. Rayner departed Earth and Stewart became the Green Lantern of Earth once again, and also a member of the Justice League of America.\n\nWhen the Green Lantern Corps reformed, Stewart begun serving with Jordan as one of his sector's two designated regular-duty Lanterns, designated as Green Lantern 2814.3. Since then, he played key roles in all big Green Lantern events, such as \"The Sinestro Corps War\" and \"Blackest Night\".\n\nIn the New 52 continuity, John Stewart was a U.S. Marine along with being an architect and the son of a social activist. He started a romantic relationship with his longtime enemy Fatality, who by that point had become a Star Sapphire and apparently forgave him for failing to save her world. In the events leading up to the \"Uprising\", Fatality was captured by shape-shifting Durlans, and a Durlan operative replicated her and took her place. John Stewart was at first hesitant about the relationship, but he eventually came to love Fatality, but it turns out that it had been the impostor by that point. In the final battle of the \"Uprising\", the impostor revealed itself as Verrat Din, an eons old Durlan, and destroyed Fatality's Star Sapphire ring, having no use for it after gaining the power of a Daxamite. Though Stewart defeated the powerful threat, he was shaken by having been misled so long, and having been intimate with a Durlan shape-shifter.\n\nStewart immediately set out to find the real Fatality, and when he did, he was astonished to discover that she had reverted to hating him. Fatality revealed that she was forcibly inducted into the Star Sapphires and brainwashed into being one of them. When her ring was destroyed, the spell was broken. Every moment she was with Stewart, she was trapped within herself. She revealed that she never loved John Stewart and departed, leaving Stewart emotionally crushed.\n\nJohn Stewart is notable for being the Green Lantern showcased on the \"Justice League\" and \"Justice League Unlimited\" cartoon shows, as well as being the primary Green Lantern of the DC Animated Universe.\n\nKyle Rayner was a struggling freelance artist when he was approached by the last Guardian of the Universe, Ganthet, to become a new Green Lantern with the very last power ring. Ganthet's reasons for choosing Rayner remained a secret for quite some time. Despite not being from the same cloth of bravery and fearlessness as Hal Jordan—or perhaps because of that—Rayner proved to be popular with readers and his fellow characters. Having continually proven himself on his own and with the JLA, he became known amongst the Oans as \"The Torch Bearer\". He briefly operated as Ion after using the power of the entire Green Lantern Corps. He was responsible for the rebirth of the Guardians and the re-ignition of the Central Power Battery, essentially restoring all that Jordan had destroyed as Parallax.\n\nKyle Rayner was chosen to wield the last ring because he knew fear, and Parallax had been released from the Central Power Battery. Ganthet knew this and chose Kyle because his experiences dealing with fear enabled him to resist Parallax. Because Parallax is a manifestation of fear, and yellow, none of the other Green Lanterns, including Hal, could harm Parallax and, therefore, came under his control. Kyle taught them to feel and overcome fear so they could defeat Parallax and incarcerate him in the Central Power Battery once again.\n\nKyle became Ion, who is later revealed to be the manifestation of willpower in the same way Parallax is fear. During the Sinestro Corps War between the Green Lantern Corps and the Sinestro Corps, Ion was imprisoned while Parallax possesses Kyle. In \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 4) #24, Parallax consumes Hal Jordan. Hal Jordan enters into Kyle's prison, and with his help, Kyle finally escapes Parallax.\n\nAfterward, Ganthet and Sayd trap Parallax in the Lanterns of the four Green Lanterns of Earth. Ganthet asks Kyle to give up his right to be Ion and become a Green Lantern again. Kyle accepts, and Ganthet gives Kyle a power ring. Kyle is outfitted with a new costume including a mask that looks like the one from his first uniform. Kyle is now a member of the Green Lantern Corps Honor Guard, and has been partnered with Guy Gardner.\n\nKyle now shows up mostly as part of the ensemble cast of \"Green Lantern Corps\". Corps rookie Sodam Yat took over the mantle of Ion. Sodam has made an appearance in the Legion of Super Heroes \"Final Crisis\" tie-in \"Legion of Three Worlds\" as the last surviving Green Lantern/Guardian of the Universe.\n\nKyle is designated as Green Lantern 2814.4 within the Corps.\n\nKyle Rayner died in \"Green Lantern Corps\" #42 (Jan. 2010) after sacrificing himself to save Oa from an attack by the Black Lantern Corps. The following issue, Kyle is brought back to life by the power of a Star Sapphire who connects Soranik Natu's heart to his heart.\n\nSimon Baz is a Lebanese American Muslim from the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Michigan. He first appeared in \"The New 52! FCBD\" #1 before making his first full appearance in \"Green Lantern\" #0 during the \"Rise of the Third Army\" storyline written by Geoff Johns. He was caught by the police street racing in a stolen car with an armed bomb in the back of the van. While being questioned by authorities, Sinestro's Green Lantern ring chose Simon as its next ring bearer, recruiting him into the Green Lantern Corps. The squirrel-like Lantern B'dg follows, becoming Baz's mentor and friend. The Justice League eventually tracks Baz down and questions him as to how he came into the possession of a Green Lantern ring. Batman tries to disarm him by removing Simon's ring, but self-defense mechanisms of the ring prevent this.\nFollowing the events of \"Wrath of The First Lantern\", Simon Baz was offered the opportunity to join Amanda Waller and Steve Trevor's \"Justice League of America\" under the pretense that, his criminal charges would be dropped and his innocence publicly declared after FBI Agent Franklin Fed vouched for him. During the events of the \"Trinity War\" storyline, after Cyborg's (Victor) body was mangled by Crime Syndicate member \"The Grid\", Baz's ring was the only thing preventing Victor from death. During the battle against Relic, when Lantern Guy Gardner and the Red Lantern Corps become the protectors of space sector 2814, Simon was appointed Green Lantern ambassador on earth by Hal Jordan. Additionally per Hal´s request Simon became the protector of Hal Jordan's family. In \"Green Lantern\" #20, after the fierce battle against the First Lantern, it was revealed that Simon Baz will go on to train the first female Green Lantern of Earth, Jessica Cruz.\n\nFirst mentioned in \"Green Lantern\" #20 as the first female Green Lantern of Earth. Jessica Cruz is a young Latina American woman who was forced to become the unwilling host to the evil Ring of Volthoom after \"Power Ring\" dies in his alternate Earth unverse. Though she is not technically \"Power Ring\", as she is not a member of the Crime Syndicate and has no association with the organization, for namesake purposes she is dubbed \"Power Ring\" while the ring uses her as a host. She is helped by the Justice League and Simon Baz, who help her understand her cursed powers. In the Darkseid War, she becomes trapped inside the Ring of Volthoom, as Volthoom himself takes over Jessica's body. She then battles the previous wearers of the ring with the help of Cyborg, and forces her body in front of the Black Racer (who at the time was controlling the Flash) and kills Volthoom. After the battle, whilst the League mourns her motionless body, a Green Lantern ring appears and Jessica is made the 6th Green Lantern of Earth, to everyone's surprise.\n\nIn \"Green Lantern: Rebirth\" #1, she meets up with Simon Baz to battle a Manhunter. This turns out to be an exercise controlled by Hal Jordan, as he needs them to protect Earth whilst he goes on a mission to find the rest of the Corps. He then fuses both their Lanterns into one, which can only be used when they are together. Hal also gives them membership into the Justice League to help with their training.\n\nThe daughter of Alan Scott, Jennifer-Lynn Hayden would discover she shared her father's mystical connection to the Starheart, which gave her the abilities of a Green Lantern. Choosing to follow in her father's footsteps, she became the superheroine Jade. She would later fight a manifestation of the Starheart and lose those abilities. When Jade was fighting an Okaaran monster, she was saved by an orange lantern named Cade and fell in love with him.\n\nAfter Jade was stripped of her powers, Kyle Rayner gave her a copy of Hal Jordan's power ring. When Rayner left Earth to restart the Green Lantern Corps, Jade donned the classic Green Lantern uniform and served as the planet's Green Lantern until losing the ring during a battle with the villain Fatality. Later, when the ring was returned to her, she changed her Green Lantern uniform to a modified version of Rayner's. Jade continued to function as a Green Lantern until Rayner, as Ion, used his power to restore her connection to the Starheart. During \"Infinite Crisis\", she died while trying to stop Alexander Luthor, Jr. from destroying the universe to create a new multiverse. Upon her death, Jade returned her Starheart power to Rayner. In the \"Blackest Night\" event, her remains have been reanimated as one of the Black Lantern Corps after receiving a black power ring. She was resurrected by the Life Entity along with eleven other Black Lantern Corps members.\n\nSinestro was born on the planet Korugar and became Green Lantern of space sector 1417. He was a friend of Abin Sur and mentor to Hal Jordan. His desire for order was an asset in the Corps, and initially led him to be considered one of the greatest Green Lanterns. As the years passed, he became more and more fixated upon not simply protecting his sector, but on preserving order in the society of his home planet no matter what the cost. Eventually, he concluded that the best way to accomplish this was to conquer Korugar and rule the planet as a dictator. Exposed by Hal Jordan and punished, he later wielded a yellow ring of fear from Qward. Later in league with Parallax, he would establish the Sinestro Corps, which began the War of Light. Following \"Blackest Night\" and \"War of the Green Lanterns\" Sinestro would once again receive a Green Lantern ring and temporarily headline the monthly \"Green Lantern\" following The New 52. \nPremiering in \"Green Lantern: New Guardians Annual\" #1, Caul is a deep undercover Green Lantern operative that works in the Tenebrian Dominion. He unwillingly helps Carol Ferris and the New Guardians attempt to petition Lady Styx to send aid against the Third Army. For betraying them, the New Guardians leave Caul behind and he is forced to become part of a reality program called \"The Hunted\", stripped of his powers and with his discharged power ring embedded into his chest. Caul stars as part of an ensemble cast of spacebound DC characters including the Blue Beetle and a new Captain K'rot in the \"Hunted\" main feature of \"Threshold\". Caul received his Green Lantern Ring after he shot and killed its previous bearer, unsure himself why he was then chosen. Caul is able to save Sh'diki Borough on the planet Tolerance after it had been bottled by Brainiac. Caul is later informed that The Hunted has been cancelled and offered the lead role on a new show, Team Cauldron with the rest of his friends and Hunted competitors. Caul agrees to the role, having his power ring re-embedded into his chest. He is granted a meeting with Lady Styx to finalize his new role. However, as soon as Caul materializes at her base, he is killed by multiple gunshots, as planned by Colonel T'omas T'morra. In a glimmernet commercial, it is shown that T'morra replaces Caul in the proposed new show. However Caul is shown alive later along with Captain K'rot in tow when the planet Telos manifests during \"Convergence\" investigating it alongside Superman, Supergirl, Guy Gardner and the Red Lanterns.\n\nThe ring is powered by willpower. \nEach Green Lantern wears a ring that grants them a variety of possibilities. The full extent of the ring's ability has never been rigorously defined in the stories, but two consistent traits are that it grants the power of flight and that all its effects are accompanied by a green light.\n\nEarly Green Lantern stories showed the characters performing all sorts of feats with the ring, from shrinking objects to turning people invisible. Later stories de-emphasized these abilities in favor of constructs.\n\nThe signature power of all Green Lanterns is the ability to conjure \"constructs:\" solid green objects that the Green Lantern can control telekinetically. These can be anything, such as a disembodied fist to beat a foe, a shield to block an attack, a sword to cut a rope, or chains to bind a prisoner. Whatever their shape or size, these constructs are always pure green in color, unless a Lantern is skillful enough to know how to change the EM spectrum the construct emits. Hal Jordan has shown the ability to have a construct emit kryptonite radiation under Batman's guidance.\n\nThe rings of the Green Lantern Corps allow their bearers to travel very quickly across interstellar distances, fast enough that they can efficiently patrol the universe. They allow the wearer to survive in virtually any environment, and also remove the need to eat, sleep and pass waste. The rings can translate practically any language in the universe. They possess powerful sensors that can identify and analyze objects. Lanterns are granted full access to all Guardian knowledge by their rings, through the Book of Oa.\n\nA noteworthy power the rings do not have is the ability to automatically heal injuries, though they can provide shielding. In Hal Jordan's origin story, Abin Sur passed on his ring to Hal because he was unable to treat his own fatal injuries. If the Green Lantern happens to be a skilled physician, then the ring can be invaluable as it can conjure any conceivable medical tool, but it cannot do much for a Lantern who lacks medical expertise. When Hal Jordan breaks his arm, the best he can do is conjure up a cast. This is further extended into an ability to replace large sections of one's injured body with constructs, but this too requires detailed biological knowledge of one's body and concentration enough to prolong the construct.\n\nAlan Scott's ring is unable to directly affect anything made of wood. Alan can conjure a green shield to block bullets, but a wooden club will pass through it effortlessly. The rings of Hal Jordan and his colleagues originally shared a similar weakness to anything colored yellow, though due to the removal of the yellow impurity from the Central Battery on Oa, more recent stories have removed this weakness.\n\nThe effectiveness of the ring is tied to the wearer's willpower. A Green Lantern with strong willpower will best a weaker-willed Lantern in a duel. Anything which weakens the Green Lantern's mind, such as a telepathic attack, may render his ring useless.\n\nGreen Lantern is famous for the oath he recites when he charges his ring. Originally, the oath was:\n\nThis oath is also used by Lanterns Tomar-Re of sector 2813 and Chief Administrator Salaak.\nIn the mid-1940s, this was revised into the form that became famous during the Hal Jordan era:\nThe oath in this form is credited to Alfred Bester, who wrote many Green Lantern stories in the 1940s. This version of the oath was first spoken by Alan Scott in \"Green Lantern\" #9 from the fall of 1943. Scott would revert to reciting his original oath after he was reintroduced during the Silver Age.\n\nMany Green Lanterns have a unique personal oath, but some oaths are shared by several Lanterns. They are usually four lines long with a rhyme scheme of “AAAA” or “AABB”.\n\nThe Pre-Crisis version of Hal Jordan was inspired to create his oath after a series of adventures in which he developed new ways to detect evasive criminals: in the first adventure, he used his ring as radar to find robbers who had blinded him with a magnesium flash; in the second, he tracked criminals in a dark cave by using his ring to make them glow with phosphorescence; finally, Jordan tracked safecrackers by the faint shockwaves from the explosives they had used.\n\nMedphyll, the Green Lantern of the planet J586 (seen in \"Swamp Thing\" #61, \"All Flesh is Grass\"), a planet where a sentient plant species lives, has the following oath:\n\nOther notable oaths include that of Jack T. Chance,\n\nand that of Rot Lop Fan, a Green Lantern whose species lacks sight, and thus has no concepts of brightness, darkness, day, night, color, or lanterns.\n\nSince \"\" and the re-establishment of the Green Lantern Corps, the only oath used has been the \"Brightest Day, Blackest Night\" version.\n\nIn \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 4) #27, the Alpha Lanterns use the oath:\n\nIn \"\", Sodam Yat in the 31st century – the last of the Green Lanterns and the last of the Guardians – recited a new oath:\n\nIn \"Batman: The Dawnbreaker\" #1, the Dawnbreaker (an amalgamation of Batman and Green Lantern from the Dark Multiverse's Earth-32) creates and recites his own oath after the death of the Guardians of the Universe and the Green Lantern Corps by his own hands:\n\nIn the video game, \"Infinite Crisis\", Hal Jordan of Earth-13 (the Arcane universe) has his own variation:\n\nIn the animated TV series \"Duck Dodgers\", Duck Dodgers temporarily becomes a Green Lantern after accidentally picking up Hal Jordan's laundry. In the first part of the episode, he forgets the real quote and makes up his own version:\n\nIn 2011, soon after the release of the \"Green Lantern\" movie, a trailer for \"The Muppets\" featured Kermit reciting a parody of the oath:\n\nThe TV show, \"Mad\", included a movie parody called \"RiOa\", a fusion of \"Green Lantern\" and \"Rio\". Blu from \"Rio\" is turned into a Green Lantern, and recruits Big Bird, the Road Runner, Mordecai from \"Regular Show\", Mumble from \"Happy Feet\", and one of the Angry Birds and turns them into Green Lanterns.\n\nThe phrase \"in the brightest day and in the darkest night\" can also be found in a letter Sullivan Ballou wrote to his wife during the American Civil War, shortly before he was killed in the First Battle of Bull Run (1861).\n\nWith the exception of Alan Scott, all Lantern oaths are formatted in four lines of Iambic tetrameter.\n\n",
                "Alan Scott\n\nAlan Scott is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, and the first* character to bear the name Green Lantern. He was created by Martin Nodell first appearing in the comic book \"All-American Comics #16\", published in 1940. His original design was based on Alan Ladd.\n\nAlan Scott was created after Nodell became inspired by the characters from Greek and Norse myths, seeking to create a popular entertainment character who fought evil with the aid of a magic ring which grants him a variety of supernatural powers. After debuting in \"All-American Comics\", Alan Scott soon became popular enough to sustain his own comic book, \"Green Lantern\". Around this time DC also began experimenting with fictional crossovers between its characters, leading towards a shared universe of characters. As one of the publisher's most popular heroes, Alan became a founding member of the Justice Society of America, one of the first such teams of \"mystery men\" or superheroes in comic books. (* Although many may argue that he was the second green lantern, he has been confirmed to be the first by DC themselves)\n\nFollowing World War II, the character's popularity began to fade along with the decline of the Golden Age of Comic Books, leading to cancellation. After 12 years out of print, DC chose to reinvent Green Lantern as science fiction hero Hal Jordan in 1959. Later, DC would again revisit Alan Scott, establishing that Alan and Hal were the Green Lanterns of two different parallel worlds, with Alan residing on Earth-Two and Hal on Earth-One. Stories set on Earth-Two thereafter showed that Alan became the father to two superheroic children, the twins Obsidian and Jade, each with powers a bit like his own. When in 1985 DC chose to reboot its internal continuity, it merged the worlds of Earth-One and Earth-Two, and Alan was again reimagined as an elder statesman of the DC Universe, the magical Green Lantern of an earlier generation who coexists with the more science fiction-oriented heroes of the Green Lantern Corps. When DC brought back its internal Multiverse concept in the 2000s, it reintroduced a new, young version of Alan on the new Earth-Two, this time as a gay man and the owner of a media conglomerate whose magical powers stem from his role as champion of the Green, an entity embodying plant life on Earth.\n\nThe original Green Lantern was created by an American artist named Martin Nodell. Nodell mentions Richard Wagner's opera cycle \"The Ring of the Nibelung\" and the sight of a trainman's green railway lantern as his inspiration. After seeing this opera, Nodell sought to create a superhero who wielded a variety of magical powers from a magic ring, which he regularly recharged from a green lantern. Nodell wanted a colorful and interesting costume for his character, deriving from elements of Greek mythology. As Nodell recalled in an undated, latter-day interview,\nNodell chose the name \"Alan Scott\" by flipping through New York telephone books until he got two names he liked.\n\nThe character of Alan Scott made his debut in \"All-American Comics\" #16 (July 1940), fighting crime under the masked identity of \"Green Lantern\". He also appeared as part of the superhero team Justice Society of America in \"All Star Comics\" #3 (Winter 1940). He served as the team's second chairman in #7, but departed following that issue and returned a few years later, remaining a regular character. His villains tended to be ordinary humans, but he did have a few paranormal ones, such as the immortal Vandal Savage and the zombie Solomon Grundy. Green Lantern proved popular and was given his own series, \"Green Lantern\", later that year. Most of his adventures were set in New York.\n\nIn 1941, Alan Scott was paired with a sidekick named Doiby Dickles, a rotund Brooklyn taxi driver, who would appear on a regular basis until 1949. In 1948, Alan also got a canine sidekick named Streak. The dog proved so popular that he starred in his own solo side-stories.\n\nAfter World War 2, superheroes declined in popularity. \"Green Lantern\" was cancelled in 1949 after 38 issues and \"All-American Comics\" dropped superheroes in favor of westerns. Alan Scott's final Golden Age appearance was in \"All-Star Comics\" #57 (1951). He remained out of publication for 12 years, and even after his revival he never got another solo series.\n\nIn 1959, DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz reinvented Green Lantern as a science fiction hero. The new Green Lantern, named Hal Jordan, was empowered by alien masters to serve as an interstellar lawman and had many adventures set in outer space. His powers were similar to Alan's but he was otherwise completely unrelated—Alan Scott never existed as far as the new stories were concerned. Hal Jordan proved popular, but readers still had an interest in the old Green Lantern. Some years later, Alan Scott reappeared as a guest star in \"The Flash\" #137 (1963). To avoid continuity conflicts with the Hal Jordan character, Alan Scott and all his old stories were written as being from a parallel universe. For most of the 1960s and 1970s, Alan Scott made guest appearances in books belonging to Silver Age characters, visiting their universe through magical or technological means. In 1976, he appeared regularly alongside his Justice Society comrades in the revived \"All-Star Comics\" and later \"Adventure Comics\" in stories set in the 1970s. In 1981, DC Comics launched \"All-Star Squadron\", which featured Alan Scott and the Justice Society in a World War 2 setting.\nIn 1986, the editors at DC Comics decided that all its characters should exist within the same setting and effected this change with the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" miniseries. Alan Scott now shared the same fictional world as Hal Jordan. DC Comics decided to write the character out of continuity in a one-shot book entitled \"Last Days of the Justice Society\", in which he was \"forever\" trapped in an extra-dimensional realm. The character was brought back in the 1990s due to fan interest. Rather than update Alan Scott as a contemporary young hero as had been done with Batman and Superman, Alan Scott was instead written as a veteran of World War 2 with a magically prolonged lifespan. To distinguish Alan Scott from Hal Jordan, his superhero codename was for a time changed to \"Sentinel\" and he lost his magic ring, manifesting his powers through his glowing hands instead. In \"JSA\" #50 (2003) he regained his classic codename and ring, though he remained apart from Hal Jordan's Green Lantern Corps. He was a regular character in \"JSA\" and \"Justice Society of America\".\n\nIn 2011, DC Comics again rebooted their fictional properties, and their new version of Alan Scott once again exists on Earth-2, where Hal Jordan and his Green Lantern Corps do not exist. The new Alan Scott is no longer a grizzled veteran of World War 2, but a fresh young superhero. He first appears in \"Earth 2\" #3 (2012) with a completely redesigned sleek, solid green suit with no cape.\n\nThousands of years ago, a mystical \"green flame\" fell to Earth in ancient China as a meteor. A voice in the flame predicted that it would act three times: once to bring death, once to bring life, and once to bring power. For the first prophecy, a lamp-maker crafted the green metal of the meteor into a lamp. In fear and as punishment for what they thought sacrilege, the local villagers killed him, only to be destroyed by a sudden burst of the green flame. For the second, in modern times, the lamp came into the hands of a patient of a mental institution who fashioned the lamp into a modern train lantern. The green flame restored him to sanity and gave him a new life. For the third, by 1940, after having already fulfilled the first two-thirds of this prophecy, the lantern fashioned from the meteoric metal fell into the hands of Alan Scott, a young railroad engineer. Following a railroad bridge collapse, the flame instructs Scott in how to fashion a ring from its metal, to give him fantastic powers as the superhero \"Green Lantern\". He adopts a colorful costume of red, purple, yellow, and brown. He becomes a crimefighter in his first adventure, defeating the crooks who caused the accident. He also discovers his powers' weakness to wood when he is bludgeoned with a club. Alan is a founding member of the Justice Society of America, and is its second chairman.\n\nScott uses his ring to fly, walk through solid objects by \"moving through the fourth dimension\", paralyze or blind people temporarily, hypnotize them, create rays of energy, melt metal as with a blowtorch, and cause dangerous objects to glow, among other things. It could also allow him and others to time travel. Occasionally, he uses it to read minds or create solid objects and force fields in the manner usually associated with fellow Green Lantern Hal Jordan. His ring could protect him against any object made of metal, but would not protect him against any wood- or plant-based objects.\n\nDuring the 1940s, Green Lantern seemed to alternate between serious adventure, particularly when Solomon Grundy, his nemesis, appeared and light comedy, usually involving his sidekick, Doiby Dickles. Toward the end of his Golden Age adventures, he was reduced to the role of a sidekick to Streak the Wonder Dog, a heroic canine in the mold of Rin-Tin-Tin and Lassie.\n\nIn \"All-American Comics\" #38, it's revealed his middle name is Wellington - a Napoleon defeated by a Wellington.\n\nA part of Scott's early history is filled out with retroactive continuity. \"All-Star Squadron Annual\" #3 states that the JSA fought the villain Ian Karkull, who inadvertently imbued them with life energy stolen from an innocent victim. The energy retarded their aging, allowing Scott and several other members, as well as their spouses, to remain active into the late 20th century without infirmity. The events of that incident also led Scott, who had failed to save the victim from whom the energy was stolen, to take a leave of absence from the JSA, explaining why the character vanished from the roster for a time.\n\nScott was a member of the Justice Society of America in 1951 when the team was investigated by the \"Joint Congressional Un-American Activities Committee,\" a fictional organization based on the real-life House Un-American Activities Committee. They were accused of possible communist sympathies and asked to reveal their identities. The members declined the offer, and many of the members retired in the 1950s.\n\nThe team re-forms in the 1960s with Scott as a member, though little is known of their adventures during this time, save for stories about their team-ups with the Justice League of America, the parallel world Earth-One, and cross-universe adventures Scott shares with Earth-One's Green Lantern, Hal Jordan.\n\nIt was eventually revealed that in the late 1960s that Scott marries the woman with the dual identity Rose and Thorn. The two have a pair of children who would grow up to become the superheroes Jade and Obsidian of the team Infinity, Inc..\n\nIn the 1980s, Scott married his reformed former nemesis, Molly Mayne, also known as The Harlequin, reconciling with his son and daughter.\n\nThe \"Last Days of the Justice Society of America Special\" (1986) one-shot tells how Adolf Hitler caused a massive wave of destructive energy to erupt over the post-\"Crisis\" Earth in 1945. Scott and the JSA, fresh from burying their Earth-Two comrades Robin and Huntress, enter into a limbo dimension in order to fight an eternally recurring Ragnarok.\n\n\"Green Lantern\" vol 3 #19 attempted to retcon Alan Scott's origin and power ring to accommodate the changes made by \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\". In this story, Alan's ring originally belonged to a Green Lantern named Yalan Gur, who was so favored by the Guardians of the Universe that they removed the yellow impurity from his ring (which the Guardians deliberately placed in all the GL rings to limit their power and could be removed at their discretion). However, Yalan Gur abused his power and interfered with the inhabitants of ancient China. The Guardians then substituted a weakness for wood that allowed the local peasants to successfully attack and mortally wound Yalan with simple wooden clubs. Yalan flew into the sky and raged against the Guardians. His body burned in the atmosphere, becoming the green metallic meteorite that ultimately became Alan Scott's lantern. Yalan's spirit also possessed the metal, promising death in his rage and life when he realized his mistakes (the first two prophecies of the green metal, which were fulfilled). When Alan received the lantern, the spirit directed Alan to create the power ring and persona of Green Lantern, complete with the ring's weakness to wood.\n\nThrough the machinations of Waverider, the JSA teammates are able to leave limbo and begin living in the post-Crisis Earth they had fought to save. The mini-series is followed by \"Justice Society of America\" (1992–1993), which shows how Alan Scott adjusts to his new world. In the short-lived series, the JSA fight the newest incarnation of the Ultra-Humanite as well as Pol St. Germain and Kulak the Sorcerer. Scott reconnects with his wife and children, stating in issue #1 that Molly \"is pretty much handling things at the company...\" and that Jade and Obsidian \"... are fine off doing their own thing in Hollywood. Not too interested in being super-heroes.\" The series ends with issue #10, not with the team disbanding, but with the members gathering together at their first formal meeting after returning home.\n\nAlan follows Guy Gardner and a small group of heroes to investigate a mysterious distress from Oa, only to be defeated by Hal Jordan, who now calls himself Parallax, having been driven mad after the destruction of his home, Coast City. After the confrontation, Alan discovers that an artist, Kyle Rayner, inherits the remaining Green Lantern ring. After meeting the young hero, he informs him of the situations with Jordan and the Green Lantern Corps. During the \"Zero Hour\" event, Alan witnesses the villain Extant incapacitate and kill several of his JSA teammates. After suffering defeat by the villain, Alan gives Kyle his original ring, passing the name \"Green Lantern\" to him. Alan's ring was later destroyed by Parallax.\n\nFor a time, the Starheart became part of Scott's body and he adopts the name Sentinel, becoming a founding member of a new JSA. Thanks to the rejuvenative properties of the Starheart, Scott's physical body is again temporarily revitalized so that he resembles a man in his 30s or early 40s. This drives his wife Molly, who has not been affected, to sell her soul to the demon Neron in exchange for youth. Alan enters the demonic realm, with help from entities such as the Phantom Stranger and Zatanna, and, with Kyle Rayner's aid, manages to win Molly's soul back, reuniting Molly's essence with her soulless being.\n\nHe has since been physically altered again so that he more closely resembles his true chronological age. He returns to using the name \"Green Lantern\" during the JSA's battle with Mordru. He continues to fight crime in his original costumed identity, rebuilding a ring and serving as an elder statesman to the Justice Society of America and to the superhero community in general.\n\nIn \"\", Alan and his daughter Jade, assist the surviving members of the Green Lantern Corps, Hal Jordan, who had been possessed by the ancient fear entity Parallax, John Stewart, Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, and Kilowog, in defeating the Parallax-possessed Ganthet. Alan is increasingly weakened due to Parallax's failed attempts to control him as it did with Jordan, Stewart, Gardner, and Kilowog, so it decides to kill him instead. However, Jordan, with the aid of The Spectre, breaks free from Parallax' influence, and saves Alan from the fear entity.\nDuring the Rann-Thanagar War, Kyle Rayner's power ring revealed that Scott is an honorary member of the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nDuring the \"Infinite Crisis\", Scott and his daughter Jade, along with many others, travel with Donna Troy to the center of the universe to save it from Alexander Luthor, Jr.. Though they manage to succeed in saving the universe, Jade dies on this mission. A year later, Scott is still active and relatively youthful compared to his true age, but now wears an eyepatch having lost his eye in a Zeta beam transporter accident while returning from space. Though Scott loses his daughter, he tells Kyle Rayner that he still has family both through relations and close friendships, among which he counts Kyle.\n\nWeek 4 of the \"52\" maxi-series reveals that Scott lost his left eye during a period when he and several other superheroes were declared missing approximately 11 months prior to the events of \"Checkmate\" #1. The Zeta Beam that Adam Strange had hoped to use for teleporting the heroes away from the time-space ripple caused by Alexander Luthor, Jr.'s actions was splintered by the ripple itself, mutilating the heroes in various ways.\n\nIn Week 5, Alan goes to the wife and daughter of Animal Man to tell them that Animal Man is missing in space. This gives Ellen Baker more hope that her husband is alive.\nIn Week 29, Alan, Wildcat, and Jay Garrick (Flash) are the only members of the JSA present on Thanksgiving. They talk about the other members of the JSA and about the new Infinity Inc., which is a new version of a team of which Alan's daughter, Jade, was a member.\n\nAfter being put into a comatose state during an attack by the Gentleman Ghost, Alan envisions Jade, who tells him goodbye and grants him another portion of her green energy. His missing eye is replaced by a green glowing orb that, due to its mystical origins and connection to Jade, allows him to track astral and mystical energy forms such as ghosts.\n\nDuring the missing year, Scott has joined Checkmate at the rank of White King, with his JSA teammate Mister Terrific as his Bishop. Scott soon finds himself in a moral conflict with \"Black Queen\" Sasha Bordeaux over the violent nature of Checkmate, particularly after Bordeaux and her team slaughter dozens of Kobra operatives during a raid on a facility. Bordeaux contends that the ends justify the means, while Scott adheres to the principle that heroes should not kill unless absolutely necessary. Bordeaux responds by suggesting that Scott resign. Concurrent with this internal conflict, Scott and the White Queen (Amanda Waller) try to keep the organization from being discontinued by political forces.\n\nAfter the rise of the being Gog, Alan Scott allies with the Justice Society members that oppose Gog's simplistic view of the world. However, after encountering a Justice Society from an alternate universe in which his daughter Jade is still alive, he considers asking the seemingly all powerful being to raise his daughter from the dead. Later, Sandman learns that Gog is rooting himself into the Earth, and if he remains for one more day, the Earth will no longer be able to survive without him. The rest of the JSA arrive to kill Gog by separating his head from the Earth, which is the only way to save the planet. The Society members ally with Gog in an attempt to protect him until they see him attempt to attack a Society member. All of Gog's followers, including Magog, turn on him, causing Gog's blessing on them to be undone. The JSA are able to topple Gog and send him to the Source Wall, but Alan is unable to see his daughter.\n\nIn the \"Final Crisis\" storyline, Alan led a resistance against Darkseid's forces as one of the superheroes responding to Article X. In \"Final Crisis\" #5, he is shown defending Checkmate's Switzerland HQ from the Justifiers. Though Donna Troy tries to place the Justifier helmet on him, Hawkman saves him.\n\nIn the \"Blackest Night\" crossover, Alan and the rest of the JSA battle the reanimated Kal-L and Black Lantern versions of dead Justice Society members. After Jakeem Thunder is knocked out, Alan is one of the heroes who adds his powers into a \"Black Lantern Bomb\" designed to mimic Jakeem's Thunderbolt abilities, destroying all of the Black Lanterns in New York. In the final battle of the event, his daughter Jade is resurrected by the power of white light.\n\nIn the beginning of the \"Brightest Day\" crossover event, Alan lies in the arms of Obsidian, convulsing and writhing as a green light pours from his body. His body possessed, Alan flies off with his JSA teammates in hot pursuit, eventually led the team to Germany. The JSA meet up with Batman's new Justice League and find that Jade, who had been staying on Oa since her resurrection, has returned to Earth inside a green meteor, later revealed to be the legendary Starheart that gave Alan his powers. Sebastian Faust tells the two teams that the Starheart has been gradually taking control of people on Earth for quite some time. Now that it is on Earth, it is growing more powerful and driving metahumans all over the world insane. Jade states that the Starheart captured her in space and purposely brought her to Earth to find Alan and that it is her fault that her father is now in danger. Just then, Alan awakens and his costume transforms into a suit of armor identical to the one he wears in \"Kingdom Come\", and he then tells the assembled heroes that he intends on destroying the world.\n\nStarman is sent into space to search for Alan, and finds that Alan has constructed a massive fortress on the surface of the moon. Before Starman can warn the others, Alan appears in front of him and tears his gem, the source of his abilities, from his chest, thus rendering him powerless. The Starheart uses its influence to corrupt various metahumans with magical or elemental abilities, which creates chaos across the globe. Realizing that the heroes must defeat Alan in order to end the chaos, Batman recruits Miss Martian to get a mental lock on Starman, which, in turn, provides the Justice League with Alan's location. Batman then assembles a small strikeforce consisting of himself, Jade, Hourman, Donna Troy, Jesse Quick, and Mr. America, all of whom have a low chance of being possessed by the Starheart. Mister Miracle arrives and informs the team that Alan has most likely installed Fourth World defenses in his base and offers to use his knowledge of such technology to guide them through the fortress. When they finally find him, Jade uses her powers to restore Alan to normal. With his sanity restored, Alan chooses to allow the Emerald City he created on the moon to stay, and the city becomes populated by various magical creatures from throughout the DCU.\n\nAfter the events of the \"Brightest Day\", Alan and the rest of the JSA travel to the city of Monument Point, which has been attacked by a superpowered terrorist named Scythe. Just before being defeated, Scythe snaps Alan's neck. In the subsequent story, it is revealed that Scythe is the product of Nazi genetic engineering, and that Alan and Jay had been tasked by the president with killing the experiment back when he was in infancy during World War 2. The two heroes could not agree on a course of action, and, as a result, Scythe was allowed to live. Doctor Mid-Nite discovers that the injuries Alan sustained have rendered him paralyzed, and that any attempt to heal himself could break his constant concentration, which could result in the Starheart once again regaining control of his body.\n\nJade visits her bed-ridden father in the Emerald City, and offers to use her abilities to help him walk again. Alan declines his daughter's offer, reasoning that if the Starheart were to once again take over his body, it could result in the deaths of everyone in the city. Eclipso attacks the city, which results in Jesse Quick having to get Alan to safety. After taking over Jade, Eclipso has the power of the starheart then defeats and possesses the Justice League's reserve roster, and then badly injures the angel Zauriel. With the Justice League outnumbered, Eclipso then reveals his ultimate goal is to somehow kill God. Eclipso then tortures Zauriel, causing his screams to attract the attention of the new Spectre, Crispus Allen, who he kills, absorbing the Spectre's powers upon his demise. With his newfound abilities, Eclipso reveals that God relies on the collective love of humanity in order to stay alive, and that by destroying the Earth, Eclipso will ultimately kill God once and for all. Just as the members of the JLA prepare to wage a counterattack, Eclipso destroys the moon, apparently dooming all life on Earth. With the moon destroyed, Eclipso then seemingly kills Donna Troy, the physically strongest remaining member of the Justice League. However, it is ultimately revealed that Donna's death was an illusion conjured by Saint Walker, who used his blue power ring to temporarily trap Eclipso in a state of euphoria. After the Atom and Starman break Eclipso's link to his brainwashed slaves, the combined heroes attack Eclipso together, defeating him. In the aftermath it is discovered that Jade and Obsidian can now be within proximity of each other again and their father has control of the Starheart again.\n\nLater, the JSA try to take down the villain D'arken who has broken free from imprisonment beneath Monument Point and absorbed the powers of JSA members, but D'arken is too powerful. Due to this only non-superpowered and magical members fight D'arken. The JSA tells Alan that unleashing the Starheart is the only way to destroy D'arken. However, after releasing the Starheart energies, Alan's body begins to incinerate. Afterwards, the JSA attend a funeral for Alan, whom they believe to be dead.\n\nAlan Scott wields a magical ring that can produce a variety of effects. The extent of the ring's ability has never been rigorously defined, but three consistent traits are that it allows him to fly, that its effects are accompanied by a green light, and that it cannot directly affect anything made of wood.\n\nIn Scott's first appearance, his body would glow green or be bathed in a green light whenever he used his power, such as passing through a wall or flying. During his earliest appearances, he would project a beam of green light from his ring that could do a variety of things such as move objects, melt metal, shrink objects, or put out fires. He rarely used it as an actual weapon and preferred to fight with his fists like any other pulp-adventure hero would do. The ring made him invulnerable to any weapon not made of wood.\n\nIn later appearances, he started conjuring solid objects. These objects could be of any shape and size such as: a sword to cut a rope, chains to bind a prisoner, a parachute to slow his fall, and a disembodied fist to beat his foe. But they were always pure green in color and would vanish as soon as he stopped concentrating on them. Alan controlled these objects telekinetically. These conjured objects, later referred to as \"constructs\", would become the signature power of Green Lanterns in later decades.\n\nAt the start of many stories, Alan charged his ring by touching it to a green lantern, which would give him 24 hours of power (regardless of how heavily he used it).\n\nAlan's ring cannot affect anything made of wood or plant matter. He can conjure a green shield to block bullets, but a wooden club will pass right through it effortlessly. Solomon Grundy, a zombie whose body is partially made from swamp matter, is highly resistant to Alan's powers.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, DC merged Alan Scott and Hal Jordan into a shared setting and eliminated parallel universes from the narrative. Because these two characters were unrelated, the writers altered Alan's powers to differentiate him from Hal. Alan's constructs were now wreathed in green flame, highlighting their magical (and not technological) nature. He physically merged with his lantern, meaning he no longer needed to recharge as Hal needed to. In 1995, he lost his magical ring but learned to manifest his power through his glowing hands instead (this change was reversed in \"JSA\" #50).\n\nIn the beginning, Alan's power was vaguely connected to the mystical power of the living world; \"green, as are the plants, the growing things!\". This link was re-established following The New 52, with Earth-2 Alan Scott's power source established as being the Green, which is also the source of Swamp Thing's abilities.\n\nAlan was reintroduced in issue 1 of \"Earth 2\" as the young dynamic head of GBC productions on Earth 2 (a parallel world within the DC Multiverse). On June 1, 2012, DC announced that Scott would be reimagined as a gay man. In issue 3, Scott is revealed to have a boyfriend named Sam, to whom he intends to propose while on vacation in China. Before he can do so, however, the train on which the couple is travelling is suddenly wrecked. A mysterious green flame protects Scott and heals him; a disembodied voice informs him that the crash was caused by a force that threatens the whole world, and that Sam did not survive. The grief-stricken Scott is then told that he will be given the power to avenge his love and protect the world. The flame creates a costume for him, and molds Sam's engagement ring into a power ring with which Scott can harness his power. Reborn as the Green Lantern, Scott proceeds to help the other survivors and swears vengeance for Sam. This version of Green Lantern is associated with The Green, a mystical realm/entity that connects all botanical life on Earth.\n\nIn the \"Kingdom Come\" limited series by Mark Waid and Alex Ross, Alan is the only Green Lantern on Earth. He lives in an orbital space station called New Oa from which he protects Earth from alien attacks, and has ceased to meddle in human affairs. When Superman comes out of retirement, he rejoins the Justice League to help suppress the rogue superhumans that are causing chaos throughout the world. After the crisis is resolved, he joins the United Nations as the ambassador of the sovereign nation of New Oa.\n\nAlan Scott's costume in this series was styled after the full plate armor of medieval knights. In the regular books, he has sported this armor on several occasions when he uses high amounts of power.\n\nAnother version of Alan Scott was seen briefly in \"\" as a post-WW2 agent called the Lantern whose use of his power ring was invaluable to the intelligence community for its ability to discern truth from lies. The ring and Alan's hand were destroyed by a Superman gone rogue.\n\nIn the Elseworlds tale, \"\", Alan Scott is depicted as the young leader of a gang called the Bowery Greens. He steals a magical green gem similar to Kyle Rayner's ring and later steals Kyle's lantern. In a final showdown, he fatally wounds Kyle, but is absorbed into Kyle's ring.\n\nIn the Elseworlds series \"The Golden Age\", Alan Scott finds himself under investigation from the House Un-American Activities Committee because of his refusal to turn over employees suspected of communist activities. In the final battle with Dynaman, Johnny Quick refers to him as \"the big guy\", implying that he may have been the most powerful hero of the era (although this is likely also a reference to Alan's large physical stature).\n\nIn \" 2\", an alternate version of Alan Scott is featured. This Alan Scott's ring's origin is explained as having originally been a Green Lantern ring that was lost on Earth long ago. In this storyline, the first time Alan used his ring, he was knocked out from behind by a man with a wooden club. This caused Alan to believe the ring was weak against wood, thereby causing a mental block that prevented him from truly exerting his power against wooden objects or attacks. (This was confirmed by the Guardians, who explained that this was the reason behind the weakness to yellow of the Green Lantern Corps' rings. They simply told all new Green Lanterns that their rings were powerless against yellow to establish the same mental block.)\n\nIn the final issue of \"52\", a new Multiverse is revealed, originally consisting of 52 identical realities. Among the parallel realities shown is one designated \"Earth-2\". As a result of Mister Mind \"eating\" aspects of this reality, it takes on visual aspects similar to the pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Two, including the Green Lantern among other Justice Society of America characters. The names of the characters and the team are not mentioned in the panel in which they appear, but the Green Lantern is visually similar to Alan Scott.\n\nBased on comments by Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-\"Crisis\" Earth-Two.\n\nIt has been revealed in \"Justice Society\" (vol. 3) #20 that the post-\"Crisis\" Earth-2 Alan Scott is dead as stated by his daughter Jade who encountered the New Earth Scott and was shocked to see the New Earth counterpart to her father still alive.\n\nScott is also shown as a member of the Green Lantern Marine Corps in \"\".\n\n\nGreen Lantern has a cameo in the opening credits of DC Universe animated film \"\" where he is seen being forced out of heroics by the government.\n\n\n\"Sleepers\" is a trilogy created by Mike Baron and written by Christopher J. Priest. Each volume focuses on a different Green Lantern including Alan Scott.\n\nIn 2010, Green Lantern was released in Wave 14 of Mattel's DC Universe Classics toyline.\n\n\n"

                "List of Green Lanterns\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps that appear in fictional stories published by DC Comics has at least 7200 members, two per sector (originally 3600 with one per sector), in addition to assorted other members who fulfill roles other than patrolling. Although seven characters—Alan Scott, Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, John Stewart, Simon Baz, Kyle Rayner, and Jessica Cruz—are primarily associated with the name, a number of other members of the Corps have appeared in DC's comics.\n\nThese seven characters are most closely associated with the \"Green Lantern\" name, and have been the title characters of \"Green Lantern\" comics.\n\nAlan Scott was the original Green Lantern character created in the Golden Age of comics. Alan created the mantle and identity of Green Lantern by himself and is not associated with the Green Lantern Corps, since his power ring was de-authorized by the Guardians even before his obtaining it. Prior to the Crisis Scott's ring ran on magic, and not the Central Power Battery of Oa. Today he is the modern day Green Lantern for New 52's Earth 2.\n\nHal Jordan, known as Green Lantern, is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created in 1959 by writer John Broome and artist Gil Kane, and first appeared in \"Showcase\" #22 (October 1959). Hal Jordan is a reinvention of a previous character called Green Lantern that had appeared in 1940s comic books as the character Alan Scott. Hal Jordan is a member and occasionally leader of the intergalactic police force called the Green Lantern Corps, as well as a founding member of the Justice League. He fights evil across the Universe with a ring that grants him a variety of superpowers.\n\nGuy Gardner is a comic book superhero published by DC Comics. He is a core member of the Green Lantern family of characters, and for a time (late 1980s through mid 1990s) was also a significant member of the Justice League family of characters. He was created by John Broome and Gil Kane (who patterned him after actor Martin Milner) in \"Green Lantern\" #59 (March 1968), although the character was changed significantly in the 1980s by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton who turned him into a jingoistic parody of an ultra-macho \"red-blooded American male.\" This latter remains the character's archetype to this date.\n\nJohn Stewart, known as Green Lantern, is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics and was the first African-American superhero to appear in DC Comics. The character was created by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams, and first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" vol. 2, #87 (December 1971), when artist Neal Adams came up with the idea of a substitute Green Lantern.\n\nKyle Rayner is a fictional comic book superhero appearing in books published by DC Comics, usually in those starring the Green Lantern Corps, an extraterrestrial police force of which Rayner was a member. Created by writer Ron Marz and artist Darryl Banks, Rayner first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" vol. 3, #48 (1994), as part of the \"Emerald Twilight\" storyline, in which DC Comics replaced Green Lantern Hal Jordan with Rayner, who was the sole Green Lantern for years until the late 1990s. He was DC's star Green Lantern into the mid-2000s. During this period he was also briefly known as Ion.\n\nSimon Baz is a fictional comic book superhero appearing in books published by DC Comics, usually in those starring the Green Lantern Corps, an extraterrestrial police force of which Simon is a member. Created by writer Geoff Johns and artist Doug Mahnke, Simon first appeared in 2012 following DC's 2011 company-wide relaunch as part of its Green Lantern story arc \"Rise of the Third Army\", in which Baz replaces Silver Age hero Hal Jordan as the Green Lantern of Earth's sector. Prior to this, the character made an unnamed cameo in The New 52 \"Free Comic Book Day Special Edition\" #1. At the time, Baz debuted to a positive critical reaction and over time gained a sizable fanbase. DC later added Baz to its flagship team-up title \"Justice League of America\" in 2013.\n\nJessica Cruz is a fictional comic book superhero appearing in books published by DC Comics. Created by Geoff Johns, she is a member of the Green Lantern Corps and the Justice League. Jessica Cruz appears briefly in the 2013 issue of \"Green Lantern\" #20 (July 2013) but does not makes her official debut until the last pages of \"Justice League\" vol. 2 #30, when the Ring of Volthoom locates her. She was dubbed \"Power Ring\" while she was host to the Ring of Volthoom but is not a member of the Crime Syndicate of America. Cruz becomes an official member of the Green Lantern Corps at the end of \"The Darkseid War\" storyline.\n\nWith the exception of Yalan Gur, these characters have also served as the Green Lantern for Sector 2814 (which includes Mars).\n\nYalan Gur is a Green Lantern introduced as part of an effort to reconcile the Golden Age Green Lantern's origin with the later introduction of the Green Lantern Corps. He is a red-scaled, reptilian humanoid, assigned to sector 2814 (Earth's sector) in the 10th century. He first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 3) #19 (December 1991).\n\nWhile Alan Scott, along with the rest of the Justice Society of America, is trapped in Limbo, his mystic lantern sends a projection to Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, and John Stewart (the Green Lanterns of Earth at the time). After tracing the projection to Scott's home, the lantern tells the story of its origin (effectively retconning the origin of Alan Scott's power).\n\nIn the lantern's story, Yalan Gur was once one of the greatest of the Green Lantern Corps, and, in the 10th century by Earth reckoning, the Guardians of the Universe chose to remove the customary weakness to the color yellow from his power ring. Without this limitation, however, he was corrupted by his power, and he came to Earth and enslaved the people of China. The Guardians of the Universe thwarted Yalan by adding a new weakness of wood to his ring, which allowed the club-wielding villagers to overwhelm their oppressor and mortally wound him. The dying Yalan Gur fled into Earth's upper atmosphere, where he merged with his lantern-shaped power battery as he died. His lantern then collided with a fragment of the Starheart and was merged with its magical essence, turning into the Green Flame that becomes the source of Alan Scott's power. The retcon involving the true reason behind the yellow impurity may mean these events have been retconned out of existence. In the film \"Justice League\" there is a character who has resemblance to him, but it is not clear whether it is Yalan Gur or not.\n\nJong Li is a Green Lantern introduced in \"Green Lantern, Dragon Lord\" #1 (June 2001), written by Doug Moench and drawn by Paul Gulacy.

He was taught to renounce all earthly possessions and to live a life of peace and discipline, but then one day a concubine named Jade Moon came to him in his temple, begging for help in trying to escape her bonds. Jong Li tried to help her but failed, and his temple and fellow monks were ravaged by the emperor's troops and their commander. Jong Li later encountered a representative of the Guardians of the Universe who gave him a power ring and a Lantern to \"Oppose Evil, Ease Suffering and Protect the Innocent.\" Jong Li later rescued Jade and learned of Lung Mountain, where the last Dragon Lords supposedly lived. He set out to seek their higher authority and with their Blessing of Fire became the last Dragon Lord of the Earth, finally defeating the evil emperor's forces and saving his people.\n\nLaham of Scylla is introduced in \"Green Lantern Corps Quarterly\" #2 (Autumn 1992).

Hannu is among several Lanterns called to defend Oa from the then renegade Hal Jordan. Jordan made short work of him and added his power to his own and left him for dead. He was later found alive on Biot. He is from Ovacron 6 and on his world it is considered disgraceful and dishonorable to use weapons. He is never seen using his ring in battle (except for life support and travel), preferring his brute strength and fists instead (which prompted Kyle and John to summon him for aid when up against Alpha Lantern Boodikka while under the control of the Cyborg Superman, reasoning that her draining Hannu's ring wouldn't matter as he didn't use it). He finally activates his ring in battle against the Anti-Monitor. Sector 2 is also the home sector of the Reach, creators of the Blue Beetle scarab and sworn enemies of the Guardians. According to their treaty with the Guardians no Green Lantern is allowed in Sector 2 as long as the Reach stays within pre-treaty boundaries.

Her instructor turns out to be Ke'Haan of Varva: Kilowog's second in command, known for his tough as nails training. Eager to please and finding a kindred spirit of honor within her teacher, she becomes his prized pupil.\n\nTo complete her training, Laira is sent to the city of X'ol on her home planet, where she must confront her father, who is not actually dead.\nShe is later discovered by a reformed Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner being held captive by the Manhunters with the other \"Lost Lanterns\" including Kreon and Tomar-Tu. With the help of Jordan and Gardner, the Lost Lanterns put an end to the Manhunter planet of Biot and return to Oa. She then resumes her duties as Green Lantern of her sector.\nDuring the \"Sinestro Corps War\" event, Laira and the Lost Lanterns come to Hal Jordan's aid on Qward. The group splits up, with Laira, Ke'Haan and Boodikka searching for Ion, and Hal, Graf Toren, and Tomar-Tu looking for John Stewart and Guy Gardner. Laira's group encounters the Anti-Monitor, who kills Ke'Haan in an instant, but they are able to recover Ion and return to Oa.\n\nAfter preventing the invasion of Coast City by the Sinestro Corps, Laira visits the Crypt of the Green Lanterns to mourn Ke'Haan's death. Hannu reveals their attraction to one another to Boodikka, but explains that (before his death) Ke'Haan refuses Laira because he has a family on his home planet. Laira and the Lost Lanterns set out to his homeworld to deliver news of his death, only to find that his family has been murdered by Sinestro Corps member Amon Sur. The killer willingly submits to the Lanterns, so that news of his actions will spread. Enraged by this, Laira kills Amon. Afterwards, Laira is held in custody on Oa, while the Lanterns who had seen her crime testify against her. She is placed in the custody of the newly founded Alpha Lanterns, and tried by the Guardians, who find her guilty and strip her of her power ring.\n\nAfter her trial, Laira is arranged to be transported back to her homeworld, Jayd, by Hannu. However, a red power ring attacks their ship and chooses Laira as its bearer; making her the second Red Lantern. Under the influence of the red light, Laira's personality degenerates to the point where she is little more than a snarling beast; obsessed with revenge against Sinestro and showing no recognition when confronted by Hal Jordan and John Stewart. During a skirmish on the prison planet Ysmault with multiple Lanterns, Hal managed to reach Laira who was able to see past her rage, and regained some control even asking Jordan for help, but she is nevertheless killed by Sinestro. Learning of her demise, the Guardians view her as dying in disgrace as a Red Lantern and renegade despite Jordan's protests.\n\nFollowing the rise of Nekron and the Black Lantern Corps a Black Lantern Ring attached itself to Laira's corpse and she was revived as a Black Lantern. After Nekron's defeat at the hands Hal Jordan and his newly formed White Lantern Corps, Laira's ring was destroyed reverting her to a corpse.\n\nLaira's trial is referred to in The New 52, in \"Green Lantern Corps\" #9.\n\nLaira is featured in the 2011 anthology film, \"\" voiced by Kelly Hu.\n\nThe Green Lantern of Sector 3453, she first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" vol. 4, #12 (July 2006) in a story written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Ivan Reis.

Varix states that his people live to obey the law, and there has not been a murder on his planet for over 74 years (however, murderers on his world cannot be sentenced to more than two years of imprisonment). His dedication to justice came to a head when the Alpha Lanterns attempted to execute John Stewart when he killed another Green Lantern while the two were being held captive by enemies of the Corps and the other Lantern was about to reveal crucial information. Recognising that John's actions had been committed for the right reasons even if they were questionable on the surface, Varix assisted the Green Lanterns in destroying the other Alpha Lanterns before he destroyed himself.\n\nDuring the rise of the First Lantern, 10 billion years ago, before the creation of the Manhunters and the Green Lantern Corps per se, Rami, the most brilliant of the Guardians of the Universe and Volthoom's closest friend, created seven Green Power Rings to seek out worthy wielders using the Great Heart for guidance.

The first seven Green Lanterns are as follow:\n\nAlitha of Galatica was an Old God warrior from the Third World, the world that pre-dates the Fourth World with Mister Miracle and Darkseid and Orion.

Their ship came into contact with an unknown star type \"purple sun\" that immobilized the ship and destroyed their communication systems. The group barely managed to escape to the nearest planet which was a hellish wasteland but nevertheless was clamed in the name of their planet. When a sandstorm reach the group, Jan-Al decision on staying on the ground instead of seeking shelter inside the arc not only proved courageous but also alters her future and of her explorer group when they noticed that the storm destroyed the arc which puts her in the path of becoming one of the original Green Lanterns. She is also the first to learn about the instability of these power rings when her willpower exceeds 2000% which essentially overcharged her ring and killed her.\n\nCalleen of Alstair was the first sentient element plant born on the dead planet Alstair, long consumed with fire from heavens.

Each time he is destroyed, the ring reanimates his body. When Sinestro was executed and all of the Green Lantern rings lost their power, Driq collapsed into a final death. During the Blackest Night, Driq was revived as a half Black Lantern, with the right side of his body unaffected with ring intact.

He trained new recruits brutally, but only so they would be strong enough to survive as Lanterns. He was killed during a surprise attack on a group of Lanterns. It was from Ermey that Kilowog picked up the term \"Poozer\" which means \"Useless Rookie\". Ermey's name (and physical appearance) is a reference to the actor R. Lee Ermey, who has portrayed Drill Sergeants/figures of military authority in films such as \"Full Metal Jacket\".\n\nErmey is later resurrected as a Black Lantern, with a more militaristic costume (and using his ring to create a black energy construct of a ceremonial sabre), in a gamble to stir powerful emotions in Kilowog by berating and abusing him for having once saved Sinestro's life and for having failed to train the now dead rookies.

The Darkstars were soon needed to fight once more, this time against the threat of Hyathis. The would-be Empress of Rann used mind control to pit the Zaredians against the Darkstars, creating a diversion while she kidnapped Aleea, the daughter of Adam Strange. Hyathis might have succeeded but for the arrival of Superboy and the Ravers who helped to crush her plans. \n\nGalius Zed was killed by the warrior Fatality who had been cutting down every Green Lantern she came across in revenge for John Stewart's failure to prevent the destruction of her home planet Xanshi.

However, the first Mongul discovered the plants and used them to spread his evil, even mutating some of the Black Mercys into giving their victims suffering. Mother Mercy, however, kept her sentience hidden from Mongul. Her abilities to both ease and create fear gave her both a Green Lantern Corps ring and a Sinestro Corps ring to choose from. The Green Lantern ring, which she ultimately chose, came from the recently deceased Bzzd. Mother Mercy first appeared in \"Green Lantern Corps\" (vol. 2) #24 (July 2008).\n\nNaut Ke Loi first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" #9 (Dec 1961), and was created by John Broome and Gil Kane.

Despite the absolute darkness of the Deeps, Katma's power ring led her unerringly to a completely fearless and honest resident of the Deeps: Rot Lop Fan. However, as Rot Lop Fan's species had evolved in darkness, they had no concept of light and color, and thus Katma Tui was unable to explain how the power ring worked (it projects solid rays of light manifested by the bearer's will power).\n\nRealizing that his species operates by hearing, Katma coaches him to create a hand bell with the ring, and describes the Green Lantern Corps as the \"F-Sharp Bell Corps\" — \"F-Sharp\" being a reassuring note for Rot Lop Fan's race in the same manner that green is a reassuring color, and the ring's powers in terms of sound instead of light. She also composes a new oath for him to recite:\n\nHaving solved this dilemma, Katma leaves Rot Lop Fan to protect his people, not mentioning the ring's weakness to yellow as the colourless space made it relatively pointless; although, she privately notes that in some ways, Rot Lop Fan cannot be counted as a member of the \"Green Lantern\" Corps as he has truthfully never heard of them.\n\nRot Lop Fan later appears in several group scenes, including in the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" storyline when the Guardians of the Universe depart this plane of existence with the Zamarons, at the trial of Sinestro, on page 3 of the bar scene in Green Lantern #56 (volume 3/Nov 94) and in a group of ex-Green Lanterns freed from slavers by Warrior.\n\nRot Lop Fan has apparently been reinstated as a Green Lantern after the rebirth of the Corps.

He later encounters Ash, who was also sent to find the Anti-Monitor, and the two decide to join forces. As they continue their journey, the voices of the dead grow so loud that they rupture Saarek's eardrums, deafening him. The two find the Black Lantern Power Battery, only to awaken the dormant power of the battery itself as two giant hands rise up from the ground and chase them, seeking flesh. He and Ash do not survive the conflict and are later seen as Black Lanterns at Scar's side on Ryut.\n\nSector 3399; First appeared in \"Green Lantern Corps Quarterly\" #1.\n\nSector 48.

After Brin's retirement, the Guardians select T-Cher as his replacement.\n\nLittle is known about Thulka Re save for the fact that he patrolled Sector 423. During a mission to the recently decimated world of Talcyion Omega, Thulka and his fellow Corpsmen were attacked by an army of powerful snakes known as the Silver Serpents. Thulka sacrificed his life in order to buy his companions time to escape, and was ultimately killed and consumed by the reptiles. His first and only appearance was in \"Wonder Woman\" (vol. 3) #42.\n\nTorquemada is a powerful sorcerer as well as a Green Lantern. He first appeared in \"Green Lantern Corps Quarterly\" #4 (Spring 1993).\n\nIn the \"Origins and Omens\" back-up story in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 4) #38 (March 2009), Torquemada is shown in manacles standing in front of the Guardians next to the sorcerer Mordru and Green Lantern Alan Scott, their fingers stretched out in accusation.\n\nIn \"\" #5 (September 2009), Torquemada and Alan Scott are shown imprisoned in a wall on the Sorcerers World in the 31st Century.\n\nThe Green Lantern of Sector 918, Tuebeen's sole appearance is in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 2) #155 (August 1982).\n\nVath Sarn first appeared in DC Comics' \"\" #1 (November 2005), and was created by writers Geoff Johns and Dave Gibbons, and artist Patrick Gleason. The character is from the planet Rann, initially depicted as a veteran soldier of the Rann-Thanagar War, resulting in some tensions between him and his sector partner Isamot Kol, a soldier from Thanagar who was nevertheless more willing to look past their old conflict than Sarn. However, over time, the two move past their war history and become friends; when Sarn loses his legs during the Black Lantern Corps' assault on Oa, Kol actually has his own legs surgically transplanted onto Sarn, reasoning that his physiology will allow him to re-grow his lost limbs and wanting to give his friend the chance to continue his service in the Corps. Later, Vath is part of a small group of Lanterns who, by recruitment and circumstance, assist in taking down the original Guardians, who had gone mad with power.\n\nSector 2812; First appeared in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 4) #6 (January 2006).

At first humbled by his failure, Wissen is persuaded to remain on Veltre to continue to act as its protector.\n\nXax of Xaos is a grasshopper-like alien from a planet ruled by insects. He first appeared in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 2) #9 and becomes one of Hal Jordan's good friends in the Corps. He was slain during a battle on the moon of Qward during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. Another grasshopper shaped Lantern named Xax is later slain and worn as an earring by Lady Styx. It's interesting to note that in his first appearance Xax does not use a ring but a variation called a \"power device\" built into the insignia of his costume. Recharging it requires pressing the lantern shaped battery to his chest. All subsequent appearances show him wearing a ring. Xax appears in several scenes in both animated films, \"First Flight\" and \"Emerald Knights\".\n\nZale of Bellatrix was Boodikka's replacement on the Bellatrix Bombers, and the next of her kind judged worthy by the Guardians to wield a GL ring. She first appeared in \"Green Lantern Corps\" #21. As a rookie Lantern who kept ignoring her call to duty, Zale was brought under investigation by her former sister Boodikka, now an Alpha-Lantern. After a lengthy confrontation, it was revealed that it was the Bombers who kept Zale from fulfilling her duties, by deceiving her into thinking she was needed with them. The Guardians punished Zale by making her Boodikka's sector partner and removing her power battery, making her dependent on Boodikka for recharges.\n\nSector 3599; First appeared in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 2) #190 (July 1985). Zqhithii is a snake-like alien that helped fellow Green Lantern Xax fight off the Spider Guild invasion of Xaox.\n\nAppearing in the animated film \"Green Lantern: Emerald Knights\" in the segment \"The First Lantern\", a former scribe for the Guardians and one of the first four chosen Green Lanterns, when the Corps was formed. He was the first to discover the natural ability of the green light to create constructs, as it is the manifestation of willpower. Because of this he is considered the very first Green Lantern. And the knowledge of his discovery was passed down to every newly recruited Green Lantern during the ages until today.\n\nAppearing in the animated film \"Green Lantern: Emerald Knights\" in the segment \"The First Lantern\", a blue-skinned humanoid female alien, also one of the first four chosen Green Lanterns. She died in battle against a massive army, as she hadn't discovered yet how to use the full power of her ring by means of her willpower. In the film, she is the first Green Lantern to die in the line of duty.\n\nIn the Elseworlds title \"In Darkest Knight\", Bruce Wayne succeeded Abin Sur as Green Lantern of Sector 2814.

She is remembered by Ganthet as a brave and gallant Green Lantern.\n\nAlthough not \"official\" members of the Green Lantern Corps, four teenagers — Frankie (male), Kelly (female), Jaclyn (female), and Samosa (male) — are given simplified Green Lantern rings by John Stewart after their homes are abducted to Oa by the Mad Guardian in \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 3) (1992) and \"\" (1992–1993)..\n\nAble to create simple objects, translate languages, synthesize atmosphere, and empower flight, these rings enabled the youngsters to explore Oa in the hopes that their youthful ways of looking at the Mosaic (and the other beings trapped there) would help ease relations between the Earthlings and other races.\n\nHaving a moderate degree of success, the four helped where they could until the Mosaic was torn apart when dozens of space fleets appeared over Oa, each planet determined to bring their people home.\n\nPresumably the four are back on Earth readjusting to a \"normal\" life. At this time, it is unknown how the destruction of the Central Power Battery and subsequent reconstruction by Ion/Kyle Rayner affected the teenagers' rings. It is possible they still exist and can be recharged if given access to a Lantern.\n\nAnother Teen Lantern, unrelated to the others and out-of-continuity is Jordana Gardner, future descendant of Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner, called in such way due to her early recruitment into the Green Lantern Corps of the alternate future detailed in \"Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes in the 31st Century\".\n\nAppearing in the opening minutes of the \"\" episode \"Beware my Power,\" M'ten was the Green Lantern of an unknown sector who was assigned to Frontier Space. After being ambushed and murdered by Zilius Zox of the Red Lantern Corps, M'ten's ring returned to Oa, setting the events of the series in motion.\n\nAppearing in the \"\" episode \"Beware My Power,\" Shyir Rev was a Green Lantern assigned to Frontier Space.

Shyir ultimately ended up sacrificing his life to save his home world from a massive bomb planted by the Red Lanterns, and was honored by his comrades.\n\nAppearing in the \"\" episode \"Heir Apparent,\" Dulok was a Green Lantern from the planet of Betrassus. Dulok had planned to join a band of Green Lanterns tasked with fighting off the Red Lantern Corps, but was murdered by Ragnar, the planet's crown prince. After Dulok's death, his ring passed to Iolande, the young queen of Betrassus.\n\nProbert was a mercenary who met up with a few Lanterns and conversed with Guy Gardner at the scene of a huge spaceborne battle. A few of the newer Lanterns pointed out that Probert had once been a Lantern and was described to Guy as having been \"worse than you.\"\n\nKai-Ro is Green Lantern in the future DC animated universe voiced by Lauren Tom, first appearing in the \"Batman Beyond\" two-part episode \"The Call\" (2000). An eight-year-old child mature beyond his age, Kai-Ro possesses the standard Green Lantern power ring and assists Terry McGinnis, the Batman of the future, in finding a supposed traitor within the ranks of the Justice League Unlimited.\n\nKai-Ro later appears as a young adult in the 2005 \"Justice League Unlimited\" episode \"Epilogue\" in Terry's daydream. Still a member of the future \"JLU\", he defeats a group of supervillains with McGinnis' help and pleads with McGinnis to stay with the team despite the Batman's growing animosity and disillusion upon the discovery of his true origins.\n\nA two-issue story in the \"Batman Beyond\" comic reveals that Kai-Ro had been raised in a Buddhist monastery prior to receiving the ring. In this story he returns there to battle Black Light, a character with a black power ring, somewhat similar to Sinestro. The story mentions that Kai-Ro's ring had no yellow weakness.\n\nA character named Kairo is Green Lantern's alien sidekick in the 1967 Filmation animated series \"The Superman/Aquaman Hour of Adventure\".\n\nIssue #3 of the miniseries \"Flash and Green Lantern: The Brave and the Bold\" (December 2000) has Flash, Kid Flash, and Green Lantern in pursuit of Mirror Master and Black Hand. The villains attempt to steal Flash's speed but Kid Flash loses his powers instead. Green Lantern creates a temporary power ring for Wally to use, dubbing him Kid Lantern. Wally's Lantern costume is palette swap of his Kid Flash costume, with black pants, green top/boots, white gloves, and a Green Lantern insignia in place of his lightning insignia.\n\nIn episode #9 (\"The Green Loontern\") of the 2003 \"Duck Dodgers\" animated series, Duck Dodgers claims his laundry at the dry-cleaners, but mistakenly takes a Green Lantern uniform instead of his usual outfit.\n\nAfter discovering that with the aid of his power ring he can fly, he has a few mishaps involving flight (including a confrontation with a dog while trying to romance a girl in a \"Romeo and Juliet\" spoof), before he is summoned to Oa: in a memorable scene, he zooms uncontrollably through outer space, dragged by the power of his ring.\n\nThe entire Green Lantern Corps is kidnapped by Sinestro; as a last resort, Duck Dodgers is dispatched by the Guardians to save the Corps. Through various flukes, he manages to do so, before Hal Jordan returns (dressed in Dodgers' normal spacesuit) to demand the return of his ring and uniform. The lanterns then flew off, unintentionally leaving Duck Dodgers behind.\n\nWhile asked by Kilowog to recite the Green Lantern power oath at the Corps Central Battery, a flustered Dodgers gabbles a random rhyme in desperation:\n\nThis episode made use of discarded character concepts for a proposed Green Lantern Corps animated series. The series would have focused on the adventures of Kyle Rayner with a slightly comical version of the Corps. The episode included the first animated versions of Guy Gardner, Ch'p, and Boodikka.\n\nA Green Guardsman is featured on the \"Justice League\" animated series' season one two-part episode \"Legends\" (2002) as an homage to the original Alan Scott. He appears as a Justice Guild of America member on an alternate Earth that had been devastated by nuclear war, but reconstructed as a vast mental illusion by a psychic, Ray Thompson. This is a reference to the pre-\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\" crossovers between DC Comics' Multiverse (which began in September 1961 \"Flash of Two Worlds\"). To mirror the Golden Age Green Lantern ring's vulnerability to wood, the Green Guardsman's ring has no power over aluminum. However, the Green Guardsman proves to be a loyal superhero of a bygone era, and willingly sacrifices himself to defend the Earth he protects.\n\nSonya Blade's ending in the video game \"Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe\" depicts her becoming the Green Lantern of Earthrealm after finding the ring of an unnamed Corps member who died offscreen during the game's Story Mode.\n\nPower Ring is the name of several DC Comics supervillains — counterparts of Green Lanterns Hal Jordan, Kyle Rayner, and John Stewart.

He is a combination of Marvel Comics' Iron Man and DC Comics' Green Lantern. Iron Lantern was created by writer Kurt Busiek.\n\nIron Lantern's origin is revealed in \"Iron Lantern\" #1. Hal Stark is the millionaire owner of Stark Aviation. While working on a prototype flight simulator, Stark is pulled to the site of a space ship by a beam of green energy. The simulator crashes, badly injuring Stark. The spaceship contains the corpse of an alien named Rhomann Sur (an amalgamation of Marvel's Rhomann Dey and DC's Abin Sur). Stark is able to use parts of the spaceship to build a superpowered suit of armor (powered by Sur's lantern) to keep himself alive. Stark then defeats the aliens responsible for Sur's death, and decides to fight evil as Iron Lantern.\n\nIron Lantern's other foes include Madame Sapphire (Pepper Ferris — Marvel's Madame Masque and DC's Star Sapphire), H.E.C.T.O.R. (Marvel's MODOK and DC's Hector Hammond), Oa the Living Planet (Ego the Living Planet mixed with Oa, the home planet of the Guardians of the Universe), and Mandarinestro (Marvel's Mandarin and DC's Sinestro).\n\nKyle O'Brien / Green Guardsman is an Amalgam Comics superhero whose true debut was in \"Iron Lantern\" #1, though his first (metafictional) appearance in the Amalgam universe was \"Showcase of Suspense\" #84, in a story entitled \"The Other Iron Lantern\". He was an amalgamation of Kevin O'Brien, the Guardsman, and Kyle Rayner, the then current Green Lantern.\n\nBased off Jennifer-Lynn Hayden, Jade Yifei is the Green Lantern of Sector 2814 in the \"Ame-Comi\" universe. A teenager from China, she was chosen as the first Green Lantern of Earth in this continuity rather than Hal Jordan.\n\nDoctor Spectrum is the name of five different fictional comic book characters in the Marvel Comics multiverse. There have been five versions of the character to date — three supervillains from the mainstream Marvel Universe belonging to the team Squadron Sinister (Earth-616) and two heroes from different alternate universes. The two heroes each belong to a version of the team Squadron Supreme (the Squadron Supreme of Earth-712 and the Squadron Supreme of Earth-31916, respectively).\n\nAfter long experimentation the Guardians equipped and loosely oversaw the Green Lantern Corps, over 7200 diverse beings from throughout the universe. Each was granted a battery and a ring. Thinly scattered among uncounted trillions of stars, each was assigned a sector of space which was vaster than anyone can comprehend.\n\nThe sectors are shaped as four-sided pyramid-shaped sections of a sphere, with their point meeting at Oa, which is located at the center of the universe. Oa is technically in each Lantern's sector, and while on Oa, the Lantern is still in his home sector\n\nThere are 3600 standard space sectors, plus three \"special\" sectors: 0 (Oa itself), -1 (Anti-matter universe), and 3601 (proscribed sector of space populated by the Manhunters).\n\n\n",
                "Green Lantern\n\nGreen Lantern is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. They fight evil with the aid of rings that grant them a variety of extraordinary powers.\n\nThe first Green Lantern character, Alan Scott, was created in 1940 by Martin Nodell during the initial popularity of superheroes. Alan Scott usually fought common criminals in New York City with the aid of his magic ring.\n\nThe Green Lanterns are among DC Comics' longer lasting sets of characters. They have been adapted to television, video games, and motion pictures.\n\nMartin Nodell (using the name Mart Dellon) created the first Green Lantern. He first appeared in the Golden Age of comic books in \"All-American Comics\" #16 (July 1940), published by All-American Publications, one of three companies that would eventually merge to form DC Comics.\n\nThis Green Lantern's real name was Alan Scott, a railroad engineer who, after a railway crash, came into possession of a magic lantern which spoke to him and said it would bring power. From this, he crafted a magic ring which gave him a wide variety of powers. The limitations of the ring were that it had to be \"charged\" every 24 hours by touching it to the lantern for a time, and that it could not directly affect objects made of wood. Alan Scott fought mostly ordinary human villains, but he did have a few paranormal ones such as the immortal Vandal Savage and the zombie Solomon Grundy. Most stories took place in New York.\n\nAs a popular character in the 1940s, the Green Lantern featured both in anthology books such as \"All-American Comics\" and \"Comic Cavalcade\", as well as his own book, \"Green Lantern\". He also appeared in \"All Star Comics\" as a member of the superhero team known as the Justice Society of America.\n\nAfter World War II the popularity of superheroes in general declined. The \"Green Lantern\" comic book was cancelled with issue #38 (May–June 1949), and \"All Star Comics\" #57 (1951) was the character's last Golden Age appearance. When superheroes came back in fashion in later decades, the character Alan Scott was revived, but he was forever marginalized by the new Hal Jordan character who had been created to supplant him (see below). Initially, he made guest appearances in other superheroes' books, but eventually got regular roles in books featuring the Justice Society. He never got another solo series. Between 1995 and 2003, DC Comics changed Alan Scott's superhero codename to \"Sentinel\" in order to distinguish him from the newer and more popular science fiction Green Lanterns.\n\nIn 2011, the Alan Scott character was revamped. His costume was redesigned and the source of his powers was changed to that of the mystical power of nature (referred to in the stories as \"the Green\").\n\nIn 1959, Julius Schwartz reinvented the Green Lantern character as a science fiction hero named Hal Jordan. Hal Jordan's powers were more or less the same as Alan Scott's, but otherwise this character was completely different than the Green Lantern character of the 1940s. He had a new name, a redesigned costume, and a rewritten origin story. Hal Jordan received his ring from a dying alien and was commissioned as an officer of the Green Lantern Corps, an interstellar law enforcement agency overseen by the Guardians of the Universe.\n\nHal Jordan was introduced in \"Showcase\" #22 (September–October 1959). Gil Kane and Sid Greene were the art team most notable on the title in its early years, along with writer John Broome.\n\nWith issue #76 (April 1970), the series made a radical stylistic departure. Editor Schwartz, in one of the company's earliest efforts to provide more than fantasy, worked with the writer-artist team of Denny O'Neil and Neal Adams to spark new interest in the comic book series and address a perceived need for social relevance. They added the character Green Arrow (with the cover, but not the official name, retitled \"Green Lantern Co-Starring Green Arrow\") and had the pair travel through America encountering \"real world\" issues, to which they reacted in different ways — Green Lantern as fundamentally a lawman, Green Arrow as a liberal iconoclast. Additionally during this run, the groundbreaking \"Snowbirds Don't Fly\" story was published (issues #85 and #86) in which Green Arrow's teen sidekick Speedy (the later grown-up hero Red Arrow) developed a heroin addiction that he was forcibly made to quit. The stories were critically acclaimed, with publications such as \"The New York Times\", \"The Wall Street Journal\", and \"Newsweek\" citing it as an example of how comic books were \"growing up\". However, the O'Neil/Adams run was not a commercial success, and the series was cancelled after only 14 issues, though an additional unpublished three installments were finally published as backups in \"The Flash\" #217-219.\n\nThe title would know a number of revivals and cancellations. Its title would change to \"Green Lantern Corps\" at one point as the popularity rose and waned. During a time there were two regular titles, each with a Green Lantern, and a third member in the Justice League. A new character, Kyle Rayner, was created to become the feature while Hal Jordan first became the villain Parallax, then died and came back as the Spectre.\n\nIn the wake of \"\", writer Geoff Johns returned Hal Jordan as Green Lantern in \"\" (2004–05). Johns began to lay groundwork for \"Blackest Night\" (released July 13, 2010), viewing it as the third part of the trilogy started by \"Rebirth\". Expanding on the Green Lantern mythology in the second part, \"Sinestro Corps War\" (2007), Johns, with artist Ethan van Sciver, found wide critical acclaim and commercial success with the series, which promised the introduction of a spectrum of colored \"lanterns\".\n\nThe series and its creators have received several awards over the years, including the 1961 Alley Award for Best Adventure Hero/Heroine with Own Book and the Academy of Comic Book Arts Shazam Award for Best Continuing Feature in 1970, for Best Individual Story (\"No Evil Shall Escape My Sight\", \"Green Lantern\" vol. 2, #76, by Dennis O'Neil and Neal Adams), and in 1971 for Best Individual Story (\"Snowbirds Don't Fly\", \"Green Lantern\" vol. 2, #85 by O'Neil and Adams).\n\nWriter O'Neil received the Shazam Award for Best Writer (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on \"Green Lantern\", \"Batman\", \"Superman\", and other titles, while artist Adams received the Shazam for Best Artist (Dramatic Division) in 1970 for his work on \"Green Lantern\" and \"Batman\". Inker Dick Giordano received the Shazam Award for Best Inker (Dramatic Division) for his work on \"Green Lantern\" and other titles.\n\nIn Judd Winick's first regular writing assignment on Green Lantern, he wrote a storyline in which an assistant of Kyle Rayner's emerged as a gay character in Green Lantern #137 (June 2001). In Green Lantern #154 (November 2001) the story entitled \"Hate Crime\" gained media recognition when Terry was brutally beaten in a homophobic attack. Winick was interviewed on Phil Donahue's show on MSNBC for that storyline on August 15, 2002 and received two GLAAD Media Awards for his Green Lantern work.\n\nIn May 2011, \"Green Lantern\" placed 7th on IGN's Top 100 Comic Book Heroes of All Time.\n\nAlan Scott's Green Lantern history originally began thousands of years ago when a mystical \"green flame\" meteor fell to Earth in ancient China. The voice of the flame prophesied that it would act three times: once to bring death (a lamp-maker named Luke Fairclough crafted the green metal of the meteor into a lamp; in fear and as punishment for what they thought sacrilege, the local villagers killed him, only to be destroyed by a sudden burst of the green flame), once to bring life (in modern times, the lamp came into the hands of a patient in a mental institution who fashioned the lamp into a modern lantern; the green flame restored him to sanity and gave him a new life), and once to bring power. By 1940, the lantern passed into the possession of Alan Scott, a young engineer. Following a railroad-bridge collapse of which he was the only survivor, the flame instructed Scott how to fashion a ring from its metal to give him fantastic powers as the superhero Green Lantern. He adopted a colorful costume and became a crime-fighter. Alan was a founding member of the Justice Society of America.\n\nAfter the Crisis on Infinite Earths (although the original origin story was still in continuity), a later \"Tales of the Green Lantern Corps\" story was published that brought Scott even closer to the Corps' ranks, when it was revealed that Alan Scott was predated as Earth's Green Lantern by a Green Lantern named Yalan Gur, a resident of China. Not only had the Corps' now-familiar green, black and white uniform motif not yet been adopted, but Yalan Gur altered the basic red uniform to more closely resemble the style of clothing worn by his countrymen. Power ultimately corrupted this early Green Lantern, as he attempted to rule over mankind, which forced the Guardians to cause his ring to manifest a weakness to wood, the material from which most Earth weapons of the time were fashioned. This allowed the Chinese peasants to ultimately defeat their corrupted \"champion\". His ring and lantern were burned and it was during this process that the “intelligence” inhabiting the ring and the lantern and linking them to the Guardians was damaged. Over time, when it had occasion to manifest itself, this \"intelligence\" became known as the mystical 'Starheart' of fable. But that was long gone. He later fought Superman which gave him superhuman powers. Then Deathstroke killed him and ruled the world.\n\nCenturies later, it was explained, when Scott found the mystical lantern, it had no memory of its true origins, save a vague recollection of the uniform of its last master. This was the origin of Scott’s distinctive costume. Due to its damaged link to them, the Guardians presumed the ring and lantern to be lost in whatever cataclysm overcame their last owner of record, thus Scott was never noticed by the Guardians and went on to carve a history of his own apart from that of the Corps, sporting a ring with an artificially induced weakness against anything made of wood. Honoring this separate history, the Guardians never moved to force Scott to relinquish the ring, formally join the Corps, or adopt its colors. Some sort of link between Scott and the Corps, however, was hinted at in a Silver Age crossover story which depicts Scott and Hal Jordan charging their rings at the same Power Battery while both reciting the \"Brightest Day\" oath. During the Rann-Thanagar War, it was revealed that Scott is an honorary member of the Corps.\n\nOn June 1, 2012, DC Comics announced that it would be introducing an alternate version of Alan Scott as a gay man in the title \"Earth 2.\" The New 52 issue was released on June 6, 2012. In its story, Alan Scott and his partner Sam were both passengers aboard a train, but the latter was killed when their train was wrecked in the railroad-bridge collapse that Scott alone survived; a magical green flame found Alan amongst the rubble. Telling him he is to become an avatar of the flame's great power and that he must channel this power through an item of importance to his heart, Alan chooses the engagement ring he was to give his boyfriend, becoming Green Lantern. This alternate version is not a member of the Green Lantern Corps, which doesn't exist in Earth 2, but rather adopts the name Green Lantern for himself, for his powers derives his mystical powers from the Green, the elemental force which connects plant life on Earth.\n\nThe character of Harold \"Hal\" Jordan was a second-generation test pilot, having followed in the footsteps of his father. He was given the power ring and battery (lantern) by a dying alien named Abin Sur, whose spaceship crashed on Earth. Abin Sur used his ring to seek out an individual who was \"utterly honest and born without fear\" to take his place as a member of the corps. At one point, when Hal Jordan was incapacitated, it was revealed that there were two individuals matching the specified criteria on Earth, the other being Guy Gardner, and the ring chose Jordan solely because of his proximity to Abin Sur. Gardner then became listed as Hal's \"backup\", even though he had a strong friendship with Barry Allen (The Flash). Gardner would fill in if Jordan was unavailable or otherwise incapacitated. Later, when Gardner was put into a coma, it turned out that by then there was a third human suitable for the task, John Stewart, who was designated as the Earth Sector's \"backup\" Lantern. Jordan, as Green Lantern, became a founding member of the Justice League of America and as of the mid-2000s is, along with John Stewart, one of the two active-duty Lanterns in Earth's sector of space.\n\nJordan also automatically became a member of the Green Lantern Corps, a galactic \"police\" force which bears some similarities to the \"Lensmen\" from the science fiction series written by E.E. Smith, although both creators Julius Schwartz and John Broome denied ever reading Smith's stories. Nevertheless, the early 1980s miniseries \"Green Lantern Corps\" honors the similarity with two characters in the corps: Eddore of Tront and Arisia. A different interpretation of Jordan and the Corps appears in \"\".\n\nFollowing the rebirth of Superman and the destruction of Green Lantern's hometown of Coast City in the early 1990s, Hal Jordan seemingly went insane and destroyed the Green Lantern Corps and the Central Power Battery. Now calling himself Parallax, Hal Jordan would devastate the DC Universe off and on for the next several years. However, after Earth's sun was threatened by a Sun-Eater, Jordan sacrificed his life, expending the last of his vast power to reignite the dying star. Jordan subsequently returned from beyond the grave as the Spectre, the divine Spirit of God's Vengeance, whom Jordan attempted to transform into a Spirit of Redemption, which ended in failure.\n\nIn \"\", it is revealed that Jordan was under the influence of a creature known as Parallax when he turned renegade. Parallax was a creature of pure fear that had been imprisoned in the Central Power Battery by the Guardians of the Universe in the distant past. Imprisonment had rendered the creature dormant and it was eventually forgotten, becoming known merely as the \"yellow impurity\" in the power rings. Sinestro was able to wake Parallax and encourage it to seek out Hal Jordan as a host. Although Parallax had been trying to corrupt Jordan (via his ring) for some time, it was not until after the destruction of Coast City that it was able to succeed. It took advantage of Jordan's weakened emotional state to lure him to Oa and cause him to attack anyone who stood in his way. After killing several Green Lanterns, Jordan finally entered the Central Power Battery and absorbed all the power, unwittingly freeing the Parallax entity and allowed it to graft onto his soul.\n\nThe Spectre bonded with Jordan in the hopes of freeing the former Green Lantern's soul from Parallax's taint, but was not strong enough to do so. In \"Green Lantern: Rebirth\", Parallax began to assert control of the Parallax-Spectre-Jordan composite. Thanks to a supreme effort of will, Jordan was able to free himself from Parallax, rejoin his soul to his body and reclaim his power ring. The newly revived (and rejuvenated) Jordan awoke just in time to save Kyle Rayner and Green Arrow from Sinestro. After the Korugarian's defeat, Jordan was able to successfully lead his fellow Green Lanterns in battle against Parallax and with help from Guardians Sayd and Ganthet, imprisoned it within the personal power batteries of Earth's Lanterns, rendering the Green Lantern's rings free of the yellow impurity, provided they had the power of will to do so.\nHal Jordan is once again a member of both the Justice League and the Green Lantern Corps, and along with John Stewart is one of the two Corps members assigned to Sector 2814, personally defeating Sinestro in the Sinestro Corps War. Jordan is designated as Green Lantern 2814.1.\n\nPost-\"Sinestro Corps War\", DC Comics revisited the origin of Hal Jordan as a precursor to \"Blackest Night\" storyline, the next chapter in the Geoff Johns era on \"Green Lantern\".\nHal Jordan is the Green Lantern portrayed by Ryan Reynolds in the 2011 \"Green Lantern\" film.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Guy Gardner appeared as the second choice to replace Abin Sur as Green Lantern of sector 2814. Gardner was a candidate to receive Abin Sur's ring, but Jordan was closer. This placed him as the \"backup\" Green Lantern for Jordan. But early in his career as a Green Lantern, tragedy struck Gardner as a power battery blew up in his face, putting him in a coma for years. During the \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", the Guardians split into factions, one of which appointed a newly revived Gardner as their champion. As a result of his years in a coma, Guy was emotionally unstable, although he still mostly managed to fight valiantly. He has gone through many changes, including wielding Sinestro's yellow Guardian power ring, then gaining and losing Vuldarian powers, and readmission to the Corps during \"\". He later became part of the Green Lantern Honor Guard, and oversees the training of new Green Lanterns. Gardner is designated as Green Lantern 2814.2 within the Corps.\n\nGuy Gardner helped lead the defense of Oa during the events of \"Blackest Night\".\n\nFollowing his outstanding acts of valour, the Guardians appoint Guy to a unique role and highest rank in the Green Lantern Corps-Sentinel, answering directly to the Guardians themselves.\n\nIn the early 1970s, John Stewart, an architect from Detroit, was selected by the Guardians to replace a comatose Guy Gardner as the backup Green Lantern for Jordan. When Jordan resigned from the Corps for an extended period of time, Stewart served as the regular Lantern, coming into his own as he battled numerous Green Lantern villains and played a key role during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. During that time the Guardians of the Universe assigned Katma Tui to train Stewart, and the two developed romantic feelings for each other. They married, but Katma was soon murdered by longtime Green Lantern villain, Star Sapphire. Stewart was crushed by this, and his life began to unravel. He reached his lowest point when he failed to save the planet Xanshi from destruction during the Cosmic Odyssey.\n\nJohn Stewart redeemed himself during the crisis, when an insane Guardian abducted cities from all over the universe and placed them together on Oa. When the Guardian was defeated, the cities remained, as the other Guardians claimed to not have enough energy in the Central Power Battery to send them home. While they gathered the resources, John Stewart was assigned to oversee the jammed together communities. Using his intellect and unconventional thinking, he formed the warring communities into a cohesive society. He was aided by Rose Hardin, a farmer from West Virginia who was trapped on Oa, due to her town being abducted. Stewart once again found love with Rose, and the two of them came to feel more comfortable on their new world than they did back on Earth.\n\nStewart eventually deduced that the Guardians had the energy to send the cities home whenever they wanted, and that they let them remain on Oa as an experiment in cosmic integration, and also as a test for John Stewart. Stewart passed the test, and discovered that he was a figure in Oan prophecy. That was why the Guardians directly chose him instead of allowing a Power Ring to do it, as is standard procedure. John Stewart rose to a new level of awareness and became the first mortal Guardian of the Universe. He was also rewarded with the resurrection of Katma Tui, which caused him to break up with Rose.\n\nStewart's new powers and resurrected wife were taken from him when Hal Jordan went mad and became Parallax, absorbing the power from the Central Power Battery. During this time, the Green Lantern Corps was disbanded, and Stewart went on to lead the Darkstars, a new organization of universal peacekeepers led by the Controllers, offshoots of the Guardians of the Universe. During a battle, Stewart was badly injured and left paralyzed from the waist down. Hal Jordan eventually restored his ability to walk before sacrificing himself to save Earth's sun. Soon after, John Stewart found himself hunted by a serial killer from Xanshi called Fatality. She sought out any remnants of the Green Lantern Corps so that she may kill them in the name of avenging her doomed planet. Stewart fended off Fatality with residual energy he blasted from his body, which was in him due to Hal Jordan healing his crippling condition, however, this left him unable to walk again.\n\nStewart later visited Fatality while she was in custody, and she revealed to him that his back was fine, and he had the ability to walk if he wanted to. Stewart had imposed a psychological block upon himself due to feeling guilty over his sister's death. Stewart overcame this condition and was given a power ring by Kyle Rayner. Rayner departed Earth and Stewart became the Green Lantern of Earth once again, and also a member of the Justice League of America.\n\nWhen the Green Lantern Corps reformed, Stewart begun serving with Jordan as one of his sector's two designated regular-duty Lanterns, designated as Green Lantern 2814.3. Since then, he played key roles in all big Green Lantern events, such as \"The Sinestro Corps War\" and \"Blackest Night\".\n\nIn the New 52 continuity, John Stewart was a U.S. Marine along with being an architect and the son of a social activist. He started a romantic relationship with his longtime enemy Fatality, who by that point had become a Star Sapphire and apparently forgave him for failing to save her world. In the events leading up to the \"Uprising\", Fatality was captured by shape-shifting Durlans, and a Durlan operative replicated her and took her place. John Stewart was at first hesitant about the relationship, but he eventually came to love Fatality, but it turns out that it had been the impostor by that point. In the final battle of the \"Uprising\", the impostor revealed itself as Verrat Din, an eons old Durlan, and destroyed Fatality's Star Sapphire ring, having no use for it after gaining the power of a Daxamite. Though Stewart defeated the powerful threat, he was shaken by having been misled so long, and having been intimate with a Durlan shape-shifter.\n\nStewart immediately set out to find the real Fatality, and when he did, he was astonished to discover that she had reverted to hating him. Fatality revealed that she was forcibly inducted into the Star Sapphires and brainwashed into being one of them. When her ring was destroyed, the spell was broken. Every moment she was with Stewart, she was trapped within herself. She revealed that she never loved John Stewart and departed, leaving Stewart emotionally crushed.\n\nJohn Stewart is notable for being the Green Lantern showcased on the \"Justice League\" and \"Justice League Unlimited\" cartoon shows, as well as being the primary Green Lantern of the DC Animated Universe.\n\nKyle Rayner was a struggling freelance artist when he was approached by the last Guardian of the Universe, Ganthet, to become a new Green Lantern with the very last power ring. Ganthet's reasons for choosing Rayner remained a secret for quite some time. Despite not being from the same cloth of bravery and fearlessness as Hal Jordan—or perhaps because of that—Rayner proved to be popular with readers and his fellow characters. Having continually proven himself on his own and with the JLA, he became known amongst the Oans as \"The Torch Bearer\". He briefly operated as Ion after using the power of the entire Green Lantern Corps. He was responsible for the rebirth of the Guardians and the re-ignition of the Central Power Battery, essentially restoring all that Jordan had destroyed as Parallax.\n\nKyle Rayner was chosen to wield the last ring because he knew fear, and Parallax had been released from the Central Power Battery. Ganthet knew this and chose Kyle because his experiences dealing with fear enabled him to resist Parallax. Because Parallax is a manifestation of fear, and yellow, none of the other Green Lanterns, including Hal, could harm Parallax and, therefore, came under his control. Kyle taught them to feel and overcome fear so they could defeat Parallax and incarcerate him in the Central Power Battery once again.\n\nKyle became Ion, who is later revealed to be the manifestation of willpower in the same way Parallax is fear. During the Sinestro Corps War between the Green Lantern Corps and the Sinestro Corps, Ion was imprisoned while Parallax possesses Kyle. In \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 4) #24, Parallax consumes Hal Jordan. Hal Jordan enters into Kyle's prison, and with his help, Kyle finally escapes Parallax.\n\nAfterward, Ganthet and Sayd trap Parallax in the Lanterns of the four Green Lanterns of Earth. Ganthet asks Kyle to give up his right to be Ion and become a Green Lantern again. Kyle accepts, and Ganthet gives Kyle a power ring. Kyle is outfitted with a new costume including a mask that looks like the one from his first uniform. Kyle is now a member of the Green Lantern Corps Honor Guard, and has been partnered with Guy Gardner.\n\nKyle now shows up mostly as part of the ensemble cast of \"Green Lantern Corps\". Corps rookie Sodam Yat took over the mantle of Ion. Sodam has made an appearance in the Legion of Super Heroes \"Final Crisis\" tie-in \"Legion of Three Worlds\" as the last surviving Green Lantern/Guardian of the Universe.\n\nKyle is designated as Green Lantern 2814.4 within the Corps.\n\nKyle Rayner died in \"Green Lantern Corps\" #42 (Jan. 2010) after sacrificing himself to save Oa from an attack by the Black Lantern Corps. The following issue, Kyle is brought back to life by the power of a Star Sapphire who connects Soranik Natu's heart to his heart.\n\nSimon Baz is a Lebanese American Muslim from the Detroit suburb of Dearborn, Michigan. He first appeared in \"The New 52! FCBD\" #1 before making his first full appearance in \"Green Lantern\" #0 during the \"Rise of the Third Army\" storyline written by Geoff Johns. He was caught by the police street racing in a stolen car with an armed bomb in the back of the van. While being questioned by authorities, Sinestro's Green Lantern ring chose Simon as its next ring bearer, recruiting him into the Green Lantern Corps. The squirrel-like Lantern B'dg follows, becoming Baz's mentor and friend. The Justice League eventually tracks Baz down and questions him as to how he came into the possession of a Green Lantern ring. Batman tries to disarm him by removing Simon's ring, but self-defense mechanisms of the ring prevent this.\nFollowing the events of \"Wrath of The First Lantern\", Simon Baz was offered the opportunity to join Amanda Waller and Steve Trevor's \"Justice League of America\" under the pretense that, his criminal charges would be dropped and his innocence publicly declared after FBI Agent Franklin Fed vouched for him. During the events of the \"Trinity War\" storyline, after Cyborg's (Victor) body was mangled by Crime Syndicate member \"The Grid\", Baz's ring was the only thing preventing Victor from death. During the battle against Relic, when Lantern Guy Gardner and the Red Lantern Corps become the protectors of space sector 2814, Simon was appointed Green Lantern ambassador on earth by Hal Jordan. Additionally per Hal´s request Simon became the protector of Hal Jordan's family. In \"Green Lantern\" #20, after the fierce battle against the First Lantern, it was revealed that Simon Baz will go on to train the first female Green Lantern of Earth, Jessica Cruz.\n\nFirst mentioned in \"Green Lantern\" #20 as the first female Green Lantern of Earth. Jessica Cruz is a young Latina American woman who was forced to become the unwilling host to the evil Ring of Volthoom after \"Power Ring\" dies in his alternate Earth unverse. Though she is not technically \"Power Ring\", as she is not a member of the Crime Syndicate and has no association with the organization, for namesake purposes she is dubbed \"Power Ring\" while the ring uses her as a host. She is helped by the Justice League and Simon Baz, who help her understand her cursed powers. In the Darkseid War, she becomes trapped inside the Ring of Volthoom, as Volthoom himself takes over Jessica's body. She then battles the previous wearers of the ring with the help of Cyborg, and forces her body in front of the Black Racer (who at the time was controlling the Flash) and kills Volthoom. After the battle, whilst the League mourns her motionless body, a Green Lantern ring appears and Jessica is made the 6th Green Lantern of Earth, to everyone's surprise.\n\nIn \"Green Lantern: Rebirth\" #1, she meets up with Simon Baz to battle a Manhunter. This turns out to be an exercise controlled by Hal Jordan, as he needs them to protect Earth whilst he goes on a mission to find the rest of the Corps. He then fuses both their Lanterns into one, which can only be used when they are together. Hal also gives them membership into the Justice League to help with their training.\n\nThe daughter of Alan Scott, Jennifer-Lynn Hayden would discover she shared her father's mystical connection to the Starheart, which gave her the abilities of a Green Lantern. Choosing to follow in her father's footsteps, she became the superheroine Jade. She would later fight a manifestation of the Starheart and lose those abilities. When Jade was fighting an Okaaran monster, she was saved by an orange lantern named Cade and fell in love with him.\n\nAfter Jade was stripped of her powers, Kyle Rayner gave her a copy of Hal Jordan's power ring. When Rayner left Earth to restart the Green Lantern Corps, Jade donned the classic Green Lantern uniform and served as the planet's Green Lantern until losing the ring during a battle with the villain Fatality. Later, when the ring was returned to her, she changed her Green Lantern uniform to a modified version of Rayner's. Jade continued to function as a Green Lantern until Rayner, as Ion, used his power to restore her connection to the Starheart. During \"Infinite Crisis\", she died while trying to stop Alexander Luthor, Jr. from destroying the universe to create a new multiverse. Upon her death, Jade returned her Starheart power to Rayner. In the \"Blackest Night\" event, her remains have been reanimated as one of the Black Lantern Corps after receiving a black power ring. She was resurrected by the Life Entity along with eleven other Black Lantern Corps members.\n\nSinestro was born on the planet Korugar and became Green Lantern of space sector 1417. He was a friend of Abin Sur and mentor to Hal Jordan. His desire for order was an asset in the Corps, and initially led him to be considered one of the greatest Green Lanterns. As the years passed, he became more and more fixated upon not simply protecting his sector, but on preserving order in the society of his home planet no matter what the cost. Eventually, he concluded that the best way to accomplish this was to conquer Korugar and rule the planet as a dictator. Exposed by Hal Jordan and punished, he later wielded a yellow ring of fear from Qward. Later in league with Parallax, he would establish the Sinestro Corps, which began the War of Light. Following \"Blackest Night\" and \"War of the Green Lanterns\" Sinestro would once again receive a Green Lantern ring and temporarily headline the monthly \"Green Lantern\" following The New 52. \nPremiering in \"Green Lantern: New Guardians Annual\" #1, Caul is a deep undercover Green Lantern operative that works in the Tenebrian Dominion. He unwillingly helps Carol Ferris and the New Guardians attempt to petition Lady Styx to send aid against the Third Army. For betraying them, the New Guardians leave Caul behind and he is forced to become part of a reality program called \"The Hunted\", stripped of his powers and with his discharged power ring embedded into his chest. Caul stars as part of an ensemble cast of spacebound DC characters including the Blue Beetle and a new Captain K'rot in the \"Hunted\" main feature of \"Threshold\". Caul received his Green Lantern Ring after he shot and killed its previous bearer, unsure himself why he was then chosen. Caul is able to save Sh'diki Borough on the planet Tolerance after it had been bottled by Brainiac. Caul is later informed that The Hunted has been cancelled and offered the lead role on a new show, Team Cauldron with the rest of his friends and Hunted competitors. Caul agrees to the role, having his power ring re-embedded into his chest. He is granted a meeting with Lady Styx to finalize his new role. However, as soon as Caul materializes at her base, he is killed by multiple gunshots, as planned by Colonel T'omas T'morra. In a glimmernet commercial, it is shown that T'morra replaces Caul in the proposed new show. However Caul is shown alive later along with Captain K'rot in tow when the planet Telos manifests during \"Convergence\" investigating it alongside Superman, Supergirl, Guy Gardner and the Red Lanterns.\n\nThe ring is powered by willpower. \nEach Green Lantern wears a ring that grants them a variety of possibilities. The full extent of the ring's ability has never been rigorously defined in the stories, but two consistent traits are that it grants the power of flight and that all its effects are accompanied by a green light.\n\nEarly Green Lantern stories showed the characters performing all sorts of feats with the ring, from shrinking objects to turning people invisible. Later stories de-emphasized these abilities in favor of constructs.\n\nThe signature power of all Green Lanterns is the ability to conjure \"constructs:\" solid green objects that the Green Lantern can control telekinetically. These can be anything, such as a disembodied fist to beat a foe, a shield to block an attack, a sword to cut a rope, or chains to bind a prisoner. Whatever their shape or size, these constructs are always pure green in color, unless a Lantern is skillful enough to know how to change the EM spectrum the construct emits. Hal Jordan has shown the ability to have a construct emit kryptonite radiation under Batman's guidance.\n\nThe rings of the Green Lantern Corps allow their bearers to travel very quickly across interstellar distances, fast enough that they can efficiently patrol the universe. They allow the wearer to survive in virtually any environment, and also remove the need to eat, sleep and pass waste. The rings can translate practically any language in the universe. They possess powerful sensors that can identify and analyze objects. Lanterns are granted full access to all Guardian knowledge by their rings, through the Book of Oa.\n\nA noteworthy power the rings do not have is the ability to automatically heal injuries, though they can provide shielding. In Hal Jordan's origin story, Abin Sur passed on his ring to Hal because he was unable to treat his own fatal injuries. If the Green Lantern happens to be a skilled physician, then the ring can be invaluable as it can conjure any conceivable medical tool, but it cannot do much for a Lantern who lacks medical expertise. When Hal Jordan breaks his arm, the best he can do is conjure up a cast. This is further extended into an ability to replace large sections of one's injured body with constructs, but this too requires detailed biological knowledge of one's body and concentration enough to prolong the construct.\n\nAlan Scott's ring is unable to directly affect anything made of wood. Alan can conjure a green shield to block bullets, but a wooden club will pass through it effortlessly. The rings of Hal Jordan and his colleagues originally shared a similar weakness to anything colored yellow, though due to the removal of the yellow impurity from the Central Battery on Oa, more recent stories have removed this weakness.\n\nThe effectiveness of the ring is tied to the wearer's willpower. A Green Lantern with strong willpower will best a weaker-willed Lantern in a duel. Anything which weakens the Green Lantern's mind, such as a telepathic attack, may render his ring useless.\n\nGreen Lantern is famous for the oath he recites when he charges his ring. Originally, the oath was:\n\nThis oath is also used by Lanterns Tomar-Re of sector 2813 and Chief Administrator Salaak.\nIn the mid-1940s, this was revised into the form that became famous during the Hal Jordan era:\nThe oath in this form is credited to Alfred Bester, who wrote many Green Lantern stories in the 1940s. This version of the oath was first spoken by Alan Scott in \"Green Lantern\" #9 from the fall of 1943. Scott would revert to reciting his original oath after he was reintroduced during the Silver Age.\n\nMany Green Lanterns have a unique personal oath, but some oaths are shared by several Lanterns. They are usually four lines long with a rhyme scheme of “AAAA” or “AABB”.\n\nThe Pre-Crisis version of Hal Jordan was inspired to create his oath after a series of adventures in which he developed new ways to detect evasive criminals: in the first adventure, he used his ring as radar to find robbers who had blinded him with a magnesium flash; in the second, he tracked criminals in a dark cave by using his ring to make them glow with phosphorescence; finally, Jordan tracked safecrackers by the faint shockwaves from the explosives they had used.\n\nMedphyll, the Green Lantern of the planet J586 (seen in \"Swamp Thing\" #61, \"All Flesh is Grass\"), a planet where a sentient plant species lives, has the following oath:\n\nOther notable oaths include that of Jack T. Chance,\n\nand that of Rot Lop Fan, a Green Lantern whose species lacks sight, and thus has no concepts of brightness, darkness, day, night, color, or lanterns.\n\nSince \"\" and the re-establishment of the Green Lantern Corps, the only oath used has been the \"Brightest Day, Blackest Night\" version.\n\nIn \"Green Lantern\" (vol. 4) #27, the Alpha Lanterns use the oath:\n\nIn \"\", Sodam Yat in the 31st century – the last of the Green Lanterns and the last of the Guardians – recited a new oath:\n\nIn \"Batman: The Dawnbreaker\" #1, the Dawnbreaker (an amalgamation of Batman and Green Lantern from the Dark Multiverse's Earth-32) creates and recites his own oath after the death of the Guardians of the Universe and the Green Lantern Corps by his own hands:\n\nIn the video game, \"Infinite Crisis\", Hal Jordan of Earth-13 (the Arcane universe) has his own variation:\n\nIn the animated TV series \"Duck Dodgers\", Duck Dodgers temporarily becomes a Green Lantern after accidentally picking up Hal Jordan's laundry. In the first part of the episode, he forgets the real quote and makes up his own version:\n\nIn 2011, soon after the release of the \"Green Lantern\" movie, a trailer for \"The Muppets\" featured Kermit reciting a parody of the oath:\n\nThe TV show, \"Mad\", included a movie parody called \"RiOa\", a fusion of \"Green Lantern\" and \"Rio\". Blu from \"Rio\" is turned into a Green Lantern, and recruits Big Bird, the Road Runner, Mordecai from \"Regular Show\", Mumble from \"Happy Feet\", and one of the Angry Birds and turns them into Green Lanterns.\n\nThe phrase \"in the brightest day and in the darkest night\" can also be found in a letter Sullivan Ballou wrote to his wife during the American Civil War, shortly before he was killed in the First Battle of Bull Run (1861).\n\nWith the exception of Alan Scott, all Lantern oaths are formatted in four lines of Iambic tetrameter.\n\n",
                "Green Lantern Corps\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps is the name of a fictional intergalactic military/police force appearing in comics published by DC Comics. They patrol the farthest reaches of the DC Universe at the behest of the Guardians, a race of immortals residing on the planet Oa. According to DC continuity, the Green Lantern Corps has been in existence for three billion years, surviving multiple conflicts both internal and foreign. Currently operating divided as pairs amongst the 3600 “sectors” of the universe, there are 7202 members (known commonly as Green Lanterns), two lanterns for every sector, except for sector 2814, which has four members. Each Green Lantern is given a power ring, a weapon granting the use of incredible abilities that are directed by the wearer's own willpower.\n\nIn 1959, during a revival of the popularity of superhero comics in America, DC Comics editor Julius Schwartz decided to reinvent the 1940s superhero character Green Lantern as a science fiction hero. Schwartz's new conception of Green Lantern had a different name (Hal Jordan), costume, and origin story, and no connection to the original Green Lantern. Whereas the Green Lantern of the 1940s was a lone vigilante who only had adventures on Earth, the new Green Lantern was but one of a group of interstellar lawmen who all called themselves Green Lanterns. The group is first mentioned in \"Showcase #22\" (1960) when a dying Green Lantern passes on his ring to Hal Jordan. Over the years, writers have introduced a large cast of Green Lanterns in both supporting and starring roles.\n\nThe Guardians of the Universe are one of several races that originated on the planet Maltus and were among the first intelligent life forms in the universe. At this time they were short greyish blue humanoids with black hair. They became scientists and thinkers, experimenting on the worlds around them. In a pivotal moment billions of years ago, a Maltusian named Krona used time-bending technology to observe the beginning of the universe. However, this experiment unleashed disaster upon all existence. Originally, the experiment splintered the universe into the multiverse and created the evil anti-matter universe. Following the retroactive destruction of the Multiverse, it was revealed that Krona flooded the beginning of the universe with entropy causing it \"to be born old\".\n\nThe male Maltusians argued about how to deal with the situation. One group decided to dedicate their eternal existences to contain evil; this group fractured into the Guardians of the Universe and the Controllers. The females, however, saw no need to involve themselves and, since the Oans were by then immortal and had no more need to reproduce, left their mates and became known as the Zamarons. Relocating to the planet Oa at \"the center of the universe\", the Guardians dedicated themselves to combatting evil and creating an orderly universe. During this period they slowly evolved into their current appearance.\nA Green Lantern's only weakness is the yellow energy of fear, opposite to the green energy of will. After the Green Lantern Sinestro betrayed the Green Lantern Corps and created the Sinestro Corps, a prophecy was fulfilled that Lantern Corps of the other cosmic energies of emotion shall form, such as Red (rage), Orange (greed), Black (death), White (life), Indigo (compassion), Blue (hope), and Violet (love).\n\nIn their first attempt to enforce their will and guard against all menaces, about 3.5 billion years ago the Guardians of the universe created a legion of robotic sentinels called the Manhunters. At first serving faithfully to enforce order, in time the Manhunters came to resent their servitude and the moral restrictions the Guardians decreed of them. They were also found to be inherently flawed due to their inability to recognize or feel emotions. They rebelled against the Guardians and fought a millennia-long war that culminated with an attack on the planet Oa. The Guardians overcame their android servants, stripped them of their power, and banished them across the universe. Eventually, the surviving Manhunters formed their own robotic society and pursued their own interpretation of their original mission (which often included interfering with and foiling the plans of the Guardians).\n\nIn the \"Martian Manhunter\" series, the Guardians first get the idea for an intergalactic police force from the Martians' own Manhunters. They offer the Martian race the opportunity to be that force. The Martians turn it down, but the Guardians take the name for the androids.\n\nIn Geoff Johns' 2008 storyline \"\", it is revealed that the Manhunters suffered from a malfunction in their logic that led them to believe that order could only be achieved by eliminating all life. They rampaged through Sector 666, massacring trillions in the process. The only survivors banded together to form the Five Inversions, swearing revenge on the Guardians for the actions of their creations. One of the five, Atrocitus, would later become the leader of the Red Lantern Corps.\n\nIt was later discovered that the Manhunters had not suffered a flaw in their logic, as had previously been assumed, but that the renegade Guardian Krona had reprogrammed them in an attempt to show the other Guardians the necessity in embracing emotions.\n\nChastened by the failure of the Manhunters, the Guardians decided that their newest force of soldiers for good would consist of living beings, ones who had free will and strong moral character. To arm this new legion of celestial knights, the Guardians created the \"Power Rings,\" rings of inconceivably-advanced technology that allowed their wearers to project green beams of energy with which the bearer could conjure objects of any size or shape, limited only by their imagination and willpower.\n\nBoth the Corps and the Guardians suffered casualties during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. The Guardians' failure to take appropriate action during the Crisis led to their decision to depart Oa in the company of their female counterparts, the Zamarons. Left to their own devices, the Corps underwent a major reorganization. A team of Green Lanterns led by Hal Jordan was stationed on Earth, and the system of assigning one Green Lantern to a sector was temporarily abandoned. The decision of the Corps to execute Sinestro resulted in the activation of a previously unknown fail-safe that depowered the rings of every Green Lantern except for Hal Jordan, Guy Gardner, Gnort, and Ch'p.\n\nThe Guardians eventually returned to Oa and began the reconstruction of the Corps, assigning Guy Gardner to Earth, John Stewart to the , and Hal Jordan to recruit new members. Ironically, Jordan himself would eventually be responsible for destroying the incarnation of the Corps that he had helped create.\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps patrolled the DC Universe for over three billion years. In that vast length of time, some Green Lanterns rebelled and turned against the Corps. A rogue Green Lantern, Universo, existed in the future epoch of the Legion of Super-Heroes. Two of the most important fallen Lanterns were Sinestro, the rogue Green Lantern, and Hal Jordan, who would unknowingly become possessed by Parallax, the ancient fear-parasite trapped in the Battery. At the ruins of his home Coast City, Jordan was consumed by grief, which in turn allowed him to be overcome by fear—all the while not knowing that his fear was tainted by the creature Parallax. This was planned by Sinestro while he was imprisoned in the Battery.\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps ranks were decimated by the Parallax-possessed Jordan. The Corps' power source, the Central Power Battery, was drained by Jordan and destroyed, removing the original power source for the rings. One Guardian, Ganthet, survived Jordan's onslaught, and chose a young human artist, Kyle Rayner, as the sole Green Lantern of the Corps. Rayner would eventually become Parallax's nemesis, and during their first battle, Rayner intentionally triggered a chain reaction in Oa's core, causing the planet to explode.\n\nAfter the fall of the Corps, other organizations tried to fill in the power vacuum left by the Guardians. Two organizations had initial notable successes: the Darkstars and L.E.G.I.O.N. However, neither ever achieved the power and reach of the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nThe Lost Lanterns were a group of Green Lanterns that tried to stop Parallax from reaching Oa. Parallax defeated them in space and after Parallax destroyed the Corps, they were assumed to be dead. Instead, they were captured by the Manhunters and taken to Biot, the Manhunter homeworld in Sector 3601. They were used in various experiments to design and power new Manhunter models. They were eventually found and rescued by the resurrected Hal Jordan and Guy Gardner. They rejoined the Corps, albeit with some difficult adjustment. Despite learning of Parallax's possession of Hal Jordan, many still blame him for their captivity and cluster to themselves when summoned to Oa.\n\nWhen Kyle Rayner accidentally travelled through time to ten years in the past and met a young Hal Jordan, the Guardians were able to send Rayner back to his own time by using the power from the Central Battery after Jordan and Rayner defeated Sinestro together. However, while doing so, Sinestro commanded his Qwardian ring to force Jordan to Rayner's time portal, in a bid to strand Jordan in Rayner's time period. Upon learning his future as Parallax (not knowing, however, that his future self's actions was the result of being possessed by a fear entity under the machination of Sinestro's future self) and aware that the future needed him to return to his own time and allow future events to unravel in the way it was supposed to, young Jordan knew he must forget everything he learned from the present, and gave Rayner a copy of his ring to restart the Green Lantern Corps in a bid to undo some of the damages he knew he was going to make once he returned to the past.\n\nRayner then gave the ring to Jennifer-Lynn Hayden, daughter of the elder Green Lantern Alan Scott, whereupon she became the first female Green Lantern of Earth, following in her father's footsteps, after he made another copy with it. In \"Green Lantern: The New Corps\", during his weeks-long adventure in space, Rayner first recruited Magaan Van'n Intraktus of the planet Van'n, Hammeroon, a bounty hunter from Ilskado System, Anya Savenlovich, a lieutenant colonel from the Soviet Air Forces who was in suspended animation after she participated in a space mission in 1964, Garl Rathbone, a miner from the debris belt over the planet Daffith, and Sool, a judge from Daffith.\n\nHowever, the group later realized Van'n Intraktus was a traitor after they discovered that he enslaved his home planet with his ring and began invading other worlds. The Green Lanterns eventually stopped the renegade after a battle, but at the cost of one of their own: Hammeroon. Rayner then realized that he couldn't be the only one to choose who to wear the rings, and took all of the power rings back from the Green Lanterns until the time was right for the Corps' rebirth. After erecting a memorial for Hammeroon, Rayner returned to Earth. The former Green Lanterns, despite being stripped of their rings, decided to continue their intergalactic adventures.\n\nIn an attempt to redeem himself after his actions as Parallax, Hal Jordan sacrificed his life reigniting the sun, whereupon Oa and the Central Power Battery were completely rebuilt by the physical manifestation of Jordan’s dying will channeled through his old friend and confidant Thomas Kalmaku. Shortly thereafter, Kyle Rayner, having been imbued with the vast power of Ion after his battle with Oblivion and Alexander Nero funneled the remaining energy left in the sun that was once the immortal Guardians back into the Central Power Battery. This allowed them to be reborn as children of both genders. After Hayden regained her Starheart powers and becomes the superheroine Jade once more, Rayner gave the ring to John Stewart. After Oa's return, Kilowog would eventually be resurrected. With everything apparently in place, Ganthet, Kilowog, Stewart, and Rayner made plans to rebuild the Corps once more.\n\nIt was later revealed that Hal Jordan had been possessed by the living embodiment of fear, an ancient parasite called Parallax. Parallax had been imprisoned within the Central Power Battery for billions of years and is the mysterious \"Yellow Impurity\" within the Corps' green light that leaves them vulnerable against yellow. Hal Jordan, upon learning the truth about Parallax, separated himself from it and was reborn as a Green Lantern once again. Jordan, with the help of John Stewart, Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, and Kilowog, reimprisoned Parallax. Upon Parallax's return to the Central Power Battery, the Guardians continued the re-construction and expansion of the Green Lantern Corps, strengthened with its power rings now able to directly affect yellow provided that a Lantern can face and conquer his or her fear. This new Corps, under the training of Kilowog, Kyle Rayner, Guy Gardner, and other veterans, was primarily composed of new recruits. Only a handful of veteran Lanterns remained in the ranks. Each sector has two Lanterns assigned to protect it (with Hal Jordan and John Stewart assigned as the protectors of Sector 2814, Guy and Kyle acting as 'elite' members responsible for training). Due to an ancient pact with the Spider Guild, the Vega star system is off limits to all members of the Corps.\n\nThe new Green Lantern Corps presently lacks both the manpower and the political influence it once had due to its years-long absence from many sectors. This has left the Corps currently unable to intervene in situations it might have before Parallax destroyed the old Corps, including conflicts such as the Rann-Thanagar War. The Guardians remain staunchly uninvolved in what they see as a conflict that could destabilize many sectors, but that has not stopped Kyle Rayner and Kilowog from helping refugees.\n\nDespite these difficulties, the Corps played a key role in defeating Superboy-Prime. Several Lanterns were killed slowing the renegade Superboy's advance on Oa, a sacrifice that enabled Earth's most powerful heroes to execute their plan to restrain him. Mogo, a sentient planet and Corps member, positioned himself to act as a final battleground between Superboy-Prime and two Supermen. Responsibility for imprisoning Superboy-Prime was undertaken by the Guardians who charged the Corps with its undertaking, incarcerating him inside a small red Sun-Eater with fifty Green Lanterns on constant guard duty. \"Prime Duty\" is considered one of the lowlier functions of the Corps, and Guy Gardner was sentenced to a month of such duty for one of his frequent rules infractions.\n\nAs of the \"One Year Later\" timeframe, the Green Lantern Corps had increased its numbers, with many former trainees now full-fledged officers. A lack of truly experienced lanterns remained an issue, with Guy Gardner being called upon often to assist the rookies.\n\nRogue Green Lantern Sinestro, working with the Anti-Monitor, created his own version of the Corps. Dubbed the \"Sinestro Corps\", it recruited beings capable of generating great fear. One of the members recruited into the Sinestro Corps was Amon Sur, the son of former Green Lantern Abin Sur, who held a grudge against Hal Jordan for being chosen to bear his father's ring instead of him. Armed with yellow Power Rings and Lanterns manufactured on Qward, the Sinestro Corps staged an attack on Oa, killing dozens of Green Lantern Corps officers, kidnapping Kyle Rayner, and freeing Superboy-Prime, Parallax, and the Cyborg Superman from the Corps' supervision.\n\nAs the Sinestro Corps' campaign of terror spread, the Guardians, in desperation, rewrote the first Law of Ten in the Book of Oa, enabling the remaining Lanterns to use lethal force against members of the Sinestro Corps. This law later expanded to include all adversaries of the Green Lanterns, though the law does not extend to cold-blooded killing of defenseless adversaries. This distinction played a part in the expulsion of Laira from the Green Lantern Corps for killing Amon Sur when he was unarmed, her induction into the Red Lanterns, and subsequent death over the course of events during the \"Sinestro Corps War\" and \"Blackest Night\" storylines.\n\nHidden in the Book of Oa is the forbidden chapter of Cosmic Revelations, which contains a prophecy called the \"Blackest Night\". In the prophecy, seven different colored corps are at war with each other, eventually destroying one another and the universe.\n\nFollowing the \"Sinestro Corps War\", Ganthet and Sayd are banished from the Guardians. Realizing that the \"Blackest Night\" prophecy will come to be, they create a blue ring powered by hope. The remaining Guardians create the Alpha-Lanterns and reveal new laws they've written to the Green Lantern Corps.\n\nDuring the \"Blackest Night,\" the Guardians finally realize the accuracy of the prophecy and are imprisoned by Scar; a rogue Guardian who launches an attack on the Corps by reviving deceased members as Black Lanterns. Command falls to Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, and Salaak, a senior Lantern holding the rank of Clarissi.\n\nThe Green Lantern corps, along with the other six corps (The Sinestro Corps, the Red Lantern Corps, The Indigo Tribe, The Blue Lantern Corps, Agent Orange, and the Star Sapphires), fight the black lanterns to regain safety and order in the universe.\n\nThe Blackest Night ends when Hal Jordan, merged with the Life Entity, and the recently created White Lantern Corps defeat Nekron and banish him from the realm of the living.\n\nAt the end of \"Blackest Night\", 12 heroes and villains were resurrected for some unknown purpose. The events of Brightest Day follow the exploits of these heroes and villains as they attempt to learn the secret behind their salvation. It is revealed that the 12 resurrected must complete an individual assignment given to them by the White Lantern Entity. If they are successful, their life will be fully returned.\n\nIn New Mexico, Sinestro discovers a White Lantern battery which no lantern can move. Boston Brand aka Deadman is made the first White Lantern picking up the White Lantern battery and is charged by the Life Entity to find a new champion who will bear the white light of life and take the Entity's place. This turns out to be Alec Holland, the new Swamp Thing who defeats the Dark Avatar saving Earth.\n\nHal Jordan, as well as the representatives of the other Lantern Corps attempt to prevent the capture of all the emotional entities which eventually leads to the Green Lantern Corps War.\n\nKyle Rayner, John Stewart, and Ganthet face the revolt of the Alpha Lanterns and later fight the Weaponer of Qward wielding a shield made from Boston Brand's White Lantern ring.\n\nGuy Gardner explores the unknown sectors and continues a secret pact with Ganthet and Atrocitus. As Guy leaves OA, Kilowog and Arisia join up to aid him in his search, as they put in motion a universe-saving plan against a new, hidden foe who meanwhile, pulls Sodam Yat out of Daxam's sun taking the Ion entity.\n\nAfter the Blackest Night, Hal Jordan forms a loose alliance with Carol Ferris, Atrocitus, Sinestro, Larfleeze, Saint Walker and Indigo-1 to find and protect the emotional entities, who have been kidnapped by a mysterious villain. The kidnapper is revealed to be Krona, who is also revealed to be the one who caused the Manhunters to go on a rampage in the first place.\n\nCarol, Sinestro, Atrocitus, Saint Walker, Larfleeze and Indigo-1 are trapped within the Book of the Black. However, Hal escapes and takes their rings. Krona begins the next stage of his plan, using the Guardians as the entities's hosts. He also places Parallax back into the Central Power Battery, restoring the yellow impurity and brainwashing all the Green Lanterns into serving him. However, Hal, Kyle Rayner, John Stewart, Guy Gardner, and Kilowog have a measure of resistance, due to their previous experience with fear. The other Lantern unaffected by the yellow impurity is Ganthet.\n\nKilowog is captured by Krona, and his resistance to brainwashing overcome. To prevent Krona from controlling them, the Earthmen take off their Green Lantern rings and put on the rings Hal rescued from the Book of the Black. Hal takes the Sinestro Corps ring, Guy takes the Red Lantern ring, John takes the Indigo Tribe ring, and Kyle takes the Blue Lantern ring. Hal, John, Guy and Kyle go to the Central Power Battery to remove Parallax and restore the Corps to normal. However, an ambush from the brainwashed Lanterns separates the group. Hal and Guy end up captured by the Guardians, while Kyle and John travel to Mogo with the intention of freeing it from Krona's control.\n\nHowever, John and Kyle are attacked by Lanterns while they travel to Mogo's core. John harnesses the Black Lantern energy left in Mogo and uses it to destroy Mogo. This allows Hal and Guy to escape from Krona's forces and re-group with John and Kyle. The four Lanterns and Ganthet go to the Battery, where Hal wields the Agent Orange ring while Guy wields the Star Sapphire ring. Hal, John, Kyle and Ganthet fight the brainwashed Lanterns while Guy removes Parallax from the Battery, restoring the Corps.\n\nWith the impurity removed, Hal, John, Kyle and Guy recover their Green Lantern rings and join the Corps in the final battle against Krona and the entity-possessed Guardians.\n\nDuring the final struggle, Hal and Kyle free Carol, Sinestro and the others from the Book of the Black. Also, Sinestro becomes a Green Lantern once again. Hal kills Krona, releasing the entities from the Guardians. However, the Guardians believe Hal to be the most dangerous Green Lantern, so they discharge him from the Corps.\n\nThe status of the Green Lantern Corps remained unchanged by the reboot applied in the \"Flashpoint\" series. As of 2011, Sinestro is still an unwilling Green Lantern, Hal remains exiled (although he has been forced to assist Sinestro's activities with a ring created and powered by Sinestro) while Kyle has gone AWOL alongside six members of the other Lantern Corps. John was recently forced to kill a Green Lantern who was about to give in to torture the access codes to the Oan defense network from the Keepers. Guy remains the only main character with a stable position in the Corps.\n\nThe Guardians currently consider the Green Lantern Corps a failure. They are planning to replace it with a mysterious \"Third Army\", which will be led by the equally mysterious \"First Lantern\". The Third Army consists of beings with no free will that are made out of the Guardians' bio-tissue. The First Lantern is a being who was imprisoned and kept under guard by the older Guardians because he was deemed too dangerous to leave free.\n\nSinestro gave Hal Jordan a temporary ring to help him out on missions, but the Guardians attacked them and both rings merged into a single, faulty one. It mistakenly concluded that Sinestro and Jordan were dead, so it went in search of a new Lantern named Simon Baz. Simon Baz is a Muslim-American Green Lantern first shown in \"Green Lantern\" #0 (vol. 5).\n\nThe Guardians command the Third Army to destroy the Green Lanterns. B'dg of Sector 1014 says that some Green Lanterns have discovered the Guardians' true intentions.\n\nMeanwhile, Green Lantern Sentinel Guy Gardner is assisting a ship as a peace treaty with warring planets. This is interrupted when he learns that his mortal enemy Xar is free. Unbeknownst to Guy, Xar was freed by the Guardians. Guy takes half of the Lanterns with him away from the mission in order to keep his family safe, but they are met by members of the Third Army. The Third Army kills all of the Lanterns with Guy, including Lantern Vandor. Guy escapes, but only to be reprimanded and removed from the Corps.\n\nMeanwhile, Green Lantern John Stewart is on a mission to gather all of the pieces of the deceased, sentient planet known as Mogo, in the hopes that Mogo can then restore himself. This succeeds, and Mogo is reborn. The Guardians had planned on assimilating the reformed Mogo into the Third Army. Mogo quickly defeated this division of the Third Army.\n\nThe rest of the Green Lantern Corps discovered that the Guardians had turned against them, so the Corps join the New Guardians and Atrocitus' Manhunters to help them fight. During the fight with the Third Army and the Guardians, the Guardians draw so much energy from Volthoom that he breaks free of containment. Volthoom says that everything the Guardians have created will be no more, and that the universe will be his once again.\n\nWhen Volthoom is freed, he teleports to the planet Maltus and imprisons the Guardians. While Volthoom is in a weakened state, he begins to drain the Lanterns and other present beings of their emotions, minds, and memories. He intends to examine their lives in order to restore his emotional powers. He alters their memories while doing so, apparently because he wants them to suffer. Among those that suffered these invasive processes: Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, John Stewart, Fatality, Carol Ferris, Larfleeze, Saint Walker and Atrocitus.\n\nLater, Volthoom destroys Sinestro's home planet of Korugar by draining the Korugarian's of their emotions. Sinestro survives the encounter and vows to kill Volthoom. Volthoom then returns to Oa to drain the rest of the green Lantern Corps, but Mogo shields them with dirt and stone so they may escape from Volthoom's powers. Mogo then rallies the Green Lantern Corps to fight against Volthoom.\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps and most of the other reserve Corps try to destroy Volthoom, but he easily manages to defeat the Corps. Then the Indigo Tribe appears. They open the Dead Zone portal from which hordes of undead, led by a Black Lantern Hal Jordan, emerge to attack Volthoom. Volthoom manages to destroy the army and drain Black Lantern Hal. Before Volthoom can unleash his full power, he is thwarted by Sinestro, who has become the new host of Parallax. Volthoom gains the upper hand, saying that he is more powerful than God. Then Black Lantern Hal proceeds to summon Nekron. He reduces Volthoom's emotional powers to a normal human state. Nekron slays Volthoom with his scythe for good, causing him to explode into rays of light.\n\nAfter the battle is over, Hal is saved from the Black Lantern ring and becomes a Green Lantern again. He goes after Sinestro, who intends to kill the Guardians for everything they have done to him, to Korugar, and to the Universe at large. By the time Hal catches up, Sinestro reveals that Hal is too late. The Guardians are dead.\n\nLater though, Sinestro meets in secret with ex-Guardians Ganthet and Sayd. He exiles them from Oa, but chooses to spare their lives since they had no involvement in Korugar's destruction.\n\nAs Hal accepts the offer to act as the leader of the Green Lantern Corps, all the corps started experiencing failure of their rings during a battle with Larfleeze. They then face an unexpected threat in the form of Relic, a resident of the universe that existed prior to this one, who seeks to destroy the various Corps in the belief that using the powers of the emotional spectrum drains an emotional 'reservoir' and hastens the death of the universe. Relic goes on to shatter the Blue Lantern power battery, new home world killing all Blue Lanterns except Saint Walker. Following this Relic wielding lantern draining technology destroys Oa and the green lantern power battery. Relic is proved correct as it becomes clear that the universe is coming to an end due to lanterns using the power of the emotional spectrum so he heads off to the Source Wall to save reality. To help fight Relic Hal recruits now Red Lantern Guy Gardner after joining with the Green Lanterns to fight Relic, Hal promises to give the Red Lanterns a sector for them to watch over, unwittingly this sector becomes Sector 2814, where Earth resides, giving guardianship of Earth to the Red Lantern Corps. With Relic trapped in the Source War it is Kyle Rayner with the entities (except Parallax) who is able to use his White Lantern status to replenish the emotional reservoir beyond the Source Wall.\n\nFollowing this the Green Lanterns make a new home on Mogo with a new battery made by the Indigo Tribe. Although they survived some Green Lanterns and Saint Walker are unwilling to use their rings if they damage the universe.\n\nFollowing their battle with Relic, the Green Lantern reputation is already tarnished by the Guardians and the Third Army but is further damaged by Durlan shape shifters. The Durlans had been posing as green lantern support staff waiting for a time to strike and they posed as Hal Jordan revealing to the universe their rings do damage to the universe. The Durlans led by The Ancients make a pact with the Khund led by General Khurtz using Relic ring draining weapons and Prixiam Nol-Anj of the Outer Braid Clanns to rise up against the Green Lanterns in their weakened state. They even try to recruit former green lantern prisoners such as Bolphunga, Hunger Dog, etc. to their cause but who also fight back. As the Green Lantern corps is low on numbers they deputize the former criminals teaming them with green lanterns. They recruit former leader of the Corpse Durlan Green Lantern member Von Daggle to hunt down his own kind to prevent them doing further harm. After clearing Mogo of Durlan spies and those posing as green lanterns, the green lanterns are able reply the uprising. However following this retreat the Durlans reveal their true intentions their allies are simply pawns; they destroy the Khund fleet and their betrayal turns the Outer Clanns into helping the green lanterns. The Durlans had captured Daxanite green lantern Sodam Yat discovering his Superman like powers and their true goal was to turn themselves into Daxanites to conquer the universe. Having already replaced a large number of people from Daxam, the Durlans head off to claim the energy they need to permanently stay as Daxamites. They are stopped by the green lantern corps. However one Dulan who had been posing as John Stewart's love Fatality, hence how the Durlans were always one step ahead, successfully becomes a Daxanite by reaching the energy. She too is defeat by moving her away from a yellow sun. For their help the former green lantern prisoners are given clean records, while Von Daggle with help from Mogo strips his Durlan brethren of their shape shifting powers so not be a threat to the corps again.\n\nWhen Kyle Rayner breached the Source Wall it is revealed that he acquired the Life Equation and when Highfather of the New Gods on New Genesis discovers this he believes it is the weapon he needs to defeat Darkseid. Also the fact that mortals wielding of the emotional spectrum could have access to such power Highfather declares war on all the Corps across the universe. The New Gods quickly incapacitate all the corps forcing the Green Lanterns to ally with the Sinestro Corps even including The Weaponer to help save the Star Sapphires and Indigo Tribe. When the combine corps attempt to attack in force against the New Gods they are betrayed by the Indigo Tribe and imprisoned. Soon Kyle Rayner is tricked by Highfather into gaining the Life Equation intending to take the fight to Earth, then convert the planet and universe into an army to fight Darkseid. After receiving help from some New Gods especially Malhedron who disagree with Highfather, our heroes escape striking back against the New Gods waiting for reinforcements from Hal Jordan. Hal recruits Black Hand who creates an army of Black Lanterns from the titans held in the Source Wall and transported to New Genesis thanks to Sinestro. Unable to stop these Source Titans the New Gods are defeated but soon Black Hand loses control when the Sources Titans come back to life. Meanwhile, the Templar Guardians reveal that Kyle Rayner still has the Life Equations within him and takes the power off Highfather, teleporting away the Source Titans. Relic is also restored to life escaping and the Sinestro Corps retreats leaving the New Gods to their fate. With New Genesis falling from the sky Hal Jordan lands the island with help from restored Blue Lantern Saint Walker. Highfather realizing he is becoming like Darkseid ends the war with the Corps and apologies unable to change his actions. The Green Lantern Corps returns home to Mogo.\n\nJohn Stewart is named second in command of the GLC as Corps Commander by the Templar Guardians, while Von Daggle with help from Hunger Dog finds his partner Asile working undercover posted there by the former Guardians to work for the Shadow Empire. They are led by a witch called Wyllt who as a child crashed on Ysmault where the demons poisoned her mind, although she was rescued by Abin Sur whose mind was also eventually poisoned by the same demons. She became consumed with restoring darkness to universe by expelling light. When a planet destroying bomb on the planet Zarox is discovered by John Stewart the full scope of her plans are revealed. She had influenced the Durlans and Khund in their Uprising and was the one responsible for the bomb that destroyed Xanshi, the planet John Stewart had once accidentally destroyed. These world destroying bombs are powered by negative emotions and protected against a Green Lantern's willpower energy. After rallying the people of Zarox positively, John Stewart uses his Star Sapphires ring he acquired during the New Gods War to save the planet and repel the Shadow Empire. However Wyllt flees with it being revealed that the Shadow Empire is in every space sector and has negative emotion bombs buried on hundreds of worlds.\n\nDarkseid comes into conflict with the Anti-Monitor thanks to Darkseid's amazon daughter Grail. It is revealed that the Anti-Monitor was once a scientist named Mobius, who found the anti-life equation at center of the anti-matter universe on Qward. Mobius believes that with the death of Darkseid, he will be free from being the Anti-Monitor. After an intense battle, the Anti-Monitor fuses the Black Racer with The Flash and sends it after Darkseid. Using the fused Flash and his own powers, he kills Darkseid. With Darkseid dead, the universe is unbalanced as it has lost its God of Evil. Darkseid's Mother Box searches for someone as powerful as he but locks onto the Central Power Battery of the Green Lantern Corps. It merges with the Central Power Battery and wielding Darkseid's parademon army to destroy the Green Lantern Corps. Hal Jordan battles the whole army and is captured and brought before the Mother Box. There it reveals it wants to serve a new god with Hal Jordan agreeing to be its god, he is then changed into the God of Light. Hal uses his godlike power to restore Oa and the Corps but realizes he should simply restore things to the way they were whether good or bad. He uses his power to destroy the Mother Box and undo the parademon attack. During the final battle against Grail and a reborn Darkseid, John Stewart and the Green Lantern Corps arrive to help save Earth and the universe.\n\nFaced with the wider universe becoming increasingly troubled by the Green Lanterns' existence after the chaos of recent events, Hal Jordan decides to act as a scapegoat, going on the run with Krona's prototype gauntlet so that the rest of the Corps can denounce him as a renegade and redeem their own reputation. However, this plan doesn't last long as the majority of the Corps are transported to the universe before ours where Relic came from. They arrive during the War of the Dwindling Light and the universe about to end. There they encounter a time displaced Krona and a younger Relic as allies fighting against all Lightsmiths of that dying universe. Six months on and with days till the end of the universe they encounter a planet Perduron with the Last City housing refugees. They help Marniel who leads them defeat the Blackest Knights Ausras and Dismas. The Last City is moved to Mogo and Perduron destroyed. What remains of the Corps enters a tear in space that they hope will return them home. It is unclear who/what transported them to the universe before.\n\nHal Jordan although a fugitive continues to help people, discovering the Corps gone, he tries to become a one-man corps with help from his ship's AI Darlene, plus ally Virgo and criminal Trapper. With worlds being turned into source wall rock, with help from Relic Hal discovers this is accidentally being done by Black Hand, who is defeated by being absorbed into the Source Wall. Hal also helps stop some Modoran terrorists on Earth and fights a version of himself as Parallax from another universe. With the Corps gone the Gray Agents attempt to takeover but are also stopped by Hal who then parts ways with his new allies/friends. Soon Hal is channeling enough Will has become the living embodiment of it and plans to save the Corps.\n\nThe Sinestro Corps takes over the Green Lantern's Corps role of 'protecting' the universe, by bringing order through fear. To do this Sinestro acquires War World from Mongul and bonds it with Ranx, he also creates an army of Sinestro Corps Manhunters. Sinestro also hires Lobo to deal with the other lantern corps, killing many red/indigo lanterns including human red lantern Rankorr, plus kidnapping Saint Walker. The Sinestro Corps moment as replacement protectors comes against The Paling anti-emotion religious monks called Pale Vicars who turn people into emotionless followers. With help from Black Adam, Sinestro discovers that they are led by the Pale Bishop a former Guardian of the Universe who turned his back on his kind when they started to use the Emotional Spectrum. Sinestro uses his all assets against The Paling including Saint Walker who can now supercharge Sinestro Corps rings and also giving out temporary yellow rings to many heroes/villains of Earth such as Superman and Wonder Woman. Sinestro fights the Pale Bishop directly and successfully kills the Guardian but this leaves him severely weakened. The Sinestro Corps is praised for saving the Earth and the galaxy, even thanked by members of the Justice League. Sinestro gives leadership of this corps over to his daughter former Green Lantern Soranik Natu, who makes Arkillo partnered with Saint Walker lanterns assigned to Earth sector. A weakened Sinestro is happy that his corps is now what he always wanted the Green Lantern Corps to be. Soon after the Sinestro Corps successfully deals with many threats to the galaxy including the reborn Red Lanterns.\n\nWith no Corps Kyle Rayner tries to single handily bring peace to the Vega System then after being kidnapped he joins the Omega Men. He helps fight The Citadel as the 'Omega Lantern', after 182 days the Omega War is over with The Citadel defeated with Vega liberated.\n\nHal returns as Green Lantern again after abandoning the prototype gauntlet due to its energies starting to transform him into a living construct, although he uses his new powers to forge a new power ring from Will itself for himself. Hal now equipped with his self-constructed power ring is a one-man corps searching for the rest of the Green Lanterns and hunting down the Sinestro Corps.\n\nHal returns to Earth temporarily to assign Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz the task of protecting Earth, he takes their Power Batteries and fuses them into a single battery to help the two bond as Lantern partners.\n\nThe Green Lantern Corps returns in a distant part of the universe where Guy Gardner is sent out to scout their location. The fight to return to their own universe and time has cost the Lanterns over ninety percent of their fighting force in deaths and injuries. They are currently at 412 active Lanterns.\n\nThe Sinestro Corps has moved Warworld into the former place of Oa where a dying Sinestro is rejuvenated by bonding with Parallax and explains he used his daughter to gain the trust of the universe so now he could inflict great fear on the universe to establish order. He then creates a fear engine giving great power to himself and his corps maintained by Sacrament Priests.\n\nHal takes on several Yellow Lanterns and gets injured but he is healed by Soranik, Sinestro's daughter. Soranik finds yellow lanterns loyal to her and saves the captives of the fear engine including Guy Gardner who was being tortured. Hal Jordan then confronts Sinestro where he uses his new living construct powers to seemingly kill himself, Sinestro, Lyssa Drak and Warworld.\n\nGanthet and Sayd return to discover Hal's ring and summon Kyle Rayner the White Lantern to use his life powers to restore Hal to life. Hal meets Abin Sur in the Emerald Space where lanterns go when they die and tells him to save Hope, soon he is restored to life and reunited with the corps.\n\nOn Earth Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz battle the Red Lantern Corps who create a Hell Tower on Earth infecting people with rage. During this Simon develops a new power called Emerald Sight being able to see the future and also do the impossible again by briefly curing Bleez of rage. Although they destroy the Hell Tower believing they won, the Red Lanterns were able to plant a Rage Seed in the Earth's core to one day bring about Red Dawn the birth of a new Rage entity.\n\nSoon after the Green Lanterns join up with Soranik's loyal yellow lanterns to defend the planet Xudar from Starro only to be bottled by a Brainiac controlled by Larfleeze. After tricking Larfleeze they escape who then flees, save Xudar and announce going forward the two corps will try to work together.\n\nGreen Lanterns and Sinestro Corps members are partnered up so the two corps can reluctantly begin working together, their first joint mission is to round up any remaining Sinestro Corps members and give them a choice, join work with the Green Lanterns or be jailed. Thanks to information from Space Cabbie all senior members of the Sinestro Corps are captured, killed or jailed. Most prominently Arkillo joins after being horrifically beaten in a non-power ring hand-to-hand fight by Guy Gardner, bringing most in line.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyle and Hal retrieve Saint Walker for the Ganthet and Sayd to save Hope. Kyle uses his White Lantern powers of Life in conjunction with Walker's Hope to try to resurrect the Blue Lantern Corps. Some sort of mysterious intruder blocks this attempt and causes Kyle's White Lantern ring to be torn asunder back into seven separate rings. Kyle only retains his original GL ring and is once again a Green Lantern in his classic costume.\n\nThe building of a new Sinestro Corps power battery on Mogo is interrupted by the arrival of Time Master Rip Hunter stating the Green Lantern Corps has ceased to exist in the future. A criminal from the future named Sarko an advocate of fear wants to prevent the successful future alliance between the Corps when the Sinestro Corps ultimately joins the Green Lantern Corps and yellow fear ceases to be. Sarko attacks with Corps with Prism Beasts impervious to harm as they were created by Krona's Gauntlet left by Hal Jordan. Hal and Rip confront Sarko and a now sentient gauntlet, where Hal recovers and breaks the present day gauntlet, and its overload killing Sarko. However Kyle using a future Green Lantern ring from Rip discovers that Sarko was his and Soranik's possible future son.\n\nThe alliance next thwarts Bolphunga and the Cepheid Raiders from stealing from planet Vault, Bolphunga then attempts blackmailing them claiming to have footage of a Green Lantern murdering a Sinestro Corps member. Although Guy Gardner and Arkillo recover the footage and defeat the raiders, it reveals that Tomar-Tu murdered the surrendering child killer Romat-Ru. Elsewhere Kyle is punishing for Soranik to become a Green Lantern again to avoid the future Sarko came from. Soranik decides to do an autopsy on Sarko to explain Kyle's interest in him, discovering it was her future son and his body fades away. She confronts Kyle for hiding this, that she cut up her own child, in rage she destroys her green lantern ring and brands Kyle with the mark of the Sinestro Corps. Hal attempts to help Tomar-Tu, but he accepts that he broke the law and must face punishment. To ensure the alliance can continue John Stewart decides to come clean about this rather than cover it up. Sinestro Corps members attempt to kill Tomar-Tu but are later calmed until Soranik arrives. Soranik declares the alliance over for lying to them and a lantern murdering one of hers, stating that she will embrace Fear, her father's legacy and no longer be Soranik Natu but Soranik Sinestro. John Stewart accepts any Sinestro Corps members loyal to the Green Lantern Corps who are quickly labelled traitors. As the Corps battle John Stewart activates a safety measure he built into the new Sinestro Corps power battery, a green impunity making them ineffective against willpower as a result Soranik and her Corps leave. The Sinestro Corps power battery is dismantled, The loyal Sinesgtro Corps members are made Green Lanterns, while Tomar-Tu is taken away to be imprisoned but not before sending his ring to find a new Xudarian green lantern, hoping one day to redeem himself. As a result Sarko had changed history keeping the two Corps apart, but not only that; on Qward is is revealed that Lyssa Drak and a heavily injured Sinestro have survived.\n\nSimon and Jessica encounter Rami the rogue guardian, exiled by the guardians for creating the Phantom Ring a ring created that can channel any light and can be used by any bearer. It is also revealed that Rami created the first Green Lantern rings to fight the First Lantern Volthoom.\n\nFrank Laminski, a man obsessed with becoming a Green Lantern and who was almost chosen by Simon's ring, acquires the Phantom Ring becoming the Phantom Lantern thanks to help from a ghost like remnant of Volthoom. The Phantom Ring shifts depending on which emotion the wearer is feeling most strongly, creating the risk of them becoming compromised by the ring's power. As well as this, the ring does not have an external battery but relies on the wearer's own life-energy, creating the risk that they would destroy themselves if they push themselves too far. Laminski almost kills Simon and Jessica when he confronts them after trying to act as a hero, his greed and anger causing him to tap into the Red and Orange rings, but when he is forced to face the damage he has done, he reverts to an indigo ring long enough to remove the ring himself. Laminski is taken in custody vowing to get his Phantom Ring back. Meanwhile, Rami is captured by Volthoom who transfers himself into Rami's body unknown to Jessica and Simon.\n\nSimon begins to help Jessica with her anxiety, helping with normal everyday life. While teaming with Batman, the pair help battle Scarecrow using a fear energy machine he had constructed when previously wearing Sinestro Corps rings. Batman also convinces Simon to give up his gun, and remarking this is the Green Lantern he has been waiting to work with for a very long time.\n\nThrough flashback it is revealed how Volthoom survived Nekron and his origin. Originally from Earth-15 he and his mother created the Travel Lantern powered by the emotional spectrum to travel in space, time and dimensions. Volthoom used it to travel the Multiverse to find a way to save his Earth from The Destroyer Pulsar. Volthoom traveled to Earth-3 where Mordru fused a piece of his soul to create a power ring - The Ring of the Volthoom, the same one recently wielded by Jessica. He discovered the future Guardians who with his help built their first lantern, The Great Heart storing their emotional souls into it and declaring the first oath:\n\nAs a result, the First Ring was created, taken by Volthoom with the Great Heart implanted in his chest. When Rami and the Guardians turned on him they destroyed the Travel Lantern preventing him from saving his home. As a result, The First Seven Green Lantern rings were made and later defeated Volthoom trapping him in the Chamber of Shadows. After the events of the Wraith of the First Lantern, Nekron reveals to Volthoom in the Dead Zone that he cannot kill him due to his permanent connection to the emotional spectrum and that as long as there is light in the universe he cannot die. With his return to life he is drawn to Rami and the Phantom Ring to get his revenge.\n\nAfter battling Doctor Polaris and saving Gateway City from a collision with the Justice League Watchtower, having learned about Rami, Corps Leader John Stewart summons Simon and Jessica to Mogo.\n\nFaced with the threat of Volthoom, Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz travel back in time to the early days of the Green Lantern Corps, where they join forces with the first seven Green Lanterns- each of whom had initially assumed they were the only people to wield a ring in the universe- to face the power of Volthoom as he mounts his first assault on Oa.\n\nIn the future shown in the \"\" miniseries, it is revealed that Mogo has been long dead. Without him, there is no way to distribute the rings; thus, there is no Green Lantern Corps in the 31st century. Rond Vidar was the last Green Lantern until he was killed by Superboy-Prime. Sodam Yat is the last Guardian of the Universe, living on the now ruined Oa. Previews for \"Legion of 3 Worlds\" #3 show Yat taking on several rings of the fallen Lanterns with a new oath:\n\nAfter aiding the Legions in defeating Prime and his forces, Yat realizes the universe needs to fight such threats. Going back to Oa, he sends rings across the universe to recruit a new Green Lantern Corps.\n\nA mysterious creature called the Dyogene is sent by Yat to recruit an Earth Green Lantern after incorrectly picking Kirt Niedrigh, also called Earth-Man, and failing to get Harmonia Li to join. Mon-El is chosen to become a Green Lantern. Later he gives up the ring because he is also field leader of the Legion of Super-Heroes.\n\nIn the original Legion continuity, the Green Lantern Corps were banned from Earth, thanks to the actions of the Green Lantern who became the Legion adversary, Universo. With recent alterations to this future continuity, it is unclear if this ban still exists. Similarly, the Guardians were revealed as still on Oa in the original continuity; their fate in the revised continuity has yet to be revealed.\n\nThe power ring must be recharged regularly (though apparently not at the standard 24-hour period as was originally described) by touching it to its lantern-shaped power battery for a period of several seconds. When recharging their rings, some Corps members recite an oath. This oath differs from Corps member to member, but the most popular seems to be Hal Jordan's.\n\nAs the embodiment of willpower which is connected to the green light of the Emotional Spectrum, Ion was revealed to be actually the emotional entity for the Green Lantern Corps. Representing the stability of willpower, Ion serves to support its host, providing a vast supply of power in return for the willpower it is provided by its host. Ethan Van Sciver describes Ion as resembling a large, primitive whale or fish. Born when life first moved of its own accord, the entity itself has several physical characteristics emulated by the Guardians and their Corps. Ion also has a monk fish-like appendage that ends in a lantern-like lure. Ion was later captured by Krona and joined the rogue Guardian on his quest to take control of the Green Lantern Corps, by possessing one of the remaining six Guardians of the Universe. Ion was eventually free from Krona's control when the rogue Guardian was killed by Hal Jordan and is once again at large in the universe.\n\nIon has since returned to the Green Central Power Battery, only leaving it when the battery itself forcefully removed the green entity from it because it was suffering from a strange illness. When Relic, a native of a prior version of spacetime, began a quest to prevent the harnessing the Emotional Electromagnetic Spectrum energy, he revealed that the Emotional Spectrum had a reservoir that was becoming exhausted and it would eventually destroy the Universe. After Relic wiped out the Blue Lantern Corps and forcefully drained the green light from Oa's Central Power Battery and destroying the planet in the process, Ion sacrifices himself by passing into the Source Wall in order for the reservoir to be refilled.\n\nThe Book of Oa is a massive tome, located on Oa. In it is the history of the Guardians of the Universe and the Green Lantern Corps. The current keeper of the book is Salaak.\n\nThe Corps is an organization of 7200+ Green Lanterns (the old Corps was composed of 3600) who are chosen by the ring for being able to overcome great fear, with two assigned to each sector of space that require the protection of more than one Green Lantern (Earth, home to Hal Jordan and John Stewart, is in Sector 2814). Heavily populated Sectors like 2814 can have several Lanterns. While the primary Lanterns of Sector 2814 are Hal Jordan and John Stewart, Kyle Rayner and Guy Gardner call Earth home, but are stationed on Oa, first as teachers, and then specially assigned to cases that are too difficult for the average lantern. The official number of active Lanterns apparently does not include backup members who are kept in reserve to be called to active duty on short notice in the event that the regular Lantern in their particular sector is not available. In the original organization, the active list was apparently kept at a strict maximum considering John Stewart was not mobilized during the Nekron crisis despite the situation's dire nature, as opposed to Guy Gardner who was medically unfit for duty at that time. Despite the vast number of Green Lanterns, certain sectors of space apparently do not recognize the authority of the Corps, as alien superhero Icon claims that his status as a citizen of the interstellar civilization known as the Cooperative makes him immune to prosecution from Guardians or their agents.\n\nEach member has a great deal of autonomy as to their methods in their jurisdiction, subject to review by the Guardians if they feel the Green Lantern in question has abused their assigned authority. The individual Lanterns are responsible for arranging their replacements (when possible) if they are near retirement or death. If a Lantern dies before that obligation is met, the ring will find and seek another trainee on its own. The planet-sized Green Lantern named Mogo plays a key role in this, helping to direct the rings to suitable recruits. For this reason, the Sinestro Corps tried to destroy Mogo during the Sinestro Corps War. In rare circumstances, Guardians will personally go out into the field to recruit a replacement, via telepresence. The recruitment of backup Lanterns is more ambiguous with different criteria such as the second closest worthy candidate to the dying Lantern in an emergency search is automatically designated, such as the case of Guy Gardner. When the sector's Lantern was still active, the Guardian would make a selection of a backup on their own, as with John Stewart's recruitment after Gardner was injured in an accident. Hal Jordan disagreed with this selection upon seeing Stewart's apparently belligerent attitude, but the Guardians stood by the decision and the recruit quickly proved himself.\n\nUpon recruitment each Green Lantern in the original Corps received a Power Ring, a Power Battery shaped like a lantern (with which the ring is recharged), and a uniform. The default uniform design for humanoids was a green section covering the torso and shoulders, black arms and leggings, green boots, white gloves, green domino mask, and a chest symbol of a stylized Green Lantern icon on a white circle. Lanterns were allowed to customize their uniforms as long as the color scheme and the symbol were present. When the nature of the being precludes a standard uniform, an equivalent arrangement is expected as a substitute. For instance, Mogo, a sentient planet, arranges his foliage to create a green circling band and lantern symbol on his body. Jack T. Chance, a humanoid, refused to wear a uniform, but conceded to wearing a badge on the lapel of his coat. Lanterns were also allowed the option of a secret identity as a security measure and it is implied that the Corps were instructed to honor that choice by taking care not to expose them. Training in the use of the ring was optional and appropriate facilities and personnel were available on Oa upon request. In addition, a senior Lantern can be assigned to coach a recruit while in the field in their sector.\n\nThe New Green Lantern Corps being built by the Guardians is far more formal and structured than the old one that was destroyed by Parallax. Recruits, after being found by their Power Rings, are taken to Oa for training. Not all recruits will make it through training - indeed a great many of them might even fail, forcing the ring to find another candidate. Lantern trainees have a simplified version of the old Green Lantern uniform (with green covering more of the torso) with the white circle on their chest blank until the Lantern insignia is added upon completion of their training. Additionally, all Power Rings, not just the ring assigned to the interim Green Lantern Kyle Rayner, now work on the color yellow, provided the user can feel the fear behind the color and overcome it.\n\nSalakk was selected as senior administrator and the Keeper of the Book of Oa. Due to this he was also selected as the Clarissi which means he is second in command after the Guardians of Oa.\n\nKilowog and Stel act as head drill sergeant of the Green Lantern Corps. Voz is the jailer and Morro is keeper of the crypt.\n\nGreen Lantern Corps headquarters are on the planet Oa, in the center of the universe. Oa was destroyed shortly after Hal Jordan became Parallax, but was later reconstituted by Jordan's friend Thomas Kalmaku. Formerly a natural if barren planet, the reconstructed Oa is now a vast labyrinthine planet-sized construct. Primary features include a great hall for the Guardians to meet in conference, training facilities for recruits, prisons called Sciencells for dangerous criminals, and tombs dedicated to honoring fallen lanterns. Oa's most prominent feature is the Central Power Battery, a gigantic version of the Lanterns' personal power batteries. The central battery channels the same green energy of the Guardians and amplifies it, broadcasting energy to the individual power batteries across the universe which can then be used to charge the Lanterns' power rings. Particularly dangerous beings, such as Sinestro or Parallax, are sometimes imprisoned within the central battery. Maintaining security on this device is vital as major damage to it would prevent individual Corpsmen throughout the universe from recharging their power rings, thus depowering the entire Corps in a single blow.\n\nThe Guardians increased the capabilities of Oa's defensive systems by creating an armored structure that protects the planet, but this was destroyed during the preludes to the Blackest Night storyline.\n\nAfter the final battle with the First Lantern, the Guardians guarding Volthroom have taken up the position of Guardians of the Universe under the new name \"Templar Guardians\" and rule with love and compassion. The last two Guardians of the Universe Ganthet and Sayd however were exiled by from Oa by Sinestro who was possessed by Parallax.\n\nThe Green Lantern Honor Guard is an elite group of Green Lanterns, based on Oa but not restricted to one sector, who serve as leaders of the Corps, troubleshooters and special operatives.\n\nThe title and mantle of Honor Guard was first introduced in issue #1 of the three part miniseries \"Tales of the Green Lantern Corps\". Amongst their rank were three elite Corps members; Tomar-Re, K'ryssma and Apros who lead three division of the Corps against the armies of the undead. In issue #3 the Guardians promote Green Lantern Hal Jordan as the first human to receive the honor for his heroic actions in leading the Corps in the defeat of Krona and Nekron.\n\nJordan, although flattered, declines the honor, maintaining that he should be seen as “no different than any other ring-slinger” who did “what any Green Lantern would have done given the chance!” Adding that \"When it comes right down to it, I guess I'm just one of the gang\" and so he remains, to the cheers of his fellow Corps mates.\n\nGreen Lantern Guy Gardner was promoted to primary membership in the Honor Guard as Lantern number one during the \"Green Lantern Corps: Recharge\" miniseries. Guy also serves as field commander during battle. In the aftermath of the Sinestro Corps War, with the Ion entity removed from his body, Kyle Rayner has been added to the Green Lantern Honor Guard as Guy's partner. In the \"Green Lantern Corps\" issue #48, John Stewart was introduced as Kyle Rayner's new partner in the Honor Guard, with Guy Gardner leaving to a new comic book called \"Emerald Warriors\".\n\nJohn Stewart, Soranik Natu, Ganthet, Hannu, Boodikka were promoted to Green Lantern Honor Guard after they freed the Grendians and Alpha Lanterns from Cyborg Superman.\n\nDuring the Rise of the Third Army the highest rank a Green Lantern can achieve was awarded to Guy Gardner, the rank of Sentinel. A Sentinel outranks the Honor Guard and Salakk as senior administrator, only getting orders directly from the Guardians. However, this role was only temporary, as the Guardians mainly inducted him into this role to make his subsequent fall all the more significant, releasing an old enemy of Guy's while he was acting as a bodyguard so that his attention would be divided.\n\n\"The Corpse\" is an elite, top-secret Black Ops division of the Green Lantern Corps. Members of The Corpse are not restricted by the same rules that regular Lanterns follow, and they perform the darkest, most dangerous missions and are allowed to use lethal force. These members do not use Power Rings; instead, they swallow special coin-like disks that give them all of the powers of the standard ring with a charge that lasts five earth days. These disks produce purple energy instead of the traditional green. Members of the \"Corpse\" do not wear Green Lantern uniforms, or display the Green Lantern symbol. Instead, they seem to prefer black uniforms that have no symbol.\n\nVery few Lanterns are even aware of the existence of the \"Corpse\". Guy Gardner said that in all of his years in the Corps, he never heard of them and after participating in a mission with the Corpse, his memory of them was erased. With the recent authorization of lethal force for the Corps in the aftermath of the Sinestro Corps War, the future and necessity of the Corpse remains unknown.\n\nVon Daggle, the only Durlan to serve in the Green Lantern Corps, was the former leader of The Corpse, after the rise of the Third Army and death of the Guardians, Von Daggle appears to be the last member. On the run and hiding from his own people Von Daggle is once more recruited to serve the Green Lantern Corps to help defeat the Durlan Uprising.\n\nWhether part of The Corpse or a separate part of the corps, there were also Deep Undercover Green Lantern Operatives observing areas that technically Green Lanterns were not allowed to go. Jediah Caul was one such agent who worked in Lady Styx's Tenebrian Dominion.\n\nAfter the Sinestro Corps War, the Guardians create a new class of Green Lantern called the Alpha Lanterns. The Alpha Lanterns are seasoned Corpsmen who have been fused with their Power Rings and Batteries. Boodikka, Varix, Kraken, Green Man, and Chaselon are all confirmed Alpha Lanterns; John Stewart was offered the chance to become an Alpha Lantern, but turned it down because he felt that he knew too little about the concept of the Alpha Lanterns to accept the offer. Geoff Johns stated in an interview with IGN that the Alpha Lanterns function as Internal Affairs for the Green Lantern Corps. The concept of the Alpha Lantern Corps was conceived by Grant Morrison.\n\nFollowing the events of the Blackest Night, it is revealed that some, if not all of the Alpha Lanterns have been recruited against their will. The Alpha Lanterns have been subverted by the Cyborg Superman and have turned many Lanterns into Alphas against their will. This is a bid to capture Ganthet, who knows much about their internal systems. The Cyborg, who is mostly Alpha himself, hopes that if Ganthet discovers how to turn the Alphas back to normal, the Cyborg can become human and thus die himself. After Henshaw is defeated, the Alpha Lanterns are restored with insights, values, and priorities and given a semblance of their free will, thanks to Ganthet.\n\nWhen Krona along with the emotional entities launched his attack on Oa, attacking the six of the remaining Guardians (Ganthet working in the Anti-Matter universe at the time), by having them possessed by all the entities except for Parallax, who is placed inside the Central Power Battery. With the yellow impurity returned to the green light, all of the Green Lanterns - with the apparent exception of Hal Jordan, Kyle Rayner, John Stewart, Kilowog and Guy Gardner - are placed under Krona's control; the Alpha Lanterns are affected by the yellow impurity in such a way as to cause them to enter into some kind of hibernation.\n\nAfter Krona's death, the Guardians went into deliberation on the future of the Corps when Sinestro was chosen by a Green Lantern Power Ring. Following acts of insubordination amongst the Green Lanterns, the Guardians ordered all Corps members to return to their assigned sectors and missions. Only the Honor Guard, Alpha Lanterns and support staff were allowed to remain on Oa at this time.\n\nWhen John Stewart was forced to kill fellow Lantern Kirrt after he was broken by the Keepers' interrogation and was about to give them the information on Oa's planetary shield codes, his death was later registered as a Code GLD that led to the Alpha Lanterns congregating at the Chambers of The Alpha Lanterns where they agreed to commence the arraingement despite their actions causing a possible uproar in the Corps. They later struck at Warriors Bar in order to place John Stewart under arrest The Alpha Lanterns took him for a court appearance before the collective Corps and The Guardians of the Universe to contemplate the evidence against him. Ultimately, it was concluded that Stewart was guilty and the Alpha Lanterns decided on the judgement of death for his crime. They believed this decision would prevent any future Green Lantern from conducting a similar act. The decision of the Alpha Lanterns was met with opposition from the Green Lantern Corps. As a result, the cybernetic Lanterns decided to not imprison Stewart in a normal detention cell but leave him confined in the Alpha Tower until his time of execution.\n\nAfterwards, they met with the Guardians of The Universe and newly promoted Sentinel Guy Gardner. The Oans whilst not happy with the decision ultimately decided to agree with the Alpha Lanterns decision. Upon believing the Guardians approval, the Alpha Lanterns wanted the Oans to collectively execute Stewart. This approach was refused and the Alpha Lanterns offered an alternative of bringing in an offworld executioner. However, this approach was also refused in an angry outburst by Gardner who left but not before telling the Alpha Lantern Corps to execute Stewart themselves if they had sentenced him to that fate. The Guardians did not condone Gardner's behavior but believed his words rang true and told the Alpha Lanterns to conduct the sentence. Following that point, Gardner went to the Alpha Tower where he was escorted by Boodikka in order to provide a final meal to Lantern Stewart. Whilst being monitored, the Alpha Lanterns did not anticipate a breakout attempt by the rest of the Green Lantern Corps where Stewart was taken. Whilst battling Green Lanterns, the Alpha Lanterns tapped into the Central Power Battery and forcibly removed the charge from their opponents Power Rings.\n\nFollowing that point, the Alpha Lanterns pressed their advantage but the two renegade Earth Lanterns unleashed reprogrammed Manhunters against them. In addition, the Alpha Lanterns faced a renewed assault from the rest of the Green Lantern Corps who had been freed from the Sciencells. The cyborg Alpha Lanterns ended up fighting a renewed assault from both sides and saw them unite to defeat an amalgam composite of a massive Manhunter. Once destroyed, they continued their attack against Stewart and Gardner where they successfully managed to capture them. With the rogue Manhunters defeated, the cybernetic Alpha Lanterns proceeded to drain the Power Rings of the Green Lantern Corps of their charge where they intended to punish all the Lanterns for their dissent. With the Earth Lanterns captive, the Alpha Lanterns proceeded with their judgement only for Varix to turn against his cybernetic brethren. He freed Stewart and Gardner whereupon the pair dismantled the Alpha Lantern Corps and killed them. This left Varix the only Alpha Lantern left and he terminated himself as he believed he along with his comrades had disgraced the Green Lantern Corps. Afterwards, the bodies of Varix and the Alpha Lanterns were interned in the Crypt of the Green Lantern Corps but were shown prior to their transformation into cyborgs.\n\nWhile the Alpha Lanterns were a subdivision of the Green Lantern Corps, they had an oath of their own:\n\nThe Keepers was the name given to a race of humanoid beings that inhabited the planet Urak. These skeletal beings native world was a barren world where their race struggled to exist. Their existence changed when their homeworld was visited by the Guardians of the Universe who were seeking a place that would serve as a storage ground for the Green Lantern Power Batteries. This came after it became apparent that members of the Green Lantern Corps began to suffer when their Power Rings ran out of charge. Thus, the Oans sought out a means of addressing this issue by providing easy access between a Green Lantern and their Power Rings. They learnt that the unique properties of Urak allowed for a temporal conduit between a Power Battery and Power Ring whereupon they made a pact with the native species. In exchange for rebuilding their world, the race would act as protectors and custodians of the Power Batteries that were stored in the Emerald Plains. Thus, the native inhabitants of Urak became known as the Keepers due to their new role. The unique composition of their homeworld led to the Power Batteries growing as if they were crops within the Emerald Fields. Though they held an important role in the Green Lantern Corps, their existence was not known to the Green Lanterns with even their Power Rings unable to identify the species.\nThese conditions, however, led to a form of symbiosis as the Power Batteries provided energy that nourished Urak and fed its people. The energy of Willpower was thus infused into the singular DNA of the Keepers and provided them an amazingly potent force of will. As a result, they became beings that possessed an innate reserve of willpower which was overwhelming and not in proportion with their relatively common forms. This trait made their armor completely immune to the effects of Lantern Energy Construct that derived from Willpower in the Emotional Spectrum. Their strength of will made them capable of actually willing their own bodies to shut down and kill themselves. The lush homeworld allowed their race to prosper as shepherds in this role. Events changed for the race in 2012 when the Oans arrived on Urak and removed all the Power Batteries from the Keepers care who they referred to as undeserving parasites. This act led to Urak returning to its formerly barren existence with the Keepers struggling to simply survive, so they begin to attack another planets in order to steal their resources.\n\nThe First Lantern is a mysterious being that stirs within imprisonment, sealed in the Chamber of Shadows for billions of years by the Guardians of the Universe. The Guardians (who have become unemotional) decided the Green Lantern Corps had failed as an interstellar police force due to their emotions and free will and it was time to replace them, so they traveled to the Chamber of Shadows to pull the First Lantern out; however as they reach the Chamber of Shadows they had to battle another group of Oans that were tasked with guarding the enigmatic First Lantern, even from the Guardians themselves. Despite heavy resistance, the Guardians take the First Lantern, who is able to recognize the Guardians and demands to be let out to no avail, and travel to Earth where they use the DNA of the First Lantern along with their own flesh to create a horde of infectious warriors, known as the Third Army. The imprisoned First Lantern tells them that they will regret what they had done and that he will escape. As the Third Army spread over the universe destroying all life and free will, the Guardians told the First Lantern that once the Third Army completes their control over the whole universe, there will be no need for him. Meanwhile, Black Hand reanimated the elder Oan (who was killed by the Guardians) for information about where the Guardians have put him in, but he is only told that the First Lantern is a danger of the universe. When the Guardians realize they cannot completely control the universe and need more of the Third Army, they use more of the power of the First Lantern, without realizing that the First Lantern's prison is breaking. While Hal Jordan and Sinestro are trapped in the Dead Zone, they encounter Tomar-Re (who was undead in the Dead Zone) and tells them to stop the First Lantern, before he goes about bringing changes to reality in history. It is eventually explained that the First Lantern was a mysterious explorer named Volthoom from an unknown time and universe, who had reach this universe during the beginning of Krona's experiment to observe of the origins of the universe. Volthoom had apparently unlocked the power of the Emotional spectrum as he came with a power battery of he's own (later revealed to be the \"Travel Lantern\") and taught what he knew about the Emotional Electromagnetic Spectrum energy to the Guardians of the Universe. As they scrambled to copy his gifts using technology, the Maltusians forsook their emotions, casting them into a device of their own creation, \"The Great Heart\". As a result of the influx of power and energy a ring was created, the very first Power Ring which they would use in conjunction with Volthoom's own power battery to allow him to return to his home. However, because the power battery was a direct connection to the emotional spectrum and had no intermediary battery, no safety regulators and no modulators, Volthoom became corrupted by its powers and took them for himself. Now able to harness any color of the emotional spectrum, Volthoom dismayed the Guardians of the Universe and renaming himself as the First Lantern, he began killing millions of beings in the universe. In order to fight back, the Guardians created the Manhunters and also released simultaneously the first seven Green Lantern rings to scan for possible users. Volthoom was eventually stripped from his power and sealed in an unbreakable chamber and wrote out of their history. A number of Guardians remained behind to ensure that the First Lantern was kept imprisoned forever and became known as The Hidden Ones.\n\nEventually the Guardians of the Universe inadvertently ended releasing a vengefully First Lantern from his prison. His freedom affected all the combatants on Oa where he captured the Guardians and began torturing Ganthet to see the mistakes in his life and reasoning on why these mistakes were made. However, Volthoom's power was greatly weakened by the Oans tapping into it and thus he was not able to affect reality. Thus, he reabsorbed his power from the Third Army leading it to dissipating into dust whereupon he decided he needed reservoirs of emotional energy of sentient beings. As a result, Volthoom began to go through his captured foes in order to tap into their memories and torture them emotionally. Among those that suffered this invasive process was Guy Gardner, Kyle Rayner, John Stewart, Carol Ferris, Hal Jordan and Atrocitus. In addition he needed to feed on great sources of emotional energy which he gained first from the destruction of Korugar and later by claiming the Great Heart on Maltus. With his powers at their height, Volthoom then reclaims the First Ring that Ganthet had kept within himself. With the intent of using the Central Power Battery as a conduit he would be able to alter the fabric of reality and conquer all of creation. However, he faced the combined might of all the warriors from the Emotional Spectrum. These included the vengeful Sinestro, who was angry over the destruction of his homeworld and bonded with the Parallax Entity. In addition, the recently deceased Hal Jordan returned as a Black Lantern and awoke Nekron from his prison in the Dead Zone. He utilized The Lord of The Dead to weaken Volthoom by separating him of his connection to the Emotional Spectrum, which, after Nekron sliced him in half, ultimately led to his defeat.\n\nYet while his body was destroyed, Volthoom's psychic energy still lives on and is now guiding Frank Laminski, to use the Phantom Ring, which allow the user to harness any color of the emotional spectrum. He also captured the exiled Guardian of the Universe Rami, the creator of the Phantom Ring and the first seven Green Lanterns Rings and Volthoom's former-old friend, and after a tremendous fight he trapped Rami's essence in an energy sphere and took possession of Rami's own body. Now under the guise of Rami, he plans on training Jessica Cruz and Simon Baz for his own agenda.\n\nMore recently it is discovered that after being defeated and slain by Nekron, Volthoom went to the Dead Zone, where he reveals his history to Nekron. He hails from Earth 15, and by the year 3079 his world was about to be destroyed (the result of Superboy Prime attack during the Countdown to Final Crisis). As a result of the impending doom surrounding his planet and his way of life, Volthoom and his mother (both being scientists) had already discovered the Emotional Electromagnetic Spectrum together and invented a device known as \"the Travel Lantern\", which was an \"experimental device for infinite exploration\" with the ability to use the energies that compromise the emotional spectrum to travel between the different alternate earths of DC Universe. In order to find a way to save their planet, Volthoom used the Travel Lantern and began jumpping from universe to universe (Earth-3 included, where he meets the wizard Mordru, who fused a piece of Volthoom's own soul to create Power Ring's ring), before finally arriving in Earth 0 10 billion years in the past. After recounting his history to Nekron, Volthoom pleads with him to end his life. However, Nekron reveals that he cannot as Volthoom's bond with the Emotional Spectrum is profound and permanent, meaning that as long as there is light in the universe, he will never die, and as Nekron says this, Volthoom is immediately pulled back to Earth 0.\n\nIn the present day, Volthoom under the guise of Rami, Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz are eventually called to Oa by the Green Lantern Corps, and while there he is able to elude Ganthet and Sayd that he is the real Rami. He then is able to read several pages from the Book of Oa and discovers that while his Travel Lantern was destroyed, the device was used to built the first seven Green Lantern Rings. With this knowledge, he began plotting into find the rings in order to apparently use them to return to his own time and universe. He was able to discover that the rings are being hold in the Vault of Shadows where its keeper, the Mighty Tyran'r (one of the original seven Green Lanterns, and the only one alive) eventually discovers Volthoom's ruse. Volthoom however is able to prevent Tyran'r from revealed the truth to Simon and Jessica. It is also revealed that 10 billion years ago, in order to help Volthoom, Rami had used in secrecy the Travel Lantern to reach Earth-15 and seen with his own eyes Volthoom's planet at the moment it exploded, only to discover that it was Volthoom himself who actually went back in time to save his planet, but because he had gone mad, destroyed it instead. In order to spare Earth 15, Rami tried to keep the Travel Lantern and the first ring away from him. Enraged and corrupted literally by the powers of the entire Emotional Spectrum, Volthoom tries to force Rami, but the remaining Guardians of the Galaxy come to his aid. However, Volthoom kills many Guardians in his quest to find his travel lantern and ring. With no other choice, Rami destroys the Travel Lantern and uses it to forge the first seven Green Lantern Rings to harness the emotional spectrum color of green and willpower. Inside the Vault of Shadows, Volthoom is also able to locate the first ring and by donning it he sheds Rami from himself, although it is not clear what state Rami is in, and reveals himself to Jessica and Simon. He’s been de-aged and restored by the first ring and goes after Jessica Cruz, Simon is able to lock him in a prison but Volthoom is able to escape it while Jessica Cruz tends to Rami. Volthoom overpowers Simon Baz’s ring and destroys it. The reason Volthoom is after Jessica Cruz is because her Green Lantern ring is either fused with or made from Volthoom’s Travel Ring. Volthoom tries to reclaim Jessica's ring and was even able to access the ring's protocols, however, Jessica Cruz’s will is strong and she escapes with Simon Baz to some unknown place in the Universe. It was later revealed that both Green Lanterns were flung ten billion years in the past.\n\nThe Guardians of the Universe (who have become unemotional) were preparing to create the 'Third Army' to replace the Green Lantern Corps. The Guardians take the First Lantern away with them and teleport to Earth, where they used the power of the First Lantern to create the Third Army from their own flesh and will. The organic constructs have the ability to transform other beings into copies of themselves through direct contact.\n\nIt has been shown that they possess both enhanced strength and a collective intelligence which is shown during an attack on the Red Lanterns when Atrocitus stabs one of the Third Army in the eyes, where all the Third Army felt the pain. Some of the Third Army are destroyed by incineration with an explosive of a bomb. When the Third Army is sent to invade Zamaron, the Third Army is destroyed by White Lantern Kyle Rayner, who has mastered the seven powers of the emotional spectrum. When the First Lantern is freed from his imprisonment, he disintegrated all of the Third Army.\n\nThe First Seven are the predecessors of the Green Lantern Corps, assembled 10 billion years ago in order to bring Volthoom to justice.\n\nIn the universe prior to the current one, groups managed to tap into the wellspring of power created by the Emotional Spectrum. In this universe those who tapped into the green light were known as the Lightsmiths of the Green Light of Resolve.\n\nIn the comic book prequel to \"Injustice: Gods Among Us\", the Green Lantern Corps become the primary focus in Year Two. The Guardians, having heard of Superman's change and more forceful approach to enforce justice, send a squad of Green Lanterns to apprehend Superman and to bring him to Oa for trial. Superman, having been warned prematurely by Sinestro, as well as receiving aid from the Sinestro Corps, overpowers the squad, and forces them to relinquish their rings. This eventually forces a violent reaction from Ganthet, who proceeds to bring in a large amount of Green Lanterns as well as Mogo with him. Despite early advantages thanks to their numbers as well as the number of rioters within Earth, the Green Lanterns soon become overextended and are picked out individually because Superman's Regime brought civilians out to the front, knowing that the Green Lanterns would not attempt to harm them. Meanwhile, Superman, who was shot with a Kryptonite bullet by Black Canary, receives a Yellow Power ring, which he uses to extract the bullet, and he proceeds to kill Canary. With his powers further augmented, Superman proceeds to drive Ganthet and Mogo to the Earth's sun to end the war, and effectively wiping out nearly every Green Lantern that was involved in the war.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following writers have been involved in the ongoing \"Green Lantern Corps\" series:\nThis listing is for the “core” series or limited series to feature the Green Lantern Corps in their various incarnations over the years:\n\n\nSome of the stories have been collected into trade paperbacks:\n\n\n\n\n"

                "Tupac Shakur\n\nTupac Amaru Shakur ( ) (born Lesane Parish Crooks; June 16, 1971September 13, 1996), also known by his stage names 2Pac and Makaveli, was an American rapper, poet and actor. Shakur sold over 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time. His double disc albums \"All Eyez on Me\" (1996) and his \"Greatest Hits\" (1998) are among the best-selling albums in the United States. Shakur is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time and he has been listed and ranked as one of the greatest artists of any genre by many publications, including \"Rolling Stone\", which ranked him 86th on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. On April 7, 2017, Shakur was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.\n\nShakur began his career as a roadie, backup dancer and MC for the alternative hip hop group Digital Underground, eventually branching off as a solo artist. Most of the themes in Shakur's songs revolved around the violence and hardship in inner cities, racism, and other social issues. Both of his parents and several other people in his family were members of the Black Panther Party, whose ideals were reflected in his songs. During the latter part of his career, Shakur was a vocal participant during the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry, becoming involved in conflicts with other rappers, producers, and record-label staff members, most notably The Notorious B.I.G. and his label, Bad Boy Records. Aside from his career in music, Shakur was also an actor, starring in six films and one TV show in the 1990s, including \"Poetic Justice\" (1993), \"Gang Related\" (1997) and \"Gridlock'd\" (1997).\n\nOn September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times in a drive-by shooting at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where he died from his injuries six days later.\n\nShakur was born on June 16, 1971, in the East Harlem section of Manhattan in New York City. His birth name was Lesane Parish Crooks, but in 1972, he was renamed after Túpac Amaru II, the 18th-century Peruvian revolutionary who was executed after leading an indigenous uprising against Spanish rule. Shakur was African American.\n\nHis mother Afeni Shakur (born Alice Faye Williams in North Carolina) and his father Billy Garland were active members of the Black Panther Party in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Lesane was born a month after his mother was acquitted of more than 150 charges of \"Conspiracy against the United States government and New York landmarks\" in the New York Panther 21 trial.\n\nMany people in Shakur's life were involved with the Black Liberation Army; some were convicted of serious criminal offenses and imprisoned, including his mother. His godfather, Elmer \"Geronimo\" Pratt, a high-ranking Black Panther, was convicted of murdering a school teacher during a 1968 robbery, although his sentence was later overturned. His stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, spent four years at large on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list beginning in 1982. Mutulu was wanted for having helped his friend (no relation) Assata Shakur (also known as Joanne Chesimard), Tupac's godmother, to escape from a penitentiary in New Jersey in 1979. She had been imprisoned since 1977 for killing a state trooper in 1973. She lived as a fugitive for several years before gaining asylum in Cuba in 1985. Mutulu was caught in 1986 and eventually imprisoned for the 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck in which two police officers and a guard were killed.\n\nShakur had an older stepbrother, Mopreme \"Komani\" Shakur, and a half-sister, Sekyiwa, two years his junior. Mopreme performed in many of his recordings. In 1986, his family moved to Baltimore, Maryland. After completing his second year at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, he transferred to the Baltimore School for the Arts. There he studied acting, poetry, jazz, and ballet. He performed in Shakespeare plays and in the role of the Mouse King in the ballet \"The Nutcracker\". Shakur, accompanied by one of his friends, Dana \"Mouse\" Smith, as his beatbox, won many rap competitions and was considered to be the best rapper in his school. He was remembered as one of the most popular kids in his school because of his sense of humor, superior rapping skills, and ability to mix with all crowds.\n\nShakur developed a close friendship with Jada Pinkett (later Jada Pinkett Smith) that lasted until his death. In the documentary \",\" Shakur says, \"Jada is my heart. She will be my friend for my whole life.\" Pinkett Smith calls him \"one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime.\" A poem written by Shakur titled \"Jada\" appears in his book, \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete\", which also includes a poem dedicated to Pinkett Smith called \"The Tears in Cupid's Eyes.\" During his time in art school, Shakur became affiliated with the Baltimore Young Communist League USA. He began dating the daughter of the director of the local chapter of the Communist Party USA.\n\nIn 1988, Shakur and his family moved to Marin City, California, a suburban community located north of San Francisco. He attended Tamalpais High School in nearby Mill Valley. Shakur contributed to the school's drama department by performing in several productions. In an English class, Shakur wrote a paper, \"Conquering All Obstacles,\" in which he said: \"our raps, not the sorry story raps everyone is so tired of. They are about what happens in the real world. Our goal is [to] have people relate to our raps, making it easier to see what really is happening out there. Even more important, what we may do to better our world.\"\nHe began attending the poetry classes of Leila Steinberg in 1989. That same year, Steinberg organized a concert with a former group of Shakur's, \"Strictly Dope\"; the concert led to him being signed with Atron Gregory. He set him up as a roadie and backup dancer with the hip hop group Digital Underground in 1990.\n\nBefore using his first name as his rap name, Shakur went by the alias MC New York when starting his career in Baltimore.\nAlthough Shakur began recording in 1987, his professional entertainment career did not take off until the early 1990s when he debuted in Digital Underground's \"Same Song\" from the soundtrack to the 1991 film \"Nothing but Trouble\", and also appeared with the group in the film. The song was later released as the lead song of the Digital Underground extended play (EP) \"This Is an EP Release\", the follow-up to their debut hit album \"Sex Packets\". Shakur appeared in the accompanying music video. After his rap debut, he performed with Digital Underground again on the album \"Sons of the P\". Shakur went on to feature Shock G and Money-B from Digital Underground in his track \"I Get Around\", which ranked #11 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nIn November 1991, Shakur released his debut solo album, \"2Pacalypse Now\". Though the album did not generate any \"Top Ten\" hits, \"2Pacalypse Now\" is hailed by many critics and fans for its underground feel, with many rappers such as Nas, Eminem, Game, and Talib Kweli having pointed to it as inspiration. Although the album was originally released on Interscope Records, the rights to its distribution are now owned by Amaru Entertainment, the label owned by Shakur's mother. The album's name is a reference to the 1979 film \"Apocalypse Now\".\n\n\"2Pacalypse Now\" generated significant controversy for numerous reasons. The songs \"Trapped\" and \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies. Dan Quayle criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney claimed he was influenced by \"2Pacalypse Now\" and its theme of police brutality before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, \"There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society.\" Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood. He said, \"I started out saying I was down for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang,\" Shakur said. \"I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males. I just figured since I lived that life I could do that, I could rap about that.\" The record was important in showcasing Shakur's political conviction and his focus on lyrical prowess. On MTV's Greatest Rappers of All Time list, \"2Pacalypse Now\" was listed as one of Shakur's \"certified classic\" albums, along with \"Me Against the World\", \"All Eyez on Me\" and \"\". \"2Pacalypse Now\" went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. It featured three singles: \"Brenda's Got a Baby\", \"Trapped\", and \"If My Homie Calls\".\n\nHis second studio album, \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\", was released in February 1993. The album did better than its predecessor both critically and commercially, debuting at number 24 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album contains many tracks emphasizing Shakur's political and social views, and there are noticeable differences in production from his first effort. While \"2Pacalypse Now\" had an indie-rap-oriented sound, \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\" is generally considered Shakur's \"breakout\" album. It spawned the hits \"Keep Ya Head Up\" and \"I Get Around\" and reached platinum status. On vinyl, Side A (tracks 1–8) was labeled the \"Black Side\" and Side B (tracks 9–16) the \"Dark Side\". It is Shakur's tenth-biggest selling album, with 1,366,000 units moved as of 2004.\n\nIn late 1993, Shakur formed the group Thug Life with a number of his friends, including Big Syke (Tyruss Himes), Macadoshis (Diron Rivers), his stepbrother Mopreme Shakur, and the Rated R (Walter Burns). The group released their only album \"\" on September 26, 1994, which went gold. The album featured the single \"Pour Out a Little Liquor\", produced by Johnny \"J\" Jackson, who went on to produce a large part of Shakur's album \"All Eyez on Me\". The group usually performed their concerts without Shakur. The album was originally released by Shakur's label Out Da Gutta Records, though Amaru Entertainment has since gained the rights to it. Among the notable tracks are \"Bury Me a G\", \"Cradle to the Grave\", \"Pour Out a Little Liquor\" (which also appears on the soundtrack to the 1994 film \"Above the Rim\"), \"How Long Will They Mourn Me?\" and \"Str8 Ballin'\". As a result of criticism of gangsta rap at the time, the original version of the album was scrapped and re-recorded with many of the original songs being cut. The album contains ten tracks because Interscope Records felt many of the other recorded songs were too controversial to release. Although the original version of the album was not completed, Shakur performed the planned first single from the album, \"Out on Bail\" at the 1994 Source Awards. \"Thug Life: Volume 1\" was certified Gold. The track \"How Long Will They Mourn Me?\" later appeared on 2Pac's posthumous \"Greatest Hits\" album.\n\nShakur's third album, \"Me Against The World\", was released in March 1995 and was very well-received, with many calling it the magnum opus of his career. It is considered one of the greatest and most influential hip-hop albums of all time. It is Shakur's fourth-best-selling album with 3,524,567 copies sold in the United States as of 2011. \"Me Against the World\" won best rap album at the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards.\n\n\"Dear Mama\" was released as the album's first single in February 1995, along with the track \"Old School\" as the B-side. It would become the album's most successful single, topping the Hot Rap Singles chart and peaking at the ninth spot on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The single was certified platinum in July 1995, and later placed at #51 on the year-end charts. The second single, \"So Many Tears\", was released in June, four months after the first single. The single would reach number six on the Hot Rap Singles chart, and number 44 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Temptations\", released in August, was the third and final single from the album; it would be the least successful of the three released, but still did fairly well on the charts, reaching number 68 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number 35 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks, and number 13 on the Hot Rap Singles charts.\n\n\"All Eyez on Me\" was the fourth studio album by 2Pac, recorded in October 1995 and released on February 13, 1996, by Death Row Records and Interscope Records. The album is frequently recognized as one of the crowning achievements of 1990s rap music. Steve Huey of AllMusic stated that \"despite some undeniable filler, it is easily the best production 2Pac's ever had on record\". It was certified 5× Platinum after just 2 months in April 1996 and 9× platinum in 1998. The album featured the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number one singles \"How Do U Want It\" and \"California Love\". It featured five singles in all, the most of any 2Pac album. Moreover, \"All Eyez on Me\" (which was the only Death Row release to be distributed through PolyGram by way of Island Records) made history as the first double-full-length hip-hop solo studio album released for mass consumption. It was issued on two compact discs and four LPs. Chartwise, \"All Eyez on Me\" was the second album from 2Pac to hit number one on both the \"Billboard\" 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. It sold 566,000 copies in the first week of its release and was charted in the top 100 for one-week Soundscan sales since 1991. By the end of 1996, the album had sold 5 million copies. The album won the 1997 Soul Train R&B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year Award. Shakur also won the Award for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist at the 24th Annual American Music Awards.\n\n\"Makaveli – \", commonly shortened to \"The 7 Day Theory\", is Shakur's fifth and final studio album and was released under his new stage name Makaveli. The album was completely finished in a total of seven days during the month of August 1996. The lyrics were written and recorded in three days and mixing took an additional four days. In 2005, MTV.com ranked \"The 7 Day Theory\" at #9 on their greatest hip hop albums of all-time list and, in 2006, recognized it as a classic. The emotion and anger showcased on the album have been admired by a large part of the hip hop community. George \"Papa G\" Pryce, former Head of Publicity for Death Row, claimed that \"\"Makaveli\", which we did was sort of tongue-in-cheek and it was not really to come out and after Tupac was murdered, it did come out. But before that, it was going to be a sort of an underground [record].\"\nThe album peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the \"Billboard\" 200. The album generated the second-highest debut-week sales total of any album that year. It was certified 4× Platinum on June 15, 1999.\n\nIn October 1995, Shakur was released from prison after serving nine months of a sentence for sexual assault and formed a new group called Outlaw Immortalz. Shakur joined the Death Row label, under which he released the single \"California Love\".\n\nOn February 13, 1996, Shakur released his fourth solo album, \"All Eyez on Me\". This double album was the first and second of his three-album commitment to Death Row Records. It sold more than nine million copies. The record was a general departure from the introspective subject matter of \"Me Against the World\", being more oriented toward a thug and gangsta mentality. Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. Dr. Dre left his post as in-house producer to form his own label, Aftermath. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums \"Still I Rise\", \"Until the End of Time\", \"Better Dayz\", \"Loyal to the Game\" and \"Pac's Life\". He also began the process of recording an album, \"One Nation\", with the New York-based Boot Camp Clik and their label Duck Down Records.\n\nOn June 4, 1996, he and Outlawz released the diss track \"Hit 'Em Up\", a scathing lyrical assault on The Notorious B.I.G. and others associated with him. In the track, Shakur claimed to have had sexual intercourse with Faith Evans, the wife of Wallace, Shakur's former friend and rival, and attacked Bad Boy's street credibility. Shakur was convinced that some members associated with Bad Boy had known about the 1994 attack on him due to their behavior that night and the information that his sources gave to him. According to a 2005 interview with Jimmy Henchman, in \"Vibe\" magazine, after the attack, Shakur immediately accused Henchman, an associate of Bad Boy CEO Sean Combs, of orchestrating the attack. Shakur, therefore, aligned himself with Suge, Death Row's CEO, who was already bitter toward Combs over a 1995 incident at the Platinum Club in Atlanta, Georgia, which culminated in the death of Jake Robles, the friend and bodyguard of Suge Knight; Knight was adamant in voicing his suspicions about Combs' involvement. In the years following their killings, associates of both Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. have made comments indicating the pair, were it not for their deaths, would have reconciled.\n\nCollaborator Buckshot claimed in 2015 that Shakur defended him against Suge Knight, who had insisted that the East Coast rapper could not come with him to Las Vegas on the grounds of the ongoing hip hop rivalry. Shakur asserted that he would not board the plane unless accompanied by Buckshot and was described by the fellow rapper as looking \"discomforted\" while they recorded a song together in a studio after Shakur \"tore up the plane tickets\".\n\nDuring an August 15, 1996, appearance at the Brotherhood Crusade Rally, which featured several artists discussing the importance of voting, Shakur compared the sales of Death Row records to voters in the U.S. and the influence he and other artists had over an adoring fanbase.\n\nWhen Shakur recorded \"Hit 'Em Up\", a diss song toward Biggie, he recruited three members from the former group, Dramacydal, with whom he had worked previously and was eager to do so again. Shakur, with the three New Jersey rappers and other associates, formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. When 2Pac signed to Death Row after his release from prison, he recruited step brother Mopreme Shakur and Big Syke from Thug Life. Hussein Fatal, Napoleon, E.D.I. Mean, Kastro, Yaki Kadafi, and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added, and together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on 2Pac's Multi-Platinum smash \"All Eyez on Me\". They later dropped the Immortal part of their name after the untimely deaths of 2Pac and Yaki Kadafi and moved on as Outlawz without the members of Thug Life. Young Noble was later added and appeared on 2Pac's second Death Row release \"\". It was on 2Pac's Makaveli album that Outlawz first came to the greater rap community's notice, appearing on a few songs.\nThe idea behind the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding with the names of various tyrants or enemies of America, past, and present. Outlawz chose in later years to make a backronym out of the letters of their group name \"Operating Under Thug Laws as Warriorz\" although it does not stand for the group's name and is used infrequently.\n\nOn forming the Outlawz, Shakur gave each of them a name of a dictator/military leader or an enemy of America.\n\nFor himself, Shakur created the alias \"Makaveli\" from Renaissance Italian philosopher and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli, whose writings inspired Shakur in prison, but who also preached that a leader could eliminate his enemies by all means necessary. He mentioned Makaveli Records a few times before his death. This was supposed to be a music label for up-and-coming artists that Shakur had an interest in developing or potentially signing, and his own future projects would have been published through it as well.\n\nIn addition to his endeavors in the music industry, Shakur acted in films. He made his first film appearance in \"Nothing but Trouble\" (1991), as part of a cameo by the Digital Underground. His first starring role was in the 1992 film \"Juice\". He played Roland Bishop, a violent member of the Wrecking Crew, for which he was hailed by \"Rolling Stone\"s Peter Travers as \"the film's most magnetic figure\". He then went on to star in \"Poetic Justice\" (1993) opposite Janet Jackson and the basketball drama \"Above the Rim\" (1994). After his death, three more completed films featuring Shakur were released: \"Bullet\" (1996), \"Gridlock'd\" (1997), and \"Gang Related\" (1997).\n\nShakur had been slated to star in the 1993 Hughes brothers' film \"Menace II Society\" but was replaced by Larenz Tate after assaulting Allen Hughes as a result of a quarrel. Shakur reportedly wanted another type of role, but Hughes would not conform to his wishes, leading to the altercation between the pair which, according to Tyrin Turner, also led members of Shakur's entourage to become physically aggressive toward Hughes. In 2013, Hughes said Shakur would have outshined the other actors had he been in the film, \"because he was bigger than the movie.\" Hughes' comments were seen as validation that he had forgiven the rapper since the incident. Larenz Tate, who had several rehearsals with Shakur before his part was recast, recalled Shakur being close to the Hughes brothers but that his actions were the result of \"creative differences\".\n\nDirector John Singleton mentioned that he wrote the script for his film \"Baby Boy\" with Shakur in mind for the lead role. It was eventually filmed with Tyrese Gibson in his place and released in 2001, five years after Shakur's death. The film features a mural of Shakur in the protagonist's bedroom, as well as featuring the song \"Hail Mary\" in the film's score.\n\nShakur's music and philosophy are rooted in many American, African-American, and world entities, including the Black Panther Party, black nationalism, egalitarianism, and liberty. Shakur's love of theater and Shakespeare also influenced his work. A student of the Baltimore School for the Arts where he studied theater, Shakur understood the Shakespearean psychology of inter-gang wars and inter-cultural conflict. During a 1995 interview, Shakur stated:\n\n[…] I love Shakespeare. He wrote some of the rawest stories, man. I mean look at Romeo and Juliet. That's some serious ghetto shit. You got this guy Romeo from the Bloods who falls for Juliet, a female from the Crips, and everybody in both gangs is against them. So they have to sneak out and they end up dead for nothing. Real tragic stuff. And look how Shakespeare busts it up with Macbeth. He creates a tale about this king's wife who convinces a happy man to chase after her and kill her husband so he can take over the country. After he commits the murder, the dude starts having delusions just like in a Scarface song. I mean the king's wife just screws this guy's whole life up for nothing [...].\n\nIn a European interview music journalist Chuck Philips said that what impressed him the most about Shakur was that he was a poet. Philips said \"I like sacred texts, myths, proverbs, and scriptures. [...] When Tupac came along, I thought he was quite the poet [...] It wasn't just how cleverly they rhymed. It wasn't just the rhythm or the cadence. I liked their attitude. It was protest music in a way nobody had ever thought about before. [...]These artists were brave, wise and smart – wickedly smart. Tupac had so many sides. He was unafraid to write about his vulnerabilities.\"\n\nShakur's debut album, \"2Pacalypse Now\", revealed his socially conscious side. On this album, Shakur attacked social injustice, poverty, and police brutality on songs \"Brenda's Got a Baby\", \"Trapped\", and \"Part Time Mutha\". On this initial release, Shakur helped extend the success of such rap groups as Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, X-Clan, and Grandmaster Flash, as he became one of the first major socially conscious rappers from the West Coast.\n\nOn his second record, Shakur continued to rap about the social ills facing African-Americans, with songs like \"The Streetz R Deathrow\" and \"Last Wordz\". He also showed his compassionate side with the anthem \"Keep Ya Head Up\", while simultaneously putting his legendary aggressiveness on display with the title track from the album \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\" He added a salute to his former group Digital Underground by including them on the playful track \"I Get Around\". Throughout his career, an increasingly aggressive attitude can be seen pervading Shakur's subsequent albums.\n\nThe contradictory themes of social inequality and injustice, unbridled aggression, compassion, playfulness, and hope all continued to shape Shakur's work, as witnessed with the release of his incendiary 1995 album \"Me Against the World\". In 1996, Shakur released \"All Eyez on Me\", and many of the tracks are considered by critics to be classics, including \"Ambitionz Az a Ridah\", \"I Ain't Mad at Cha\", \"California Love\", \"Life Goes On\" and \"Picture Me Rollin\". Shakur described \"All Eyez on Me\" as a celebration of life, and the record was critically and commercially successful.\n\nShakur had enjoyed and had been influenced by the work of contemporary English and Irish pop musicians as a teenager such as Kate Bush, Culture Club, Sinéad O'Connor, and U2. His style on \"2Pacalypse Now\" was highly influenced by the social consciousness and Afrocentrism pervading hip hop in the late 1980s and early 1990s. \"All Eyez on Me\" was a change of style from his earlier works; while still containing socially conscious songs and themes, Shakur's album was heavily influenced by party tracks and tended to have a more \"feel good\" vibe than his earlier albums.\n\nShakur never professed to follow a particular religion, but his lyrics in singles such as \"Ghetto Gospel\" and \"Only God Can Judge Me\" and poems such as \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete (poetry collection)\" suggest he believed in God. Many analysts currently describe him as a deist. He believed in Karma but rejected a literal afterlife and organized religion.\nShakur has had several family members who were members of the Black Panthers; Mutulu Shakur, his step-father; Assata Shakur, his step-aunt; Billy Garland, his biological father; and Afeni Shakur, his mother. Shakur publicly spoke out against interracial marriage in an interview with \"Source\" magazine in 1994, but later retracted these comments.\n\nHis bandana tied into rabbit ears was considered by one writer as one of hip-hop's most recognizable style choices.\n\nShakur was friends with Mike Tyson, Chuck D, Marlon Wayans, Jim Carrey, and Rosie Perez. He befriended fellow rappers Snoop Dogg and Freddie Foxxx, collaborating on songs with the pair and writing to Foxxx while in prison. Tupac attended the John Muir High School prom with his god sister Tashauna Howard. He was also engaged to Kidada Jones. He had a three-year relationship with Madonna.\n\nBilly Garland said Shakur's anger was derived from his frustrations in being misunderstood, pointing specifically to whenever his commitment to the black community and the West Coast were questioned.\n\nIn October 1991, Shakur filed a $10 million civil suit against the Oakland Police Department, alleging that the police brutally beat him for jaywalking. Shakur received approximately $43,000 in settlement money, much of which went to pay his lawyer.\n\nOn August 22, 1992, in Marin City, Shakur performed at an outdoor festival and stayed for an hour afterward signing autographs and pictures. A confrontation occurred and Shakur drew a legally registered Colt Mustang, and allegedly dropped it. As it was picked up by a member of his entourage, a bullet was discharged. About away, Qa'id Walker-Teal, a 6-year-old boy, was pedaling his bicycle at a school playground nearby when a bullet struck him in the forehead and killed him. Although the police matched the bullet to a .38-caliber pistol registered to Shakur, and although his stepbrother, Maurice Harding, was initially arrested on suspicion of firing the weapon, no charges were filed. Marin County prosecutors have said they were stymied by a lack of witnesses. In 1995, a wrongful death suit was brought against Shakur by Qa'id's mother. The defense attorney acknowledged that the bullet that killed Qa'id was traced by authorities to a gun registered to Shakur. The suit was dropped when Shakur agreed to pay a $300,000–$500,000 settlement to the parents.\n\nOn April 5, 1993, Shakur was charged with one count of felonious assault. He was accused of attempting to hit rapper Chauncey Wynn from the group M.A.D. with a baseball bat at a concert at Michigan State University. The incident reportedly began when Shakur became angry and threw a microphone. Shakur pleaded guilty on September 14, 1994, to a misdemeanor in exchange for the dismissal of the felonious-assault charge. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 20 of which were suspended, and ordered to perform 35 hours of community service.\n\nIn October 1993, in Atlanta, two brothers and off-duty police officers, Mark and Scott Whitwell, were with their wives celebrating Mrs. Whitwell's passing of the state bar examination. The officers were drunk and in possession of stolen guns. As they crossed the street, a car with Shakur inside passed them or \"almost struck them\". The Whitwells argued with the driver, Shakur, and the other passengers, who were joined by a second passing car. Shakur shot one officer in the buttocks and the other in the leg, back, or abdomen, according to varying news reports. Mark Whitwell was charged with firing at Shakur's car and later lying to the police during the investigation. Shakur was charged with the shooting. Prosecutors dropped all charges against the parties.\n\nIn early 1994, he was found guilty of assaulting \"Menace II Society\" co-director Allen Hughes and served 15 days in jail. The previous year, Shakur had boasted during an appearance on \"Yo! MTV Raps\" that he had \"beat up the director of Menace II Society\", the line later being used against him in court.\n\nIn November 1993, Shakur and others were charged with sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room. Shakur denied the charges. According to Shakur, he had prior relations days earlier with the woman that were consensual (the woman admitted she performed oral sex on Shakur). The complainant claimed sexual assault after her second visit to Shakur's hotel room; she alleged that Shakur and his entourage raped her. As a result of the trial, Shakur was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse, and acquitted of the weapons and sodomy charges. The judge described the crimes during the sentencing of Shakur to 1½–4½ years in prison, as \"an act of brutal violence against a helpless woman.\" While appearing on the \"Arsenio Hall Show\", Shakur stated he was innocent of all charges and he was hurt that \"a woman would accuse me of taking something from her\" when he was raised by and was surrounded by females.\n\nIn October 1995, Shakur's case was on appeal but because of his considerable legal fees, he could not raise the $1.4 million bail. After serving nine months of his sentence, Shakur was released from the Clinton Correctional Facility on October 12, 1995, due in large part to the help and influence of Suge Knight, the CEO of Death Row Records, who posted a $1.4 million bail pending appeal of the conviction, in exchange for Shakur releasing three albums under the Death Row label. On April 5, 1996, a judge sentenced him to serve 120 days in jail for violating terms of his release on bail.\n\nOn the night of November 30, 1994, the day before the verdict in his sexual abuse trial was to be announced, Shakur was robbed and shot five times by three men in the lobby of Quad Recording Studios in Manhattan. Shakur stated that he believed the robbery to be a setup for the attack, wondering why they would take jewelry and leave his Rolex watch. Shakur checked out of the Bellevue Hospital Center against doctor's orders, three hours after surgery. In the day that followed, he entered the courthouse in a wheelchair and was found guilty of three counts of molestation and found not guilty of six others, including sodomy, stemming from his 1993 arrest for sexual assault.\n\nIn a 1995 interview with \"Vibe\" magazine, Shakur accused Sean Combs, Jimmy Henchman, and Biggie, among others, of setting up the Quad Recording Studios attack. \"Vibe\" changed the names of the accused assailants upon publication. Later evidence did not implicate Biggie in the studio assault. When Biggie's entourage went downstairs to check on the incident, Shakur was being taken out on a stretcher, giving the finger to those around.\n\nOn March 17, 2008, Chuck Philips wrote in the \"Los Angeles Times\" about an alleged order for an attack on Shakur. The article was retracted by the \"LA Times\" because it partially relied on FBI documents, supplied by a man convicted of fraud, which turned out to be forged. In 2011, Dexter Isaac admitted to attacking Shakur. Following Isaac's public confession, Philips named Isaac as one of his unnamed sources for the retracted article.\n\nShakur began serving his prison sentence on sexual-assault charges at Clinton Correctional Facility on February 14, 1995. Shortly afterward, he released his Multi-Platinum album \"Me Against the World\". Shakur became the first artist to have an album at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 while serving a prison sentence. \"Me Against the World\" made its debut on the \"Billboard\" 200 and stayed at the top of the charts for four weeks. The album sold 240,000 copies in its first week, setting a record for highest first week sales for a solo male rap artist at the time. While serving his sentence, he married his long-time girlfriend, Keisha Morris, on April 4, 1995; the couple divorced in 1996. Shakur stated that he married her \"for the wrong reasons\". In an interview after his release, Shakur claimed to have only written one song during his sentence. While imprisoned, Shakur became interested in philosophy, philosophy of war, and military strategy by studying the works such as \"The Prince\" by Italian philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli and \"The Art of War\" by Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu. The works inspired his pseudonym \"Makaveli\" under which he released the album \"\". The album presents a stark contrast to previous works. Throughout the album, Shakur continues to focus on the themes of pain and aggression, making this album one of the emotionally darker works of his career.\n\nWhile in prison, Shakur wrote to Death Row Uncut director Nina Bhadresher about his plans to begin a \"new chapter\" of his life. According to Kevin Powell, who spoke to Shakur following his release from prison, Shakur \"seemed like a completely transformed person.\" Powell recalled Shakur being more dark and menacing to the extent that Powell wondered whether he had really known Shakur.\n\nOn the night of September 7, 1996, Shakur attended the Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson boxing match with Suge Knight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. After leaving the match, one of Knight's associates spotted Orlando \"Baby Lane\" Anderson, an alleged Crips gang member from Compton, California, in the MGM Grand lobby. Earlier that year, Anderson and a group of Crips had robbed a member of Death Row's entourage in a Foot Locker store. Knight's associate told Shakur, who attacked Anderson. Shakur's entourage, as well as Knight and his followers, assisted in assaulting Anderson. Shakur punched Anderson in the face. The fight was captured on the hotel's video surveillance. After the brawl, Shakur went with Knight to Death Row–owned Club 662 (now known as restaurant/club Seven). Shakur rode in Knight's 1996 black BMW 750iL sedan as part of a larger convoy, which included many in Shakur's entourage.\n\nAt 11:00–11:05 p.m. (PDT), they were halted on Las Vegas Boulevard by Metro bicycle police for playing the car stereo too loudly and not having license plates, which were found in the trunk of Knight's car; the party was released a few minutes later without being ticketed. At 11:10 p.m. (PDT), while they were stopped at a red light at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in front of the Maxim Hotel, a vehicle occupied by two women pulled up on their left side. Shakur, who was standing up through the sunroof, exchanged words with the women and invited them to Club 662. At 11:15 p.m. (PDT), a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac with unknown occupants pulled up to the sedan's right side. Someone inside rolled down a window and rapidly fired gunshots at Shakur. He was hit four times, twice in the chest, once in the arm, and once in the thigh. One of the bullets went into Shakur's right lung. Knight was hit in the head by fragmentation. The bodyguard, Frank Alexander, stated that, when he was about to ride along with the rapper in Knight's car, Shakur asked him to drive the car of Shakur's fiancée, Kidada Jones, instead, in case they needed additional vehicles for the drive from Club 662 to the hotel. The bodyguard reported in his documentary, \"Before I Wake\", that, shortly after the assault, one of the convoy's cars drove off after the assailant but that he never heard from the occupants.\nAfter arriving at the scene, police and paramedics took Knight and a wounded Shakur to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada. Chris Carroll, the first Las Vegas police officer to arrive on the scene, heard Shakur's last words, \"fuck you\". Carroll reports that he refused to say another word to him or another officer. According to an interview with the music video director Gobi, while at the hospital, Shakur received news from a Death Row marketing employee that the shooters had called the record company and threatened Shakur. Gobi informed the Las Vegas police but said that the police claimed to be understaffed. No attackers came. At the hospital, Shakur was heavily sedated, was placed on life-support machines, and was ultimately put under a barbiturate-induced coma after repeatedly trying to get out of the bed.\nWhile in the intensive-care unit, on the afternoon of September 13, 1996, Shakur died from internal bleeding; doctors attempted to revive him but could not stop the hemorrhaging. His mother, Afeni, made the decision to tell the doctors to stop. He was pronounced dead at 4:03 p.m. (PDT). The official causes of death were noted as respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest in connection with multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nShakur's body was cremated the next day. Some of his ashes were purportedly later mixed with marijuana and smoked by members of the Outlawz. However, E.D.I. Mean claimed in an interview in 2014 that, despite his belief at the time that the ashes were those of Shakur, he later found that the ashes did not belong to Shakur, which has led some people to believe that Shakur did not die at all.\n\nHis fifth album, \"\", was released two months later along with numerous other posthumous albums.\n\nIn 2002, the \"Los Angeles Times\" published a two-part story by investigative reporter Chuck Philips, titled \"Who Killed Tupac Shakur?\", based on yearlong research that reconstructed the crime and the events leading up to it. Information gathered by the paper indicated that: \"the shooting was carried out by a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier. Orlando Anderson, the Crip whom Shakur had attacked, fired the fatal shots. Las Vegas police discounted Anderson as a suspect and interviewed him only once, briefly. He was later killed in an unrelated gang shooting.\" The article also reported the involvement of East Coast rapper Biggie, Shakur's rival at the time, and several New York criminals.\n\nBefore they died, The Notorious B.I.G. and Anderson denied any role in the murder. In support of their claims, Biggie's family produced computerized invoices suggesting that Biggie was working in a New York recording studio the night of the drive-by shooting. His manager Wayne Barrow and fellow rapper Lil' Cease (James Lloyd) made public announcements denying Biggie's role in the crime and claimed further that they were with him in the recording studio the night of the event. The \"New York Times\" called the evidence \"inconclusive\", noting:\n\nThe pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called \"Nasty Boy\" on the afternoon Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace \"wrote half the session\", was \"In and out/sat around\" and \"laid down a ref\", shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, said in an interview that he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. 'We would have heard about it,' Mr. Alfred said.\"\nIn 2011, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the FBI released documents revealing its investigation of the Jewish Defense League for making death threats against Shakur and other rappers.\n\nAt a Mobb Deep concert following the death of Shakur and the release of \"\", Cormega recalled in an interview that the fans were all shouting \"Makaveli\", and emphasized the influence of \"The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory\" and of Shakur himself even in New York at the height of the media-dubbed \"intercoastal rivalry\".\n\nShakur is held in high esteem by other MCs: In the book \"How to Rap\", Bishop Lamont (Philip Martin) notes that Shakur \"mastered every element, every aspect\" of rapping and Fredro Starr (Fred Scruggs) of Onyx says Shakur \"was a master of the flow.\" \"Every rapper who grew up in the Nineties owes something to Tupac,\" wrote 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson). \"He didn't sound like anyone who came before him.\" About.com, for their part, named Shakur the most influential rapper ever.\n\nChuck Philips writes that \"the slaying [of Tupac Shakur] silenced one of modern music's most eloquent voices—a ghetto poet whose tales of urban alienation captivated young people of all races and backgrounds. The 25-year-old Shakur had helped elevate rap from a crude street fad to a complex art form, setting the stage for the current global hip-hop phenomenon\".\n\nTo preserve Shakur's legacy, his mother founded the Shakur Family Foundation (later renamed the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation or TASF) in 1997. The TASF's stated mission is to \"provide training and support for students who aspire to enhance their creative talents.\" The TASF sponsors essay contests, charity events, a performing arts day camp for teenagers and undergraduate scholarships. The Foundation officially opened the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts (TASCA) in Stone Mountain, Georgia, on June 11, 2005. On November 14, 2003, a documentary about Shakur entitled \"\" was released under the supervision of his mother and narrated entirely in his voice. It was nominated for Best Documentary at the 2005 Academy Awards. Proceeds will go to a charity set up by Shakur's mother Afeni. On April 17, 2003, Harvard University co-sponsored an academic symposium entitled \"All Eyez on Me: Tupac Shakur and the Search for the Modern Folk Hero\". The speakers discussed a wide range of topics dealing with Shakur's impact on everything from entertainment to sociology.\n\nMany of the speakers discussed Shakur's status and public persona, including State University of New York at Buffalo English professor Mark Anthony Neal who gave the talk \"Thug Nigga Intellectual: Tupac as Celebrity Gramscian\" in which he argued that Shakur was an example of the \"organic intellectual\" expressing the concerns of a larger group. Professor Neal has also indicated in his writings that the death of Shakur has left a \"leadership void amongst hip-hop artists.\" Neal further describes him as a \"walking contradiction\", a status that allowed him to \"make being an intellectual accessible to ordinary people.\"\n\nProfessor of Communications Murray Forman, of Northeastern University, spoke of the mythical status about Shakur's life and death. He addressed the symbolism and mythology surrounding Shakur's death in his talk entitled \"Tupac Shakur: O.G. (Ostensibly Gone)\". Among his findings were that Shakur's fans have \"succeeded in resurrecting Tupac as an ethereal life force.\" In \"From Thug Life to Legend: Realization of a Black Folk Hero\", Professor of Music at Northeastern University, Emmett Price, compared Shakur's public image to that of the trickster figures of African-American folklore which gave rise to the urban \"bad-man\" persona of the post-slavery period. He ultimately described Shakur as a \"prolific artist\" who was \"driven by a terrible sense of urgency\" in a quest to \"unify mind, body, and spirit\".\n\nIn \"Holler If You Hear Me: Searching for Tupac Shakur\", Michael Eric Dyson indicated that Shakur \"spoke with brilliance and insight as someone who bears witness to the pain of those who would never have his platform. He told the truth, even as he struggled with the fragments of his identity.\" At one Harvard Conference the theme was Shakur's impact on entertainment, race relations, politics and the \"hero/martyr\". In late 1997, the University of California, Berkeley offered a student-led course entitled \"History 98: Poetry and History of Tupac Shakur.\"\n\nIn late 2003, the Makaveli Branded Clothing line was launched by Afeni. In 2005, Death Row released \"\". The DVD was the final recorded performance of Shakur's career, which took place on July 4, 1996, and features a large number of Death Row artists. In August 2006, \"Tupac Shakur Legacy\" was released. The interactive biography was written by Jamal Joseph. It features unseen family photographs, intimate stories, and over 20 removable reproductions of his handwritten song lyrics, contracts, scripts, poetry, and other personal papers. Shakur's sixth posthumous studio album, \"Pac's Life\", was released on November 21, 2006. It commemorates the 10th anniversary of Shakur's death. He is still considered one of the most popular artists in the music industry .\n\nAccording to \"Forbes\", in 2008 Shakur's estate made $15 million. In 2002, they recognized him as a \"Top-Earning Dead Celebrity\", coming in at number ten on their list.\n\nBET named 2Pac 'The Most Influential Rappers of All Time'. They then went on to say \"his confounding mixture of ladies' man, thug, revolutionary and poet has forever altered our perception of what a rapper should look like, sound like and act like. In 50 Cent, Ja Rule, Lil Wayne, newcomers like Freddie Gibbs and even his friend-turned-rival Biggie, it's easy to see that Pac is the most copied MC of all time. There are murals bearing his likeness in New York, Brazil, Sierra Leone, Bulgaria and countless other places; he even has statues in Atlanta and Germany. Quite simply, no other rapper has captured the world's attention the way Tupac did and still does.\"\nOn April 15, 2012, a \"hologram\" of Shakur (technically a 2-D video projection) performed his songs \"Hail Mary\" and \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\" with Snoop Dogg at the Coachella Music Festival. The effect was created using an optical illusion called Pepper's ghost. The video footage was created by visual effects company Digital Domain. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were in talks of a possible tour involving the two rappers and the projection version of Shakur, which was later turned down by Dr. Dre.\nTupac's 1998 album Greatest Hits returned to the Billboard 200 the following week for the first time since 2000, reaching No. 129 with 4,000 copies sold according to Nielsen SoundScan (a gain of 571% over the previous week). The MC's other albums also saw gains, including \"All Eyez On Me\" (2,000; up 95%) and \"Me Against the World\" (1,000; up 53%).\nHis singles also saw a boost in sales. His biggest seller of the week was \"Hail Mary\"—the song his projection opened with at Coachella. His second biggest seller was his No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hit \"California Love\" (featuring Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman), shifting 11,000 downloads (119% increase). His third best-seller was the second Tupac song that was performed at Coachella – \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\" (with Snoop). It sold 9,000 (up 881%).\n\n\"Holler If Ya Hear Me\" (2014), was a Broadway play based on the lyrics of Tupac. The production lasted 6 weeks before it folded due to being one of Broadway's worst-selling musicals in recent years. It was announced in January 2015 the following month would see an exhibit dedicated to Shakur opened at the Grammy Museum. Executive director Robert Santelli praised Shakur as \"one of the most original and important of all hip hop artists\", adding that his writings were \"both powerful and provocative\". During a panel for the exhibit, attended by his mother Afeni, cousins and various members of his extended family, rapper YG said that he was inspired by Shakur to return to school and that Shakur was like a \"father figure\" to some.\n\nOn December 24, 2015, Demetrius Shipp, Jr. was cast as Shakur in a biopic titled \"All Eyez on Me\", which started filming in Atlanta in December 2015. With distribution from Morgan Creek Productions, the film had been in development since 2013, with producers Randall Emmett and George Furla having sued Morgan Creek for $10 million in October. Emmett and Furla claimed breach-of-contract after the production company allegedly picked a lead, set a budget and production schedule without their approval. Morgan Creek also sued Afeni Shakur for the music rights for the film. Music video director Benny Boom helmed \"All Eyez on Me\", which had been hamstrung by production problems. Multiple directors were involved with the film before Boom, including John Singleton and Antoine Fuqua. The film was released to negative reviews on June 16, 2017, which would have been Shakur's 46th birthday.\n\nIn 2003, MTV's \"22 Greatest MCs\" countdown listed Shakur as the \"Number 1 MC\", as voted by the viewers. In 2004, at the VH1 Hip Hop Honors Shakur was honored along with DJ Hollywood, Kool DJ Herc, KRS-One, Public Enemy, Run-D.M.C., Rock Steady Crew, and Sugarhill Gang. A \"Vibe\" magazine poll in 2004 rated Shakur \"the greatest rapper of all time\" as voted by fans. Editors of About.com ranked him No. 5 on their list of the \"Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007)\". In 2012, \"The Source\" ranked him No. 5 on their list of the top 50 hip-hop lyricists of all time. In a 2005 \"Rolling Stone\" magazine vote, Shakur was named No. 86 of the \"100 Immortal Artists of All Time\" behind Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and John Lennon. MTV ranked him at No. 2 on their list of \"The Greatest MCs of All Time\". Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame in 2002. VH1 ranked him 69th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time. At the First Annual Turks & Caicos International Film Festival held on Tuesday, October 17, 2006, Shakur was honored for his undeniable voice and talent and as a performer who crossed racial, ethnic, cultural and medium lines; his mother accepted the award on his behalf.\n\nIn 2008, The National Association Of Recording Merchandisers in conjunction with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame recognized him as a very influential artist and has added him in their Definitive 200 list.\n\nOn June 23, 2010, Shakur was inducted to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry. The seat of the Catholic Church released a list of 12 songs onto the social networking Web site's streaming music service. Among the artists included are Mozart, Muse, and Dame Shirley Bassey; the list also includes Shakur's song \"Changes\", which was released two years after his shooting death on a greatest hits album in 1998.\n\nHis double album, \"All Eyez on Me\", is one of the highest-selling rap albums of all time, with over 5 million copies of the album sold in the United States alone by April 1996; it was eventually certified 9x platinum in June 1998 by the RIAA. In July 2014 it was recertified 10x platinum.\n\nShakur's hit song \"Dear Mama\" is one of 25 songs that were added to the National Recording Registry in 2010. The Library of Congress has called Dear Mama \"a moving and eloquent homage to both the murdered rapper's own mother and all mothers struggling to maintain a family in the face of addiction, poverty, and societal indifference.\" The honor came seven days after what would have been Shakur's 39th birthday. Shakur is the third rapper to enter the library, outside of the copyright office, behind Grandmaster Flash and Public Enemy.\n\nIn 2016, Shakur was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, when on December 20, 2016, it was announced that he and 5 others would be inducted into the Hall on April 7, 2017. At the ceremony, Shakur was inducted by his friend and fellow hip hop artist Snoop Dogg, who delineated several stories about their time together and of the time Shakur spent in the hospital before his death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShakur's life has been recognized in big and small documentaries, each trying capture the many different events during his short lifetime, most notably the Academy Award nominated \"\", released in 2003.\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Randall cattle\n\nRandall Cattle or Randall Lineback Cattle are dual-listed by the American Livestock Breed Conservancy as a critically endangered American landrace breed. This cattle breed originated in Sunderland, Vermont.\n\nRandall cattle are a rare breed of purebred cattle developed in Sunderland, Vermont, USA, on the farm of Samuel Randall, and later his son, Everett Randall. The Randall family kept a closed herd for over 80 years. Randalls are considered to be a landrace breed, descended from the local cattle common in New England in the nineteenth Century. \n\nIn 1985 the Randall cattle were rescued from the Randall farm after Everett Randall had died. The animals were widely dispersed but soon began to disappear. Cynthia Creech, then living in Tennessee, stepped in to purchase most of the remaining animals to preserve the genetics from extinction. During the following years the breed was called various names. There are now two separate breed associations charged with promoting and registering the Randall or Randall Lineback animals: the Randall Cattle Registry and the Randall Lineback Breed association. \nRandall Linebacks are an all-purpose breed, meaning they originally served as dairy, meat, and draft animals. From fewer than 20 animals the breed population has increased to over 350 breeding females.\n\nRandall cattle are quite variable in size and conformation and have a constitution that is suited to the New England climate. Randalls on average are medium in size with the cows weighing about 600-1100 lbs. and bulls weighing from 1000 to 1800 lbs. or more. Randall cattle have a \"Colour-sided\" lineback pattern, black markings on a white base, varying from almost white to very dark. Other subtle shades such as blue, mahogany, and gray have been observed, and there are now a number of recessive reds. \n\nRandall meat characteristics can vary between different family lines, for example some produce a lean carcass with yellow fat and others produce a beefier well marbled carcass. \n\nCalving difficulties are rare, and metabolic disorders have not been seen. They have strong maternal and survival instincts, high intelligence, and are very docile when handled regularly. \n\nThis breed is uniquely adapted to extensive or low input farming systems. Historically, the most suitable and natural environment for these cattle has been on small scale forage-based farms, subsistence farms, and homesteads. It is on such farms and homesteads that the unique genetic attributes of the Randalls can be fully expressed.\n\nMost Randall Lineback cattle are currently found in the Eastern United States and Canada, all on cool weather farms. The largest Randall Lineback herd is located at Chapel Hill Farm, in the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia. The second largest herd, and the Randall Registry, call South Kent, Connecticut home. Other, much smaller, herds exist, most of them dairying. While breed numbers are greatly improved, the breed remains critically endangered, according to the American Livestock Breed Conservancy.\n\n",
                "Afeni Shakur\n\nAfeni Shakur Davis (born Alice Faye Williams; January 10, 1947 – May 2, 2016) was an American activist and businesswoman. Shakur was the mother of American rapper and actor, Tupac Shakur.\n\nShakur was born Alice Faye Williams on January 10, 1947, in Lumberton, North Carolina, the daughter of Rosa Belle, a homemaker, and Walter Williams, a trucker.\n\nIn 1968 at the age of twenty-one, she changed her name to Afeni Shakur, \"Afeni\" meaning \"lover of people\" and \"Shakur\" being Arabic for \"thankful to god\", respectively. She was then living in Harlem, New York, where she joined the far-left Black Panther Party. She became a section leader of the Harlem chapter and a mentor to new members, including Jamal Joseph, Cleo Silvers and Dhoruba Bin-Wahad. She also worked with Billy Garland (who is Tupac's biological father) and Geronimo Pratt (who became Tupac's baptismal sponsor). \n\nIn April 1969, Shakur was arrested on charges of conspiring with other Black Panther members to carry out bombings in New York. With bail set at $100,000 each for the 21 suspects, the Black Panthers decided to raise bail money first for Joseph and Shakur so that those two could work on raising bail for the others. Shakur had been effective in raising bail funds for jailed Panthers. After reading Fidel Castro's \"History Will Absolve Me\", Shakur chose to represent herself in court, telling other accused Panthers that if they were convicted, they would be the ones serving jail time, not the lawyers. Pregnant while on trial and facing a thirty-year prison sentence, Shakur interviewed witnesses and argued in court. She and the others in the \"Panther 21\" were acquitted in May 1971 after an eight-month trial. Her son Lesane Parish Crooks was born on June 16, 1971 (he would be renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur the following year, in 1972).\n\nExactly one year following her son's death, with revenue from his albums released posthumously, Afeni Shakur founded the Georgia-based Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation, which provides art programs for young people, and Amaru Entertainment, the holding company for all Tupac's unreleased material. She also launched a fashion clothing line, Makaveli Branded; all proceeds go to his charity, the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation.\n\nShakur was reportedly in federal court on July 20, 2007, to file an injunction to prevent Death Row Records from selling any unreleased material from Tupac after the company failed to prove that the unreleased songs were not part of its bankruptcy settlement. \n\nShe created a record label named Amaru Records to release Tupac's unreleased recordings. She won her court case against Death Row Record to receive 150 unreleased songs by her son.\n\nShakur traveled across the U.S., making guest appearances and delivering lectures. On February 6, 2007, she gave the keynote address for Vanderbilt University's Commemoration for Black History Month.\n\nOn May 2, 2016, police and paramedics responded to Shakur's home in Sausalito, California. She was transported to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead of a suspected heart attack. Her body was cremated.\n\n"

Shakur sold over 75 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling music artists of all time.

Shakur is consistently ranked as one of the greatest and most influential rappers of all time and he has been listed and ranked as one of the greatest artists of any genre by many publications, including \"Rolling Stone\", which ranked him 86th on its list of The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. On April 7, 2017, Shakur was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility.\n\nShakur began his career as a roadie, backup dancer and MC for the alternative hip hop group Digital Underground, eventually branching off as a solo artist. Most of the themes in Shakur's songs revolved around the violence and hardship in inner cities, racism, and other social issues. Both of his parents and several other people in his family were members of the Black Panther Party, whose ideals were reflected in his songs. During the latter part of his career, Shakur was a vocal participant during the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry, becoming involved in conflicts with other rappers, producers, and record-label staff members, most notably The Notorious B.I.G. and his label, Bad Boy Records. Aside from his career in music, Shakur was also an actor, starring in six films and one TV show in the 1990s, including \"Poetic Justice\" (1993), \"Gang Related\" (1997) and \"Gridlock'd\" (1997).\n\nOn September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times in a drive-by shooting at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in Las Vegas, Nevada. He was taken to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada, where he died from his injuries six days later.\n\nShakur was born on June 16, 1971, in the East Harlem section of Manhattan in New York City. His birth name was Lesane Parish Crooks, but in 1972, he was renamed after Túpac Amaru II, the 18th-century Peruvian revolutionary who was executed after leading an indigenous uprising against Spanish rule. Shakur was African American.\n\nHis mother Afeni Shakur (born Alice Faye Williams in North Carolina) and his father Billy Garland were active members of the Black Panther Party in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Lesane was born a month after his mother was acquitted of more than 150 charges of \"Conspiracy against the United States government and New York landmarks\" in the New York Panther 21 trial.\n\nMany people in Shakur's life were involved with the Black Liberation Army; some were convicted of serious criminal offenses and imprisoned, including his mother. His godfather, Elmer \"Geronimo\" Pratt, a high-ranking Black Panther, was convicted of murdering a school teacher during a 1968 robbery, although his sentence was later overturned. His stepfather, Mutulu Shakur, spent four years at large on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list beginning in 1982. Mutulu was wanted for having helped his friend (no relation) Assata Shakur (also known as Joanne Chesimard), Tupac's godmother, to escape from a penitentiary in New Jersey in 1979. She had been imprisoned since 1977 for killing a state trooper in 1973. She lived as a fugitive for several years before gaining asylum in Cuba in 1985. Mutulu was caught in 1986 and eventually imprisoned for the 1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck in which two police officers and a guard were killed.\n\nShakur had an older stepbrother, Mopreme \"Komani\" Shakur, and a half-sister, Sekyiwa, two years his junior. Mopreme performed in many of his recordings. In 1986, his family moved to Baltimore, Maryland. After completing his second year at Paul Laurence Dunbar High School, he transferred to the Baltimore School for the Arts. There he studied acting, poetry, jazz, and ballet. He performed in Shakespeare plays and in the role of the Mouse King in the ballet \"The Nutcracker\". Shakur, accompanied by one of his friends, Dana \"Mouse\" Smith, as his beatbox, won many rap competitions and was considered to be the best rapper in his school. He was remembered as one of the most popular kids in his school because of his sense of humor, superior rapping skills, and ability to mix with all crowds.\n\nShakur developed a close friendship with Jada Pinkett (later Jada Pinkett Smith) that lasted until his death. In the documentary \",\" Shakur says, \"Jada is my heart. She will be my friend for my whole life.\" Pinkett Smith calls him \"one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime.\" A poem written by Shakur titled \"Jada\" appears in his book, \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete\", which also includes a poem dedicated to Pinkett Smith called \"The Tears in Cupid's Eyes.\" During his time in art school, Shakur became affiliated with the Baltimore Young Communist League USA. He began dating the daughter of the director of the local chapter of the Communist Party USA.\n\nIn 1988, Shakur and his family moved to Marin City, California, a suburban community located north of San Francisco. He attended Tamalpais High School in nearby Mill Valley. Shakur contributed to the school's drama department by performing in several productions. In an English class, Shakur wrote a paper, \"Conquering All Obstacles,\" in which he said: \"our raps, not the sorry story raps everyone is so tired of. They are about what happens in the real world. Our goal is [to] have people relate to our raps, making it easier to see what really is happening out there. Even more important, what we may do to better our world.\"\nHe began attending the poetry classes of Leila Steinberg in 1989. That same year, Steinberg organized a concert with a former group of Shakur's, \"Strictly Dope\"; the concert led to him being signed with Atron Gregory. He set him up as a roadie and backup dancer with the hip hop group Digital Underground in 1990.\n\nBefore using his first name as his rap name, Shakur went by the alias MC New York when starting his career in Baltimore.\nAlthough Shakur began recording in 1987, his professional entertainment career did not take off until the early 1990s when he debuted in Digital Underground's \"Same Song\" from the soundtrack to the 1991 film \"Nothing but Trouble\", and also appeared with the group in the film. The song was later released as the lead song of the Digital Underground extended play (EP) \"This Is an EP Release\", the follow-up to their debut hit album \"Sex Packets\". Shakur appeared in the accompanying music video. After his rap debut, he performed with Digital Underground again on the album \"Sons of the P\". Shakur went on to feature Shock G and Money-B from Digital Underground in his track \"I Get Around\", which ranked #11 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100.\n\nIn November 1991, Shakur released his debut solo album, \"2Pacalypse Now\". Though the album did not generate any \"Top Ten\" hits, \"2Pacalypse Now\" is hailed by many critics and fans for its underground feel, with many rappers such as Nas, Eminem, Game, and Talib Kweli having pointed to it as inspiration. Although the album was originally released on Interscope Records, the rights to its distribution are now owned by Amaru Entertainment, the label owned by Shakur's mother. The album's name is a reference to the 1979 film \"Apocalypse Now\".\n\n\"2Pacalypse Now\" generated significant controversy for numerous reasons. The songs \"Trapped\" and \"Brenda's Got a Baby\" were widely noted for their poetic qualities but also offered strong critiques of unjust social policies. Dan Quayle criticized the album after a Texas youth's defense attorney claimed he was influenced by \"2Pacalypse Now\" and its theme of police brutality before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, \"There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society.\" Shakur stated that he felt he had been misunderstood. He said, \"I started out saying I was down for the young black male, you know, and that was gonna be my thang,\" Shakur said. \"I just wanted to rap about things that affected young black males. When I said that, I didn't know that I was gonna tie myself down to just take all the blunts and hits for all the young black males, to be the media's kicking post for young black males. I just figured since I lived that life I could do that, I could rap about that.\" The record was important in showcasing Shakur's political conviction and his focus on lyrical prowess. On MTV's Greatest Rappers of All Time list, \"2Pacalypse Now\" was listed as one of Shakur's \"certified classic\" albums, along with \"Me Against the World\", \"All Eyez on Me\" and \"\". \"2Pacalypse Now\" went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. It featured three singles: \"Brenda's Got a Baby\", \"Trapped\", and \"If My Homie Calls\".\n\nHis second studio album, \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\", was released in February 1993. The album did better than its predecessor both critically and commercially, debuting at number 24 on the \"Billboard\" 200. The album contains many tracks emphasizing Shakur's political and social views, and there are noticeable differences in production from his first effort. While \"2Pacalypse Now\" had an indie-rap-oriented sound, \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\" is generally considered Shakur's \"breakout\" album. It spawned the hits \"Keep Ya Head Up\" and \"I Get Around\" and reached platinum status. On vinyl, Side A (tracks 1–8) was labeled the \"Black Side\" and Side B (tracks 9–16) the \"Dark Side\". It is Shakur's tenth-biggest selling album, with 1,366,000 units moved as of 2004.\n\nIn late 1993, Shakur formed the group Thug Life with a number of his friends, including Big Syke (Tyruss Himes), Macadoshis (Diron Rivers), his stepbrother Mopreme Shakur, and the Rated R (Walter Burns). The group released their only album \"\" on September 26, 1994, which went gold. The album featured the single \"Pour Out a Little Liquor\", produced by Johnny \"J\" Jackson, who went on to produce a large part of Shakur's album \"All Eyez on Me\". The group usually performed their concerts without Shakur. The album was originally released by Shakur's label Out Da Gutta Records, though Amaru Entertainment has since gained the rights to it. Among the notable tracks are \"Bury Me a G\", \"Cradle to the Grave\", \"Pour Out a Little Liquor\" (which also appears on the soundtrack to the 1994 film \"Above the Rim\"), \"How Long Will They Mourn Me?\" and \"Str8 Ballin'\". As a result of criticism of gangsta rap at the time, the original version of the album was scrapped and re-recorded with many of the original songs being cut. The album contains ten tracks because Interscope Records felt many of the other recorded songs were too controversial to release. Although the original version of the album was not completed, Shakur performed the planned first single from the album, \"Out on Bail\" at the 1994 Source Awards. \"Thug Life: Volume 1\" was certified Gold. The track \"How Long Will They Mourn Me?\" later appeared on 2Pac's posthumous \"Greatest Hits\" album.\n\nShakur's third album, \"Me Against The World\", was released in March 1995 and was very well-received, with many calling it the magnum opus of his career. It is considered one of the greatest and most influential hip-hop albums of all time. It is Shakur's fourth-best-selling album with 3,524,567 copies sold in the United States as of 2011. \"Me Against the World\" won best rap album at the 1996 Soul Train Music Awards.\n\n\"Dear Mama\" was released as the album's first single in February 1995, along with the track \"Old School\" as the B-side. It would become the album's most successful single, topping the Hot Rap Singles chart and peaking at the ninth spot on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. The single was certified platinum in July 1995, and later placed at #51 on the year-end charts. The second single, \"So Many Tears\", was released in June, four months after the first single. The single would reach number six on the Hot Rap Singles chart, and number 44 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. \"Temptations\", released in August, was the third and final single from the album; it would be the least successful of the three released, but still did fairly well on the charts, reaching number 68 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100, number 35 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks, and number 13 on the Hot Rap Singles charts.\n\n\"All Eyez on Me\" was the fourth studio album by 2Pac, recorded in October 1995 and released on February 13, 1996, by Death Row Records and Interscope Records. The album is frequently recognized as one of the crowning achievements of 1990s rap music. Steve Huey of AllMusic stated that \"despite some undeniable filler, it is easily the best production 2Pac's ever had on record\". It was certified 5× Platinum after just 2 months in April 1996 and 9× platinum in 1998. The album featured the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 number one singles \"How Do U Want It\" and \"California Love\". It featured five singles in all, the most of any 2Pac album. Moreover, \"All Eyez on Me\" (which was the only Death Row release to be distributed through PolyGram by way of Island Records) made history as the first double-full-length hip-hop solo studio album released for mass consumption. It was issued on two compact discs and four LPs. Chartwise, \"All Eyez on Me\" was the second album from 2Pac to hit number one on both the \"Billboard\" 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts. It sold 566,000 copies in the first week of its release and was charted in the top 100 for one-week Soundscan sales since 1991. By the end of 1996, the album had sold 5 million copies. The album won the 1997 Soul Train R&B/Soul or Rap Album of the Year Award. Shakur also won the Award for Favorite Rap/Hip-Hop Artist at the 24th Annual American Music Awards.\n\n\"Makaveli – \", commonly shortened to \"The 7 Day Theory\", is Shakur's fifth and final studio album and was released under his new stage name Makaveli. The album was completely finished in a total of seven days during the month of August 1996. The lyrics were written and recorded in three days and mixing took an additional four days. In 2005, MTV.com ranked \"The 7 Day Theory\" at #9 on their greatest hip hop albums of all-time list and, in 2006, recognized it as a classic. The emotion and anger showcased on the album have been admired by a large part of the hip hop community. George \"Papa G\" Pryce, former Head of Publicity for Death Row, claimed that \"\"Makaveli\", which we did was sort of tongue-in-cheek and it was not really to come out and after Tupac was murdered, it did come out. But before that, it was going to be a sort of an underground [record].\"\nThe album peaked at number one on the \"Billboard\" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the \"Billboard\" 200. The album generated the second-highest debut-week sales total of any album that year. It was certified 4× Platinum on June 15, 1999.\n\nIn October 1995, Shakur was released from prison after serving nine months of a sentence for sexual assault and formed a new group called Outlaw Immortalz. Shakur joined the Death Row label, under which he released the single \"California Love\".\n\nOn February 13, 1996, Shakur released his fourth solo album, \"All Eyez on Me\". This double album was the first and second of his three-album commitment to Death Row Records. It sold more than nine million copies. The record was a general departure from the introspective subject matter of \"Me Against the World\", being more oriented toward a thug and gangsta mentality. Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. Dr. Dre left his post as in-house producer to form his own label, Aftermath. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums \"Still I Rise\", \"Until the End of Time\", \"Better Dayz\", \"Loyal to the Game\" and \"Pac's Life\". He also began the process of recording an album, \"One Nation\", with the New York-based Boot Camp Clik and their label Duck Down Records.\n\nOn June 4, 1996, he and Outlawz released the diss track \"Hit 'Em Up\", a scathing lyrical assault on The Notorious B.I.G. and others associated with him. In the track, Shakur claimed to have had sexual intercourse with Faith Evans, the wife of Wallace, Shakur's former friend and rival, and attacked Bad Boy's street credibility. Shakur was convinced that some members associated with Bad Boy had known about the 1994 attack on him due to their behavior that night and the information that his sources gave to him. According to a 2005 interview with Jimmy Henchman, in \"Vibe\" magazine, after the attack, Shakur immediately accused Henchman, an associate of Bad Boy CEO Sean Combs, of orchestrating the attack. Shakur, therefore, aligned himself with Suge, Death Row's CEO, who was already bitter toward Combs over a 1995 incident at the Platinum Club in Atlanta, Georgia, which culminated in the death of Jake Robles, the friend and bodyguard of Suge Knight; Knight was adamant in voicing his suspicions about Combs' involvement. In the years following their killings, associates of both Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. have made comments indicating the pair, were it not for their deaths, would have reconciled.\n\nCollaborator Buckshot claimed in 2015 that Shakur defended him against Suge Knight, who had insisted that the East Coast rapper could not come with him to Las Vegas on the grounds of the ongoing hip hop rivalry. Shakur asserted that he would not board the plane unless accompanied by Buckshot and was described by the fellow rapper as looking \"discomforted\" while they recorded a song together in a studio after Shakur \"tore up the plane tickets\".\n\nDuring an August 15, 1996, appearance at the Brotherhood Crusade Rally, which featured several artists discussing the importance of voting, Shakur compared the sales of Death Row records to voters in the U.S. and the influence he and other artists had over an adoring fanbase.\n\nWhen Shakur recorded \"Hit 'Em Up\", a diss song toward Biggie, he recruited three members from the former group, Dramacydal, with whom he had worked previously and was eager to do so again. Shakur, with the three New Jersey rappers and other associates, formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. When 2Pac signed to Death Row after his release from prison, he recruited step brother Mopreme Shakur and Big Syke from Thug Life. Hussein Fatal, Napoleon, E.D.I. Mean, Kastro, Yaki Kadafi, and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added, and together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on 2Pac's Multi-Platinum smash \"All Eyez on Me\". They later dropped the Immortal part of their name after the untimely deaths of 2Pac and Yaki Kadafi and moved on as Outlawz without the members of Thug Life. Young Noble was later added and appeared on 2Pac's second Death Row release \"\". It was on 2Pac's Makaveli album that Outlawz first came to the greater rap community's notice, appearing on a few songs.\nThe idea behind the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding with the names of various tyrants or enemies of America, past, and present. Outlawz chose in later years to make a backronym out of the letters of their group name \"Operating Under Thug Laws as Warriorz\" although it does not stand for the group's name and is used infrequently.\n\nOn forming the Outlawz, Shakur gave each of them a name of a dictator/military leader or an enemy of America.\n\nFor himself, Shakur created the alias \"Makaveli\" from Renaissance Italian philosopher and political theorist Niccolò Machiavelli, whose writings inspired Shakur in prison, but who also preached that a leader could eliminate his enemies by all means necessary. He mentioned Makaveli Records a few times before his death. This was supposed to be a music label for up-and-coming artists that Shakur had an interest in developing or potentially signing, and his own future projects would have been published through it as well.\n\nIn addition to his endeavors in the music industry, Shakur acted in films. He made his first film appearance in \"Nothing but Trouble\" (1991), as part of a cameo by the Digital Underground. His first starring role was in the 1992 film \"Juice\". He played Roland Bishop, a violent member of the Wrecking Crew, for which he was hailed by \"Rolling Stone\"s Peter Travers as \"the film's most magnetic figure\". He then went on to star in \"Poetic Justice\" (1993) opposite Janet Jackson and the basketball drama \"Above the Rim\" (1994). After his death, three more completed films featuring Shakur were released: \"Bullet\" (1996), \"Gridlock'd\" (1997), and \"Gang Related\" (1997).\n\nShakur had been slated to star in the 1993 Hughes brothers' film \"Menace II Society\" but was replaced by Larenz Tate after assaulting Allen Hughes as a result of a quarrel. Shakur reportedly wanted another type of role, but Hughes would not conform to his wishes, leading to the altercation between the pair which, according to Tyrin Turner, also led members of Shakur's entourage to become physically aggressive toward Hughes. In 2013, Hughes said Shakur would have outshined the other actors had he been in the film, \"because he was bigger than the movie.\" Hughes' comments were seen as validation that he had forgiven the rapper since the incident. Larenz Tate, who had several rehearsals with Shakur before his part was recast, recalled Shakur being close to the Hughes brothers but that his actions were the result of \"creative differences\".\n\nDirector John Singleton mentioned that he wrote the script for his film \"Baby Boy\" with Shakur in mind for the lead role. It was eventually filmed with Tyrese Gibson in his place and released in 2001, five years after Shakur's death. The film features a mural of Shakur in the protagonist's bedroom, as well as featuring the song \"Hail Mary\" in the film's score.\n\nShakur's music and philosophy are rooted in many American, African-American, and world entities, including the Black Panther Party, black nationalism, egalitarianism, and liberty. Shakur's love of theater and Shakespeare also influenced his work. A student of the Baltimore School for the Arts where he studied theater, Shakur understood the Shakespearean psychology of inter-gang wars and inter-cultural conflict. During a 1995 interview, Shakur stated:\n\n[…] I love Shakespeare. He wrote some of the rawest stories, man. I mean look at Romeo and Juliet. That's some serious ghetto shit. You got this guy Romeo from the Bloods who falls for Juliet, a female from the Crips, and everybody in both gangs is against them. So they have to sneak out and they end up dead for nothing. Real tragic stuff. And look how Shakespeare busts it up with Macbeth. He creates a tale about this king's wife who convinces a happy man to chase after her and kill her husband so he can take over the country. After he commits the murder, the dude starts having delusions just like in a Scarface song. I mean the king's wife just screws this guy's whole life up for nothing [...].\n\nIn a European interview music journalist Chuck Philips said that what impressed him the most about Shakur was that he was a poet. Philips said \"I like sacred texts, myths, proverbs, and scriptures. [...] When Tupac came along, I thought he was quite the poet [...] It wasn't just how cleverly they rhymed. It wasn't just the rhythm or the cadence. I liked their attitude. It was protest music in a way nobody had ever thought about before. [...]These artists were brave, wise and smart – wickedly smart. Tupac had so many sides. He was unafraid to write about his vulnerabilities.\"\n\nShakur's debut album, \"2Pacalypse Now\", revealed his socially conscious side. On this album, Shakur attacked social injustice, poverty, and police brutality on songs \"Brenda's Got a Baby\", \"Trapped\", and \"Part Time Mutha\". On this initial release, Shakur helped extend the success of such rap groups as Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, X-Clan, and Grandmaster Flash, as he became one of the first major socially conscious rappers from the West Coast.\n\nOn his second record, Shakur continued to rap about the social ills facing African-Americans, with songs like \"The Streetz R Deathrow\" and \"Last Wordz\". He also showed his compassionate side with the anthem \"Keep Ya Head Up\", while simultaneously putting his legendary aggressiveness on display with the title track from the album \"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\" He added a salute to his former group Digital Underground by including them on the playful track \"I Get Around\". Throughout his career, an increasingly aggressive attitude can be seen pervading Shakur's subsequent albums.\n\nThe contradictory themes of social inequality and injustice, unbridled aggression, compassion, playfulness, and hope all continued to shape Shakur's work, as witnessed with the release of his incendiary 1995 album \"Me Against the World\". In 1996, Shakur released \"All Eyez on Me\", and many of the tracks are considered by critics to be classics, including \"Ambitionz Az a Ridah\", \"I Ain't Mad at Cha\", \"California Love\", \"Life Goes On\" and \"Picture Me Rollin\". Shakur described \"All Eyez on Me\" as a celebration of life, and the record was critically and commercially successful.\n\nShakur had enjoyed and had been influenced by the work of contemporary English and Irish pop musicians as a teenager such as Kate Bush, Culture Club, Sinéad O'Connor, and U2. His style on \"2Pacalypse Now\" was highly influenced by the social consciousness and Afrocentrism pervading hip hop in the late 1980s and early 1990s. \"All Eyez on Me\" was a change of style from his earlier works; while still containing socially conscious songs and themes, Shakur's album was heavily influenced by party tracks and tended to have a more \"feel good\" vibe than his earlier albums.\n\nShakur never professed to follow a particular religion, but his lyrics in singles such as \"Ghetto Gospel\" and \"Only God Can Judge Me\" and poems such as \"The Rose That Grew from Concrete (poetry collection)\" suggest he believed in God. Many analysts currently describe him as a deist. He believed in Karma but rejected a literal afterlife and organized religion.\nShakur has had several family members who were members of the Black Panthers; Mutulu Shakur, his step-father; Assata Shakur, his step-aunt; Billy Garland, his biological father; and Afeni Shakur, his mother. Shakur publicly spoke out against interracial marriage in an interview with \"Source\" magazine in 1994, but later retracted these comments.\n\nHis bandana tied into rabbit ears was considered by one writer as one of hip-hop's most recognizable style choices.\n\nShakur was friends with Mike Tyson, Chuck D, Marlon Wayans, Jim Carrey, and Rosie Perez. He befriended fellow rappers Snoop Dogg and Freddie Foxxx, collaborating on songs with the pair and writing to Foxxx while in prison. Tupac attended the John Muir High School prom with his god sister Tashauna Howard. He was also engaged to Kidada Jones. He had a three-year relationship with Madonna.\n\nBilly Garland said Shakur's anger was derived from his frustrations in being misunderstood, pointing specifically to whenever his commitment to the black community and the West Coast were questioned.\n\nIn October 1991, Shakur filed a $10 million civil suit against the Oakland Police Department, alleging that the police brutally beat him for jaywalking. Shakur received approximately $43,000 in settlement money, much of which went to pay his lawyer.\n\nOn August 22, 1992, in Marin City, Shakur performed at an outdoor festival and stayed for an hour afterward signing autographs and pictures. A confrontation occurred and Shakur drew a legally registered Colt Mustang, and allegedly dropped it. As it was picked up by a member of his entourage, a bullet was discharged. About away, Qa'id Walker-Teal, a 6-year-old boy, was pedaling his bicycle at a school playground nearby when a bullet struck him in the forehead and killed him. Although the police matched the bullet to a .38-caliber pistol registered to Shakur, and although his stepbrother, Maurice Harding, was initially arrested on suspicion of firing the weapon, no charges were filed. Marin County prosecutors have said they were stymied by a lack of witnesses. In 1995, a wrongful death suit was brought against Shakur by Qa'id's mother. The defense attorney acknowledged that the bullet that killed Qa'id was traced by authorities to a gun registered to Shakur. The suit was dropped when Shakur agreed to pay a $300,000–$500,000 settlement to the parents.\n\nOn April 5, 1993, Shakur was charged with one count of felonious assault. He was accused of attempting to hit rapper Chauncey Wynn from the group M.A.D. with a baseball bat at a concert at Michigan State University. The incident reportedly began when Shakur became angry and threw a microphone. Shakur pleaded guilty on September 14, 1994, to a misdemeanor in exchange for the dismissal of the felonious-assault charge. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, 20 of which were suspended, and ordered to perform 35 hours of community service.\n\nIn October 1993, in Atlanta, two brothers and off-duty police officers, Mark and Scott Whitwell, were with their wives celebrating Mrs. Whitwell's passing of the state bar examination. The officers were drunk and in possession of stolen guns. As they crossed the street, a car with Shakur inside passed them or \"almost struck them\". The Whitwells argued with the driver, Shakur, and the other passengers, who were joined by a second passing car. Shakur shot one officer in the buttocks and the other in the leg, back, or abdomen, according to varying news reports. Mark Whitwell was charged with firing at Shakur's car and later lying to the police during the investigation. Shakur was charged with the shooting. Prosecutors dropped all charges against the parties.\n\nIn early 1994, he was found guilty of assaulting \"Menace II Society\" co-director Allen Hughes and served 15 days in jail. The previous year, Shakur had boasted during an appearance on \"Yo! MTV Raps\" that he had \"beat up the director of Menace II Society\", the line later being used against him in court.\n\nIn November 1993, Shakur and others were charged with sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room. Shakur denied the charges. According to Shakur, he had prior relations days earlier with the woman that were consensual (the woman admitted she performed oral sex on Shakur). The complainant claimed sexual assault after her second visit to Shakur's hotel room; she alleged that Shakur and his entourage raped her. As a result of the trial, Shakur was convicted of first-degree sexual abuse, and acquitted of the weapons and sodomy charges. The judge described the crimes during the sentencing of Shakur to 1½–4½ years in prison, as \"an act of brutal violence against a helpless woman.\" While appearing on the \"Arsenio Hall Show\", Shakur stated he was innocent of all charges and he was hurt that \"a woman would accuse me of taking something from her\" when he was raised by and was surrounded by females.\n\nIn October 1995, Shakur's case was on appeal but because of his considerable legal fees, he could not raise the $1.4 million bail. After serving nine months of his sentence, Shakur was released from the Clinton Correctional Facility on October 12, 1995, due in large part to the help and influence of Suge Knight, the CEO of Death Row Records, who posted a $1.4 million bail pending appeal of the conviction, in exchange for Shakur releasing three albums under the Death Row label. On April 5, 1996, a judge sentenced him to serve 120 days in jail for violating terms of his release on bail.\n\nOn the night of November 30, 1994, the day before the verdict in his sexual abuse trial was to be announced, Shakur was robbed and shot five times by three men in the lobby of Quad Recording Studios in Manhattan. Shakur stated that he believed the robbery to be a setup for the attack, wondering why they would take jewelry and leave his Rolex watch. Shakur checked out of the Bellevue Hospital Center against doctor's orders, three hours after surgery. In the day that followed, he entered the courthouse in a wheelchair and was found guilty of three counts of molestation and found not guilty of six others, including sodomy, stemming from his 1993 arrest for sexual assault.\n\nIn a 1995 interview with \"Vibe\" magazine, Shakur accused Sean Combs, Jimmy Henchman, and Biggie, among others, of setting up the Quad Recording Studios attack. \"Vibe\" changed the names of the accused assailants upon publication. Later evidence did not implicate Biggie in the studio assault. When Biggie's entourage went downstairs to check on the incident, Shakur was being taken out on a stretcher, giving the finger to those around.\n\nOn March 17, 2008, Chuck Philips wrote in the \"Los Angeles Times\" about an alleged order for an attack on Shakur. The article was retracted by the \"LA Times\" because it partially relied on FBI documents, supplied by a man convicted of fraud, which turned out to be forged. In 2011, Dexter Isaac admitted to attacking Shakur. Following Isaac's public confession, Philips named Isaac as one of his unnamed sources for the retracted article.\n\nShakur began serving his prison sentence on sexual-assault charges at Clinton Correctional Facility on February 14, 1995. Shortly afterward, he released his Multi-Platinum album \"Me Against the World\". Shakur became the first artist to have an album at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200 while serving a prison sentence. \"Me Against the World\" made its debut on the \"Billboard\" 200 and stayed at the top of the charts for four weeks. The album sold 240,000 copies in its first week, setting a record for highest first week sales for a solo male rap artist at the time. While serving his sentence, he married his long-time girlfriend, Keisha Morris, on April 4, 1995; the couple divorced in 1996. Shakur stated that he married her \"for the wrong reasons\". In an interview after his release, Shakur claimed to have only written one song during his sentence. While imprisoned, Shakur became interested in philosophy, philosophy of war, and military strategy by studying the works such as \"The Prince\" by Italian philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli and \"The Art of War\" by Chinese military strategist Sun Tzu. The works inspired his pseudonym \"Makaveli\" under which he released the album \"\". The album presents a stark contrast to previous works. Throughout the album, Shakur continues to focus on the themes of pain and aggression, making this album one of the emotionally darker works of his career.\n\nWhile in prison, Shakur wrote to Death Row Uncut director Nina Bhadresher about his plans to begin a \"new chapter\" of his life. According to Kevin Powell, who spoke to Shakur following his release from prison, Shakur \"seemed like a completely transformed person.\" Powell recalled Shakur being more dark and menacing to the extent that Powell wondered whether he had really known Shakur.\n\nOn the night of September 7, 1996, Shakur attended the Bruce Seldon vs. Mike Tyson boxing match with Suge Knight at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, Nevada. After leaving the match, one of Knight's associates spotted Orlando \"Baby Lane\" Anderson, an alleged Crips gang member from Compton, California, in the MGM Grand lobby. Earlier that year, Anderson and a group of Crips had robbed a member of Death Row's entourage in a Foot Locker store. Knight's associate told Shakur, who attacked Anderson. Shakur's entourage, as well as Knight and his followers, assisted in assaulting Anderson. Shakur punched Anderson in the face. The fight was captured on the hotel's video surveillance. After the brawl, Shakur went with Knight to Death Row–owned Club 662 (now known as restaurant/club Seven). Shakur rode in Knight's 1996 black BMW 750iL sedan as part of a larger convoy, which included many in Shakur's entourage.\n\nAt 11:00–11:05 p.m. (PDT), they were halted on Las Vegas Boulevard by Metro bicycle police for playing the car stereo too loudly and not having license plates, which were found in the trunk of Knight's car; the party was released a few minutes later without being ticketed. At 11:10 p.m. (PDT), while they were stopped at a red light at the intersection of Flamingo Road and Koval Lane in front of the Maxim Hotel, a vehicle occupied by two women pulled up on their left side. Shakur, who was standing up through the sunroof, exchanged words with the women and invited them to Club 662. At 11:15 p.m. (PDT), a white, four-door, late-model Cadillac with unknown occupants pulled up to the sedan's right side. Someone inside rolled down a window and rapidly fired gunshots at Shakur. He was hit four times, twice in the chest, once in the arm, and once in the thigh. One of the bullets went into Shakur's right lung. Knight was hit in the head by fragmentation. The bodyguard, Frank Alexander, stated that, when he was about to ride along with the rapper in Knight's car, Shakur asked him to drive the car of Shakur's fiancée, Kidada Jones, instead, in case they needed additional vehicles for the drive from Club 662 to the hotel. The bodyguard reported in his documentary, \"Before I Wake\", that, shortly after the assault, one of the convoy's cars drove off after the assailant but that he never heard from the occupants.\nAfter arriving at the scene, police and paramedics took Knight and a wounded Shakur to the University Medical Center of Southern Nevada. Chris Carroll, the first Las Vegas police officer to arrive on the scene, heard Shakur's last words, \"fuck you\". Carroll reports that he refused to say another word to him or another officer. According to an interview with the music video director Gobi, while at the hospital, Shakur received news from a Death Row marketing employee that the shooters had called the record company and threatened Shakur. Gobi informed the Las Vegas police but said that the police claimed to be understaffed. No attackers came. At the hospital, Shakur was heavily sedated, was placed on life-support machines, and was ultimately put under a barbiturate-induced coma after repeatedly trying to get out of the bed.\nWhile in the intensive-care unit, on the afternoon of September 13, 1996, Shakur died from internal bleeding; doctors attempted to revive him but could not stop the hemorrhaging. His mother, Afeni, made the decision to tell the doctors to stop. He was pronounced dead at 4:03 p.m. (PDT). The official causes of death were noted as respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest in connection with multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nShakur's body was cremated the next day. Some of his ashes were purportedly later mixed with marijuana and smoked by members of the Outlawz. However, E.D.I. Mean claimed in an interview in 2014 that, despite his belief at the time that the ashes were those of Shakur, he later found that the ashes did not belong to Shakur, which has led some people to believe that Shakur did not die at all.\n\nHis fifth album, \"\", was released two months later along with numerous other posthumous albums.\n\nIn 2002, the \"Los Angeles Times\" published a two-part story by investigative reporter Chuck Philips, titled \"Who Killed Tupac Shakur?\", based on yearlong research that reconstructed the crime and the events leading up to it. Information gathered by the paper indicated that: \"the shooting was carried out by a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier. Orlando Anderson, the Crip whom Shakur had attacked, fired the fatal shots. Las Vegas police discounted Anderson as a suspect and interviewed him only once, briefly. He was later killed in an unrelated gang shooting.\" The article also reported the involvement of East Coast rapper Biggie, Shakur's rival at the time, and several New York criminals.\n\nBefore they died, The Notorious B.I.G. and Anderson denied any role in the murder. In support of their claims, Biggie's family produced computerized invoices suggesting that Biggie was working in a New York recording studio the night of the drive-by shooting. His manager Wayne Barrow and fellow rapper Lil' Cease (James Lloyd) made public announcements denying Biggie's role in the crime and claimed further that they were with him in the recording studio the night of the event. The \"New York Times\" called the evidence \"inconclusive\", noting:\n\nThe pages purport to be three computer printouts from Daddy's House, indicating that Wallace was in the studio recording a song called \"Nasty Boy\" on the afternoon Shakur was shot. They indicate that Wallace \"wrote half the session\", was \"In and out/sat around\" and \"laid down a ref\", shorthand for a reference vocal, the equivalent of a first take. But nothing indicates when the documents were created. And Louis Alfred, the recording engineer listed on the sheets, said in an interview that he remembered recording the song with Wallace in a late-night session, not during the day. He could not recall the date of the session but said it was likely not the night Shakur was shot. 'We would have heard about it,' Mr. Alfred said.\"\nIn 2011, pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, the FBI released documents revealing its investigation of the Jewish Defense League for making death threats against Shakur and other rappers.\n\nAt a Mobb Deep concert following the death of Shakur and the release of \"\", Cormega recalled in an interview that the fans were all shouting \"Makaveli\", and emphasized the influence of \"The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory\" and of Shakur himself even in New York at the height of the media-dubbed \"intercoastal rivalry\".\n\nShakur is held in high esteem by other MCs: In the book \"How to Rap\", Bishop Lamont (Philip Martin) notes that Shakur \"mastered every element, every aspect\" of rapping and Fredro Starr (Fred Scruggs) of Onyx says Shakur \"was a master of the flow.\" \"Every rapper who grew up in the Nineties owes something to Tupac,\" wrote 50 Cent (Curtis Jackson). \"He didn't sound like anyone who came before him.\" About.com, for their part, named Shakur the most influential rapper ever.\n\nChuck Philips writes that \"the slaying [of Tupac Shakur] silenced one of modern music's most eloquent voices—a ghetto poet whose tales of urban alienation captivated young people of all races and backgrounds. The 25-year-old Shakur had helped elevate rap from a crude street fad to a complex art form, setting the stage for the current global hip-hop phenomenon\".\n\nTo preserve Shakur's legacy, his mother founded the Shakur Family Foundation (later renamed the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation or TASF) in 1997. The TASF's stated mission is to \"provide training and support for students who aspire to enhance their creative talents.\" The TASF sponsors essay contests, charity events, a performing arts day camp for teenagers and undergraduate scholarships. The Foundation officially opened the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts (TASCA) in Stone Mountain, Georgia, on June 11, 2005. On November 14, 2003, a documentary about Shakur entitled \"\" was released under the supervision of his mother and narrated entirely in his voice. It was nominated for Best Documentary at the 2005 Academy Awards. Proceeds will go to a charity set up by Shakur's mother Afeni. On April 17, 2003, Harvard University co-sponsored an academic symposium entitled \"All Eyez on Me: Tupac Shakur and the Search for the Modern Folk Hero\". The speakers discussed a wide range of topics dealing with Shakur's impact on everything from entertainment to sociology.\n\nMany of the speakers discussed Shakur's status and public persona, including State University of New York at Buffalo English professor Mark Anthony Neal who gave the talk \"Thug Nigga Intellectual: Tupac as Celebrity Gramscian\" in which he argued that Shakur was an example of the \"organic intellectual\" expressing the concerns of a larger group. Professor Neal has also indicated in his writings that the death of Shakur has left a \"leadership void amongst hip-hop artists.\" Neal further describes him as a \"walking contradiction\", a status that allowed him to \"make being an intellectual accessible to ordinary people.\"\n\nProfessor of Communications Murray Forman, of Northeastern University, spoke of the mythical status about Shakur's life and death. He addressed the symbolism and mythology surrounding Shakur's death in his talk entitled \"Tupac Shakur: O.G. (Ostensibly Gone)\". Among his findings were that Shakur's fans have \"succeeded in resurrecting Tupac as an ethereal life force.\" In \"From Thug Life to Legend: Realization of a Black Folk Hero\", Professor of Music at Northeastern University, Emmett Price, compared Shakur's public image to that of the trickster figures of African-American folklore which gave rise to the urban \"bad-man\" persona of the post-slavery period. He ultimately described Shakur as a \"prolific artist\" who was \"driven by a terrible sense of urgency\" in a quest to \"unify mind, body, and spirit\".\n\nIn \"Holler If You Hear Me: Searching for Tupac Shakur\", Michael Eric Dyson indicated that Shakur \"spoke with brilliance and insight as someone who bears witness to the pain of those who would never have his platform. He told the truth, even as he struggled with the fragments of his identity.\" At one Harvard Conference the theme was Shakur's impact on entertainment, race relations, politics and the \"hero/martyr\". In late 1997, the University of California, Berkeley offered a student-led course entitled \"History 98: Poetry and History of Tupac Shakur.\"\n\nIn late 2003, the Makaveli Branded Clothing line was launched by Afeni. In 2005, Death Row released \"\". The DVD was the final recorded performance of Shakur's career, which took place on July 4, 1996, and features a large number of Death Row artists. In August 2006, \"Tupac Shakur Legacy\" was released. The interactive biography was written by Jamal Joseph. It features unseen family photographs, intimate stories, and over 20 removable reproductions of his handwritten song lyrics, contracts, scripts, poetry, and other personal papers. Shakur's sixth posthumous studio album, \"Pac's Life\", was released on November 21, 2006. It commemorates the 10th anniversary of Shakur's death. He is still considered one of the most popular artists in the music industry .\n\nAccording to \"Forbes\", in 2008 Shakur's estate made $15 million. In 2002, they recognized him as a \"Top-Earning Dead Celebrity\", coming in at number ten on their list.\n\nBET named 2Pac 'The Most Influential Rappers of All Time'. They then went on to say \"his confounding mixture of ladies' man, thug, revolutionary and poet has forever altered our perception of what a rapper should look like, sound like and act like. In 50 Cent, Ja Rule, Lil Wayne, newcomers like Freddie Gibbs and even his friend-turned-rival Biggie, it's easy to see that Pac is the most copied MC of all time. There are murals bearing his likeness in New York, Brazil, Sierra Leone, Bulgaria and countless other places; he even has statues in Atlanta and Germany. Quite simply, no other rapper has captured the world's attention the way Tupac did and still does.\"\nOn April 15, 2012, a \"hologram\" of Shakur (technically a 2-D video projection) performed his songs \"Hail Mary\" and \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\" with Snoop Dogg at the Coachella Music Festival. The effect was created using an optical illusion called Pepper's ghost. The video footage was created by visual effects company Digital Domain. \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg were in talks of a possible tour involving the two rappers and the projection version of Shakur, which was later turned down by Dr. Dre.\nTupac's 1998 album Greatest Hits returned to the Billboard 200 the following week for the first time since 2000, reaching No. 129 with 4,000 copies sold according to Nielsen SoundScan (a gain of 571% over the previous week). The MC's other albums also saw gains, including \"All Eyez On Me\" (2,000; up 95%) and \"Me Against the World\" (1,000; up 53%).\nHis singles also saw a boost in sales. His biggest seller of the week was \"Hail Mary\"—the song his projection opened with at Coachella. His second biggest seller was his No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 hit \"California Love\" (featuring Dr. Dre and Roger Troutman), shifting 11,000 downloads (119% increase). His third best-seller was the second Tupac song that was performed at Coachella – \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\" (with Snoop). It sold 9,000 (up 881%).\n\n\"Holler If Ya Hear Me\" (2014), was a Broadway play based on the lyrics of Tupac. The production lasted 6 weeks before it folded due to being one of Broadway's worst-selling musicals in recent years. It was announced in January 2015 the following month would see an exhibit dedicated to Shakur opened at the Grammy Museum. Executive director Robert Santelli praised Shakur as \"one of the most original and important of all hip hop artists\", adding that his writings were \"both powerful and provocative\". During a panel for the exhibit, attended by his mother Afeni, cousins and various members of his extended family, rapper YG said that he was inspired by Shakur to return to school and that Shakur was like a \"father figure\" to some.\n\nOn December 24, 2015, Demetrius Shipp, Jr. was cast as Shakur in a biopic titled \"All Eyez on Me\", which started filming in Atlanta in December 2015. With distribution from Morgan Creek Productions, the film had been in development since 2013, with producers Randall Emmett and George Furla having sued Morgan Creek for $10 million in October. Emmett and Furla claimed breach-of-contract after the production company allegedly picked a lead, set a budget and production schedule without their approval. Morgan Creek also sued Afeni Shakur for the music rights for the film. Music video director Benny Boom helmed \"All Eyez on Me\", which had been hamstrung by production problems. Multiple directors were involved with the film before Boom, including John Singleton and Antoine Fuqua. The film was released to negative reviews on June 16, 2017, which would have been Shakur's 46th birthday.\n\nIn 2003, MTV's \"22 Greatest MCs\" countdown listed Shakur as the \"Number 1 MC\", as voted by the viewers. In 2004, at the VH1 Hip Hop Honors Shakur was honored along with DJ Hollywood, Kool DJ Herc, KRS-One, Public Enemy, Run-D.M.C., Rock Steady Crew, and Sugarhill Gang. A \"Vibe\" magazine poll in 2004 rated Shakur \"the greatest rapper of all time\" as voted by fans. Editors of About.com ranked him No. 5 on their list of the \"Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987–2007)\". In 2012, \"The Source\" ranked him No. 5 on their list of the top 50 hip-hop lyricists of all time. In a 2005 \"Rolling Stone\" magazine vote, Shakur was named No. 86 of the \"100 Immortal Artists of All Time\" behind Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and John Lennon. MTV ranked him at No. 2 on their list of \"The Greatest MCs of All Time\". Shakur was inducted into the Hip-Hop Hall of Fame in 2002. VH1 ranked him 69th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All-Time. At the First Annual Turks & Caicos International Film Festival held on Tuesday, October 17, 2006, Shakur was honored for his undeniable voice and talent and as a performer who crossed racial, ethnic, cultural and medium lines; his mother accepted the award on his behalf.\n\nIn 2008, The National Association Of Recording Merchandisers in conjunction with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame recognized him as a very influential artist and has added him in their Definitive 200 list.\n\nOn June 23, 2010, Shakur was inducted to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry. The seat of the Catholic Church released a list of 12 songs onto the social networking Web site's streaming music service. Among the artists included are Mozart, Muse, and Dame Shirley Bassey; the list also includes Shakur's song \"Changes\", which was released two years after his shooting death on a greatest hits album in 1998.\n\nHis double album, \"All Eyez on Me\", is one of the highest-selling rap albums of all time, with over 5 million copies of the album sold in the United States alone by April 1996; it was eventually certified 9x platinum in June 1998 by the RIAA. In July 2014 it was recertified 10x platinum.\n\nShakur's hit song \"Dear Mama\" is one of 25 songs that were added to the National Recording Registry in 2010. The Library of Congress has called Dear Mama \"a moving and eloquent homage to both the murdered rapper's own mother and all mothers struggling to maintain a family in the face of addiction, poverty, and societal indifference.\" The honor came seven days after what would have been Shakur's 39th birthday. Shakur is the third rapper to enter the library, outside of the copyright office, behind Grandmaster Flash and Public Enemy.\n\nIn 2016, Shakur was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility, when on December 20, 2016, it was announced that he and 5 others would be inducted into the Hall on April 7, 2017. At the ceremony, Shakur was inducted by his friend and fellow hip hop artist Snoop Dogg, who delineated several stories about their time together and of the time Shakur spent in the hospital before his death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShakur's life has been recognized in big and small documentaries, each trying capture the many different events during his short lifetime, most notably the Academy Award nominated \"\", released in 2003.\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Afeni Shakur\n\nAfeni Shakur Davis (born Alice Faye Williams; January 10, 1947 – May 2, 2016) was an American activist and businesswoman. Shakur was the mother of American rapper and actor, Tupac Shakur.\n\nShakur was born Alice Faye Williams on January 10, 1947, in Lumberton, North Carolina, the daughter of Rosa Belle, a homemaker, and Walter Williams, a trucker.\n\nIn 1968 at the age of twenty-one, she changed her name to Afeni Shakur, \"Afeni\" meaning \"lover of people\" and \"Shakur\" being Arabic for \"thankful to god\", respectively. She was then living in Harlem, New York, where she joined the far-left Black Panther Party. She became a section leader of the Harlem chapter and a mentor to new members, including Jamal Joseph, Cleo Silvers and Dhoruba Bin-Wahad. She also worked with Billy Garland (who is Tupac's biological father) and Geronimo Pratt (who became Tupac's baptismal sponsor). \n\nIn April 1969, Shakur was arrested on charges of conspiring with other Black Panther members to carry out bombings in New York. With bail set at $100,000 each for the 21 suspects, the Black Panthers decided to raise bail money first for Joseph and Shakur so that those two could work on raising bail for the others. Shakur had been effective in raising bail funds for jailed Panthers. After reading Fidel Castro's \"History Will Absolve Me\", Shakur chose to represent herself in court, telling other accused Panthers that if they were convicted, they would be the ones serving jail time, not the lawyers. Pregnant while on trial and facing a thirty-year prison sentence, Shakur interviewed witnesses and argued in court. She and the others in the \"Panther 21\" were acquitted in May 1971 after an eight-month trial. Her son Lesane Parish Crooks was born on June 16, 1971 (he would be renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur the following year, in 1972).\n\nExactly one year following her son's death, with revenue from his albums released posthumously, Afeni Shakur founded the Georgia-based Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation, which provides art programs for young people, and Amaru Entertainment, the holding company for all Tupac's unreleased material. She also launched a fashion clothing line, Makaveli Branded; all proceeds go to his charity, the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation.\n\nShakur was reportedly in federal court on July 20, 2007, to file an injunction to prevent Death Row Records from selling any unreleased material from Tupac after the company failed to prove that the unreleased songs were not part of its bankruptcy settlement. \n\nShe created a record label named Amaru Records to release Tupac's unreleased recordings. She won her court case against Death Row Record to receive 150 unreleased songs by her son.\n\nShakur traveled across the U.S., making guest appearances and delivering lectures. On February 6, 2007, she gave the keynote address for Vanderbilt University's Commemoration for Black History Month.\n\nOn May 2, 2016, police and paramedics responded to Shakur's home in Sausalito, California. She was transported to a nearby hospital, where she was pronounced dead of a suspected heart attack. Her body was cremated.\n\n",
                "Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts\n\nThe Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts, based in Stone Mountain, Georgia, was a performing arts center supported through the Shakur Family Foundation. The Shakur Center's mission was to provide opportunities for young people through the arts, and offers programs such as drama, dance, and creative writing classes. The organization also ran a Performing Arts Day Camp for youth ages twelve to eighteen. \n\nThe center, located off of Memorial Drive was named in honor of the late American Hip Hop artist Tupac Amaru Shakur, and was founded by his mother Afeni Shakur.\n\nThe center was founded in 1997 by Tupac Shakur's mother Afeni Shakur in the interest of preserving her son's legacy. It is designed to bring quality arts training to young people including some students that face many social-economic issues such as poverty. Many students have enriched their artistic abilities through this center and some have even received part-time jobs. \n\nIn July 1999 the foundation began its first annual summer session of PA camps with twenty campers. The camp continued to grow throughout the years. On June 11, 2005 The Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts Peace Garden and visitor centre was opened. The peace garden was designed as a tribute to Tupac Shakur as well as others who have died. In 2006 the music video for the single Pac's Life for the self-titled album was shot at the Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts. Tupac's mother Afeni Shakur also went to Africa in 2006 and fostered a relationship between The Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts and The Nelson Mendela foundation.\n\nAfter 2006 the foundation showed signs of growth as many additional programs were created such as after school programs, dance classes and cultural exchange programs. Fees for these program resemble prices similar to those of joining a local sports league. The foundation has also held Tupac birthday concert celebrations since 2009.\n\nAs Tupac's catalogue of unreleased music decreased, the foundation began facing financial struggles. Despite these struggles, Afeni Shakur resisted selling the center.\n\nThe foundation offered acting, after school and dancing classes. In addition, they offer yearly leadership and arts programs. They had also set up cross cultural exchanges with Japan and South Africa.\n\n"

                "Giant armadillo\n\nThe giant armadillo (\"Priodontes maximus\"), colloquially tatou, ocarro, tatu-canastra or tatú carreta, is the largest living species of armadillo (although their extinct relatives, the glyptodonts, were much larger). It lives in South America, ranging throughout as far south as northern Argentina. This species is considered vulnerable to extinction.\n\nThe giant armadillo prefers termites and some ants as prey, and often consumes the entire population of a termite mound. It also has been known to prey upon worms, larvae and larger creatures, such as spiders and snakes, and plants.\n\nAt least one zoo park, in Villavicencio, Colombia – \"Los Ocarros\" – is dedicated to this animal.\n\nThe giant armadillo is the largest living species of armadillo, with 11 to 13 hinged bands protecting the body and a further three or four on the neck. Its body is dark brown in color, with a lighter, yellowish band running along the sides, and a pale, yellow-white head. These armadillos have around 80 to 100 teeth, which is more than any other terrestrial mammal. The teeth are all similar in appearance, being reduced premolars and molars, grow constantly throughout life, and lack enamel. They also possess extremely long front claws, including a sickle-shaped third claw, which are proportionately the largest of any living mammal. The tail is covered in small rounded scales and does not have the heavy bony scutes that cover the upper body and top of the head. The animal is almost entirely hairless, with just a few beige colored hairs protruding between the scutes.\n\nGiant armadillos typically weigh around when fully grown, however a specimen has been weighed in the wild and captive specimens have been weighed up to . The typical length of the species is , with the tail adding another .\n\nGiant armadillos are found throughout much of northern South America east of the Andes, except for eastern Brazil and Paraguay. In the south, they reach the northernmost provinces of Argentina, including Salta, Formosa, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero. There are no recognised geographic subspecies. They primarily inhabit open habitats, with cerrado grasslands covering about 25% of their range, but they can also be found in lowland forests.\n\nGiant armadillos are solitary and nocturnal, spending the day in burrows. They also burrow to escape predators, being unable to completely roll into a protective ball. Compared with those of other armadillos, their burrows are unusually large, with entrances averaging wide, and typically opening to the west.\n\nGiant armadillos use their large front claws to dig for prey and rip open termite mounds. The diet is mainly composed of termites, although ants, worms, spiders and other invertebrates are also eaten. Little is currently known about this species' reproductive biology, and no juveniles have ever been discovered in the field. The average sleep time of a captive giant armadillo is said to be 18.1 hours.\n\nArmadillos have not been extensively studied in the wild; therefore, little is known about their natural ecology and behavior. In the only long term study on the species, that started in 2003 in the Peruvian Amazon, dozens of other species of mammals, reptiles and birds were found using the giant armadillos' burrows on the same day, including the rare short-eared dog (\"Atelocynus microtis\"). Because of this, the species is considered a habitat engineer, and the local extinction of \"Priodontes\" may have cascading effects in the mammalian community by impoverishing fossorial habitat.\n\nFemale giant armadillos have two teats and are thought to normally give birth to only a single young per year. Little is known with certainty about their life history, although it is thought that the young are weaned by about seven to eight months of age, and that the mother periodically seals up the entrance to burrows containing younger offspring, presumably to protect them from predators. Although they have never bred in captivity, a wild-born giant armadillo at San Antonio Zoo was estimated to have been around sixteen years old when it died.\n\nHunted throughout its range, a single giant armadillo supplies a great deal of meat, and is the primary source of protein for some indigenous peoples. In addition, live giant armadillos are frequently captured for trade on the black market, and invariably die during transportation or in captivity. Despite this species’ wide range, it is locally rare. This is further exacerbated by habitat loss resulting from deforestation. Current estimates indicate the giant armadillo may have undergone a worrying population decline of 30 to 50 percent over the past three decades. Without intervention, this trend is likely to continue.\n\nThe giant armadillo was classified as vulnerable on the World Conservation Union's Red List in 2002, and is listed under Appendix I (threatened with extinction) of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna.\n\nThe giant armadillo is protected by law in Colombia, Guyana, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Suriname and Peru, and international trade is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). However, hunting for food and sale in the black market continues to occur throughout its entire range. Some populations occur within protected reserves, including the Parque das Emas in Brazil, and the Central Suriname Nature Reserve, a massive 1.6-million-hectare site of pristine rainforest managed by Conservation International. Such protection helps to some degree to mitigate the threat of habitat loss, but targeted conservation action is required to prevent the further decline of this species.\n\n",
                "Termite\n\nTermites are eusocial insects that are classified at the taxonomic rank of infraorder Isoptera, or as epifamily Termitoidae within the cockroach order Blattodea. Termites were once classified in a separate order from cockroaches, but recent phylogenetic studies indicate that they evolved from close ancestors of cockroaches during the Jurassic or Triassic. However, the first termites possibly emerged during the Permian or even the Carboniferous. About 3,106 species are currently described, with a few hundred more left to be described. Although these insects are often called \"white ants\", they are not ants.\n\nLike ants and some bees and wasps from the separate order Hymenoptera, termites divide labour among castes consisting of sterile male and female \"workers\" and \"soldiers\". All colonies have fertile males called \"kings\" and one or more fertile females called \"queens\". Termites mostly feed on dead plant material and cellulose, generally in the form of wood, leaf litter, soil, or animal dung. Termites are major detritivores, particularly in the subtropical and tropical regions, and their recycling of wood and plant matter is of considerable ecological importance.\n\nTermites are among the most successful groups of insects on Earth, colonising most landmasses except for Antarctica. Their colonies range in size from a few hundred individuals to enormous societies with several million individuals. Termite queens have the longest lifespan of any insect in the world, with some queens reportedly living up to 30 to 50 years. Unlike ants, which undergo a complete metamorphosis, each individual termite goes through an incomplete metamorphosis that proceeds through egg, nymph, and adult stages. Colonies are described as superorganisms because the termites form part of a self-regulating entity: the colony itself.\n\nTermites are a delicacy in the diet of some human cultures and are used in many traditional medicines. Several hundred species are economically significant as pests that can cause serious damage to buildings, crops, or plantation forests. Some species, such as the West Indian drywood termite (\"Cryptotermes brevis\"), are regarded as invasive species.\n\nThe infraorder name Isoptera is derived from the Greek words \"iso\" (equal) and \"ptera\" (winged), which refers to the nearly equal size of the fore and hind wings. \"Termite\" derives from the Latin and Late Latin word \"termes\" (\"woodworm, white ant\"), altered by the influence of Latin \"terere\" (\"to rub, wear, erode\") from the earlier word \"tarmes\". Termite nests were commonly known as \"terminarium\" or \"termitaria\". In early English, termites were known as \"wood ants\" or \"white ants\". The modern term was first used in 1781.\n\nDNA analysis from 16S rRNA sequences has supported a hypothesis, originally suggested by Cleveland and colleagues in 1934, that these insects are most closely related to wood-eating cockroaches (genus \"Cryptocercus\", the woodroach). This earlier conclusion had been based on the similarity of the symbiotic gut flagellates in the wood-eating cockroaches to those in certain species of termites regarded as living fossils. In the 1960s additional evidence supporting that hypothesis emerged when F. A. McKittrick noted similar morphological characteristics between some termites and \"Cryptocercus\" nymphs. These similarities have led some authors to propose that termites be reclassified as a single family, the Termitidae, within the order Blattodea, which contains cockroaches. Other researchers advocate the more conservative measure of retaining the termites as the Termitoidae, an epifamily within the cockroach order, which preserves the classification of termites at family level and below.\n\nThe oldest unambiguous termite fossils date to the early Cretaceous, but given the diversity of Cretaceous termites and early fossil records showing mutualism between microorganisms and these insects, they likely originated earlier in the Jurassic or Triassic. Further evidence of a Jurassic origin is the assumption that the extinct \"Fruitafossor\" consumed termites, judging from its morphological similarity to modern termite-eating mammals. The oldest termite nest discovered is believed to be from the Upper Cretaceous in West Texas, where the oldest known faecal pellets were also discovered.\n\nClaims that termites emerged earlier have faced controversy. For example, F. M. Weesner indicated that the Mastotermitidae termites may go back to the Late Permian, 251 million years ago, and fossil wings that have a close resemblance to the wings of \"Mastotermes\" of the Mastotermitidae, the most primitive living termite, have been discovered in the Permian layers in Kansas. It is even possible that the first termites emerged during the Carboniferous. Termites are thought to be the descendants of the genus \"Cryptocercus\". The folded wings of the fossil wood roach \"Pycnoblattina\", arranged in a convex pattern between segments 1a and 2a, resemble those seen in \"Mastotermes\", the only living insect with the same pattern. Krishna \"et al.\", though, consider that all of the Paleozoic and Triassic insects tentatively classified as termites are in fact unrelated to termites and should be excluded from the Isoptera. Termites were the first social insects to evolve a caste system, evolving more than 100 million years ago.\n\nTermites have long been accepted to be closely related to cockroaches and mantids, and they are classified in the same superorder (Dictyoptera). Strong evidence suggests termites are highly specialised wood-eating cockroaches. The cockroach genus \"Cryptocercus\" shares the strongest phylogenetical similarity with termites and is considered to be a sister-group to termites. Termites and \"Cryptocercus\" share similar morphological and social features: for example, most cockroaches do not exhibit social characteristics, but \"Cryptocercus\" takes care of its young and exhibits other social behaviour such as trophallaxis and allogrooming. The primitive giant northern termite (\"Mastotermes darwiniensis\") exhibits numerous cockroach-like characteristics that are not shared with other termites, such as laying its eggs in rafts and having anal lobes on the wings. Cryptocercidae and Isoptera are united in the clade Xylophagodea. Although termites are sometimes called \"white ants\", they are actually not ants. Ants belong to the family Formicidae within the order Hymenoptera. The similarity of their social structure to that of termites is attributed to convergent evolution.\nAs of 2013, about 3,106 living and fossil termite species are recognised, classified in 12 families. The infraorder Isoptera is divided into the following clade and family groups, showing the subfamilies in their respective classification:\n\nOrder Blattaria\n\nTermites are found on all continents except Antarctica. The diversity of termite species is low in North America and Europe (10 species known in Europe and 50 in North America), but is high in South America, where over 400 species are known. Of the 3,000 termite species currently classified, 1,000 are found in Africa, where mounds are extremely abundant in certain regions. Approximately 1.1 million active termite mounds can be found in the northern Kruger National Park alone. In Asia, there are 435 species of termites, which are mainly distributed in China. Within China, termite species are restricted to mild tropical and subtropical habitats south of the Yangtze River. In Australia, all ecological groups of termites (dampwood, drywood, subterranean) are endemic to the country, with over 360 classified species.\n\nDue to their soft cuticles, termites do not inhabit cool or cold habitats. There are three ecological groups of termites: dampwood, drywood and subterranean. Dampwood termites are found only in coniferous forests, and drywood termites are found in hardwood forests; subterranean termites live in widely diverse areas. One species in the drywood group is the West Indian drywood termite \"(Cryptotermes brevis)\", which is an invasive species in Australia.\n\nTermites are usually small, measuring between in length. The largest of all extant termites are the queens of the species \"Macrotermes bellicosus\", measuring up to over 10 centimetres (4 in) in length. Another giant termite, the extinct \"Gyatermes styriensis\", flourished in Austria during the Miocene and had a wingspan of and a body length of .\n\nMost worker and soldier termites are completely blind as they do not have a pair of eyes. However, some species, such as \"Hodotermes mossambicus\", have compound eyes which they use for orientation and to distinguish sunlight from moonlight. The alates have eyes along with lateral ocelli. Lateral ocelli, however, are not found in all termites. Like other insects, termites have a small tongue-shaped labrum and a clypeus; the clypeus is divided into a postclypeus and anteclypeus. Termite antennae have a number of functions such as the sensing of touch, taste, odours (including pheromones), heat and vibration. The three basic segments of a termite antenna include a scape, a pedicel (typically shorter than the scape), and the flagellum (all segments beyond the scape and pedicel). The mouth parts contain a maxillae, a labium, and a set of mandibles. The maxillae and labium have palps that help termites sense food and handling.\n\nConsistent with all insects, the anatomy of the termite thorax consists of three segments: the prothorax, the mesothorax and the metathorax. Each segment contains a pair of legs. On alates, the wings are located at the mesothorax and metathorax. The mesothorax and metathorax have well-developed exoskeletal plates; the prothorax has smaller plates.\nTermites have a ten-segmented abdomen with two plates, the tergites and the sternites. The tenth abdominal segment has a pair of short cerci. There are ten tergites, of which nine are wide and one is elongated. The reproductive organs are similar to those in cockroaches but are more simplified. For example, the intromittent organ is not present in male alates, and the sperm is either immotile or aflagellate. However, Mastotermitidae termites have multiflagellate sperm with limited motility. The genitals in females are also simplified. Unlike in other termites, Mastotermitidae females have an ovipositor, a feature strikingly similar to that in female cockroaches.\n\nThe non-reproductive castes of termites are wingless and rely exclusively on their six legs for locomotion. The alates fly only for a brief amount of time, so they also rely on their legs. The appearance of the legs is similar in each caste, but the soldiers have larger and heavier legs. The structure of the legs is consistent with other insects: the parts of a leg include a coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia and the tarsus. The number of tibial spurs on an individual's leg varies. Some species of termite have an arolium, located between the claws, which is present in species that climb on smooth surfaces but is absent in most termites.\n\nUnlike in ants, the hind-wings and fore-wings are of equal length. Most of the time, the alates are poor flyers; their technique is to launch themselves in the air and fly in a random direction. Studies show that in comparison to larger termites, smaller termites cannot fly long distances. When a termite is in flight, its wings remain at a right angle, and when the termite is at rest, its wings remain parallel to the body.\n\nWorker termites undertake the most labour within the colony, being responsible for foraging, food storage, and brood and nest maintenance. Workers are tasked with the digestion of cellulose in food and are thus the most likely caste to be found in infested wood. The process of worker termites feeding other nestmates is known as trophallaxis. Trophallaxis is an effective nutritional tactic to convert and recycle nitrogenous components. It frees the parents from feeding all but the first generation of offspring, allowing for the group to grow much larger and ensuring that the necessary gut symbionts are transferred from one generation to another. Some termite species do not have a true worker caste, instead relying on nymphs that perform the same work without differentiating as a separate caste.\n\nThe soldier caste has anatomical and behavioural specialisations, and their sole purpose is to defend the colony. Many soldiers have large heads with highly modified powerful jaws so enlarged they cannot feed themselves. Instead, like juveniles, they are fed by workers. Fontanelles, simple holes in the forehead that exude defensive secretions, are a feature of the family Rhinotermitidae. Many species are readily identified using the characteristics of the soldiers' larger and darker head and large mandibles. Among certain termites, soldiers may use their globular (phragmotic) heads to block their narrow tunnels. Different sorts of soldiers include minor and major soldiers, and nasutes, which have a horn-like nozzle frontal projection (a nasus). These unique soldiers are able to spray noxious, sticky secretions containing diterpenes at their enemies. Nitrogen fixation plays an important role in nasute nutrition.\n\nThe reproductive caste of a mature colony includes a fertile female and male, known as the queen and king. The queen of the colony is responsible for egg production for the colony. Unlike in ants, the king mates with her for life. In some species, the abdomen of the queen swells up dramatically to increase fecundity, a characteristic known as physogastrism. Depending on the species, the queen starts producing reproductive winged alates at a certain time of the year, and huge swarms emerge from the colony when nuptial flight begins. These swarms attract a wide variety of predators.\n\nTermites are often compared with the social Hymenoptera (ants and various species of bees and wasps), but their differing evolutionary origins result in major differences in life cycle. In the eusocial Hymenoptera, the workers are exclusively female, males (drones) are haploid and develop from unfertilised eggs, while females (both workers and the queen) are diploid and develop from fertilised eggs. In contrast, worker termites, which constitute the majority in a colony, are diploid individuals of both sexes and develop from fertilised eggs. Depending on species, male and female workers may have different roles in a termite colony.\n\nThe life cycle of a termite begins with an egg, but is different from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and go through a series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then some workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs.\n\nThe development of nymphs into adults can take months; the time period depends on food availability, temperature, and the general population of the colony. Since nymphs are unable to feed themselves, workers must feed them, but workers also take part in the social life of the colony and have certain other tasks to accomplish such as foraging, building or maintaining the nest or tending to the queen. Pheromones regulate the caste system in termite colonies, preventing all but a very few of the termites from becoming fertile queens.\n\nTermite alates only leave the colony when a nuptial flight takes place. Alate males and females pair up together and then land in search of a suitable place for a colony. A termite king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot. When they do, they excavate a chamber big enough for both, close up the entrance and proceed to mate. After mating, the pair never go outside and spend the rest of their lives in the nest. Nuptial flight time varies in each species. For example, alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter. The nuptial flight may also begin at dusk, when the alates swarm around areas with lots of lights. The time when nuptial flight begins depends on the environmental conditions, the time of day, moisture, wind speed and precipitation. The number of termites in a colony also varies, with the larger species typically having 100–1,000 individuals. However, some termite colonies, including those with large individuals, can number in the millions.\n\nThe queen only lays 10–20 eggs in the very early stages of the colony, but lays as many as 1,000 a day when the colony is several years old. At maturity, a primary queen has a great capacity to lay eggs. In some species, the mature queen has a greatly distended abdomen and may produce 40,000 eggs a day. The two mature ovaries may have some 2,000 ovarioles each. The abdomen increases the queen's body length to several times more than before mating and reduces her ability to move freely; attendant workers provide assistance.\n\nThe king grows only slightly larger after initial mating and continues to mate with the queen for life (a termite queen can live between 30  to 50 years); this is very different from ant colonies, in which a queen mates once with the male(s) and stores the gametes for life, as the male ants die shortly after mating. If a queen is absent, a termite king produces pheromones which encourage the development of replacement termite queens. As the queen and king are monogamous, sperm competition does not occur.\n\nTermites going through incomplete metamorphosis on the path to becoming alates form a subcaste in certain species of termite, functioning as potential supplementary reproductives. These supplementary reproductives only mature into primary reproductives upon the death of a king or queen, or when the primary reproductives are separated from the colony. Supplementaries have the ability to replace a dead primary reproductive, and there may also be more than a single supplementary within a colony. Some queens have the ability to switch from sexual reproduction to asexual reproduction. Studies show that while termite queens mate with the king to produce colony workers, the queens reproduce their replacements (neotenic queens) parthenogenetically.\n\nTermites are detritivores, consuming dead plants at any level of decomposition. They also play a vital role in the ecosystem by recycling waste material such as dead wood, faeces and plants. Many species eat cellulose, having a specialised midgut that breaks down the fibre. Termites are considered to be a major source (11%) of atmospheric methane, one of the prime greenhouse gases, produced from the breakdown of cellulose. Termites rely primarily upon symbiotic protozoa (metamonads) and other microbes such as flagellate protists in their guts to digest the cellulose for them, allowing them to absorb the end products for their own use. Gut protozoa, such as \"Trichonympha\", in turn, rely on symbiotic bacteria embedded on their surfaces to produce some of the necessary digestive enzymes. Most higher termites, especially in the family Termitidae, can produce their own cellulase enzymes, but they rely primarily upon the bacteria. The flagellates have been lost in Termitidae. Scientists' understanding of the relationship between the termite digestive tract and the microbial endosymbionts is still rudimentary; what is true in all termite species, however, is that the workers feed the other members of the colony with substances derived from the digestion of plant material, either from the mouth or anus. Judging from closely related bacterial species, it is strongly presumed that the termites' and cockroach's gut microbiota derives from their dictyopteran ancestors.\n\nCertain species such as \"Gnathamitermes tubiformans\" have seasonal food habits. For example, they may preferentially consume Red three-awn (\"Aristida longiseta\") during the summer, Buffalograss (\"Buchloe dactyloides\") from May to August, and blue grama \"Bouteloua gracilis\" during spring, summer and autumn. Colonies of \"G. tubiformans\" consume less food in spring than they do during autumn when their feeding activity is high.\n\nVarious woods differ in their susceptibility to termite attack; the differences are attributed to such factors as moisture content, hardness, and resin and lignin content. In one study, the drywood termite \"Cryptotermes brevis\" strongly preferred poplar and maple woods to other woods that were generally rejected by the termite colony. These preferences may in part have represented conditioned or learned behaviour.\n\nSome species of termite practice fungiculture. They maintain a \"garden\" of specialised fungi of genus \"Termitomyces\", which are nourished by the excrement of the insects. When the fungi are eaten, their spores pass undamaged through the intestines of the termites to complete the cycle by germinating in the fresh faecal pellets. Molecular evidence suggests that the family Macrotermitinae developed agriculture about 31 million years ago. It is assumed that more than 90 percent of dry wood in the semiarid savannah ecosystems of Africa and Asia are reprocessed by these termites. Originally living in the rainforest, fungus farming allowed them to colonise the African savannah and other new environments, eventually expanding into Asia.\n\nDepending on their feeding habits, termites are placed into two groups: the lower termites and higher termites. The lower termites predominately feed on wood. As wood is difficult to digest, termites prefer to consume fungus-infected wood because it is easier to digest and the fungi are high in protein. Meanwhile, the higher termites consume a wide variety of materials, including faeces, humus, grass, leaves and roots. The gut in the lower termites contains many species of bacteria along with protozoa, while the higher termites only have a few species of bacteria with no protozoa.\n\nTermites are consumed by a wide variety of predators. One termite species alone, \"Hodotermes mossambicus\", was found in the stomach contents of 65 birds and 19 mammals. Ants, arthropods, reptiles, and amphibians such as bees, centipedes, cockroaches, crickets, dragonflies, frogs, lizards, scorpions, spiders, and toads consume these insects, while 2 spiders in the family Ammoxenidae are specialist termite predators. Other predators include aardvarks, aardwolves, anteaters, bats, bears, bilbies, many birds, echidnas, foxes, galagos, numbats, mice and pangolins. The aardwolf is an insectivorous mammal that primarily feeds on termites; it locates its food by sound and also by detecting the scent secreted by the soldiers; a single aardwolf is capable of consuming thousands of termites in a single night by using its long, sticky tongue. Sloth bears break open mounds to consume the nestmates, while chimpanzees have developed tools to \"fish\" termites from their nest. Wear pattern analysis of bone tools used by the early hominin \"Paranthropus robustus\" suggests that they used these tools to dig into termite mounds.\nAmong all predators, ants are the greatest enemy to termites. Some ant genera are specialist predators of termites. For example, \"Megaponera\" is a strictly termite-eating (termitophagous) genus that perform raiding activities, some lasting several hours. \"Paltothyreus tarsatus\" is another termite-raiding species, with each individual stacking as many termites as possible in its mandibles before returning home, all the while recruiting additional nestmates to the raiding site through chemical trails. The Malaysian basicerotine ants \"Eurhopalothrix heliscata\" uses a different strategy of termite hunting by pressing themselves into tight spaces, as they hunt through rotting wood housing termite colonies. Once inside, the ants seize their prey by using their short but sharp mandibles. \"Tetramorium uelense\" is a specialised predator species that feeds on small termites. A scout recruits 10–30 workers to an area where termites are present, killing them by immobilising them with their stinger. \"Centromyrmex\" and \"Iridomyrmex\" colonies sometimes nest in termite mounds, and so the termites are preyed on by these ants. No evidence for any kind of relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. Other ants, including \"Acanthostichus\", \"Camponotus\", \"Crematogaster\", \"Cylindromyrmex\", \"Leptogenys\", \"Odontomachus\", \"Ophthalmopone\", \"Pachycondyla\", \"Rhytidoponera\", \"Solenopsis\" and \"Wasmannia\", also prey on termites. In contrast to all these ant species, and despite their enormous diversity of prey, \"Dorylus ants\" rarely consume termites.\n\nAnts are not the only invertebrates that perform raids. Many sphecoid wasps and several species including \"Polybia Lepeletier\" and \"Angiopolybia Araujo\" are known to raid termite mounds during the termites' nuptial flight.\n\nTermites are less likely to be attacked by parasites than bees, wasps and ants, as they are usually well protected in their mounds. Nevertheless, termites are infected by a variety of parasites. Some of these include dipteran flies, \"Pyemotes\" mites, and a large number of nematode parasites. Most nematode parasites are in the order Rhabditida; others are in the genus \"Mermis\", \"Diplogaster aerivora\" and \"Harteria gallinarum\". Under imminent threat of an attack by parasites, a colony may migrate to a new location. Fungi pathogens such as \"Aspergillus nomius\" and \"Metarhizium anisopliae\" are, however, major threats to a termite colony as they are not host-specific and may infect large portions of the colony; transmission usually occurs via direct physical contact. \"M. anispliae\" is known to weaken the termite immune system. Infection with \"A. nomius\" only occurs when a colony is under great stress.\n\nTermites are infected by viruses including Entomopoxvirinae and the Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus.\n\nBecause the worker and soldier castes lack wings and thus never fly, and the reproductives use their wings for just a brief amount of time, termites predominantly rely upon their legs to move about.\n\nForaging behaviour depends on the type of termite. For example, certain species feed on the wood structures they inhabit, and others harvest food that is near the nest. Most workers are rarely found out in the open, and do not forage unprotected; they rely on sheeting and runways to protect them from predators. Subterranean termites construct tunnels and galleries to look for food, and workers who manage to find food sources recruit additional nestmates by depositing a phagostimulant pheromone that attracts workers. Foraging workers use semiochemicals to communicate with each other, and workers who begin to forage outside of their nest release trail pheromones from their sternal glands. In one species, \"Nasutitermes costalis\", there are three phases in a foraging expedition: first, soldiers scout an area. When they find a food source, they communicate to other soldiers and a small force of workers starts to emerge. In the second phase, workers appear in large numbers at the site. The third phase is marked by a decrease in the number of soldiers present and an increase in the number of workers. Isolated termite workers may engage in Lévy flight behaviour as an optimised strategy for finding their nestmates or foraging for food.\n\nCompetition between two colonies always results in agonistic behaviour towards each other, resulting in fights. These fights can cause mortality on both sides and, in some cases, the gain or loss of territory. \"Cemetery pits\" may be present, where the bodies of dead termites are buried.\n\nStudies show that when termites encounter each other in foraging areas, some of the termites deliberately block passages to prevent other termites from entering. Dead termites from other colonies found in exploratory tunnels leads to the isolation of the area and thus the need to construct new tunnels. Conflict between two competitors does not always occur. For example, though they might block each other's passages, colonies of \"Macrotermes bellicosus\" and \"Macrotermes subhyalinus\" are not always aggressive towards each other. Suicide cramming is known in \"Coptotermes formosanus\". Since \"C. formosanus\" colonies may get into physical conflict, some termites squeeze tightly into foraging tunnels and die, successfully blocking the tunnel and ending all agonistic activities.\n\nAmong the reproductive caste, neotenic queens may compete with each other to become the dominant queen when there are no primary reproductives. This struggle among the queens leads to the elimination of all but a single queen, which, with the king, takes over the colony.\n\nAnts and termites may compete with each other for nesting space. In particular, ants that prey on termites usually have a negative impact on arboreal nesting species.\n\nMost termites are blind, so communication primarily occurs through chemical, mechanical and pheromonal cues. These methods of communication are used in a variety of activities, including foraging, locating reproductives, construction of nests, recognition of nestmates, nuptial flight, locating and fighting enemies, and defending the nests. The most common way of communicating is through antennation. A number of pheromones are known, including contact pheromones (which are transmitted when workers are engaged in trophallaxis or grooming) and alarm, trail and sex pheromones. The alarm pheromone and other defensive chemicals are secreted from the frontal gland. Trail pheromones are secreted from the sternal gland, and sex pheromones derive from two glandular sources: the sternal and tergal glands. When termites go out to look for food, they forage in columns along the ground through vegetation. A trail can be identified by the faecal deposits or runways that are covered by objects. Workers leave pheromones on these trails, which are detected by other nestmates through olfactory receptors. Termites can also communicate through mechanical cues, vibrations, and physical contact. These signals are frequently used for alarm communication or for evaluating a food source.\n\nWhen termites construct their nests, they use predominantly indirect communication. No single termite would be in charge of any particular construction project. Individual termites react rather than think, but at a group level, they exhibit a sort of collective cognition. Specific structures or other objects such as pellets of soil or pillars cause termites to start building. The termite adds these objects onto existing structures, and such behaviour encourages building behaviour in other workers. The result is a self-organised process whereby the information that directs termite activity results from changes in the environment rather than from direct contact among individuals.\n\nTermites can distinguish nestmates and non-nestmates through chemical communication and gut symbionts: chemicals consisting of hydrocarbons released from the cuticle allow the recognition of alien termite species. Each colony has its own distinct odour. This odour is a result of genetic and environmental factors such as the termites' diet and the composition of the bacteria within the termites' intestines.\n\nTermites rely on alarm communication to defend a colony. Alarm pheromones can be released when the nest has been breached or is being attacked by enemies or potential pathogens. Termites always avoid nestmates infected with \"Metarhizium anisopliae\" spores, through vibrational signals released by infected nestmates. Other methods of defence include intense jerking and secretion of fluids from the frontal gland and defecating faeces containing alarm pheromones.\n\nIn some species, some soldiers block tunnels to prevent their enemies from entering the nest, and they may deliberately rupture themselves as an act of defence. In cases where the intrusion is coming from a breach that is larger than the soldier's head, defence requires a special formations where soldiers form a phalanx-like formation around the breach and bite at intruders. If an invasion carried out by \"Megaponera analis\" is successful, an entire colony may be destroyed, although this scenario is rare.\n\nTo termites, any breach of their tunnels or nests is a cause for alarm. When termites detect a potential breach, the soldiers usually bang their heads, apparently to attract other soldiers for defence and to recruit additional workers to repair any breach. Additionally, an alarmed termite bumps into other termites which causes them to be alarmed and to leave pheromone trails to the disturbed area, which is also a way to recruit extra workers.\nThe pantropical subfamily Nasutitermitinae has a specialised caste of soldiers, known as nasutes, that have the ability to exude noxious liquids through a horn-like frontal projection that they use for defence. Nasutes have lost their mandibles through the course of evolution and must be fed by workers. A wide variety of monoterpene hydrocarbon solvents have been identified in the liquids that nasutes secrete.\n\nSoldiers of the species \"Globitermes sulphureus\" commit suicide by autothysis – rupturing a large gland just beneath the surface of their cuticles. The thick, yellow fluid in the gland becomes very sticky on contact with the air, entangling ants or other insects which are trying to invade the nest. Another termite, \"Neocapriterme taracua\", also engages in suicidal defence. Workers physically unable to use their mandibles while in a fight form a pouch full of chemicals, then deliberately rupture themselves, releasing toxic chemicals that paralyse and kill their enemies. The soldiers of the neotropical termite family Serritermitidae have a defence strategy which involves front gland autothysis, with the body rupturing between the head and abdomen. When soldiers guarding nest entrances are attacked by intruders, they engage in autothysis, creating a block that denies entry to any attacker.\n\nWorkers use several different strategies to deal with their dead, including burying, cannibalism, and avoiding a corpse altogether. To avoid pathogens, termites occasionally engage in necrophoresis, in which a nestmate carries away a corpse from the colony to dispose of it elsewhere. Which strategy is used depends on the nature of the corpse a worker is dealing with (i.e. the age of the carcass).\n\nA species of fungus is known to mimic termite eggs, successfully avoiding its natural predators. These small brown balls, known as \"termite balls\", rarely kill the eggs, and in some cases the workers tend to them. This fungus mimics these eggs by producing a cellulose-digesting enzyme known as glucosidases. A unique mimicking behaviour exists between various species of \"Trichopsenius\" beetles and certain termite species within \"Reticulitermes\". The beetles share the same cuticle hydrocarbons as the termites and even biosynthesize them. This chemical mimicry allows the beetles to integrate themselves within the termite colonies. The developed appendages on the physogastric abdomen of \"Austrospirachtha mimetes\" allows the beetle to mimic a termite worker.\n\nSome species of ant are known to capture termites to use as a fresh food source later on, rather than killing them. For example, \"Formica nigra\" captures termites, and those who try to escape are immediately seized and driven underground. Certain species of ants in the subfamily Ponerinae conduct these raids although other ant species go in alone to steal the eggs or nymphs. Ants such as \"Megaponera analis\" attack the outside the mounds and Dorylinae ants attack underground. Despite this, some termites and ants can coexist peacefully. Some species of termite, including \"Nasutitermes corniger\", form associations with certain ant species to keep away predatory ant species. The earliest known association between \"Azteca\" ants and \"Nasutitermes\" termites date back to the Oligocene to Miocene period.\n54 species of ants are known to inhabit \"Nasutitermes\" mounds, both occupied and abandoned ones. One reason many ants live in \"Nasutitermes\" mounds is due to the termites' frequent occurrence in their geographical range; another is to protect themselves from floods. \"Iridomyrmex\" also inhabits termite mounds although no evidence for any kind of relationship (other than a predatory one) is known. In rare cases, certain species of termites live inside active ant colonies. Some invertebrate organisms such as beetles, caterpillars, flies and millipedes are termitophiles and dwell inside termite colonies (they are unable to survive independently). As a result, certain beetles and flies have evolved with their hosts. They have developed a gland that secrete a substance that attracts the workers by licking them. Mounds may also provide shelter and warmth to birds, lizards, snakes and scorpions.\n\nTermites are known to carry pollen and regularly visit flowers, so are regarded as potential pollinators for a number of flowering plants. One flower in particular, \"Rhizanthella gardneri\", is regularly pollinated by foraging workers, and it is perhaps the only Orchidaceae flower in the world to be pollinated by termites.\n\nMany plants have developed effective defences against termites. However, seedlings are vulnerable to termite attacks and need additional protection, as their defence mechanisms only develop when they have passed the seedling stage. Defence is typically achieved by secreting antifeedant chemicals into the woody cell walls. This reduces the ability of termites to efficiently digest the cellulose. A commercial product, \"Blockaid\", has been developed in Australia that uses a range of plant extracts to create a paint-on nontoxic termite barrier for buildings. An extract of a species of Australian figwort, \"Eremophila\", has been shown to repel termites; tests have shown that termites are strongly repelled by the toxic material to the extent that they will starve rather than consume the food. When kept close to the extract, they become disoriented and eventually die.\n\nTermite populations can be substantially impacted by environmental changes including those caused by human intervention. A Brazilian study investigated the termite assemblages of three sites of Caatinga under different levels of anthropogenic disturbance in the semi-arid region of northeastern Brazil were sampled using 65 x 2 m transects. A total of 26 species of termites were present in the three sites, and 196 encounters were recorded in the transects. The termite assemblages were considerably different among sites, with a conspicuous reduction in both diversity and abundance with increased disturbance, related to the reduction of tree density and soil cover, and with the intensity of trampling by cattle and goats. The wood-feeders were the most severely affected feeding group.\n\nA termite nest can be considered as being composed of two parts, the inanimate and the animate. The animate is all of the termites living inside the colony, and the inanimate part is the structure itself, which is constructed by the termites. Nests can be broadly separated into three main categories: subterranean (completely below ground), epigeal (protruding above the soil surface), and arboreal (built above ground, but always connected to the ground via shelter tubes). Epigeal nests (mounds) protrude from the earth with ground contact and are made out of earth and mud. A nest has many functions such as providing a protected living space and providing shelter against predators. Most termites construct underground colonies rather than multifunctional nests and mounds. Primitive termites of today nest in wooden structures such as logs, stumps and the dead parts of trees, as did termites millions of years ago.\n\nTo build their nests, termites primarily use faeces, which have many desirable properties as a construction material. Other building materials include partly digested plant material, used in carton nests (arboreal nests built from faecal elements and wood), and soil, used in subterranean nest and mound construction. Not all nests are visible, as many nests in tropical forests are located underground. Species in the subfamily Apicotermitinae are good examples of subterranean nest builders, as they only dwell inside tunnels. Other termites live in wood, and tunnels are constructed as they feed on the wood. Nests and mounds protect the termites' soft bodies against desiccation, light, pathogens and parasites, as well as providing a fortification against predators. Nests made out of carton are particularly weak, and so the inhabitants use counter-attack strategies against invading predators.\n\nArboreal carton nests of mangrove swamp-dwelling \"Nasutitermes\" are enriched in lignin and depleted in cellulose and xylans. This change is caused by bacterial decay in the gut of the termites: they use their faeces as a carton building material. Arboreal termites nests can account for as much as 2% of above ground carbon storage in Puerto Rican mangrove swamps. These \"Nasutitermes\" nests are mainly composed of partially biodegraded wood material from the stems and branches of mangrove trees, namely, \"Rhizophora mangle\" (red mangrove), \"Avicennia germinans\" (black mangrove) and \"Laguncularia racemose\" (white mangrove).\n\nSome species build complex nests called polycalic nests; this habitat is called polycalism. Polycalic species of termites form multiple nests, or calies, connected by subterranean chambers. The termite genera \"Apicotermes\" and \"Trinervitermes\" are known to have polycalic species. Polycalic nests appear to be less frequent in mound-building species although polycalic arboreal nests have been observed in a few species of \"Nasutitermes\".\n\nNests are considered mounds if they protrude from the earth's surface. A mound provides termites the same protection as a nest but is stronger. Mounds located in areas with torrential and continuous rainfall are at risk of mound erosion due to their clay-rich construction. Those made from carton can provide protection from the rain, and in fact can withstand high precipitation. Certain areas in mounds are used as strong points in case of a breach. For example, \"Cubitermes\" colonies build narrow tunnels used as strong points, as the diameter of the tunnels is small enough for soldiers to block. A highly protected chamber, known as the \"queens cell\", houses the queen and king and is used as a last line of defence.\n\nSpecies in the genus \"Macrotermes\" arguably build the most complex structures in the insect world, constructing enormous mounds. These mounds are among the largest in the world, reaching a height of 8 to 9 metres (26 to 29 feet), and consist of chimneys, pinnacles and ridges. Another termite species, \"Amitermes meridionalis\", can build nests 3 to 4 metres (9 to 13 feet) high and 2.5 metres (8 feet) wide. The tallest mound ever recorded was 12.8 metres (42 ft) long found in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nThe sculptured mounds sometimes have elaborate and distinctive forms, such as those of the compass termite (\"Amitermes meridionalis\" and \"A. laurensis\"), which builds tall, wedge-shaped mounds with the long axis oriented approximately north–south, which gives them their common name. This orientation has been experimentally shown to assist thermoregulation. The north-south orientation causes the internal temperature of a mound to increase rapidly during the morning while avoiding overheating from the midday sun. The temperature then remains at a plateau for the rest of the day until the evening.\n\nTermites construct shelter tubes, also known as earthen tubes or mud tubes, that start from the ground. These shelter tubes can be found on walls and other structures. Constructed by termites during the night, a time of higher humidity, these tubes provide protection to termites from potential predators, especially ants. Shelter tubes also provide high humidity and darkness and allow workers to collect food sources that cannot be accessed in any other way. These passageways are made from soil and faeces and are normally brown in colour. The size of these shelter tubes depends on the amount of food sources that are available. They range from less than 1 cm to several cm in width, but may extend dozens of metres in length.\n\nOwing to their wood-eating habits, many termite species can do great damage to unprotected buildings and other wooden structures. Their habit of remaining concealed often results in their presence being undetected until the timbers are severely damaged, leaving a thin layer of a wall that protects them from the environment. Of the 3,106 species known, only 183 species cause damage; 83 species cause significant damage to wooden structures. In North America, nine subterranean species are pests; in Australia, 16 species have an economic impact; in the Indian subcontinent 26 species are considered pests, and in tropical Africa, 24. In Central America and the West Indies, there are 17 pest species. Among the termite genera, \"Coptotermes\" has the highest number of pest species of any genus, with 28 species known to cause damage. Less than 10% of drywood termites are pests, but they infect wooden structures and furniture in tropical, subtropical and other regions. Dampwood termites only attack lumber material exposed to rainfall or soil.\n\nDrywood termites thrive in warm climates, and human activities can enable them to invade homes since they can be transported through contaminated goods, containers and ships. Colonies of termites have been seen thriving in warm buildings located in cold regions. Some termites are considered invasive species. \"Cryptotermes brevis\", the most widely introduced invasive termite species in the world, has been introduced to all the islands in the West Indies and to Australia.\nIn addition to causing damage to buildings, termites can also damage food crops. Termites may attack trees whose resistance to damage is low but generally ignore fast-growing plants. Most attacks occur at harvest time; crops and trees are attacked during the dry season.\n\nThe damage caused by termites costs the southwestern United States approximately $1.5 billion each year in wood structure damage, but the true cost of damage worldwide cannot be determined. Drywood termites are responsible for a large proportion of the damage caused by termites.\n\nTo better control the population of termites, various methods have been developed to track termite movements. One early method involved distributing termite bait laced with immunoglobulin G (IgG) marker proteins from rabbits or chickens. Termites collected from the field could be tested for the rabbit-IgG markers using a rabbit-IgG-specific assay. More recently developed, less expensive alternatives include tracking the termites using egg white, cow milk, or soy milk proteins, which can be sprayed on termites in the field. Termites bearing these proteins can be traced using a protein-specific ELISA test.\n\n43 termite species are used as food by humans or are fed to livestock. These insects are particularly important in less developed countries where malnutrition is common, as the protein from termites can help improve the human diet. Termites are consumed in many regions globally, but this practice has only become popular in developed nations in recent years.\n\nTermites are consumed by people in many different cultures around the world. In Africa, the alates are an important factor in the diets of native populations. Tribes have different ways of collecting or cultivating insects; sometimes tribes collect soldiers from several species. Though harder to acquire, queens are regarded as a delicacy. Termite alates are high in nutrition with adequate levels of fat and protein. They are regarded as pleasant in taste, having a nut-like flavour after they are cooked.\n\nAlates are collected when the rainy season begins. During a nuptial flight, they are typically seen around lights to which they are attracted, and so nets are set up on lamps and captured alates are later collected. The wings are removed through a technique that is similar to winnowing. The best result comes when they are lightly roasted on a hot plate or fried until crisp. Oil is not required as their bodies usually contain sufficient amounts of oil. Termites are typically eaten when livestock is lean and tribal crops have not yet developed or produced any food, or if food stocks from a previous growing season are limited.\n\nIn addition to Africa, termites are consumed in local or tribal areas in Asia and North and South America. In Australia, Indigenous Australians are aware that termites are edible but do not consume them even in times of scarcity; there are few explanations as to why. Termite mounds are the main sources of soil consumption (geophagy) in many countries including Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Researchers have suggested that termites are suitable candidates for human consumption and space agriculture, as they are high in protein and can be used to convert inedible waste to consumable products for humans.\n\nTermites can be major agricultural pests, particularly in East Africa and North Asia, where crop losses can be severe (3–100% in crop loss in Africa). Counterbalancing this is the greatly improved water infiltration where termite tunnels in the soil allow rainwater to soak in deeply, which helps reduce runoff and consequent soil erosion through bioturbation. In South America, cultivated plants such as eucalyptus, upland rice and sugarcane can be severely damaged by termite infestations, with attacks on leaves, roots and woody tissue. Termites can also attack other plants, including cassava, coffee, cotton, fruit trees, maize, peanuts, soybeans and vegetables. Mounds can disrupt farming activities, making it difficult for farmers to operate farming machinery; however, despite farmers' dislike of the mounds, it is often the case that no net loss of production occurs. Termites can be beneficial to agriculture, such as by boosting crop yields and enriching the soil. Termites and ants can re-colonise untilled land that contains crop stubble, which colonies use for nourishment when they establish their nests. The presence of nests in fields enables larger amounts of rainwater to soak into the ground and increases the amount of nitrogen in the soil, both essential for the growth of crops.\n\nThe termite gut has inspired various research efforts aimed at replacing fossil fuels with cleaner, renewable energy sources. Termites are efficient bioreactors, capable of producing two litres of hydrogen from a single sheet of paper. Approximately 200 species of microbes live inside the termite hindgut, releasing the hydrogen that was trapped inside wood and plants that they digest. Through the action of unidentified enzymes in the termite gut, lignocellulose polymers are broken down into sugars and are transformed into hydrogen. The bacteria within the gut turns the sugar and hydrogen into cellulose acetate, an acetate ester of cellulose on which termites rely for energy. Community DNA sequencing of the microbes in the termite hindgut has been employed to provide a better understanding of the metabolic pathway. Genetic engineering may enable hydrogen to be generated in bioreactors from woody biomass.\n\nThe development of autonomous robots capable of constructing intricate structures without human assistance has been inspired by the complex mounds that termites build. These robots work independently and can move by themselves on a tracked grid, capable of climbing and lifting up bricks. Such robots may be useful for future projects on Mars, or for building levees to prevent flooding.\n\nTermites use sophisticated means to control the temperatures of their mounds. As discussed above, the shape and orientation of the mounds of the Australian compass termite stabilises their internal temperatures during the day. As the towers heat up, the solar chimney effect (stack effect) creates an updraft of air within the mound. Wind blowing across the tops of the towers enhances the circulation of air through the mounds, which also include side vents in their construction. The solar chimney effect has been in use for centuries in the Middle East and Near East for passive cooling, as well as in Europe by the Romans. It is only relatively recently, however, that climate responsive construction techniques have become incorporated into modern architecture. Especially in Africa, the stack effect has become a popular means to achieve natural ventilation and passive cooling in modern buildings.\n\nThe Eastgate Centre is a shopping centre and office block in central Harare, Zimbabwe, whose architect, Mick Pearce, used passive cooling inspired by that used by the local termites. It was the first major building exploiting termite-inspired cooling techniques to attract international attention. Other such buildings include the Learning Resource Center at the Catholic University of Eastern Africa and the Council House 2 building in Melbourne, Australia.\n\nFew zoos hold termites, due to the difficulty in keeping them captive and to the reluctance of authorities to permit potential pests. One of the few that do, the Zoo Basel in Switzerland, has two thriving \"Macrotermes bellicosus\" populations – resulting in an event very rare in captivity: the mass migrations of young flying termites. This happened in September 2008, when thousands of male termites left their mound each night, died, and covered the floors and water pits of the house holding their exhibit.\n\nAfrican tribes in several countries have termites as totems, and for this reason tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates. Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, sinusitis, tonsillitis and whooping cough. In Nigeria, \"Macrotermes nigeriensis\" is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women. In Southeast Asia, termites are used in ritual practices. In Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace. Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits, believing a local guardian dwells within the mound; this is known as Keramat and Datok Kong. In urban areas, local residents construct red-painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned, where they pray for good health, protection and luck.\n\n\n\n",
                "Nine-banded armadillo\n\nThe nine-banded armadillo (\"Dasypus novemcinctus\"), or the nine-banded, long-nosed armadillo, is a medium-sized mammal found in North, Central, and South America, making it the most widespread of the armadillos. Its ancestors originated in South America, and remained there until the formation of the Isthmus of Panama allowed them to enter North America as part of the Great American Interchange.\nThe nine-banded armadillo is a solitary, mainly nocturnal animal, found in many kinds of habitats, from mature and secondary rainforests to grassland and dry scrub. It is an insectivore, feeding chiefly on ants, termites, and other small invertebrates. The armadillo can jump straight in the air if sufficiently frightened, making it a particular danger on roads. It is the state small mammal of Texas.\n\nThe nine-banded armadillo evolved in a warm, rainy environment, and is still most commonly found in regions resembling its ancestral home. As a very adaptable animal, though, it can also be found in scrublands, open prairies, and tropical rainforests. It cannot thrive in particularly cold or dry environments, as its large surface area, which is not well insulated by fat, makes it especially susceptible to heat and water loss.\n\nThe nine-banded armadillo has been rapidly expanding its range both north and east within the United States, where it is the only regularly occurring species of armadillo. The armadillo crossed the Rio Grande from Mexico in the late 19th century, and was introduced in Florida at about the same time by humans. By 1995, the species had become well established in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, and had been sighted as far afield as Kansas, Missouri, Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina. A decade later, the armadillo had become established in all of those areas and continued its migration, being sighted as far north as southern Nebraska, southern Illinois, and southern Indiana.\nThe primary cause of this rapid expansion is explained simply by the species having few natural predators within the United States, little desire on the part of Americans to hunt or eat the armadillo, and the animals' high reproductive rate. The northern expansion of the armadillo is expected to continue until the species reaches as far north as Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut, and all points southward on the East Coast of the United States. Further northward and westward expansion will probably be limited by the armadillo's poor tolerance of harsh winters, due to its lack of insulating fat and its inability to hibernate.\nAs of 2009, newspaper reports indicated the nine-banded armadillo seems to have expanded its range northward as far as Omaha, Nebraska in the west, and Kentucky Dam and Evansville, Indiana, in the east. In 1995, armadillos were only seen in the southern tip of South Carolina, and within two to three years, they had swept across most of the state. In late 2009, North Carolina began considering the establishment of a hunting season for armadillo, following reports that the species has been moving into the southern reaches of the state (roughly between the areas of Charlotte and Wilmington).\nOutside the United States, the nine-banded armadillo ranges southward through Central and South America into northern Argentina and Uruguay, where it is still expanding its range.\n\nNine-banded armadillos are generally insectivores. They forage for meals by thrusting their snouts into loose soil and leaf litter and frantically digging in erratic patterns, stopping occasionally to dig up grubs, beetles (perhaps the main portion of this species' prey selection), ants, termites, and worms, which their sensitive noses can detect through of soil. They then lap up the insects with their sticky tongues. Nine-banded armadillos have been observed to roll about on ant hills to dislodge and consume the resident ants. They supplement their diets with amphibians and small reptiles, especially in more wintery months when such prey tends to be more sluggish, and occasionally bird eggs and baby mammals. Carrion is also eaten, although perhaps the species is most attracted to the maggots borne by carcasses rather than the meat itself. Less than 10% of the diet of this species is composed by nonanimal matter, though fungi, tubers, fruits, and seeds are occasionally eaten.\n\nNine-banded armadillos generally weigh from , though the largest specimens can scale up to . They are one of the largest species of armadillos. Head and body length is , which combines with the tail, for a total length of . They stand tall at the top of the shell. The outer shell is composed of ossified dermal scutes covered by nonoverlapping, keratinized epidermal scales, which are connected by flexible bands of skin. This armor covers the back, sides, head, tail, and outside surfaces of the legs. The underside of the body and the inner surfaces of the legs have no armored protection. Instead, they are covered by tough skin and a layer of coarse hair. The vertebrae attach to the carapace.\nThe claws on the middle toes of the forefeet are elongated for digging, though not to the same degree as those of the much larger giant armadillo of South America.\nTheir low metabolic rate and poor thermoregulation make them best suited for semitropical environments.\nUnlike the South American three-banded armadillos, the nine-banded armadillo cannot roll itself into a ball. It is, however, capable of floating across rivers by inflating its intestines, or by sinking and running across riverbeds. The second is possible due to its ability to hold its breath for up to six minutes, an adaptation originally developed for allowing the animal to keep its snout submerged in soil for extended periods while foraging. Although nine is the typical number of bands on the nine-banded armadillo, the actual number varies by geographic range.\nArmadillos possess the teeth typical of all sloths and anteaters. The teeth are all small, peg-like molars with open roots and no enamel. Incisors do form in the embryos, but quickly degenerate and are usually absent by birth.\n\nNine-banded armadillos are solitary, largely nocturnal animals that come out to forage around dusk. They are extensive burrowers, with a single animal sometimes maintaining up to 12 burrows on its range. These burrows are roughly wide, deep, and long. Armadillos mark their territory with urine, feces, and excretions from scent glands found on the eyelids, nose, and feet. Males hold breeding territories and may become aggressive in order to keep other males out of their home range to increase chances of pairing with a female. Territorial disputes are settled by kicking and chasing. When they are not foraging, armadillos shuffle along fairly slowly, stopping occasionally to sniff the air for signs of danger.\n\nIf alarmed, nine-banded armadillos can flee with surprising speed. Occasionally, a large predator may be able to ambush the armadillo before it can clear a distance, and breach the hard carapace with a well-placed bite or swipe. If the fleeing escape fails, the armadillo may quickly dig a shallow trench and lodge itself inside. Predators are rarely able to dislodge the animal once it has burrowed itself, and abandon their prey when they cannot breach the armadillo’s armor or grasp its tapered tail. Due to their softer carapaces, juvenile armadillos are more likely to fall victim to natural predation and their cautious behavior generally reflects this. Young nine-banded armadillos tend to forage earlier in the day and are more wary of the approach of an unknown animal (including humans) than are adults. Their known natural predators include cougars (perhaps the leading predator), maned wolves, coyotes, black bears, red wolves, jaguars, alligators, bobcats, and large raptors. By far the leading predator of nine-banded armadillos today is humans, as armadillos are locally harvested for their meat and shells and many thousands fall victim to auto accidents every year.\n\nMating takes place during a two-to-three month long mating season, which occurs from July–August in the Northern Hemisphere and November–January in the Southern Hemisphere. A single egg is fertilized, but implantation is delayed for three to four months to ensure the young will not be born during an unfavorable time. Once the zygote does implant in the uterus, a gestation period of four months occurs, during which the zygote splits into four identical embryos, each of which develops its own placenta, so blood and nutrients are not mixed between them. They are born in March and weigh 3 oz (85 g). After birth, the quadruplets remain in the burrow, living off the mother’s milk for about three months. They then begin to forage with the mother, eventually leaving after six months to a year.\n\nNine-banded armadillos reach sexual maturity at the age of one year, and reproduce every year for the rest of their 12–to-15 year lifespans. A single female can produce up to 56 young over the course of her life. This high reproductive rate is a major cause of the species’ rapid expansion.\n\nThe foraging of nine-banded armadillo can cause mild damage to the root systems of certain plants. Skunks, cotton rats, burrowing owls, pine snakes, and rattlesnakes can be found living in abandoned armadillo burrows. Occasionally, the armadillo may threaten the endangered gopher tortoise by aggressively displacing them from their burrows and claiming the burrows for themselves. Studies have shown the fan-tailed warbler habitually follows armadillos to feed on insects and other invertebrates displaced by them.\n\nThey are typically hunted for their meat, which is said to taste like pork, but are more frequently killed as a result of their tendency to steal the eggs of poultry and game birds. This has caused certain populations of the nine-banded armadillo to become threatened, although the species as a whole is under no immediate threat.\nThey are also valuable for use in medical research, as they are among the few mammals other than humans susceptible to leprosy.\nIn Texas, nine-banded armadillos are raised to participate in armadillo racing, a small-scale, but well-established sport in which the animals scurry down a 40-foot track.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, the species was hunted for its meat in East Texas, where it was known as poor man’s pork, or the \"Hoover hog\" by those who considered President Herbert Hoover to be responsible for the Depression. Earlier, German settlers in Texas would often refer to the armadillo as \"Panzerschwein\" (\"armored pig\"). In 1995, the nine-banded armadillo was, with some resistance, made the state small mammal of Texas, where it is considered a pest and is often seen dead on the roadside. They first forayed into Texas across the Rio Grande from Mexico in the 19th century, eventually spreading across the southeast United States.\n\nNorth American subspecies exhibit reduced genetic variability compared with the subspecies of South America, indicating the armadillos of North America are descended from a relatively small number of individuals that migrated from south of the Rio Grande.\n\n\n"

                "Giant armadillo\n\nThe giant armadillo (\"Priodontes maximus\"), colloquially tatou, ocarro, tatu-canastra or tatú carreta, is the largest living species of armadillo (although their extinct relatives, the glyptodonts, were much larger). It lives in South America, ranging throughout as far south as northern Argentina. This species is considered vulnerable to extinction.\n\nThe giant armadillo prefers termites and some ants as prey, and often consumes the entire population of a termite mound. It also has been known to prey upon worms, larvae and larger creatures, such as spiders and snakes, and plants.\n\nAt least one zoo park, in Villavicencio, Colombia – \"Los Ocarros\" – is dedicated to this animal.\n\nThe giant armadillo is the largest living species of armadillo, with 11 to 13 hinged bands protecting the body and a further three or four on the neck. Its body is dark brown in color, with a lighter, yellowish band running along the sides, and a pale, yellow-white head. These armadillos have around 80 to 100 teeth, which is more than any other terrestrial mammal. The teeth are all similar in appearance, being reduced premolars and molars, grow constantly throughout life, and lack enamel. They also possess extremely long front claws, including a sickle-shaped third claw, which are proportionately the largest of any living mammal. The tail is covered in small rounded scales and does not have the heavy bony scutes that cover the upper body and top of the head. The animal is almost entirely hairless, with just a few beige colored hairs protruding between the scutes.\n\nGiant armadillos typically weigh around when fully grown, however a specimen has been weighed in the wild and captive specimens have been weighed up to . The typical length of the species is , with the tail adding another .\n\nGiant armadillos are found throughout much of northern South America east of the Andes, except for eastern Brazil and Paraguay. In the south, they reach the northernmost provinces of Argentina, including Salta, Formosa, Chaco, and Santiago del Estero. There are no recognised geographic subspecies. They primarily inhabit open habitats, with cerrado grasslands covering about 25% of their range, but they can also be found in lowland forests.\n\nGiant armadillos are solitary and nocturnal, spending the day in burrows. They also burrow to escape predators, being unable to completely roll into a protective ball. Compared with those of other armadillos, their burrows are unusually large, with entrances averaging wide, and typically opening to the west.\n\nGiant armadillos use their large front claws to dig for prey and rip open termite mounds. The diet is mainly composed of termites, although ants, worms, spiders and other invertebrates are also eaten. Little is currently known about this species' reproductive biology, and no juveniles have ever been discovered in the field. The average sleep time of a captive giant armadillo is said to be 18.1 hours.\n\nArmadillos have not been extensively studied in the wild; therefore, little is known about their natural ecology and behavior. In the only long term study on the species, that started in 2003 in the Peruvian Amazon, dozens of other species of mammals, reptiles and birds were found using the giant armadillos' burrows on the same day, including the rare short-eared dog (\"Atelocynus microtis\"). Because of this, the species is considered a habitat engineer, and the local extinction of \"Priodontes\" may have cascading effects in the mammalian community by impoverishing fossorial habitat.\n\nFemale giant armadillos have two teats and are thought to normally give birth to only a single young per year. Little is known with certainty about their life history, although it is thought that the young are weaned by about seven to eight months of age, and that the mother periodically seals up the entrance to burrows containing younger offspring, presumably to protect them from predators. Although they have never bred in captivity, a wild-born giant armadillo at San Antonio Zoo was estimated to have been around sixteen years old when it died.\n\nHunted throughout its range, a single giant armadillo supplies a great deal of meat, and is the primary source of protein for some indigenous peoples. In addition, live giant armadillos are frequently captured for trade on the black market, and invariably die during transportation or in captivity. Despite this species’ wide range, it is locally rare. This is further exacerbated by habitat loss resulting from deforestation. Current estimates indicate the giant armadillo may have undergone a worrying population decline of 30 to 50 percent over the past three decades. Without intervention, this trend is likely to continue.\n\nThe giant armadillo was classified as vulnerable on the World Conservation Union's Red List in 2002, and is listed under Appendix I (threatened with extinction) of the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna.\n\nThe giant armadillo is protected by law in Colombia, Guyana, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Suriname and Peru, and international trade is banned by its listing on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). However, hunting for food and sale in the black market continues to occur throughout its entire range. Some populations occur within protected reserves, including the Parque das Emas in Brazil, and the Central Suriname Nature Reserve, a massive 1.6-million-hectare site of pristine rainforest managed by Conservation International. Such protection helps to some degree to mitigate the threat of habitat loss, but targeted conservation action is required to prevent the further decline of this species.\n\n",
                "Armadillo\n\nArmadillos are New World placental mammals in the order Cingulata with a leathery armour shell. The Chlamyphoridae and Dasypodidae are the only surviving families in the order, which is part of the superorder Xenarthra, along with the anteaters and sloths. The word \"armadillo\" means \"little armoured one\" in Spanish. The Aztecs called them \"āyōtōchtli\" , Nahuatl for \"turtle-rabbit\": \"āyōtl\" (turtle) and \"tōchtli\" (rabbit). The Portuguese word for \"armadillo\" is \"tatu\" which derives from the Tupi language. Similar names are also found in other, especially European, languages.\n\nAbout nine extant genera and 21 extant species of armadillo have been described, some of which are distinguished by the number of bands on their armour. Their average length is about , including tail. The giant armadillo grows up to and weighs up to , while the pink fairy armadillo is a diminutive species, with an overall length of . All species are native to the Americas, where they inhabit a variety of different environments.\n\nRecent genetic research suggests that an extinct group of giant armoured mammals, the glyptodonts, should be included within the lineage of armadillos, having diverged some 35 million years ago, much more recently than previously assumed.\n\nLike all of the Xenarthra lineages, armadillos originated in South America. Due to the continent's former isolation, they were confined there for most of the Cenozoic. The recent formation of the Isthmus of Panama allowed a few members of the family to migrate northward into southern North America by the early Pleistocene, as part of the Great American Interchange. (Some of their much larger cingulate relatives, the pampatheres and chlamyphorid glyptodonts, made the same journey.)\n\nToday, all extant armadillo species are still present in South America. They are particularly diverse in Paraguay (where 11 species exist) and surrounding areas. Many species are endangered. Some, including four species of \"Dasypus\", are widely distributed over the Americas, whereas others, such as Yepes's mulita, are restricted to small ranges. Two species, the northern naked-tailed armadillo and nine-banded armadillo, are found in Central America; the latter has also reached the United States, primarily in the south-central states (notably Texas), but with a range that extends as far east as South Carolina and Florida, and as far north as Nebraska and central Indiana. Their range has consistently expanded in North America over the last century due to a lack of natural predators.\n\nArmadillos are small to medium-sized mammals. The smallest species, the pink fairy armadillo, is roughly chipmunk-sized at and in total length. The largest species, the giant armadillo, can be the size of a small pig and weigh up to , and can be long. They are prolific diggers. Many species use their sharp claws to dig for food, such as grubs, and to dig dens. The nine-banded armadillo prefers to build burrows in moist soil near the creeks, streams, and arroyos around which it lives and feeds. The diets of different armadillo species vary, but consist mainly of insects, grubs, and other invertebrates. Some species, however, feed almost entirely on ants and termites.\n\nIn common with other xenarthrans, armadillos, in general, have low body temperatures of and low basal metabolic rates (40–60% of that expected in placental mammals of their mass). This is particularly true of types that specialize in using termites as their primary food source (for example, \"Priodontes\" and \"Tolypeutes\").\n\nThe armour is formed by plates of dermal bone covered in relatively small, overlapping epidermal scales called \"scutes\", composed of bone with a covering of horn. Most species have rigid shields over the shoulders and hips, with a number of bands separated by flexible skin covering the back and flanks. Additional armour covers the top of the head, the upper parts of the limbs, and the tail. The underside of the animal is never armoured, and is simply covered with soft skin and fur.\n\nThis armour-like skin appears to be the main defense of many armadillos, although most escape predators by fleeing (often into thorny patches, from which their armour protects them) or digging to safety. Only the South American three-banded armadillos (\"Tolypeutes\") rely heavily on their armour for protection. When threatened by a predator, \"Tolypeutes\" species frequently roll up into a ball. Other armadillo species cannot roll up because they have too many plates. The North American nine-banded armadillo tends to jump straight in the air when surprised, so consequently often collides with the undercarriage or fenders of passing vehicles.\n\nArmadillos have short legs, but can move quite quickly. The nine-banded armadillo is noted for its movement through water which is accomplished via two different methods: it can walk underwater for short distances, holding its breath for as long as six minutes; also, to cross larger bodies of water, it is capable of increasing its buoyancy by swallowing air, inflating its stomach and intestines.\n\nArmadillos have very poor eyesight, and use their keen sense of smell to hunt for food. They use their claws for digging and finding food, as well as for making their homes in burrows. They dig their burrows with their claws, making only a single corridor the width of the animal's body. They have five clawed toes on their hind feet, and three to five toes with heavy digging claws on their fore feet. Armadillos have a large number of cheek teeth which are not divided into premolars and molars, but usually have no incisors or canines. The dentition of the nine-banded armadillo is P 7/7, M 1/1 = 32.\n\nGestation lasts from 60 to 120 days, depending on species, although the nine-banded armadillo also exhibits delayed implantation, so the young are not typically born for eight months after mating. Most members of the genus \"Dasypus\" give birth to four monozygotic young (that is, identical quadruplets), but other species may have typical litter sizes that range from one to eight. The young are born with soft, leathery skin which hardens within a few weeks. They reach sexual maturity in three to 12 months, depending on the species. Armadillos are solitary animals that do not share their burrows with other adults.\n\nFamily Dasypodidae\n\nFamily Chlamyphoridae\n\n† indicates extinct taxon\n\nArmadillos are often used in the study of leprosy, since they, along with mangabey monkeys, rabbits, and mice (on their footpads), are among the few known species that can contract the disease systemically. They are particularly susceptible due to their unusually low body temperature, which is hospitable to the leprosy bacterium, \"Mycobacterium leprae\". (The leprosy bacterium is difficult to culture and armadillos have a body temperature of , similar to human skin.) Humans can acquire a leprosy infection from armadillos by handling them or consuming armadillo meat. Armadillos are a presumed vector and natural reservoir for the disease in Texas and Louisiana and Florida. Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the late 15th century, leprosy was unknown in the New World. Given that armadillos are native to the New World, at some point they must have acquired the disease from old-world humans.\n\nThe armadillo is also a natural reservoir for Chagas disease.\n\nThe nine-banded armadillo also serves science through its unusual reproductive system, in which four genetically identical offspring are born, the result of one original egg. Because they are always genetically identical, the group of four young provides a good subject for scientific, behavioral, or medical tests that need consistent biological and genetic makeup in the test subjects. This is the only reliable manifestation of polyembryony in the class Mammalia, and exists only within the genus \"Dasypus\" and not in all armadillos, as is commonly believed. Other species that display this trait include parasitoid wasps, certain flatworms, and various aquatic invertebrates.\n\nArmadillos (mainly \"Dasypus\") are common roadkill due to their habit of jumping 3–4 ft vertically when startled, which puts them into collision with the underside of vehicles. Wildlife enthusiasts are using the northward march of the armadillo as an opportunity to educate others about the animals, which can be a burrowing nuisance to property owners and managers.\n\nArmadillo shells have traditionally been used to make the back of the \"charango\", an Andean lute instrument.\n\n\n",

                "Ray Kroc\n\nRaymond Albert \"Ray\" Kroc (October 5, 1902 – January 14, 1984) was an American businessman. He joined the California company McDonald's in 1954, just a few months after the McDonald brothers had branched out from their original 1940 operation in San Bernardino, with Kroc turning the chain into a nationwide and eventually global franchise, making it the most successful fast food corporation in the world. Controversially, Kroc would present himself as the founder of McDonald's during his later life. Kroc was included in \"\", and amassed a fortune during his lifetime. He owned the San Diego Padres baseball team from 1974 until his death in 1984.\n\nKroc was born on October 5, 1902 in Oak Park, Illinois, near Chicago, to parents of Czech origin, Rose Mary (Hrach) and Alois \"Louis\" Kroc. His father was from the village of Břasy near Plzeň, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic). The elder Kroc had made a fortune speculating on land during the 1920s, only to lose everything with the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nRay Kroc grew up and spent most of his life in Oak Park. During World War I, he lied about his age and became a Red Cross ambulance driver at 15. The war, however, ended shortly after. During the Depression, Kroc worked a variety of jobs selling paper cups, as a real estate agent in Florida, and sometimes playing piano in bands.\n\nAfter World War II, Kroc found employment as a milk shake mixer salesman for the foodservice equipment manufacturer Prince Castle. When Prince Castle Multi-Mixer sales plummeted because of competition from lower-priced Hamilton Beach products, Kroc was impressed by Richard and Maurice McDonald who had purchased eight of his Multi-Mixers for their San Bernardino, California store, and visited them in 1954. Kroc became convinced that the concept and design of this small chain had the potential to expand across the nation.\n\nHaving been in approximately one thousand kitchens, Kroc believed the McDonald brothers had the best-run operation he had ever seen. The restaurant was clean, modern, mechanized, and the staff professional and well-groomed. Roadside hamburger restaurants were more often than not hangouts for motorcycle gangs and rebellious teenagers, and Kroc saw in McDonald's a better vision for a restaurant. He once said \"In my experience, hamburger joints are nothing but jukeboxes, pay phones, smoking rooms, and guys in leather jackets. I wouldn't take my wife to such a place and you wouldn't take your wife either.\"\n\nKroc opened the first McDonald's franchised under his partnership with the McDonald brothers in Des Plaines, Illinois.\n\nAfter finalizing the franchise agreement with the McDonald brothers, Kroc sent a letter to Walt Disney. They had met as ambulance attendant trainees at Sound Beach, Connecticut during World War I. Kroc wrote, \"I have very recently taken over the national franchise of the McDonald's system. I would like to inquire if there may be an opportunity for a McDonald's in your Disney Development\". According to one account, Disney agreed under stipulation to increase fries from ten cents to fifteen cents, allowing himself the profit. Kroc refused to gouge his loyal customers, leaving Disneyland to open without a McDonald's restaurant. Journalist Eric Schlosser, writing in his book \"Fast Food Nation\", believes that this is a doctored retelling of the transaction by some McDonald's marketing executives. Most probably, the proposal was returned without approval.\n\nKroc has been credited with making a number of innovative changes in the food-service franchise model. Chief among them was the sale of only single-store franchises instead of selling larger, territorial franchises which was common in the industry at the time. Kroc recognized that the sale of exclusive licenses for large markets was the quickest way for a franchisor to make money, but he also saw in the practice a loss in the franchisor's ability to exert control over the course and direction of a chain’s development. Above all else, Kroc wanted uniformity in service and quality among all of the McDonald’s locations. Without the ability to influence franchisees, Kroc knew that it would be difficult to achieve that goal. By granting a franchisee the right to only one store location at a time, Kroc retained for the franchise some measure of control over the franchisee (or at least those desiring to someday own the rights to another store).\n\nKroc's policies for McDonald's included establishing locations only in suburban areas, not in downtowns since the seedy underbelly of urban areas might eat in them after the main business hours were over. Restaurants were to be kept properly sanitized at all times, and the staff must be clean, properly groomed and polite to children. The food was to be of a strictly fixed, standardized content and restaurants were not allowed to deviate from specifications in any way. There was to be no waste of anything, Kroc insisted; every condiment container was to be scraped completely clean. No cigarette machines or pinball games were allowed in any McDonald's. \n\nKroc had difficulty enforcing his strict policies in the beginning as several California franchisees began offering things that were not supposed to be on the menu, altering prices, the recipes, or committing various other offenses. For a time, Kroc held off on licensing more McDonald's in California, preferring to concentrate on the Midwest, where he believed people were more conservative and less likely to challenge authority.\n\nKroc had a contemptuous opinion of MBAs and people who attended business school or obtained college degrees in management, believing they lacked competitive drive or market savvy. For a time, McDonald's had a policy of not hiring MBAs. He also forbade McDonald's executives to have secretaries and required them to answer their own phones. They were expected to follow dress and grooming rules similar to those of rank-and-file employees in the restaurants, which included no scruffy beards (though carefully groomed facial hair was allowed), and they received regular company pamphlets extolling thriftiness and financial responsibility both at the company and in their personal lives.\n\nDuring the 1960s, a wave of new fast food chains appeared that copied McDonald's model, including Burger King, Burger Chef, Arbys, KFC, and Hardee's. Kroc spoke of the competition with contempt, saying that they did not offer the same quality of food, service, affordable prices, or sanitation as McDonald's. He resisted joining any fast food trade organizations for fear of giving away his business secrets.\n\nKroc became frustrated with the McDonald brothers' desire to maintain a small number of restaurants. The brothers also consistently told Kroc he could not make changes to things such as the original blueprint (building codes were different in Illinois than in California), but despite Kroc's pleas, the brothers never sent any formal letters that legally allowed the changes in the chain. In 1961, he bought the company for $2.7 million ($ million today), calculated so as to ensure each brother $1 million ($ million today) after taxes. Obtaining the funds for the buyout was difficult due to existing debt from expansion. However, Harry Sonneborn, whom Kroc referred to as his \"financial wizard\", was able to raise the required funds.\n\nAt the closing table, Kroc became annoyed that the brothers would not transfer to him the real estate and rights to the original San Bernardino location. The brothers had told Kroc they were giving the operation, property and all, to the founding employees. In his anger, Kroc later opened a new McDonald's restaurant near the original McDonald's, which had been renamed \"The Big M\" because the brothers had neglected to retain rights to the name. \"The Big M\" closed six years later. It is alleged that as part of the buyout Kroc promised, based on a handshake agreement, to continue the annual 0.5% royalty of the original agreement, but there is no evidence of this beyond a claim by a nephew of the McDonald brothers. Neither of the brothers publicly expressed disappointment over the deal. Speaking to someone about the buyout, Richard McDonald reportedly said that he had no regrets.\n\nKroc maintained the assembly line \"Speedee Service System\" for hamburger preparation that was introduced by the McDonald brothers in 1948. He standardized operations, ensuring every burger would taste the same in every restaurant. He set strict rules for franchisees on how the food was to be made, portion sizes, cooking methods and times, and packaging. Kroc also rejected cost-cutting measures like using soybean filler in the hamburger patties. These strict rules also were applied to customer service standards with such mandates that money be refunded to clients whose orders were not correct or to customers who had to wait more than five minutes for their food.\n\nBy the time of Kroc's death, the chain had 7,500 outlets in the United States and 31 other countries and territories. The total system-wide sales of its restaurants were more than $8 billion in 1983, and his personal fortune amounted to some $600 million.\n\nKroc retired from running McDonald's in 1974. While he was looking for new challenges, he decided to get back into baseball, his lifelong favorite sport, when he learned that the San Diego Padres were for sale. The team had been conditionally sold to Joseph Danzansky, a Washington, D.C. grocery-chain owner, who planned to move the Padres to Washington. However, the sale was tied up in lawsuits when Kroc purchased the team for $12 million, keeping the team in San Diego. In Kroc's first year of ownership in 1974, the Padres lost 102 games, yet drew over one million in attendance, the standard of box office success in the major leagues during that era. Their previous top attendance was 644,772 in 1972. The \"San Diego Union\" said Kroc was \"above all, a fan of his team\". On April 9, 1974, while the Padres were on the brink of losing a 9–5 decision to the Houston Astros in the season opener at San Diego Stadium, Kroc took the public address microphone in front of 39,083 fans.\n\"I’ve never seen such stupid ballplaying in my life,\" he said. The crowd cheered in approval. In 1979, Kroc's public interest in future free agent players Graig Nettles and Joe Morgan drew a $100,000 fine from Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. Frustrated with the team, he handed over operations of the team to his son-in-law, Ballard Smith. \"There's more future in hamburgers than baseball,\" Kroc said.\n\nAfter his death, the Padres in 1984 wore a special patch with Kroc's initials, RAK. They won the NL pennant that year and played in the 1984 World Series. Kroc was inducted posthumously as part of the inaugural class of the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nThe Kroc Foundation supported research, treatment and education about various medical conditions, such as alcoholism, diabetes, arthritis and multiple sclerosis. It is best known for establishing the Ronald McDonald House, a nonprofit organization that provides free housing for parents close to medical facilities where their children are receiving treatment.\n\nA lifelong Republican, Kroc believed firmly in self-reliance and staunchly opposed government welfare and the New Deal. He generated significant controversy for donating $255,000 to Richard Nixon's reelection campaign in 1972, and was accused by some, notably Senator Harrison Williams, of making the donation to influence Nixon to veto a minimum wage bill making its way through Congress.\n\nIn 1980, following a stroke, Kroc entered an alcohol rehabilitation facility. He died four years later of heart failure at a hospital in San Diego, California, on January 14, 1984, at the age of 81, and was buried at the El Camino Memorial Park in Sorrento Valley, San Diego.\n\nKroc's first two marriages to Ethel Fleming (1922–1961) and Jane Dobbins Green (1963–1968) ended in divorce. His third wife, Joan Kroc, was a philanthropist who significantly increased her charitable contributions after Kroc's death, donating to a variety of causes that interested her, such as the promotion of peace and nuclear nonproliferation. Upon her death in 2003, her remaining $2.7 billion estate was distributed among a number of nonprofit organizations, including $1.5 billion donation to The Salvation Army to build 26 Kroc Centers, community centers serving underserved neighborhoods, throughout the country.\n\nKroc's acquisition of the McDonald's franchise as well as his \"Kroc-style\" business tactics are the subject of Mark Knopfler's 2004 song \"Boom, Like That.\"\n\nKroc co-authored the book \"Grinding it Out\" released in 1977. It received positive reviews including from critic Ryan Stewman: \"Salesman to salesperson, get the book and read it. You should be inspired by it. Ray was one of us who made it!\"\n\nKroc is portrayed by Michael Keaton in the 2016 John Lee Hancock film \"The Founder\". The movie depicts Kroc's franchise development, nationwide expansion, and ultimate acquisition of McDonald's, while being critical of his treatment of the founding McDonald's brothers.\n\n\n\n",
                "McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's is a fast food company that was founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand. The first time a McDonald's franchise used the Golden Arches logo was in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers. McDonald's had its original headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but has approved plans to move its global headquarters to Chicago by 2018.\n\nMcDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue, serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries across approximately 36,900 outlets as of 2016. Although McDonald's is known for its hamburgers, they also sell cheeseburgers, chicken products, french fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food, the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit. The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. According to a BBC report published in 2012, McDonald's is the world's second largest private employer (behind Walmart with 1.9 million employees), 1.5 million of whom work for franchises.\n\nThe siblings Richard and Maurice McDonald opened in 1940 the first McDonald's at 1398 North E Street at West 14th Street in San Bernardino, California (at ) but it was not the McDonald's recognizable today; Ray Kroc made changes to the brothers business that modernized it. The brothers introduced the \"Speedee Service System\" in 1948, putting into expanded use the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant that their predecessor White Castle had put into practice more than two decades earlier.. The original mascot of McDonald's was a chef hat on top of a hamburger who was referred to as \"Speedee\". In 1962, the Golden Arches replaced Speedee as the universal mascot. The symbol, Ronald McDonald, was introduced in 1965. The clown, Ronald McDonald, appeared in advertising to target their audience of children.\nOn May 4, 1961, McDonald's first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name \"McDonald's\" with the description \"Drive-In Restaurant Services\", which continues to be renewed. By September 13, 1961, McDonald's under the guidance of Ray Kroc, filed for a trademark on a new logo—an overlapping, double-arched \"M\" symbol. But before the double arches, McDonald's used the a single arch for the architecture of their buildings. Although the \"Golden Arches\" logo appeared in various forms, the present version was not used until November 18, 1968, when the company was favored a U.S. trademark.\n\nThe present corporation credits its founding to franchised businessman Ray Kroc in on April 15, 1955, this was in fact the ninth opened McDonald's restaurant overall; although this location was destroyed and rebuilt in 1984. Kroc later purchased the McDonald brothers' equity in the company and begun the companies worldwide reach. Kroc was recorded as being an aggressive business partner, driving the McDonald brothers out of the industry.\n\nKroc and the McDonald brothers fought for control of the business, as documented in Kroc's autobiography. The San Bernardino restaurant was eventually torn down (1971, according to Juan Pollo) and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo chain in 1976. This area now serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, and a McDonald's and Route 66 museum. With the expansion of McDonald's into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life. Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics, and consumer responsibility.\n\nMcDonald's restaurants are found in 120 countries and territories around the world and serve 68 million customers each day. McDonald's operates 36,899 restaurants worldwide, employing more than 375,000 people as of the end of 2016. There are currently a total of 5,669 company-owned locations and 31,230 franchised locations, which includes 21,559 locations franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,300 locations licensed to developmental licensees, and 3,371 locations licensed to foreign affiliates, primarily Japan.\n\nFocusing on its core brand, McDonald's began divesting itself of other chains it had acquired during the 1990s. The company owned a majority stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill until October 2006, when McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle through a stock exchange. Until December 2003, it also owned Donatos Pizza, and it owned a small share of Aroma Cafe from 1999 to 2001. On August 27, 2007, McDonald's sold Boston Market to Sun Capital Partners.\n\nNotably, McDonald's has increased shareholder dividends for 25 consecutive years, making it one of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. In October 2012, its monthly sales fell for the first time in nine years. In 2014, its quarterly sales fell for the first time in seventeen years, when its sales dropped for the entirety of 1997.\n\nIn the United States, it is reported that drive-throughs account for 70 percent of sales. McDonald's closed down 184 restaurants in the United States in 2015, which was 59 more than what they planned to open. This move was also the first time McDonald's had a net decrease in the number of locations in the United States since 1970.\n\nThe company currently owns all the land, valued at an estimated $16 to $18 billion, on which its restaurants are situated. The company earns a significant portion of its revenue from rental payments from franchisees. These rent payments rose 26 percent between 2010 and 2015, accounting for one-fifth of the company's total revenue at the end of the period. In recent times, there have been calls to spin off the company's US holdings into a potential real estate investment trust, but the company announced at its investor conference on November 10, 2015, that this would not happen. The CEO, Steve Easterbrook discussed that pursuing the REIT option would pose too large a risk to the company's business model.\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland business model is different from the U.S, in that fewer than 30 percent of restaurants are franchised, with the majority under the ownership of the company. McDonald's trains its franchisees and management at Hamburger University in Oak Brook, Illinois. In other countries, McDonald's restaurants are operated by joint ventures of McDonald's Corporation and other, local entities or governments.\n\nAccording to \"Fast Food Nation\" by Eric Schlosser (2001), nearly one in eight workers in the U.S. have at some time been employed by McDonald's. Employees are encouraged by McDonald's Corp. to maintain their health by singing along to their favorite songs in order to relieve stress, attending church services in order to have a lower blood pressure, and taking two vacations annually in order to reduce risk for myocardial infarction. \"Fast Food Nation\" also states that McDonald's is the largest private operator of playgrounds in the U.S., as well as the single largest purchaser of beef, pork, potatoes, and apples. The selection of meats McDonald's uses varies to some extent based on the culture of the host country.\n\nThe McDonald's headquarters complex, McDonald's Plaza, is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. It sits on the site of the former headquarters and stabling area of Paul Butler, the founder of Oak Brook. McDonald's moved into the Oak Brook facility from an office within the Chicago Loop in 1971.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, McDonald's confirmed plans to move its global headquarters to Chicago's West Loop neighborhood in the Near West Side. The 608,000-square-foot structure will be built on the former site of Harpo Productions (where the \"Oprah Winfrey Show\" and several other Harpo productions taped) and open in early 2018.\n\nAs of November 2014, the board of directors had the following members:\n\nOn March 1, 2015, after being chief brand officer of McDonald's and its former head in the UK and northern Europe, Steve Easterbrook became CEO, succeeding Don Thompson, who stepped down on January 28, 2015.\n\nMcDonald's has become emblematic of globalization, sometimes referred to as the \"McDonaldization\" of society. \"The Economist\" newspaper uses the \"Big Mac Index\": the comparison of a Big Mac's cost in various world currencies can be used to informally judge these currencies' purchasing power parity. Switzerland has the most expensive Big Mac in the world as of July 2015, while the country with the least expensive Big Mac is India (albeit for a Maharaja Mac—the next cheapest Big Mac is Hong Kong).\n\nThomas Friedman once said that no country with a McDonald's had gone to war with another. However, the \"Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention\" is not strictly true. Exceptions are the 1989 United States invasion of Panama, NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999, the 2006 Lebanon War, and the 2008 South Ossetia war. McDonald's suspended operations in its corporate-owned stores in Crimea after Russia annexed the region in 2014. On August 20, 2014, as tensions between the United States and Russia strained over events in Ukraine, and the resultant U.S. sanctions, the Russian government temporarily shut down four McDonald's outlets in Moscow, citing sanitary concerns. The company has operated in Russia since 1990 and at August 2014 had 438 stores across the country. On August 23, 2014, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich ruled out any government move to ban McDonald's and dismissed the notion that the temporary closures had anything to do with the sanctions.\n\nSome observers have suggested that the company should be given credit for increasing the standard of service in markets that it enters. A group of anthropologists in a study entitled \"Golden Arches East\" looked at the impact McDonald's had on East Asia and Hong Kong, in particular. When it opened in Hong Kong in 1975, McDonald's was the first restaurant to consistently offer clean restrooms, driving customers to demand the same of other restaurants and institutions. McDonald's has taken to partnering up with Sinopec, the second largest oil company in the People's Republic of China, as it takes advantage of the country's growing use of personal vehicles by opening numerous drive-thru restaurants. McDonald's has opened a McDonald's restaurant and McCafé on the underground premises of the French fine arts museum, The Louvre.\n\nThe company stated it would open vegetarian-only restaurants in India by mid-2013. Foreign restaurants are banned in Bermuda, with the exception of KFC, which was present before the current law was passed. Therefore, there are no McDonald's in Bermuda.\n\nOn January 9, 2017, 80% of the franchise rights in the mainland China and in Hong Kong were sold for US$2.080 billion to a consortium of CITIC Limited (for 32%) and private equity funds managed by CITIC Capital (for 20%) and Carlyle (for 20%), which CITIC Limited and CITIC Capital would also formed a joint venture to own the stake.\n\nMcDonald's predominantly sells hamburgers, various types of chicken, chicken sandwiches, French fries, soft drinks, breakfast items, and desserts. In most markets, McDonald's offers salads and vegetarian items, wraps and other localized fare. On a seasonal basis, McDonald's offers the McRib sandwich. Some speculate the seasonality of the McRib adds to its appeal.\n\nProducts are offered as either \"eat-in\" (where the customer opts to eat in the restaurant) or \"take-out\" (where the customer opts to take the food for consumption off the premises). \"Eat-in\" meals are provided on a plastic tray with a paper insert on the floor of the tray. \"Take-out\" meals are usually delivered with the contents enclosed in a distinctive McDonald's-branded brown paper bag. In both cases, the individual items are wrapped or boxed as appropriate.\n\nSince Steve Easterbrook became CEO of the company, McDonald's has streamlined the menu which in the United States contained nearly 200 items. The company has also looked to introduce healthier options, and removed high-fructose corn syrup from hamburger buns. The company has also removed artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets, replacing chicken skin, safflower oil and citric acid found in Chicken McNuggets with pea starch, rice starch and powdered lemon juice.\n\nRestaurants in several countries, particularly in Asia, serve soup. This local deviation from the standard menu is a characteristic for which the chain is particularly known, and one which is employed either to abide by regional food taboos (such as the religious prohibition of beef consumption in India) or to make available foods with which the regional market is more familiar (such as the sale of McRice in Indonesia, or Ebi (prawn) Burger in Singapore and Japan).\n\nIn Germany and some other Western European countries, McDonald's sells beer. In New Zealand, McDonald's sells meat pies, after the local affiliate partially relaunched the Georgie Pie fast food chain it bought out in 1996.\n\nIn the United States, after limited trials on a regional basis, McDonald's plans to offer an all-day breakfast menu whenever its restaurants are open, although eggs cannot be cooked at the same time on the same equipment as hamburgers due to different temperature requirements.\n\nMost standalone McDonald's restaurants offer both counter service and drive-through service, with indoor and sometimes outdoor seating. Drive-Thru, Auto-Mac, Pay and Drive, or \"McDrive\" as it is known in many countries, often has separate stations for placing, paying for, and picking up orders, though the latter two steps are frequently combined; it was first introduced in Arizona in 1975, following the lead of other fast-food chains. The first such restaurant in Britain opened at Fallowfield, Manchester in 1986.\n\nIn some countries, \"McDrive\" locations near highways offer no counter service or seating. In contrast, locations in high-density city neighborhoods often omit drive-through service. There are also a few locations, located mostly in downtown districts, that offer a \"Walk-Thru\" service in place of Drive-Thru.\n\nMcCafé is a café-style accompaniment to McDonald's restaurants and is a concept created by McDonald's Australia (also known, and marketed, as \"Macca's\" in Australia), starting with Melbourne in 1993. As of 2016, most McDonald's in Australia have McCafés located within the existing McDonald's restaurant. In Tasmania, there are McCafés in every restaurant, with the rest of the states quickly following suit. After upgrading to the new McCafé look and feel, some Australian restaurants have noticed up to a 60 percent increase in sales. At the end of 2003, there were over 600 McCafés worldwide.\n\nFrom 2015–2016, McDonald's tried a new gourmet burger service/restaurant concept based on other gourmet restaurants such as \"Shake Shack\" and \"Grill'd\". It was rolled out for the first time in Australia during the early months of 2015 and expanded to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Arabia and New Zealand, with ongoing trials in the US market. In dedicated \"Create Your Taste\" (CYT) kiosks, customers could choose all ingredients including type of bun and meat along with optional extras. In late 2015 the Australian CYT service introduced CYT salads.\n\nAfter a person had ordered, McDonald's advised that wait times were between 10–15 minutes. When the food was ready, trained crew ('hosts') brought the food to the customer's table. Instead of McDonald's usual cardboard and plastic packaging, CYT food was presented on wooden boards, fries in wire baskets and salads in china bowls with metal cutlery. A higher price applied.\n\nIn November 2016, Create Your Taste was replaced by a \"Signature Crafted Recipes\" program designed to be more efficient and less expensive.\n\nSome locations are connected to gas stations/convenience stores, while others called McExpress have limited seating and/or menu or may be located in a shopping mall. Other McDonald's are located in Walmart stores. McStop is a location targeted at truckers and travelers which may have services found at truck stops.\n\nIn Sweden, customers who order a happy meal can use the meal's container for a pair of happy goggles. The company created a game for the goggles known as \"Slope Stars.\" McDonald's predicts happy goggles will continue in other countries. In the Netherlands, McDonald's has introduced McTrax that doubles as a recording studio; it reacts to touch. They can create their own beats with a synth and tweak sounds with special effects.\n\nThe first kosher McDonald's was established in 1997 at the Abasto de Buenos Aires mall in Buenos Aires, Argentina. There are also many kosher branches in Israel.\n\nMcDonald's playgrounds are called McDonald's PlayPlace. Some McDonald's in suburban areas and certain cities feature large indoor or outdoor playgrounds. The first PlayPlace with the familiar crawl-tube design with ball pits and slides was introduced in 1987 in the US, with many more being constructed soon after.\n\nMcDonald's Next use open-concept design and offer \"Create Your Taste\" digital ordering. The concept store also offering free mobile device charging and table service after 6:00 pm. The first store open in Hong Kong in December 2015.\n\nIn 2006, McDonald's introduced its \"Forever Young\" brand by redesigning all of its restaurants, the first major redesign since the 1970s.\n\nThe goal of the redesign is to be more like a coffee shop, similar to Starbucks. The design includes wooden tables, faux-leather chairs, and muted colors; the red was muted to terracotta, the yellow was shifted to golden for a more \"sunny\" look, and olive and sage green were also added.\n\nTo create a warmer look, the restaurants have less plastic and more brick and wood, with modern hanging lights to produce a softer glow. Many restaurants now feature free Wi-Fi and flat-screen TVs. Other upgrades include double drive-thrus, flat roofs instead of the angled red roofs, and replacing fiber glass with wood. Also, instead of the familiar golden arches, the restaurants now feature \"semi-swooshes\" (half of a golden arch), similar to the Nike swoosh.\n\nMcDonald's began banning smoking in 1994 when it banned smoking within its 1,400 wholly owned restaurants.\n\nSince the late 1990s, McDonald's has attempted to replace employees with electronic kiosks which would perform actions such taking orders and accepting money. In 1999, McDonald's first tested \"E-Clerks\" in suburban Chicago, Illinois, and Wyoming, Michigan, with the devices being able to \"save money on live staffers\" and attracting larger purchase amounts than average employees.\n\nIn 2013, the University of Oxford estimated that in the succeeding decades, there was a 92% probability of food preparation and serving to become automated in fast food establishments. By 2016, McDonald's \"Create Your Taste\" electronic kiosks were seen in some restaurants internationally where customers could custom order meals. As employees pushed for higher wages in the late-2010s, some believed that fast food companies such as McDonald's would use the devices to cut costs for employing individuals.\n\nOn August 5, 2013, \"The Guardian\" revealed that 90 percent of McDonald's UK workforce are on zero hour contracts, making it possibly the largest such private sector employer in the country. A study released by Fast Food Forward conducted by Anzalone Liszt Grove Research showed that approximately 84 percent of all fast food employees working in New York City in April 2013 had been paid less than their legal wages by their employers.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, fast food workers in the US drew an average of $7 billion of public assistance annually resulting from receiving low wages. The McResource website advised employees to break their food into smaller pieces to feel fuller, seek refunds for unopened holiday purchases, sell possessions online for quick cash, and to \"quit complaining\" as \"stress hormone levels rise by 15 percent after ten minutes of complaining.\" In December 2013, McDonald's shut down the McResource website amidst negative publicity and criticism. McDonald's plans to continue an internal telephone help line through which its employees can obtain advice on work and life problems.\n\nLiberal thinktank the Roosevelt Institute accuses some McDonald's restaurants of actually paying less than the minimum wage to entry positions due to 'rampant' wage theft. In South Korea, McDonald's pays part-time employees $5.50 an hour and is accused of paying less with arbitrary schedules adjustments and pay delays. In late 2015, Anonymous aggregated data collected by Glassdoor suggests that McDonald's in the United States pays entry-level employees between $7.25 an hour and $11 an hour, with an average of $8.69 an hour. Shift managers get paid an average of $10.34 an hour. Assistant managers get paid an average of $11.57 an hour. McDonald's CEO, Steve Easterbrook, currently earns an annual salary of $1,100,000.\n\nMcDonald's workers have on occasions decided to strike over pay, with most of the employees on strike seeking to be paid $15.00. When interviewed about the strikes occurring, former McDonald's CEO Ed Rensi stated: \"It's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who's inefficient making $15 an hour bagging french fries\" with Rensi explaining that increasing employee wages could possibly take away from entry-level jobs. However, according to Easterbrook, increasing wages and benefits for workers saw a 6% increase in customer satisfaction when comparing 2015's first quarter data to the first quarter of 2016, with greater returns seen as a result.\n\nIn September 2017, two British McDonald's stores agreed to a strike over zero hours contracts for staff. Picket lines were formed around the two stores in Crayford and Cambridge. The strike was supported by the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nIn March 2015, McDonald's workers in 19 US cities filed 28 health and safety complaints with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration which allege that low staffing, lack of protective gear, poor training and pressure to work fast has resulted in injuries. The complaints also allege that, because of a lack of first aid supplies, workers were told by management to treat burn injuries with condiments such as mayonnaise and mustard. The Fight for $15 labor organization aided the workers in filing the complaints.\n\nIn 2015, McDonald's pledged to stop using eggs from battery cage facilities by 2025. Since McDonald's purchases over 2 billion eggs per year or 4 percent of eggs produced in the United States, the switch is expected to have a major impact on the egg industry and is part of a general trend toward cage-free eggs driven by consumer concern over the harsh living conditions of hens. The aviary systems from which the new eggs will be sourced are troubled by much higher mortality rates, as well as introducing environmental and worker safety problems. The high hen mortality rate, which is more than double that of battery cage systems, will require new research to mitigate. The facilities also have higher ammonia levels due to faeces being kicked up into the air. Producers raised concerns about the production cost, which is expected to increase by 36 percent.\n\nMcDonald's continues to source pork from facilities that use gestation crates, and in 2012 pledged to phase them out.\n\nMcDonald's has for decades maintained an extensive advertising campaign. In addition to the usual media (television, radio, and newspaper), the company makes significant use of billboards and signage, sponsors sporting events ranging from Little League to the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games. Television has played a central role in the company's advertising strategy. To date, McDonald's has used 23 different slogans in United States advertising, as well as a few other slogans for select countries and regions.\n\nMcDonald's and NASA explored an advertising agreement for a planned mission to the asteroid 449 Hamburga; however, the spacecraft was eventually cancelled.\n\nMcDonald's is the title sponsor of the McDonald's All-American Game, all-star basketball games played each year for American and Canadian boys' and girls' high school basketball graduates.\n\nMcHappy Day is an annual event at McDonald's, where a percentage of the day's sales go to charity. It is the signature fundraising event for Ronald McDonald House Charities.\n\nIn 2007, it was celebrated in 17 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, the United States, Finland, France, Guatemala, Hungary, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Uruguay.\n\nAccording to the Australian McHappy Day website, McHappy Day raised $20.4 million in 2009. The goal for 2010 was $20.8 million.\n\nIn 1995, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital received an anonymous letter postmarked in Dallas, Texas, containing a $1 million winning McDonald's Monopoly game piece. McDonald's officials came to the hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, who examined the card under a jeweler's eyepiece, handled it with plastic gloves, and verified it as a winner. Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, McDonald's waived the rule and has made the annual $50,000 annuity payments, even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald's (see McDonald's Monopoly).\n\nMcRefugees are poor people in Hong Kong, Japan, and China who use McDonald's 24-hour restaurants as a temporary hostel. One in five of Hong Kong's population lives below the poverty line. The rise of McRefugees was first documented by photographer Suraj Katra in 2013.\n\nIn 1990, activists from a small group known as London Greenpeace (no connection to the international group Greenpeace) distributed leaflets entitled \"What's wrong with McDonald's?\", criticizing its environmental, health, and labor record. The corporation wrote to the group demanding they desist and apologize, and, when two of the activists refused to back down, sued them for libel in one of the longest cases in British civil law. A documentary film of the McLibel Trial has been shown in several countries.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Phil Sokolof, a millionaire businessman who had suffered a heart attack at the age of 43, took out full-page newspaper ads in New York, Chicago, and other large cities accusing McDonald's menu of being a threat to American health, and asking them to stop using beef tallow to cook their french fries.\n\nDespite the objections of McDonald's, the term \"McJob\" was added to \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\" in 2003. The term was defined as \"a low-paying job that requires little skill and provides little opportunity for advancement\".\n\nIn 2001, Eric Schlosser's book \"Fast Food Nation\" included criticism of the business practices of McDonald's. Among the critiques were allegations that McDonald's (along with other companies within the fast food industry) uses its political influence to increase its profits at the expense of people's health and the social conditions of its workers. The book also brought into question McDonald's advertisement techniques in which it targets children. While the book did mention other fast-food chains, it focused primarily on McDonald's.\n\nIn 2002, vegetarian groups, largely Hindu and Buddhist, successfully sued McDonald's for misrepresenting its French fries as vegetarian, when they contained beef broth.\n\nMorgan Spurlock's 2004 documentary film \"Super Size Me\" claimed that McDonald's food was contributing to the increase of obesity in society and that the company was failing to provide nutritional information about its food for its customers. Six weeks after the film premiered, McDonald's announced that it was eliminating the super size option, and was creating the adult Happy Meal.\nIn 2006, an unsanctioned McDonald's Videogame was released online. It is parody of the business practices of the corporate giant, taking the guise of a tycoon style business simulation game. In the game, the player plays the role of a McDonald's CEO, choosing whether or not to use controversial practices like genetically altered cow feed, plowing over rainforests, and corrupting public officials. McDonald's issued a statement distancing itself from the game.\n\nIn January 2014, it was reported that McDonald's was accused of having used a series of tax maneuvers to avoid taxes in France. The company confirmed that tax authorities had visited McDonald's French headquarters in Paris but insisted that it had not done anything wrong, saying, \"McDonald's firmly denies the accusation made by L'Express according to which McDonald's supposedly hid part of its revenue from taxes in France.\"\n\nIn response to public pressure, McDonald's has sought to include more healthy choices in its menu and has introduced a new slogan to its recruitment posters: \"Not bad for a McJob\". The word McJob, first attested in the mid-1980s and later popularized by Canadian novelist Douglas Coupland in his book \"\", has become a buzz word for low-paid, unskilled work with few prospects or benefits and little security. McDonald's disputes this definition of McJob. In 2007, the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan \"Would you like a career with that?\" on Irish television, asserting that its jobs have good prospects.\n\nIn an effort to respond to growing consumer awareness of food provenance, the fast-food chain changed its supplier of both coffee beans and milk. UK chief executive Steve Easterbrook said: \"British consumers are increasingly interested in the quality, sourcing, and ethics of the food and drink they buy\". In a bid to tap into the ethical consumer market, McDonald's switched to using coffee beans taken from stocks that are certified by the Rainforest Alliance, a conservation group. Additionally, in response to pressure, McDonald's UK started using organic milk supplies for its bottled milk and hot drinks, although it still uses conventional milk in its milkshakes, and in all of its dairy products in the United States. According to a report published by \"Farmers Weekly\" in 2007, the quantity of milk used by McDonald's could have accounted for as much as 5 percent of the UK's organic milk output.\n\nMcDonald's announced on May 22, 2008, that, in the United States and Canada, it would switch to using cooking oil that contains no trans fats for its french fries, and canola-based oil with corn and soy oils, for its baked items, pies and cookies, by year's end.\n\nWith regard to acquiring chickens from suppliers who use CAK/CAS methods of slaughter, McDonald's says that it needs to see more research \"to help determine whether any CAS system in current use is optimal from an animal welfare perspective.\"\n\nIn April 2008, McDonald's announced that 11 of its Sheffield, England restaurants have been engaged in a biomass trial that had cut its waste and carbon footprint by half in the area. In this trial, wastes from the restaurants were collected by Veolia Environmental Services and were used to produce energy at a power plant. McDonald's plans to expand this project, although the lack of biomass power plants in the United States will prevent this plan from becoming a national standard anytime soon. In addition, in Europe, McDonald's has been recycling vegetable grease by converting it to fuel for its diesel trucks.\n\nMcDonald's has been using a corn-based bioplastic to produce containers for some of its products. The environmental benefits of this technology are controversial, with critics noting that biodegradation is slow, produces greenhouse gases and that contamination of traditional plastic waste streams with bioplastics can complicate recycling efforts.\n\nIn 1990, McDonald's worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to stop using \"clam shell\" shaped styrofoam food containers to house its food products. 20 years later, McDonald's announced they would try replacing styrofoam coffee cups with an alternative material.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized McDonald's continuous effort to reduce solid waste by designing more efficient packaging and by promoting the use of recycled-content materials. McDonald's reports that it is committed towards environmental leadership by effectively managing electric energy, by conserving natural resources through recycling and reusing materials, and by addressing water management issues within the restaurant.\n\nIn an effort to reduce energy usage by 25 percent in its restaurants, McDonald's opened a prototype restaurant in Chicago in 2009 with the intention of using the model in its other restaurants throughout the world. Building on past efforts, specifically a restaurant it opened in Sweden in 2000 that was the first to intentionally incorporate green ideas, McDonald's designed the Chicago site to save energy by incorporating old and new ideas such as managing storm water, using skylights for more natural lighting and installing some partitions and tabletops made from recycled goods.\n\nWhen McDonald's received criticism for its environmental policies in the 1970s, it began to make substantial progress in reducing its use of materials. For instance, an \"average meal\" in the 1970s—a Big Mac, fries, and a drink—required 46 grams of packaging; today, it requires only 25 grams, allowing a 46 percent reduction. In addition, McDonald's eliminated the need for intermediate containers for cola by having a delivery system that pumps syrup directly from the delivery truck into storage containers, saving of packaging annually. Overall, weight reductions in packaging and products, as well as the increased usage of bulk packaging ultimately decreased packaging by annually.\n\nMcDonald's has been involved in a number of lawsuits and other legal cases, most of which involved trademark disputes. The company has threatened many food businesses with legal action unless it drops the Mc or Mac from trading names.\n\nOn September 8, 2009, McDonald's Malaysian operations lost a lawsuit to prevent another restaurant calling itself McCurry. McDonald's lost in an appeal to Malaysia's highest court, the Federal Court.\n\nIn April 2007, in Perth, Western Australia, McDonald's pleaded guilty to five charges relating to the employment of children under 15 in one of its outlets and was fined A$8,000.\n\nIn 2016, the Australian Taxation Office revealed that McDonald's Asia-Pacific Consortium had generated $478 million in revenue in 2013–14, but had paid no tax on those earnings whatsoever.\n\nMcDonald's has defended itself in several cases involving workers' rights.\n\nThe longest running legal action of all time in the UK was the McLibel case against 2 defendants who criticized a number of aspects of the company. The trial lasted 10 years and called 130 witnesses. The European Court of Human Rights deemed that the unequal resources of the litigants breached the defendants rights to freedom of speech and biased the trial. The result was widely seen as a \"PR disaster.\"\n\nA famous legal case in the US involving McDonald's was the 1994 decision in \"Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants\" where Stella Liebeck was awarded several million dollars after she suffered third-degree burns after spilling a scalding cup of McDonald's coffee on herself.\n\nIn April 2014, it was reported that McDonald's in Europe will use chicken meat that was produced by using genetically modified animal feed. Greenpeace argues that McDonald's saves less than one Eurocent for each chicken burger and goes down a path not desired by its customers.\n\n\n\n",
                "History of McDonald's\n\nThis history of McDonald's is an overview of the original restaurant and of the chain.\n\nThe McDonald family moved from Manchester, New Hampshire to Hollywood, California in the late 1930s, where brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald began working as set movers and handymen at Motion-Picture studios. In 1937, their father Patrick McDonald opened \"The Airdrome\", a food stand, on Huntington Drive (Route 66) near the Monrovia Airport in the Los Angeles County city of Monrovia, California with hot dogs being one of the first items sold. Hamburgers were later added to the menu at a cost of ten cents with all-you-can-drink orange juice at five cents. In 1940, Maurice and Richard (\"Mac\" and \"Dick\") moved the entire building east, to West 14th and 1398 North E Streets in San Bernardino, California. The restaurant was renamed \"McDonald's Bar-B-Que\" and had 25 menu items, mostly barbecue.\n\nIn October 1948, after the McDonald brothers realized that most of their profits came from selling hamburgers, they closed down their successful carhop drive-in to establish a streamlined system with a simple menu which consisted of only hamburgers, cheeseburgers, potato chips, coffee, soft drinks, and apple pie. After the first year, potato chips and pie were swapped out for french fries and milkshakes. The carhops were eliminated, making the new restaurant a self-service operation. Richard and Maurice took great care in setting up their kitchen like an assembly line to ensure maximum efficiency. The restaurant's name was changed again, this time to simply \"McDonald's,\" and reopened on December 12, 1948.\n\nIn April 1952, the brothers decided they needed an entirely new building in order to achieve two goals: further efficiency improvements, and a more eye-catching appearance. They collected recommendations for an architect and interviewed at least four, finally choosing Stanley Clark Meston, an architect practicing in nearby Fontana. The brothers and Meston worked together closely in the design of their new building. They achieved the extra efficiencies they needed by, among other things, drawing the actual measurements of every piece of equipment in chalk on a tennis court behind the McDonald house (with Meston's assistant Charles Fish). The new restaurant's design achieved a high level of noticeability thanks to gleaming surfaces of red and white ceramic tile, stainless steel, brightly colored sheet metal, and glass; pulsing red, white, yellow, and green neon; and two 25-foot yellow sheet-metal arches trimmed in neon, called \"golden arches\" even at the design stage. A third, smaller arch sign at the roadside hosted a pudgy character in a chef's hat, known as Speedee, striding across the top, trimmed in animated neon. Further marketing techniques were implemented to change McDonald's from a sit down restaurant to a fast food chain. They used such things as turning off the heating to prevent people wanting to stay so long, fixed and angled seating so the customer would sit over their food promoting them to eat faster, spreading the seats further apart so being less of a sociable place to dine in, and giving their customers branded cone shaped cups forcing them to hold their drink whilst eating which would speed up the eating process. Many other companies followed McDonald's strategies to turn their own restaurants into fast food establishments including Burger King, White Castle and Subway.\n\nIn late 1953, with only a rendering of Meston's design in hand, the brothers began seeking franchisees. Their first franchisee was Neil Fox, a distributor for General Petroleum Corporation. Fox's stand, the first with Meston's golden arches design, opened in May 1953 at Central Avenue and Indian School Road in Phoenix, Arizona. Their second franchisee was the team of Fox's brother-in-law Roger Williams and Burdette \"Bud\" Landon, both of whom also worked for General Petroleum. Williams and Landon opened their stand on August 18, 1953 at 10207 Lakewood Boulevard in Downey, California. The Downey stand has the distinction of being the oldest surviving McDonald's restaurant. The Downey stand was never required to comply with the McDonald's Corporation's remodeling and updating requests over the years because it was franchised not by the McDonald's Corporation, but by the McDonald brothers themselves to Williams and Landon.\nIn 1954, Ray Kroc, a seller of Prince Castle brand Multimixer milkshake machines, learned that the McDonald brothers were using eight of his machines in their San Bernardino restaurant. His curiosity was piqued, and he went to take a look at the restaurant. He was joined by good friend Charles Lewis who had suggested to Kroc several improvements to the McDonald's burger recipe.\n\nBelieving the McDonald's formula was a ticket to success, Kroc suggested they franchise their restaurants throughout the country. The brothers were skeptical, however, that the self-service approach could succeed in colder, rainier climates; furthermore, their thriving business in San Bernardino, and franchises already operating or planned, made them reluctant to risk a national venture. Kroc offered to take the major responsibility for setting up the new franchises elsewhere. He returned to his home outside of Chicago with rights to set up McDonald's restaurants throughout the country, except in a handful of territories in California and Arizona already licensed by the McDonald brothers. The brothers were to receive one-half of one percent of gross sales. Kroc's first McDonald's restaurant opened on April 15, 1955, at 400 North Lee Street in Des Plaines, Illinois, near Chicago. The Des Plaines interior and exterior was painted by master painter Eugene Wright, who owned Wright's Decorating Service. Eugene was asked to come up with a color scheme and he chose yellow and white, with dark brown and red being secondary trim colors. Those colors would go on to become the colors of all McDonald's franchises. (Recognizing its historic and nostalgic value, in 1990 the McDonald's Corporation acquired the stand and rehabilitated it to a modern but nearly original condition, and then built an adjacent museum and gift shop to commemorate the site.)\nOnce the Des Plaines restaurant had become operational, Kroc sought franchisees for his McDonald's chain. The first snag came quickly. In 1956 he discovered that the McDonald brothers had licensed the franchise rights for Cook County, Illinois to the Frejlach Ice Cream Company. Kroc was incensed that the McDonald's had not informed him of this arrangement. He purchased the rights back for $25,000 ($ today), five times what the Frejlacks had originally paid, and pressed forward. McDonald's grew slowly for its first three years. By 1958, there were 34 restaurants. In 1959, however, Kroc opened 68 new restaurants, bringing the total to 102 locations.\n\nIn 1960, the McDonald's advertising campaign \"Look for the Golden Arches\" gave sales a big boost. Kroc believed that advertising was an investment that would in the end come back many times over, and advertising has always played a key role in the development of the McDonald's Corporation. In 1962, McDonald's introduced its now world-famous Golden Arches logo. A year later, the company sold its millionth hamburger and introduced Ronald McDonald, a red-haired clown designed to appeal to children.\n\nIn the early 1960s, McDonald's really began to take off. The growth in U.S. automobile use that came with suburbanization and the interstate highway system contributed heavily to McDonald's success. In 1961 Kroc bought out the McDonald brothers for $2.7 million, aiming at making McDonald's the number one fast-food chain in the country.\n\nOn May 3, 1960 Kroc assisted Christopher Boulos in opening a McDonald's franchise in DeKalb, Illinois. By 1965, the McDonald's at 805 W. Lincoln Highway sold over 4 million burgers and of fries. Boulos was the first Greek-American McDonald's franchise operator.\n\nIn 1965, McDonald's Corporation went public. Common shares were offered at $22.50 per share. By the end of the first day's trading, the price had risen to $30. A block of 100 shares purchased for $2,250 in 1965 was worth, after 12 stock splits (increasing the number of shares to 74,360), over $5.7 million as of year-end market close on December 31, 2010. In 1980, McDonald's Corporation became one of the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nMcDonald's success in the 1960s was in large part due to the company's skillful marketing and flexible response to customer demand. In 1962, the Filet-O-Fish sandwich, billed as \"the fish that catches people\", was introduced in McDonald's restaurants. The new item had originally met with disapproval from Kroc, but after its successful test marketing, he eventually agreed to add it. Another item that Kroc had backed a year previously, a burger with a slice of pineapple and a slice of cheese, known as a \"hulaburger\", had flopped (both it and the Filet-O-Fish were developed in Catholic neighborhoods where burger sales dropped off markedly on Fridays and during Lent). The market was not quite ready for Kroc's taste; the hulaburger's tenure on the McDonald's menu board was short. In 1968 the now legendary Big Mac made its debut, and in 1969 McDonald's sold its five billionth hamburger. Two years later, as it launched the \"You Deserve a Break Today\" advertising campaign, McDonald's restaurants had reached all 50 states.\n\nIn 1968, McDonald's opened its 1,000th restaurant, and Fred L. Turner became the company's president and chief administrative officer. Kroc became chairman and remained CEO until 1973. Turner had originally intended to open a McDonald's franchise, but when he had problems with his backers over a location, he went to work as a grillman for Kroc in 1956. As operations vice president, Turner helped new franchisees get their stores up and running. He was constantly looking for new ways to perfect the McDonald's system, experimenting, for example, to determine the maximum number of hamburger patties one could stack in a box without squashing them and pointing out that seconds could be saved if McDonald's used buns that were presliced all the way through and were not stuck together in the package. Such attention to detail was one reason for the company's extraordinary success.\n\nBy the late 1960s, many of the candy-striped Golden Arches stores had been modified with enclosed walk-up order areas and limited indoor seating. In June 1969, McDonald's introduced a new \"mansard roof\" building design featuring indoor seating. The natural brick and cedar shake look mansards were a response to critics who berated McDonald's architecture as too garish. It became the standard for McDonald's restaurants, and franchise holders were ultimately required to demolish older restaurants and replace them with the new design. The first McDonald's restaurant using the \"mansard roof\" design opened that same year in the Chicago suburb of Matteson.\n\nMcDonald's spectacular growth continued in the 1970s. Americans were more on-the-go than ever, and fast service was a priority. In 1972, the company passed $1 billion in annual sales. By 1976, McDonald's had served 20 billion hamburgers, and system wide sales exceeded $3 billion.\n\nThe company pioneered breakfast fast food with the introduction of the Egg McMuffin in 1972 when market research indicated that a quick breakfast would be welcomed by consumers. Five years later McDonald's added a full breakfast line to the menu, and by 1987 one-fourth of all breakfasts eaten out in the United States came from McDonald's restaurants. In test market locations, such as New York City, McDonald's added a full breakfast line to its menus in 1975.\n\nKroc was a firm believer in giving \"something back into the community where you do business\". In 1974 McDonald's acted upon that philosophy in an original way by opening the first Ronald McDonald House, in Philadelphia, to provide a \"home away from home\" for the families of children in nearby hospitals. Twelve years after this first house opened, 100 similar Ronald McDonald Houses were in operation across the United States.\n\nThere was some skepticism in the company's phenomenal growth internationally. When Wally and Hugh Morris approached the corporation in 1974 to bring McDonald's into New Zealand, they were firmly shunned by Kroc, citing a visit to the country and saying \"There aren't any people... I never met a more dead-than-alive hole in my life.\" Persistence by the brothers eventually led to their request being granted in May 1975. They managed to negotiate a deal with the corporation by selling New Zealand cheese to the US to offset the high costs of importing plant equipment. The first New Zealand restaurant opened in June 1976 at Porirua, near Wellington, to much more success than the corporation predicted.\n\nIn 1975, McDonald's opened its first drive-thru window in Sierra Vista, Arizona, following Wendy's lead. This service gave Americans a fast, convenient way to procure a quick meal. The company's goal was to provide service in 50 seconds or less. Drive-thru sales eventually accounted for more than half of McDonald's systemwide sales. Meantime, the Happy Meal, a combo meal for children featuring a toy, was added to the menu in 1979. A period of aggressive advertising campaigns and price slashing in the early 1980s became known as the \"burger wars\". Burger King suggested to customers: \"have it your way\"; Wendy's offered itself as the \"fresh alternative\" and launched their \"Where's the beef?\" campaign. McDonald's sales and market still predominated, however.\n\nDuring the 1980s, a period of substantial expansion, McDonald's further diversified its menu to suit changing consumer tastes. The company introduced the McChicken in 1980; it proved to be a sales disappointment, and was replaced with Chicken McNuggets a year later (having originally been invented by Rene Arend in 1979). In 1985, ready-to-eat salads were introduced. Efficiency, combined with an expanded menu, continued to draw customers. McDonald's began to focus on urban centers and introduced new architectural styles.\n\nThe first McDonald's Express locations opened in 1991. These are smaller-scale prototypes, usually constructed in prefabricated buildings or urban storefronts, that do not feature certain menu items such as milkshakes and Quarter Pounders.\n\nIn 1992 Michael R. Quinlan became president of McDonald's Corporation, and Fred L. Turner became chairman. Quinlan, who took over as CEO in 1987, had started at McDonald's in the mail room in 1963, and gradually worked his way up. In his first year as CEO, the company opened 600 new restaurants.\n\nBy 1991, 37 percent of system-wide sales came from restaurants outside the United States. McDonald's opened its first foreign restaurant in British Columbia, Canada, in 1967. By the early 1990s the company had established itself in 58 foreign countries, and operated more than 3,600 restaurants outside the United States, through wholly owned subsidiaries, joint ventures, and franchise agreements. Its strongest foreign markets were Japan, Canada, Germany, Great Britain, Australia, and France.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, McDonald's, like other traditional employers of teenagers, was faced with a shortage of labor in the United States. The company met this challenge by being the first to entice retirees back into the workforce. Focusing on off-site training, it opened its Hamburger University in 1961 to train franchisees and corporate decision-makers. By 1990, more than 40,000 people had received \"Bachelor of Hamburgerology\" degrees from the Oak Brook, Illinois, facility. The corporation opened a Hamburger University in Tokyo in 1971, in Munich in 1975, and in London in 1982.\n\nBraille menus were first introduced in 1979, and picture menus in 1988. In March 1992, combination Braille and picture menus were reintroduced to accommodate those with vision, speech, or hearing impairments.\n\nClamshell grills, which cooked both sides of a hamburger simultaneously, were tested. New locations such as hospitals and military bases were tapped as sites for new restaurants. In response to the increase in microwave oven usage, McDonald's, whose name is the single most advertised brand name in the world, stepped up advertising and promotional expenditures stressing that its taste was superior to quick-packaged foods.\n\nThe first McDonald's in Mainland China opened in Dongmen, Shenzhen in October 1990.\n\nMcRecycle USA began in 1990 and included a commitment to purchase at least $100 million worth of recycled products annually for use in construction, remodeling, and equipping restaurants. Chairs, table bases, table tops, eating counters, table columns, waste receptacles, corrugated cartons, packaging, and washroom tissue were all made from recycled products. McDonald's worked with the U.S. Environmental Defense Fund to develop a comprehensive solid waste reduction program. Wrapping burgers in paper rather than plastic led to a 90 percent reduction in the wrapping material waste stream.\n\nIt took McDonald's 33 years to open its first 10,000 restaurants. The 10,000th unit opened in April 1988. Incredibly, the company reached the 20,000-restaurant mark in only eight more years, in mid-1996. By the end of 1997 the total had surpassed 23,000, and by that time McDonald's was opening 2,000 new restaurants each year, an average of five every day.\n\nMuch of the growth of the 1990s came outside the US, with international units increasing from about 3,600 in 1991 to more than 11,000 by 1998. The number of countries with McDonald's outlets nearly doubled from 59 in 1991 to 114 in late 1998. In 1993, a new region was added to the empire when the first McDonald's in the Middle East opened in Tel Aviv, Israel. As the company entered new markets, it showed increasing flexibility with respect to local food preferences and customs. In Israel, for example, the first kosher McDonald's opened in a Jerusalem suburb in 1995. In Arab countries the restaurant chain used \"Halal\" menus, which complied with Islamic laws for food preparation. In 1996 McDonald's entered India for the first time, where it offered a Big Mac made with lamb called the Maharaja Mac. That same year the first McSki-Thru opened in Lindvallen, Sweden.\n\nOverall, the company derived increasing percentages of its revenue and income from outside the US. In 1992 about two-thirds of systemwide sales came from U.S. McDonald's, but by 1997 that figure was down to about 51 percent. Similarly, the operating income numbers showed a reduction from about 60 percent of sales derived from the US in 1992 to 42.5 percent in 1997.\n\nIn the US, the number of units grew from 9,000 in 1991 to 12,500 in 1997, an increase of about 40 percent. Although the additional units increased market share in some markets, a number of franchisees complained that new units were cannibalizing sales from existing ones. Same-store sales for outlets open for more than one year were flat in the mid-1990s, a reflection of both the greater number of units and the mature nature of the U.S. market.\n\nThe company made several notable blunders in the US in the 1990s which hurt stateside profits. The McLean Deluxe sandwich, which featured a 91 percent fat-free beef patty, was introduced in 1991, never really caught on, and was dropped from the menu in February 1996 to make room for the Arch Deluxe, itself an underperforming product. The \"grown-up\" (and pricey) Arch Deluxe sandwich was launched in May 1996 and the Deluxe Line was launched in September 1996 in a $200 million campaign to gain the business of more adults, but were bombs. The following spring brought a 55-cent Big Mac promotion, which many customers either rejected outright or were confused by because the burgers had to be purchased with full-priced fries and a drink. The promotion embittered still more franchisees, whose complaints led to its withdrawal. In July 1997 McDonald's fired its main ad agency, Leo Burnett, a 15-year McDonald's partner after the nostalgic \"My McDonald's\" campaign proved a failure. Several other 1990s-debuted menu items, including fried chicken, pasta, fajitas, and pizza failed as well. A seemingly weakened McDonald's was the object of a Burger King offensive when the rival fast-food maker launched the Big King sandwich, a Big Mac clone. Meanwhile, internal taste tests revealed that customers preferred the fare at Wendy's and Burger King.\n\nIn response to these difficulties, McDonald's drastically cut back on its U.S. expansion. In contrast to the 1,130 units opened in 1995, only about 400 new McDonald's were built in 1997. Plans to open hundreds of smaller restaurants in Wal-Marts and gasoline stations were abandoned because test sites did not meet targeted goals. Reacting to complaints from franchisees about poor communication with the corporation and excess bureaucracy, the head of McDonald's U.S.A. (Jack M. Greenberg, who had assumed the position in October 1996) reorganized the unit into five autonomous geographic divisions. The aim was to bring management and decision-making closer to franchisees and customers.\n\nOn the marketing side, McDonald's scored big in 1996 and 1997 with a Teenie Beanie Baby promotion in which about 80 million of the toys/collectibles were gobbled up virtually overnight. The chain received some bad publicity, however, when it was discovered that a number of customers purchased Happy Meals just to get the toys and threw the food away. For a similar spring 1998 Teenie Beanie giveaway, the company altered the promotion to allow patrons to buy menu items other than kids' meals. McDonald's also began to benefit from a seven years global marketing alliance signed with Disney/Pixar in 1998. Initial Disney/Pixar movies promoted by McDonald's included \"A Bug's Life\", \"Monsters, Inc.\", \"Finding Nemo\" and \"The Incredibles\". Perhaps the most important marketing move came in the later months of 1997 when McDonald's named DDB Needham as its new lead ad agency. Needham had been the company's agency in the 1970s and was responsible for the hugely successful \"You Deserve a Break Today\" campaign. Late in 1997, McDonald's launched the Needham-designed \"Did Somebody Say McDonald's?\" campaign, which appeared to be an improvement over its predecessors.\n\nFollowing the difficulties of the early and mid-1990s, several moves in 1998 seemed to indicate a reinvigorated McDonald's. In February the company for the first time took a stake in another fast-food chain when it purchased a minority interest in the 16-unit, Colorado-based Chipotle Mexican Grill chain. The following month came the announcement that McDonald's would improve the taste of several sandwiches and introduce several new menu items. McFlurry desserts, developed by a Canadian franchisee in 1997, proved popular when launched in the United States in the summer of 1998. That same month, McDonald's said that it would overhaul its food preparation system in every U.S. restaurant. The new just-in-time system, dubbed \"Made for You\", was in development for a number of years and aimed to deliver to customers \"fresher, hotter food\"; enable patrons to receive special-order sandwiches (a perk long offered by rivals Burger King and Wendy's); and allow new menu items to be more easily introduced thanks to the system's enhanced flexibility. The expensive changeover was expected to cost about $25,000 per restaurant, with McDonald's offering to pay for about half of the cost; the company planned to provide about $190 million in financial assistance to its franchisees before implementation was completed by year-end 1999.\n\nIn May 1998, Greenberg was named president and CEO of McDonald's Corporation, with Quinlan remaining chairman; at the same time Alan D. Feldman, who had joined the company only four years earlier from Pizza Hut, replaced Greenberg as president of McDonald's U.S.A., an unusual move for a company whose executives typically were long-timers. The following month brought another first, McDonald's first job cuts. The company said it would eliminate 525 employees from its headquarters staff, a cut of about 23 percent. In the second quarter of 1998 McDonald's took a $160 million charge in relation to the cuts. As a result, the company, for the first time since it went public in 1965, recorded a decrease in net income, from $1.64 billion in 1997 to $1.55 billion in 1998.\n\nMcDonald's followed up its investment in Chipotle with several more moves beyond the burger business. In March 1999 the company bought Aroma Café, a UK chain of 23 upscale coffee and sandwich shops. In July of that year McDonald's added Donatos Pizza, a midwestern chain of 143 pizzerias based in Columbus, Ohio. Donatos had revenues of $120 million in 1997. In 1999, McDonald's 25,000th unit opened, Greenberg took on the additional post of chairman, and Jim Cantalupo was named company president. Cantalupo, who had joined the company as controller in 1974 and later became head of McDonald's International, had been vice-chairman, a position he retained. In May 2000 McDonald's completed its largest acquisition yet, buying the bankrupt Boston Market chain for $173.5 million in cash and debt. At the time, there were more than 850 Boston Market outlets, which specialized in home-style meals, with rotisserie chicken the lead menu item. Revenue at Boston Market during 1999 totaled $670 million. McDonald's rounded out its acquisition spree in early 2001 by buying a 33 percent stake in Pret A Manger, an upscale urban-based chain specializing in ready-to-eat sandwiches made on the premises. There were more than 110 Pret shops in the United Kingdom and several more in New York City. Also during 2001, McDonald's sold off Aroma Café and took its McDonald's Japan affiliate public, selling a minority stake through an initial public offering.\n\nAs it was exploring new avenues of growth, even though, McDonald's core burger chain had become plagued by problems. Most prominently, the Made for You system backfired. Although many franchisees believed that it succeeded in improving the quality of the food, it also increased service times and proved labor-intensive. Some franchisees also complained that the actual cost of implementing the system ran much higher than the corporation had estimated, a charge that McDonald's contested. In any case, there was no question that Made for You failed to reverse the chain's sluggish sales. Growth in sales at stores open more than a year (known as same-store sales) fell in both 2000 and 2001. Late in 2001 the company launched a restructuring involving the elimination of about 850 positions, 700 of which were in the US, and several restaurant closings.\n\nIn 2000, a McDonald's in Dearborn, Michigan in Greater Detroit was the first one in Michigan and the only one east of the Mississippi River to offer halal food for Muslim customers.\n\nThere were further black eyes as well. McDonald's was sued in 2001 after it was revealed that for flavoring purposes a small amount of beef extract was being added to the vegetable oil used to cook the french fries. The company had cooked its fries in beef tallow until 1990, when it began claiming in ads that it used 100 percent vegetable oil. McDonald's soon apologized for any \"confusion\" that had been caused by its use of the beef flavoring, and in mid-2002 it reached a settlement in the litigation, agreeing to donate $10 million to Hindu, vegetarian, and other affected groups. Also in 2001, further embarrassment came when 51 people were charged with conspiring to rig McDonald's game promotions over the course of several years. It was revealed that $24 million of winning McDonald's game tickets had been stolen as part of the scam. McDonald's was not implicated in the scheme, which centered on a worker at an outside company that had administered the promotions.\n\nMcDonald's also had to increasingly battle its public image as a purveyor of fatty, unhealthy food. Consumers began filing lawsuits contending that years of eating at McDonald's had made them overweight. McDonald's responded by introducing low-calorie menu items and switching to a more healthful cooking oil for its french fries. McDonald's franchises overseas became a favorite target of people and groups expressing anti-American and/or anti-globalization sentiments. In August 1999 a group of protesters led by farmer José Bové destroyed a half-built McDonald's restaurant in Millau, France. In 2002 Bové, who gained fame from the incident, served a three-month jail sentence for the act, which he said was in protest against U.S. trade protectionism. McDonald's was also one of three multinational corporations (along with Starbucks Corporation and Nike, Inc.) whose outlets in Seattle were attacked in late 1999 by some of the more aggressive protesters against a World Trade Organization meeting taking place there. In the early 2000s McDonald's pulled out of several countries, including Bolivia and two Middle Eastern nations, at least in part because of the negative regard with which the brand was held in some areas.\n\nEarly in 2002, Cantalupo retired after 28 years of service. Sales remained lackluster that year, and in October the company attempted to revive U.S. sales through the introduction of a low-cost Dollar Menu. In December 2002, after this latest initiative to reignite sales growth failed and also after profits fell in seven of the previous eight quarters, Greenberg announced that he would resign at the end of the year. Cantalupo came out of retirement to become chairman and CEO at the beginning of 2003.\n\nCantalupo started his tenure by announcing a major restructuring that involved the 2002 quarterly loss, which included the closure of more than 700 restaurants (mostly in the United States and Japan), the elimination of 600 jobs, and charges of $853 million. The charges resulted in a fourth-quarter 2002 loss of $343.8 million, the first quarterly loss in McDonald's 38 years as a public company. The new CEO also shifted away from the company's traditional reliance on growth through the opening of new units to a focus on gaining more sales from existing units. By 2003, with Ray Kroc's McDonald's Corporation nearly 50 and the McDonald's fast food restaurant concept itself old enough to qualify for AARP membership, the brand had perhaps become too familiar and sales figures stalled. Analysts, management, owners, and customers alike recognized that the aged chain required revivification. The question in need of solution was: How should McDonald's reinvent itself without losing its core values and maintain relevance in the marketplace? To that end, several new menu items were successfully launched, including entree salads, McGriddles breakfast sandwiches (which used pancakes in place of bread), and white-meat Chicken McNuggets. Some outlets began test-marketing fruits and vegetables as Happy Meal options. It was quickly determined that focus on customer experience was key in reversing the slippage. Then, a new global marketing campaign was adopted which was designed around the notion of the \"Rolling Energy\" phase. Launched on September 29, 2003, the campaign began featuring youthful images, hip music, and pop culture celebrities touting the tagline, \"I'm lovin' it\". Next, James R. Cantalupo was called back from retirement to head the corporation and its efforts to recapture golden luster. His plan was to keep things simple with a focus on the basics like customer service, clean restrooms, and reliable appealing food (not unlike Ray Kroc's mantra of QSC and V: Quality, Service, Cleanliness, and Value). In addition to the basics he determined to position the company with a more modern coherent image in order to foster a McDonald's \"experience\" for customers. More than an advertising campaign he and his team approved sweeping new architecture for McDonald's restaurants, the first major overhaul since 1969 when the now universally recognized signature double mansard roof became standard. In fact, Mr. Cantalupo personally approved abandonment of the ubiquitous and familiar mansard in favor of what became the \"Forever Young\" prototype topped with its swish eyebrow. This was the first global campaign in McDonald's history, as the new slogan was to be used in advertising in more than 100 countries. It also proved to be the first truly successful ad campaign in years; sales began rebounding, helped also by improvements in service. Cantalupo did not live to see the fruits of his labor and he died in 2004 just as his modern vision for McDonald's was getting underway. Nonetheless he had set things into motion causing a paradigm shift for the company resulting in a refreshed image without a dilution of brand identity.\n\nIn December 2003, for instance, same-store sales increased 7.3 percent. Same-store sales rose 2.4 percent for the entire year, after falling 2.1 percent in 2002. Also, in that month, McDonald's announced that it would further its focus on its core hamburger business by downsizing its other ventures. The company said that it would sell Donatos back to that chain's founder. In addition, it would discontinue development of non-McDonald's brands outside of the United States. This included Boston Market outlets in Canada and Australia and Donatos units in Germany. McDonald's kept its minority investment in Pret A Manger, but McDonald's Japan was slated to close its Pret units there. These moves would enable the company to concentrate its international efforts on the McDonald's chain, while reducing the non-hamburger brands in the United States to Chipotle and Boston Market, both of which were operating in the black.\n\nMcDonald's continued to curtail store openings in 2004 and to concentrate on building business at existing restaurants. Much of the more than $1.5 billion budgeted for capital expenditures in 2004 was slated to be used to remodel existing restaurants. McDonald's also aimed to pay down debt by $400 million to $700 million and to return approximately $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Cantalupo also set several long-term goals, such as sustaining annual systemwide sales and revenue growth rates of 3 to 5 percent. In a move to both simplify the menu and make its offerings less fattening, McDonald's announced in March 2004 that it would phase out Super Size french fries and soft drinks by the end of the year.\n\nIn the 1960s, the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s, \"no loitering\" had been McDonald's motto. Ray Kroc had decreed upon the origins of his version of the chain that pay telephones, jukeboxes, and vending machines of any kind were forbidden at McDonald's restaurants. The goal had been to quickly serve customers and not force them to stay in the restaurants any longer than it took them to eat a hamburger. Along that line of thinking, dining areas were designed with minimalist hard plastic tables and chairs which were more often than not bolted in place. Thus customers consumed their fast food in scant comfort without dillydally allowing room for the next hurrying customers.\n\nWith the new \"Forever Young\" design (adopted in 2006), the first major redesign since 1969, McDonald's turned a new page for itself. New and remodeled restaurants feature dining zones with \"distinct personalities\". Most of them offer three sections or zones. A linger zone was designed to accommodate people who were inclined to dawdle and socialize while sitting comfortably on armchairs or sofas using free wifi access. Another zone offers counters and stools for patrons in a hurry who might just grab and go. The third and perhaps most important zone is the one for families or groups where seating arrangements can be reconfigured to meet a variety of needs. Harsh colors and hard plastics have been replaced with custom earth tones and flexible, padded, fabric-covered booth-seating, all in hopes of engaging diners to loiter and perhaps spend more money. In addition to architecture and furnishings, the McDonald's menu has been tweaked to offer a larger variety of what the corporation refers to as more healthy food.\n\nMcDonald's franchises are required to follow the directions of the parent company and perhaps more than a few have complained about the Forever Young changes. First, customers needed to recognize the mansard buildings and identify McDonald's with them—a new look may initially generate some degree of confusion. The next objection is cost: as of 2008, a newly built swish-brow store was said to cost upwards of $1 million and renovation of an existing unit to meet the new standards as much as $400,000. With a large percentage of sales from drive-in business, franchises could argue that the expensive interior redesign is unwarranted for their bottom lines.\n\nIn May 2010, McDonald's redesigned its US website to a sleeker, HTML 5 friendly interface. Along with those changes, McDonald's also introduced new advertising material to its website, including the unveiling of new pictures used exclusively for in-restaurant ads, television commercials, print advertising, and online advertising, which consist of more realistic pictures of its products, which are now up close and face the camera instead of facing left or right.\n\nIn July 2011, McDonald's announced that their largest restaurant in the world would be built on the 2012 London Olympics site. The restaurant contains over 1,500 seats and is half the length of an American football field. Over 470 staff were employed serving on average (during the 2012 Olympics) 100,000 portions of fries, 50,000 Big Macs and 30,000 Milkshakes. This restaurant will overshadow the current largest McDonald's in the world in Moscow, Russia.\n\nIn January 2012, the company announced revenue for 2011 reached an all-time high of $27 billion, and that 2,400 restaurants would be updated and 1,300 new ones opened worldwide.\n\nIn the middle of the decade, the restaurant began to suffer from declining profits. In response, McDonald's began to offer its breakfast menu all day starting in 2015. At first, the launch was unpopular with franchisees who claimed that the changes caused service to slow down. However, the plan paid off with CNBC reporting that the company's fourth quarter earning \"easily topped analysts' forecasts\".\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                "Ray Kroc\n\nRaymond Albert \"Ray\" Kroc (October 5, 1902 – January 14, 1984) was an American businessman. He joined the California company McDonald's in 1954, just a few months after the McDonald brothers had branched out from their original 1940 operation in San Bernardino, with Kroc turning the chain into a nationwide and eventually global franchise, making it the most successful fast food corporation in the world. Controversially, Kroc would present himself as the founder of McDonald's during his later life. Kroc was included in \"\", and amassed a fortune during his lifetime. He owned the San Diego Padres baseball team from 1974 until his death in 1984.\n\nKroc was born on October 5, 1902 in Oak Park, Illinois, near Chicago, to parents of Czech origin, Rose Mary (Hrach) and Alois \"Louis\" Kroc. His father was from the village of Břasy near Plzeň, Bohemia (now the Czech Republic). The elder Kroc had made a fortune speculating on land during the 1920s, only to lose everything with the stock market crash in 1929.\n\nRay Kroc grew up and spent most of his life in Oak Park. During World War I, he lied about his age and became a Red Cross ambulance driver at 15. The war, however, ended shortly after. During the Depression, Kroc worked a variety of jobs selling paper cups, as a real estate agent in Florida, and sometimes playing piano in bands.\n\nAfter World War II, Kroc found employment as a milk shake mixer salesman for the foodservice equipment manufacturer Prince Castle. When Prince Castle Multi-Mixer sales plummeted because of competition from lower-priced Hamilton Beach products, Kroc was impressed by Richard and Maurice McDonald who had purchased eight of his Multi-Mixers for their San Bernardino, California store, and visited them in 1954. Kroc became convinced that the concept and design of this small chain had the potential to expand across the nation.\n\nHaving been in approximately one thousand kitchens, Kroc believed the McDonald brothers had the best-run operation he had ever seen. The restaurant was clean, modern, mechanized, and the staff professional and well-groomed. Roadside hamburger restaurants were more often than not hangouts for motorcycle gangs and rebellious teenagers, and Kroc saw in McDonald's a better vision for a restaurant. He once said \"In my experience, hamburger joints are nothing but jukeboxes, pay phones, smoking rooms, and guys in leather jackets. I wouldn't take my wife to such a place and you wouldn't take your wife either.\"\n\nKroc opened the first McDonald's franchised under his partnership with the McDonald brothers in Des Plaines, Illinois.\n\nAfter finalizing the franchise agreement with the McDonald brothers, Kroc sent a letter to Walt Disney. They had met as ambulance attendant trainees at Sound Beach, Connecticut during World War I. Kroc wrote, \"I have very recently taken over the national franchise of the McDonald's system. I would like to inquire if there may be an opportunity for a McDonald's in your Disney Development\". According to one account, Disney agreed under stipulation to increase fries from ten cents to fifteen cents, allowing himself the profit. Kroc refused to gouge his loyal customers, leaving Disneyland to open without a McDonald's restaurant. Journalist Eric Schlosser, writing in his book \"Fast Food Nation\", believes that this is a doctored retelling of the transaction by some McDonald's marketing executives. Most probably, the proposal was returned without approval.\n\nKroc has been credited with making a number of innovative changes in the food-service franchise model. Chief among them was the sale of only single-store franchises instead of selling larger, territorial franchises which was common in the industry at the time. Kroc recognized that the sale of exclusive licenses for large markets was the quickest way for a franchisor to make money, but he also saw in the practice a loss in the franchisor's ability to exert control over the course and direction of a chain’s development. Above all else, Kroc wanted uniformity in service and quality among all of the McDonald’s locations. Without the ability to influence franchisees, Kroc knew that it would be difficult to achieve that goal. By granting a franchisee the right to only one store location at a time, Kroc retained for the franchise some measure of control over the franchisee (or at least those desiring to someday own the rights to another store).\n\nKroc's policies for McDonald's included establishing locations only in suburban areas, not in downtowns since the seedy underbelly of urban areas might eat in them after the main business hours were over. Restaurants were to be kept properly sanitized at all times, and the staff must be clean, properly groomed and polite to children. The food was to be of a strictly fixed, standardized content and restaurants were not allowed to deviate from specifications in any way. There was to be no waste of anything, Kroc insisted; every condiment container was to be scraped completely clean. No cigarette machines or pinball games were allowed in any McDonald's. \n\nKroc had difficulty enforcing his strict policies in the beginning as several California franchisees began offering things that were not supposed to be on the menu, altering prices, the recipes, or committing various other offenses. For a time, Kroc held off on licensing more McDonald's in California, preferring to concentrate on the Midwest, where he believed people were more conservative and less likely to challenge authority.\n\nKroc had a contemptuous opinion of MBAs and people who attended business school or obtained college degrees in management, believing they lacked competitive drive or market savvy. For a time, McDonald's had a policy of not hiring MBAs. He also forbade McDonald's executives to have secretaries and required them to answer their own phones. They were expected to follow dress and grooming rules similar to those of rank-and-file employees in the restaurants, which included no scruffy beards (though carefully groomed facial hair was allowed), and they received regular company pamphlets extolling thriftiness and financial responsibility both at the company and in their personal lives.\n\nDuring the 1960s, a wave of new fast food chains appeared that copied McDonald's model, including Burger King, Burger Chef, Arbys, KFC, and Hardee's. Kroc spoke of the competition with contempt, saying that they did not offer the same quality of food, service, affordable prices, or sanitation as McDonald's. He resisted joining any fast food trade organizations for fear of giving away his business secrets.\n\nKroc became frustrated with the McDonald brothers' desire to maintain a small number of restaurants. The brothers also consistently told Kroc he could not make changes to things such as the original blueprint (building codes were different in Illinois than in California), but despite Kroc's pleas, the brothers never sent any formal letters that legally allowed the changes in the chain. In 1961, he bought the company for $2.7 million ($ million today), calculated so as to ensure each brother $1 million ($ million today) after taxes. Obtaining the funds for the buyout was difficult due to existing debt from expansion. However, Harry Sonneborn, whom Kroc referred to as his \"financial wizard\", was able to raise the required funds.\n\nAt the closing table, Kroc became annoyed that the brothers would not transfer to him the real estate and rights to the original San Bernardino location. The brothers had told Kroc they were giving the operation, property and all, to the founding employees. In his anger, Kroc later opened a new McDonald's restaurant near the original McDonald's, which had been renamed \"The Big M\" because the brothers had neglected to retain rights to the name. \"The Big M\" closed six years later. It is alleged that as part of the buyout Kroc promised, based on a handshake agreement, to continue the annual 0.5% royalty of the original agreement, but there is no evidence of this beyond a claim by a nephew of the McDonald brothers. Neither of the brothers publicly expressed disappointment over the deal. Speaking to someone about the buyout, Richard McDonald reportedly said that he had no regrets.\n\nKroc maintained the assembly line \"Speedee Service System\" for hamburger preparation that was introduced by the McDonald brothers in 1948. He standardized operations, ensuring every burger would taste the same in every restaurant. He set strict rules for franchisees on how the food was to be made, portion sizes, cooking methods and times, and packaging. Kroc also rejected cost-cutting measures like using soybean filler in the hamburger patties. These strict rules also were applied to customer service standards with such mandates that money be refunded to clients whose orders were not correct or to customers who had to wait more than five minutes for their food.\n\nBy the time of Kroc's death, the chain had 7,500 outlets in the United States and 31 other countries and territories. The total system-wide sales of its restaurants were more than $8 billion in 1983, and his personal fortune amounted to some $600 million.\n\nKroc retired from running McDonald's in 1974. While he was looking for new challenges, he decided to get back into baseball, his lifelong favorite sport, when he learned that the San Diego Padres were for sale. The team had been conditionally sold to Joseph Danzansky, a Washington, D.C. grocery-chain owner, who planned to move the Padres to Washington. However, the sale was tied up in lawsuits when Kroc purchased the team for $12 million, keeping the team in San Diego. In Kroc's first year of ownership in 1974, the Padres lost 102 games, yet drew over one million in attendance, the standard of box office success in the major leagues during that era. Their previous top attendance was 644,772 in 1972. The \"San Diego Union\" said Kroc was \"above all, a fan of his team\". On April 9, 1974, while the Padres were on the brink of losing a 9–5 decision to the Houston Astros in the season opener at San Diego Stadium, Kroc took the public address microphone in front of 39,083 fans.\n\"I’ve never seen such stupid ballplaying in my life,\" he said. The crowd cheered in approval. In 1979, Kroc's public interest in future free agent players Graig Nettles and Joe Morgan drew a $100,000 fine from Commissioner Bowie Kuhn. Frustrated with the team, he handed over operations of the team to his son-in-law, Ballard Smith. \"There's more future in hamburgers than baseball,\" Kroc said.\n\nAfter his death, the Padres in 1984 wore a special patch with Kroc's initials, RAK. They won the NL pennant that year and played in the 1984 World Series. Kroc was inducted posthumously as part of the inaugural class of the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nThe Kroc Foundation supported research, treatment and education about various medical conditions, such as alcoholism, diabetes, arthritis and multiple sclerosis. It is best known for establishing the Ronald McDonald House, a nonprofit organization that provides free housing for parents close to medical facilities where their children are receiving treatment.\n\nA lifelong Republican, Kroc believed firmly in self-reliance and staunchly opposed government welfare and the New Deal. He generated significant controversy for donating $255,000 to Richard Nixon's reelection campaign in 1972, and was accused by some, notably Senator Harrison Williams, of making the donation to influence Nixon to veto a minimum wage bill making its way through Congress.\n\nIn 1980, following a stroke, Kroc entered an alcohol rehabilitation facility. He died four years later of heart failure at a hospital in San Diego, California, on January 14, 1984, at the age of 81, and was buried at the El Camino Memorial Park in Sorrento Valley, San Diego.\n\nKroc's first two marriages to Ethel Fleming (1922–1961) and Jane Dobbins Green (1963–1968) ended in divorce. His third wife, Joan Kroc, was a philanthropist who significantly increased her charitable contributions after Kroc's death, donating to a variety of causes that interested her, such as the promotion of peace and nuclear nonproliferation. Upon her death in 2003, her remaining $2.7 billion estate was distributed among a number of nonprofit organizations, including $1.5 billion donation to The Salvation Army to build 26 Kroc Centers, community centers serving underserved neighborhoods, throughout the country.\n\nKroc's acquisition of the McDonald's franchise as well as his \"Kroc-style\" business tactics are the subject of Mark Knopfler's 2004 song \"Boom, Like That.\"\n\nKroc co-authored the book \"Grinding it Out\" released in 1977. It received positive reviews including from critic Ryan Stewman: \"Salesman to salesperson, get the book and read it. You should be inspired by it. Ray was one of us who made it!\"\n\nKroc is portrayed by Michael Keaton in the 2016 John Lee Hancock film \"The Founder\". The movie depicts Kroc's franchise development, nationwide expansion, and ultimate acquisition of McDonald's, while being critical of his treatment of the founding McDonald's brothers.\n\n\n\n",
                "McDonald's\n\nMcDonald's is a fast food company that was founded in 1940 as a restaurant operated by Richard and Maurice McDonald, in San Bernardino, California, United States. They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand. The first time a McDonald's franchise used the Golden Arches logo was in 1953 at a location in Phoenix, Arizona. In 1955, Ray Kroc, a businessman, joined the company as a franchise agent and proceeded to purchase the chain from the McDonald brothers. McDonald's had its original headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but has approved plans to move its global headquarters to Chicago by 2018.\n\nMcDonald's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue, serving over 69 million customers daily in over 100 countries across approximately 36,900 outlets as of 2016. Although McDonald's is known for its hamburgers, they also sell cheeseburgers, chicken products, french fries, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food, the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit. The McDonald's Corporation revenues come from the rent, royalties, and fees paid by the franchisees, as well as sales in company-operated restaurants. According to a BBC report published in 2012, McDonald's is the world's second largest private employer (behind Walmart with 1.9 million employees), 1.5 million of whom work for franchises.\n\nThe siblings Richard and Maurice McDonald opened in 1940 the first McDonald's at 1398 North E Street at West 14th Street in San Bernardino, California (at ) but it was not the McDonald's recognizable today; Ray Kroc made changes to the brothers business that modernized it. The brothers introduced the \"Speedee Service System\" in 1948, putting into expanded use the principles of the modern fast-food restaurant that their predecessor White Castle had put into practice more than two decades earlier.. The original mascot of McDonald's was a chef hat on top of a hamburger who was referred to as \"Speedee\". In 1962, the Golden Arches replaced Speedee as the universal mascot. The symbol, Ronald McDonald, was introduced in 1965. The clown, Ronald McDonald, appeared in advertising to target their audience of children.\nOn May 4, 1961, McDonald's first filed for a U.S. trademark on the name \"McDonald's\" with the description \"Drive-In Restaurant Services\", which continues to be renewed. By September 13, 1961, McDonald's under the guidance of Ray Kroc, filed for a trademark on a new logo—an overlapping, double-arched \"M\" symbol. But before the double arches, McDonald's used the a single arch for the architecture of their buildings. Although the \"Golden Arches\" logo appeared in various forms, the present version was not used until November 18, 1968, when the company was favored a U.S. trademark.\n\nThe present corporation credits its founding to franchised businessman Ray Kroc in on April 15, 1955, this was in fact the ninth opened McDonald's restaurant overall; although this location was destroyed and rebuilt in 1984. Kroc later purchased the McDonald brothers' equity in the company and begun the companies worldwide reach. Kroc was recorded as being an aggressive business partner, driving the McDonald brothers out of the industry.\n\nKroc and the McDonald brothers fought for control of the business, as documented in Kroc's autobiography. The San Bernardino restaurant was eventually torn down (1971, according to Juan Pollo) and the site was sold to the Juan Pollo chain in 1976. This area now serves as headquarters for the Juan Pollo chain, and a McDonald's and Route 66 museum. With the expansion of McDonald's into many international markets, the company has become a symbol of globalization and the spread of the American way of life. Its prominence has also made it a frequent topic of public debates about obesity, corporate ethics, and consumer responsibility.\n\nMcDonald's restaurants are found in 120 countries and territories around the world and serve 68 million customers each day. McDonald's operates 36,899 restaurants worldwide, employing more than 375,000 people as of the end of 2016. There are currently a total of 5,669 company-owned locations and 31,230 franchised locations, which includes 21,559 locations franchised to conventional franchisees, 6,300 locations licensed to developmental licensees, and 3,371 locations licensed to foreign affiliates, primarily Japan.\n\nFocusing on its core brand, McDonald's began divesting itself of other chains it had acquired during the 1990s. The company owned a majority stake in Chipotle Mexican Grill until October 2006, when McDonald's fully divested from Chipotle through a stock exchange. Until December 2003, it also owned Donatos Pizza, and it owned a small share of Aroma Cafe from 1999 to 2001. On August 27, 2007, McDonald's sold Boston Market to Sun Capital Partners.\n\nNotably, McDonald's has increased shareholder dividends for 25 consecutive years, making it one of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. In October 2012, its monthly sales fell for the first time in nine years. In 2014, its quarterly sales fell for the first time in seventeen years, when its sales dropped for the entirety of 1997.\n\nIn the United States, it is reported that drive-throughs account for 70 percent of sales. McDonald's closed down 184 restaurants in the United States in 2015, which was 59 more than what they planned to open. This move was also the first time McDonald's had a net decrease in the number of locations in the United States since 1970.\n\nThe company currently owns all the land, valued at an estimated $16 to $18 billion, on which its restaurants are situated. The company earns a significant portion of its revenue from rental payments from franchisees. These rent payments rose 26 percent between 2010 and 2015, accounting for one-fifth of the company's total revenue at the end of the period. In recent times, there have been calls to spin off the company's US holdings into a potential real estate investment trust, but the company announced at its investor conference on November 10, 2015, that this would not happen. The CEO, Steve Easterbrook discussed that pursuing the REIT option would pose too large a risk to the company's business model.\nThe United Kingdom and Ireland business model is different from the U.S, in that fewer than 30 percent of restaurants are franchised, with the majority under the ownership of the company. McDonald's trains its franchisees and management at Hamburger University in Oak Brook, Illinois. In other countries, McDonald's restaurants are operated by joint ventures of McDonald's Corporation and other, local entities or governments.\n\nAccording to \"Fast Food Nation\" by Eric Schlosser (2001), nearly one in eight workers in the U.S. have at some time been employed by McDonald's. Employees are encouraged by McDonald's Corp. to maintain their health by singing along to their favorite songs in order to relieve stress, attending church services in order to have a lower blood pressure, and taking two vacations annually in order to reduce risk for myocardial infarction. \"Fast Food Nation\" also states that McDonald's is the largest private operator of playgrounds in the U.S., as well as the single largest purchaser of beef, pork, potatoes, and apples. The selection of meats McDonald's uses varies to some extent based on the culture of the host country.\n\nThe McDonald's headquarters complex, McDonald's Plaza, is located in Oak Brook, Illinois. It sits on the site of the former headquarters and stabling area of Paul Butler, the founder of Oak Brook. McDonald's moved into the Oak Brook facility from an office within the Chicago Loop in 1971.\n\nOn June 13, 2016, McDonald's confirmed plans to move its global headquarters to Chicago's West Loop neighborhood in the Near West Side. The 608,000-square-foot structure will be built on the former site of Harpo Productions (where the \"Oprah Winfrey Show\" and several other Harpo productions taped) and open in early 2018.\n\nAs of November 2014, the board of directors had the following members:\n\nOn March 1, 2015, after being chief brand officer of McDonald's and its former head in the UK and northern Europe, Steve Easterbrook became CEO, succeeding Don Thompson, who stepped down on January 28, 2015.\n\nMcDonald's has become emblematic of globalization, sometimes referred to as the \"McDonaldization\" of society. \"The Economist\" newspaper uses the \"Big Mac Index\": the comparison of a Big Mac's cost in various world currencies can be used to informally judge these currencies' purchasing power parity. Switzerland has the most expensive Big Mac in the world as of July 2015, while the country with the least expensive Big Mac is India (albeit for a Maharaja Mac—the next cheapest Big Mac is Hong Kong).\n\nThomas Friedman once said that no country with a McDonald's had gone to war with another. However, the \"Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention\" is not strictly true. Exceptions are the 1989 United States invasion of Panama, NATO's bombing of Serbia in 1999, the 2006 Lebanon War, and the 2008 South Ossetia war. McDonald's suspended operations in its corporate-owned stores in Crimea after Russia annexed the region in 2014. On August 20, 2014, as tensions between the United States and Russia strained over events in Ukraine, and the resultant U.S. sanctions, the Russian government temporarily shut down four McDonald's outlets in Moscow, citing sanitary concerns. The company has operated in Russia since 1990 and at August 2014 had 438 stores across the country. On August 23, 2014, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich ruled out any government move to ban McDonald's and dismissed the notion that the temporary closures had anything to do with the sanctions.\n\nSome observers have suggested that the company should be given credit for increasing the standard of service in markets that it enters. A group of anthropologists in a study entitled \"Golden Arches East\" looked at the impact McDonald's had on East Asia and Hong Kong, in particular. When it opened in Hong Kong in 1975, McDonald's was the first restaurant to consistently offer clean restrooms, driving customers to demand the same of other restaurants and institutions. McDonald's has taken to partnering up with Sinopec, the second largest oil company in the People's Republic of China, as it takes advantage of the country's growing use of personal vehicles by opening numerous drive-thru restaurants. McDonald's has opened a McDonald's restaurant and McCafé on the underground premises of the French fine arts museum, The Louvre.\n\nThe company stated it would open vegetarian-only restaurants in India by mid-2013. Foreign restaurants are banned in Bermuda, with the exception of KFC, which was present before the current law was passed. Therefore, there are no McDonald's in Bermuda.\n\nOn January 9, 2017, 80% of the franchise rights in the mainland China and in Hong Kong were sold for US$2.080 billion to a consortium of CITIC Limited (for 32%) and private equity funds managed by CITIC Capital (for 20%) and Carlyle (for 20%), which CITIC Limited and CITIC Capital would also formed a joint venture to own the stake.\n\nMcDonald's predominantly sells hamburgers, various types of chicken, chicken sandwiches, French fries, soft drinks, breakfast items, and desserts. In most markets, McDonald's offers salads and vegetarian items, wraps and other localized fare. On a seasonal basis, McDonald's offers the McRib sandwich. Some speculate the seasonality of the McRib adds to its appeal.\n\nProducts are offered as either \"eat-in\" (where the customer opts to eat in the restaurant) or \"take-out\" (where the customer opts to take the food for consumption off the premises). \"Eat-in\" meals are provided on a plastic tray with a paper insert on the floor of the tray. \"Take-out\" meals are usually delivered with the contents enclosed in a distinctive McDonald's-branded brown paper bag. In both cases, the individual items are wrapped or boxed as appropriate.\n\nSince Steve Easterbrook became CEO of the company, McDonald's has streamlined the menu which in the United States contained nearly 200 items. The company has also looked to introduce healthier options, and removed high-fructose corn syrup from hamburger buns. The company has also removed artificial preservatives from Chicken McNuggets, replacing chicken skin, safflower oil and citric acid found in Chicken McNuggets with pea starch, rice starch and powdered lemon juice.\n\nRestaurants in several countries, particularly in Asia, serve soup. This local deviation from the standard menu is a characteristic for which the chain is particularly known, and one which is employed either to abide by regional food taboos (such as the religious prohibition of beef consumption in India) or to make available foods with which the regional market is more familiar (such as the sale of McRice in Indonesia, or Ebi (prawn) Burger in Singapore and Japan).\n\nIn Germany and some other Western European countries, McDonald's sells beer. In New Zealand, McDonald's sells meat pies, after the local affiliate partially relaunched the Georgie Pie fast food chain it bought out in 1996.\n\nIn the United States, after limited trials on a regional basis, McDonald's plans to offer an all-day breakfast menu whenever its restaurants are open, although eggs cannot be cooked at the same time on the same equipment as hamburgers due to different temperature requirements.\n\nMost standalone McDonald's restaurants offer both counter service and drive-through service, with indoor and sometimes outdoor seating. Drive-Thru, Auto-Mac, Pay and Drive, or \"McDrive\" as it is known in many countries, often has separate stations for placing, paying for, and picking up orders, though the latter two steps are frequently combined; it was first introduced in Arizona in 1975, following the lead of other fast-food chains. The first such restaurant in Britain opened at Fallowfield, Manchester in 1986.\n\nIn some countries, \"McDrive\" locations near highways offer no counter service or seating. In contrast, locations in high-density city neighborhoods often omit drive-through service. There are also a few locations, located mostly in downtown districts, that offer a \"Walk-Thru\" service in place of Drive-Thru.\n\nMcCafé is a café-style accompaniment to McDonald's restaurants and is a concept created by McDonald's Australia (also known, and marketed, as \"Macca's\" in Australia), starting with Melbourne in 1993. As of 2016, most McDonald's in Australia have McCafés located within the existing McDonald's restaurant. In Tasmania, there are McCafés in every restaurant, with the rest of the states quickly following suit. After upgrading to the new McCafé look and feel, some Australian restaurants have noticed up to a 60 percent increase in sales. At the end of 2003, there were over 600 McCafés worldwide.\n\nFrom 2015–2016, McDonald's tried a new gourmet burger service/restaurant concept based on other gourmet restaurants such as \"Shake Shack\" and \"Grill'd\". It was rolled out for the first time in Australia during the early months of 2015 and expanded to China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Arabia and New Zealand, with ongoing trials in the US market. In dedicated \"Create Your Taste\" (CYT) kiosks, customers could choose all ingredients including type of bun and meat along with optional extras. In late 2015 the Australian CYT service introduced CYT salads.\n\nAfter a person had ordered, McDonald's advised that wait times were between 10–15 minutes. When the food was ready, trained crew ('hosts') brought the food to the customer's table. Instead of McDonald's usual cardboard and plastic packaging, CYT food was presented on wooden boards, fries in wire baskets and salads in china bowls with metal cutlery. A higher price applied.\n\nIn November 2016, Create Your Taste was replaced by a \"Signature Crafted Recipes\" program designed to be more efficient and less expensive.\n\nSome locations are connected to gas stations/convenience stores, while others called McExpress have limited seating and/or menu or may be located in a shopping mall. Other McDonald's are located in Walmart stores. McStop is a location targeted at truckers and travelers which may have services found at truck stops.\n\nIn Sweden, customers who order a happy meal can use the meal's container for a pair of happy goggles. The company created a game for the goggles known as \"Slope Stars.\" McDonald's predicts happy goggles will continue in other countries. In the Netherlands, McDonald's has introduced McTrax that doubles as a recording studio; it reacts to touch. They can create their own beats with a synth and tweak sounds with special effects.\n\nThe first kosher McDonald's was established in 1997 at the Abasto de Buenos Aires mall in Buenos Aires, Argentina. There are also many kosher branches in Israel.\n\nMcDonald's playgrounds are called McDonald's PlayPlace. Some McDonald's in suburban areas and certain cities feature large indoor or outdoor playgrounds. The first PlayPlace with the familiar crawl-tube design with ball pits and slides was introduced in 1987 in the US, with many more being constructed soon after.\n\nMcDonald's Next use open-concept design and offer \"Create Your Taste\" digital ordering. The concept store also offering free mobile device charging and table service after 6:00 pm. The first store open in Hong Kong in December 2015.\n\nIn 2006, McDonald's introduced its \"Forever Young\" brand by redesigning all of its restaurants, the first major redesign since the 1970s.\n\nThe goal of the redesign is to be more like a coffee shop, similar to Starbucks. The design includes wooden tables, faux-leather chairs, and muted colors; the red was muted to terracotta, the yellow was shifted to golden for a more \"sunny\" look, and olive and sage green were also added.\n\nTo create a warmer look, the restaurants have less plastic and more brick and wood, with modern hanging lights to produce a softer glow. Many restaurants now feature free Wi-Fi and flat-screen TVs. Other upgrades include double drive-thrus, flat roofs instead of the angled red roofs, and replacing fiber glass with wood. Also, instead of the familiar golden arches, the restaurants now feature \"semi-swooshes\" (half of a golden arch), similar to the Nike swoosh.\n\nMcDonald's began banning smoking in 1994 when it banned smoking within its 1,400 wholly owned restaurants.\n\nSince the late 1990s, McDonald's has attempted to replace employees with electronic kiosks which would perform actions such taking orders and accepting money. In 1999, McDonald's first tested \"E-Clerks\" in suburban Chicago, Illinois, and Wyoming, Michigan, with the devices being able to \"save money on live staffers\" and attracting larger purchase amounts than average employees.\n\nIn 2013, the University of Oxford estimated that in the succeeding decades, there was a 92% probability of food preparation and serving to become automated in fast food establishments. By 2016, McDonald's \"Create Your Taste\" electronic kiosks were seen in some restaurants internationally where customers could custom order meals. As employees pushed for higher wages in the late-2010s, some believed that fast food companies such as McDonald's would use the devices to cut costs for employing individuals.\n\nOn August 5, 2013, \"The Guardian\" revealed that 90 percent of McDonald's UK workforce are on zero hour contracts, making it possibly the largest such private sector employer in the country. A study released by Fast Food Forward conducted by Anzalone Liszt Grove Research showed that approximately 84 percent of all fast food employees working in New York City in April 2013 had been paid less than their legal wages by their employers.\n\nFrom 2007 to 2011, fast food workers in the US drew an average of $7 billion of public assistance annually resulting from receiving low wages. The McResource website advised employees to break their food into smaller pieces to feel fuller, seek refunds for unopened holiday purchases, sell possessions online for quick cash, and to \"quit complaining\" as \"stress hormone levels rise by 15 percent after ten minutes of complaining.\" In December 2013, McDonald's shut down the McResource website amidst negative publicity and criticism. McDonald's plans to continue an internal telephone help line through which its employees can obtain advice on work and life problems.\n\nLiberal thinktank the Roosevelt Institute accuses some McDonald's restaurants of actually paying less than the minimum wage to entry positions due to 'rampant' wage theft. In South Korea, McDonald's pays part-time employees $5.50 an hour and is accused of paying less with arbitrary schedules adjustments and pay delays. In late 2015, Anonymous aggregated data collected by Glassdoor suggests that McDonald's in the United States pays entry-level employees between $7.25 an hour and $11 an hour, with an average of $8.69 an hour. Shift managers get paid an average of $10.34 an hour. Assistant managers get paid an average of $11.57 an hour. McDonald's CEO, Steve Easterbrook, currently earns an annual salary of $1,100,000.\n\nMcDonald's workers have on occasions decided to strike over pay, with most of the employees on strike seeking to be paid $15.00. When interviewed about the strikes occurring, former McDonald's CEO Ed Rensi stated: \"It's cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who's inefficient making $15 an hour bagging french fries\" with Rensi explaining that increasing employee wages could possibly take away from entry-level jobs. However, according to Easterbrook, increasing wages and benefits for workers saw a 6% increase in customer satisfaction when comparing 2015's first quarter data to the first quarter of 2016, with greater returns seen as a result.\n\nIn September 2017, two British McDonald's stores agreed to a strike over zero hours contracts for staff. Picket lines were formed around the two stores in Crayford and Cambridge. The strike was supported by the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nIn March 2015, McDonald's workers in 19 US cities filed 28 health and safety complaints with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration which allege that low staffing, lack of protective gear, poor training and pressure to work fast has resulted in injuries. The complaints also allege that, because of a lack of first aid supplies, workers were told by management to treat burn injuries with condiments such as mayonnaise and mustard. The Fight for $15 labor organization aided the workers in filing the complaints.\n\nIn 2015, McDonald's pledged to stop using eggs from battery cage facilities by 2025. Since McDonald's purchases over 2 billion eggs per year or 4 percent of eggs produced in the United States, the switch is expected to have a major impact on the egg industry and is part of a general trend toward cage-free eggs driven by consumer concern over the harsh living conditions of hens. The aviary systems from which the new eggs will be sourced are troubled by much higher mortality rates, as well as introducing environmental and worker safety problems. The high hen mortality rate, which is more than double that of battery cage systems, will require new research to mitigate. The facilities also have higher ammonia levels due to faeces being kicked up into the air. Producers raised concerns about the production cost, which is expected to increase by 36 percent.\n\nMcDonald's continues to source pork from facilities that use gestation crates, and in 2012 pledged to phase them out.\n\nMcDonald's has for decades maintained an extensive advertising campaign. In addition to the usual media (television, radio, and newspaper), the company makes significant use of billboards and signage, sponsors sporting events ranging from Little League to the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games. Television has played a central role in the company's advertising strategy. To date, McDonald's has used 23 different slogans in United States advertising, as well as a few other slogans for select countries and regions.\n\nMcDonald's and NASA explored an advertising agreement for a planned mission to the asteroid 449 Hamburga; however, the spacecraft was eventually cancelled.\n\nMcDonald's is the title sponsor of the McDonald's All-American Game, all-star basketball games played each year for American and Canadian boys' and girls' high school basketball graduates.\n\nMcHappy Day is an annual event at McDonald's, where a percentage of the day's sales go to charity. It is the signature fundraising event for Ronald McDonald House Charities.\n\nIn 2007, it was celebrated in 17 countries: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, the United States, Finland, France, Guatemala, Hungary, England, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Uruguay.\n\nAccording to the Australian McHappy Day website, McHappy Day raised $20.4 million in 2009. The goal for 2010 was $20.8 million.\n\nIn 1995, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital received an anonymous letter postmarked in Dallas, Texas, containing a $1 million winning McDonald's Monopoly game piece. McDonald's officials came to the hospital, accompanied by a representative from the accounting firm Arthur Andersen, who examined the card under a jeweler's eyepiece, handled it with plastic gloves, and verified it as a winner. Although game rules prohibited the transfer of prizes, McDonald's waived the rule and has made the annual $50,000 annuity payments, even after learning that the piece was sent by an individual involved in an embezzlement scheme intended to defraud McDonald's (see McDonald's Monopoly).\n\nMcRefugees are poor people in Hong Kong, Japan, and China who use McDonald's 24-hour restaurants as a temporary hostel. One in five of Hong Kong's population lives below the poverty line. The rise of McRefugees was first documented by photographer Suraj Katra in 2013.\n\nIn 1990, activists from a small group known as London Greenpeace (no connection to the international group Greenpeace) distributed leaflets entitled \"What's wrong with McDonald's?\", criticizing its environmental, health, and labor record. The corporation wrote to the group demanding they desist and apologize, and, when two of the activists refused to back down, sued them for libel in one of the longest cases in British civil law. A documentary film of the McLibel Trial has been shown in several countries.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Phil Sokolof, a millionaire businessman who had suffered a heart attack at the age of 43, took out full-page newspaper ads in New York, Chicago, and other large cities accusing McDonald's menu of being a threat to American health, and asking them to stop using beef tallow to cook their french fries.\n\nDespite the objections of McDonald's, the term \"McJob\" was added to \"Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\" in 2003. The term was defined as \"a low-paying job that requires little skill and provides little opportunity for advancement\".\n\nIn 2001, Eric Schlosser's book \"Fast Food Nation\" included criticism of the business practices of McDonald's. Among the critiques were allegations that McDonald's (along with other companies within the fast food industry) uses its political influence to increase its profits at the expense of people's health and the social conditions of its workers. The book also brought into question McDonald's advertisement techniques in which it targets children. While the book did mention other fast-food chains, it focused primarily on McDonald's.\n\nIn 2002, vegetarian groups, largely Hindu and Buddhist, successfully sued McDonald's for misrepresenting its French fries as vegetarian, when they contained beef broth.\n\nMorgan Spurlock's 2004 documentary film \"Super Size Me\" claimed that McDonald's food was contributing to the increase of obesity in society and that the company was failing to provide nutritional information about its food for its customers. Six weeks after the film premiered, McDonald's announced that it was eliminating the super size option, and was creating the adult Happy Meal.\nIn 2006, an unsanctioned McDonald's Videogame was released online. It is parody of the business practices of the corporate giant, taking the guise of a tycoon style business simulation game. In the game, the player plays the role of a McDonald's CEO, choosing whether or not to use controversial practices like genetically altered cow feed, plowing over rainforests, and corrupting public officials. McDonald's issued a statement distancing itself from the game.\n\nIn January 2014, it was reported that McDonald's was accused of having used a series of tax maneuvers to avoid taxes in France. The company confirmed that tax authorities had visited McDonald's French headquarters in Paris but insisted that it had not done anything wrong, saying, \"McDonald's firmly denies the accusation made by L'Express according to which McDonald's supposedly hid part of its revenue from taxes in France.\"\n\nIn response to public pressure, McDonald's has sought to include more healthy choices in its menu and has introduced a new slogan to its recruitment posters: \"Not bad for a McJob\". The word McJob, first attested in the mid-1980s and later popularized by Canadian novelist Douglas Coupland in his book \"\", has become a buzz word for low-paid, unskilled work with few prospects or benefits and little security. McDonald's disputes this definition of McJob. In 2007, the company launched an advertising campaign with the slogan \"Would you like a career with that?\" on Irish television, asserting that its jobs have good prospects.\n\nIn an effort to respond to growing consumer awareness of food provenance, the fast-food chain changed its supplier of both coffee beans and milk. UK chief executive Steve Easterbrook said: \"British consumers are increasingly interested in the quality, sourcing, and ethics of the food and drink they buy\". In a bid to tap into the ethical consumer market, McDonald's switched to using coffee beans taken from stocks that are certified by the Rainforest Alliance, a conservation group. Additionally, in response to pressure, McDonald's UK started using organic milk supplies for its bottled milk and hot drinks, although it still uses conventional milk in its milkshakes, and in all of its dairy products in the United States. According to a report published by \"Farmers Weekly\" in 2007, the quantity of milk used by McDonald's could have accounted for as much as 5 percent of the UK's organic milk output.\n\nMcDonald's announced on May 22, 2008, that, in the United States and Canada, it would switch to using cooking oil that contains no trans fats for its french fries, and canola-based oil with corn and soy oils, for its baked items, pies and cookies, by year's end.\n\nWith regard to acquiring chickens from suppliers who use CAK/CAS methods of slaughter, McDonald's says that it needs to see more research \"to help determine whether any CAS system in current use is optimal from an animal welfare perspective.\"\n\nIn April 2008, McDonald's announced that 11 of its Sheffield, England restaurants have been engaged in a biomass trial that had cut its waste and carbon footprint by half in the area. In this trial, wastes from the restaurants were collected by Veolia Environmental Services and were used to produce energy at a power plant. McDonald's plans to expand this project, although the lack of biomass power plants in the United States will prevent this plan from becoming a national standard anytime soon. In addition, in Europe, McDonald's has been recycling vegetable grease by converting it to fuel for its diesel trucks.\n\nMcDonald's has been using a corn-based bioplastic to produce containers for some of its products. The environmental benefits of this technology are controversial, with critics noting that biodegradation is slow, produces greenhouse gases and that contamination of traditional plastic waste streams with bioplastics can complicate recycling efforts.\n\nIn 1990, McDonald's worked with the Environmental Defense Fund to stop using \"clam shell\" shaped styrofoam food containers to house its food products. 20 years later, McDonald's announced they would try replacing styrofoam coffee cups with an alternative material.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has recognized McDonald's continuous effort to reduce solid waste by designing more efficient packaging and by promoting the use of recycled-content materials. McDonald's reports that it is committed towards environmental leadership by effectively managing electric energy, by conserving natural resources through recycling and reusing materials, and by addressing water management issues within the restaurant.\n\nIn an effort to reduce energy usage by 25 percent in its restaurants, McDonald's opened a prototype restaurant in Chicago in 2009 with the intention of using the model in its other restaurants throughout the world. Building on past efforts, specifically a restaurant it opened in Sweden in 2000 that was the first to intentionally incorporate green ideas, McDonald's designed the Chicago site to save energy by incorporating old and new ideas such as managing storm water, using skylights for more natural lighting and installing some partitions and tabletops made from recycled goods.\n\nWhen McDonald's received criticism for its environmental policies in the 1970s, it began to make substantial progress in reducing its use of materials. For instance, an \"average meal\" in the 1970s—a Big Mac, fries, and a drink—required 46 grams of packaging; today, it requires only 25 grams, allowing a 46 percent reduction. In addition, McDonald's eliminated the need for intermediate containers for cola by having a delivery system that pumps syrup directly from the delivery truck into storage containers, saving of packaging annually. Overall, weight reductions in packaging and products, as well as the increased usage of bulk packaging ultimately decreased packaging by annually.\n\nMcDonald's has been involved in a number of lawsuits and other legal cases, most of which involved trademark disputes. The company has threatened many food businesses with legal action unless it drops the Mc or Mac from trading names.\n\nOn September 8, 2009, McDonald's Malaysian operations lost a lawsuit to prevent another restaurant calling itself McCurry. McDonald's lost in an appeal to Malaysia's highest court, the Federal Court.\n\nIn April 2007, in Perth, Western Australia, McDonald's pleaded guilty to five charges relating to the employment of children under 15 in one of its outlets and was fined A$8,000.\n\nIn 2016, the Australian Taxation Office revealed that McDonald's Asia-Pacific Consortium had generated $478 million in revenue in 2013–14, but had paid no tax on those earnings whatsoever.\n\nMcDonald's has defended itself in several cases involving workers' rights.\n\nThe longest running legal action of all time in the UK was the McLibel case against 2 defendants who criticized a number of aspects of the company. The trial lasted 10 years and called 130 witnesses. The European Court of Human Rights deemed that the unequal resources of the litigants breached the defendants rights to freedom of speech and biased the trial. The result was widely seen as a \"PR disaster.\"\n\nA famous legal case in the US involving McDonald's was the 1994 decision in \"Liebeck v. McDonald's Restaurants\" where Stella Liebeck was awarded several million dollars after she suffered third-degree burns after spilling a scalding cup of McDonald's coffee on herself.\n\nIn April 2014, it was reported that McDonald's in Europe will use chicken meat that was produced by using genetically modified animal feed. Greenpeace argues that McDonald's saves less than one Eurocent for each chicken burger and goes down a path not desired by its customers.\n\n\n\n",
                "Fast food restaurant\n\nA fast food restaurant, also known as a quick service restaurant (QSR) within the industry, is a specific type of restaurant that serves fast food cuisine and has minimal table service. The food served in fast food restaurants is typically part of a \"meat-sweet diet\", offered from a limited menu, cooked in bulk in advance and kept hot, finished and packaged to order, and usually available for take away, though seating may be provided. Fast food restaurants are typically part of a restaurant chain or franchise operation that provisions standardized ingredients and/or partially prepared foods and supplies to each restaurant through controlled supply channels. The term \"fast food\" was recognized in a dictionary by Merriam–Webster in 1951.\n\nArguably, the first fast food restaurants originated in the United States with White Castle in 1921 and A&W in 1923. Today, American-founded fast food chains such as McDonald's (est. 1940) and KFC (est. 1952) are multinational corporations with outlets across the globe.\n\nVariations on the fast food restaurant concept include fast casual restaurants and catering trucks. Fast casual restaurants have higher sit-in ratios, offering a hybrid between counter-service typical at fast food restaurants and a traditional table service restaurant. Catering trucks (also called food trucks) often park just outside worksites and are popular with factory workers.\n\nSome trace the modern history of fast food in the United States to 7 July 1912, with the opening of a fast food restaurant called the Automat in New York. The Automat was a cafeteria with its pre-prepared foods behind small glass windows and coin-operated slots. Joseph Horn and Frank Hardart had already opened the first Horn & Hardart Automat in Philadelphia in 1902, but their \"Automat\" at Broadway and 13th Street, in New York City, created a sensation. Numerous Automat restaurants were built around the country to deal with the demand. Automats remained extremely popular throughout the 1920s and 1930s. The company also popularized the notion of \"take-out\" food, with their slogan \"Less work for Mother\".\n\nSome historians concur that A&W, which opened in 1921 and began franchising in 1923, was the first fast food restaurant (E. Tavares). Thus, the American company White Castle is sometimes considered the second fast-food outlet in Wichita, Kansas in 1921, selling hamburgers for five cents apiece from its inception and spawning numerous competitors and emulators. What is certain, however, is that White Castle made the first significant effort to standardize the food production in, look of, and operation of fast-food hamburger restaurants. William Ingram's and Walter Anderson's White Castle System created the first fast food supply chain to provide meat, buns, paper goods, and other supplies to their restaurants, pioneered the concept of the multi-state hamburger restaurant chain, standardized the look and construction of the restaurants themselves, and even developed a construction division that manufactured and built the chain's prefabricated restaurant buildings. The McDonald's Speedee Service System and, much later, Ray Kroc's McDonald's outlets and Hamburger University all built on principles, systems and practices that White Castle had already established between 1923 and 1932.\n\nThe hamburger restaurant most associated by the public with the term \"fast food\" was created by two brothers originally from Nashua, New Hampshire. Richard and Maurice McDonald opened a barbecue drive-in in 1940 in the city of San Bernardino, California. After discovering that most of their profits came from hamburgers, the brothers closed their restaurant for three months and reopened it in 1948 as a walk-up stand offering a simple menu of hamburgers, french fries, shakes, coffee, and Coca-Cola, served in disposable paper wrapping. As a result, they could produce hamburgers and fries constantly, without waiting for customer orders, and could serve them immediately; hamburgers cost 15 cents, about half the price at a typical diner. Their streamlined production method, which they named the \"Speedee Service System\" was influenced by the production line innovations of Henry Ford.\n\nBy 1954, The McDonald brothers' stand was restaurant equipment manufacturer Prince Castle's biggest purchaser of milkshake blending machines. Prince Castle salesman Ray Kroc traveled to California to discover why the company had purchased almost a dozen of the units as opposed to the normal one or two found in most restaurants of the time. Enticed by the success of the McDonald's concept, Kroc signed a franchise agreement with the brothers and began opening McDonald's restaurants in Illinois. By 1961, Kroc had bought out the brothers and created what is now the modern McDonald's Corporation. One of the major parts of his business plan was to promote cleanliness of his restaurants to growing groups of Americans that had become aware of food safety issues. As part of his commitment to cleanliness, Kroc often took part in cleaning his own Des Plaines, Illinois outlet by hosing down the garbage cans and scraping gum off the cement. Another concept Kroc added was great swaths of glass which enabled the customer to view the food preparation, a practice still found in chains such as Krispy Kreme. A clean atmosphere was only part of Kroc's grander plan which separated McDonald's from the rest of the competition and attributes to their great success. Kroc envisioned making his restaurants appeal to suburban families.\n\nAt roughly the same time as Kroc was conceiving what eventually became McDonald's Corporation, two Miami, Florida businessmen, James McLamore and David Edgerton, opened a franchise of the predecessor to what is now the international fast food restaurant chain Burger King. McLamore had visited the original McDonald's hamburger stand belonging to the McDonald brothers; sensing potential in their innovative assembly line-based production system, he decided he wanted to open a similar operation of his own. The two partners eventually decided to invest their money in Jacksonville, Florida-based Insta-Burger King. Originally opened in 1953, the founders and owners of the chain, Kieth J. Kramer and his wife's uncle Matthew Burns, opened their first stores around a piece of equipment known as the Insta-Broiler. The Insta-Broiler oven proved so successful at cooking burgers, they required all of their franchises to carry the device. By 1959 McLamore and Edgarton were operating several locations within the Miami-Dade area and were growing at a fast clip. Despite the success of their operation, the partners discovered that the design of the insta-broiler made the unit's heating elements prone to degradation from the drippings of the beef patties. The pair eventually created a mechanized gas grill that avoided the problems by changing the way the meat patties were cooked in the unit. After the original company began to falter in 1959, it was purchased by McLamore and Edgerton who renamed the company Burger King.\n\nWhile fast food restaurants usually have a seating area in which customers can eat the food on the premises, orders are designed to be taken away, and traditional table service is rare. Orders are generally taken and paid for at a wide counter, with the customer waiting by the counter for a tray or container for their food. A \"drive-through\" service can allow customers to order and pick up food from their cars.\n\nNearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten \"on the go\" and often does not require traditional cutlery and is eaten as a finger food. Common menu items at fast food outlets include fish and chips, sandwiches, pitas, hamburgers, fried chicken, french fries, chicken nuggets, tacos, pizza, and ice cream, although many fast food restaurants offer \"slower\" foods like chili, mashed potatoes, and salads.\n\nModern commercial fast food is highly processed and prepared on a large scale from bulk ingredients using standardized cooking and production methods and equipment. It is usually rapidly served in cartons or bags or in a plastic wrapping, in a fashion which reduces operating costs by allowing rapid product identification and counting, promoting longer holding time, avoiding transfer of bacteria, and facilitating order fulfillment. In most fast food operations, menu items are generally made from processed ingredients prepared at central supply facilities and then shipped to individual outlets where they are cooked (usually by grill, microwave, or deep-frying) or assembled in a short amount of time either in anticipation of upcoming orders (i.e., \"to stock\") or in response to actual orders (i.e., \"to order\"). Following standard operating procedures, pre-cooked products are monitored for freshness and disposed of if holding times become excessive. This process ensures a consistent level of product quality, and is key to delivering the order quickly to the customer and avoiding labor and equipment costs in the individual stores.\n\nBecause of commercial emphasis on taste, speed, product safety, uniformity, and low cost, fast food products are made with ingredients formulated to achieve an identifiable flavor, aroma, texture, and \"mouth feel\" and to preserve freshness and control handling costs during preparation and order fulfillment. This requires a high degree of food engineering. The use of additives, including salt, sugar, flavorings and preservatives, and processing techniques may limit the nutritional value of the final product.\n\nA \"value meal\" is a group of menu items offered together at a lower price than they would cost individually. A hamburger, side of fries, and drink commonly constitute a value meal—or \"combo\" depending on the chain. Value meals at fast food restaurants are common as a merchandising tactic to facilitate bundling, up-selling, and price discrimination. Most of the time they can be upgraded to a larger side and drink for a small fee. The perceived creation of a \"discount\" on individual menu items in exchange for the purchase of a \"meal\" is also consistent with the loyalty marketing school of thought.\n\nTo make quick service possible and to ensure accuracy and security, many fast food restaurants have incorporated hospitality point of sale systems. This makes it possible for kitchen crew people to view orders placed at the front counter or drive through in real time. Wireless systems allow orders placed at drive through speakers to be taken by cashiers and cooks. Drive through and walk through configurations will allow orders to be taken at one register and paid at another. Modern point of sale systems can operate on computer networks using a variety of software programs. Sales records can be generated and remote access to computer reports can be given to corporate offices, managers, troubleshooters, and other authorized personnel.\n\nFood service chains partner with food equipment manufacturers to design highly specialized restaurant equipment, often incorporating heat sensors, timers, and other electronic controls into the design. Collaborative design techniques, such as rapid visualization and computer-aided design of restaurant kitchens are now being used to establish equipment specifications that are consistent with restaurant operating and merchandising requirements.\n\nIn the United States, consumers spent about US$110 billion on fast food in 2000 (which increased from $6 billion in 1970). The National Restaurant Association forecasts that fast food restaurants in the US will reach $142 billion in sales in 2006, a 5% increase over 2005. In comparison, the full-service restaurant segment of the food industry is expected to generate $173 billion in sales. Fast food has been losing market share to so-called fast casual restaurants, which offer more robust and expensive cuisines.\n\nMcDonald's, a fast food supplier, opened its first franchised restaurant in the US in 1955 (1974 in the UK). It has become a phenomenally successful enterprise in terms of financial growth, brand-name recognition, and worldwide expansion. Ray Kroc, who bought the franchising license from the McDonald brothers, pioneered concepts which emphasized standardization. He introduced uniform products, identical in all respects at each outlet, to increase sales. Kroc also insisted on cutting food costs as much as possible, eventually using the McDonald's Corporation's size to force suppliers to conform to this ethos.\n\nOther prominent international fast food companies include Burger King, the number two hamburger chain in the world, known for promoting its customized menu offerings (\"Have it Your Way\"). Another international fast food chain is KFC, which sells Chicken-related products and is the number 1 Fast Food company in the People's Republic of China.\n\nMultinational corporations typically modify their menus to cater to local tastes, and most overseas outlets are owned by native franchisees. McDonald's in India, for example, uses chicken and paneer rather than beef and pork in their burgers because Hinduism traditionally forbids eating beef. In Israel some McDonald's restaurants are kosher and respect the Jewish Shabbat; there is also a kosher McDonald's in Argentina. In Egypt, Indonesia, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Singapore, all menu items are halal.\n\nMany fast food operations have more local and regional roots, such as White Castle in the Midwest United States, along with Hardee's (owned by CKE Restaurants, which also owns Carl's Jr., whose locations are primarily on the United States West Coast); Krystal, Bojangles' Famous Chicken 'n Biscuits, Cook Out, and Zaxby's restaurants in the American Southeast; Raising Cane's in Louisiana and other mostly Southern states; Hot 'n Now in Michigan and Wisconsin; In-N-Out Burger (in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and Texas) and Original Tommy's chains in Southern California; Dick's Drive-In in Seattle, Washington and Arctic Circle in Utah and other western states; Halo Burger around Flint, Michigan and Burgerville in the Portland, Oregon area. Also, Whataburger is a popular burger chain in the American South, and Jack in the Box is located in the West and South. Canada pizza chains Topper's Pizza and Pizza Pizza are primarily located in Ontario. Coffee chain Country Style operates only in Ontario, and competes with the famous coffee and donut chain Tim Hortons. Maid-Rite restaurant is one of the oldest chain fast food restaurants in the United States. Founded in 1926, their specialty is a loose meat hamburger. Maid-Rites can be found in the midwest - mainly Iowa, Minnesota, Illinois, and Missouri.\n\nInternational brands dominant in North America include McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's, the number three burger chain in the USA; Dunkin' Donuts, a New England-based chain; automobile oriented Sonic Drive-In's from Oklahoma City; Starbucks, Seattle-born coffee-based fast food beverage corporation; KFC and Taco Bell, which are both part of the largest restaurant conglomerate in the world, Yum! Brands; and Domino's Pizza, a pizza chain known for popularizing home delivery of fast food.\n\nSubway is known for their sub sandwiches and are the largest restaurant chain to serve such food items. Quiznos a Denver-based sub shop is another fast-growing sub chain, yet with over 6,000 locations it is still far behind Subway's 34,000 locations. Other smaller sub shops include Blimpie, Jersey Mike's Subs, Mr. Goodcents, Jimmy John's, and Firehouse.\n\nA&W Restaurants was originally a United States and Canada fast food brand, but it is currently an International fast food corporation in several countries.\n\nIn Canada the majority of fast food chains are American owned or were originally American owned but have since set up a Canadian management/headquarters locations such as Panera Bread, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Five Guys, and Carl's Jr.. Although the case is usually American fast food chains expanding into Canada, Canadian chains such as Tim Hortons have expanded into 22 states in the United States, but are more prominent in border states such as New York and Michigan. Tim Hortons has started to expand to other countries outside of North America. The Pita Pit franchise originated in Canada and has expanded to the United States and other Countries. The Canadian Extreme Pita franchise sells low fat and salt pita sandwiches with stores in the larger Canadian cities. Other Canadian fast food chains such as Manchu Wok serve North American style Asian foods; this company is located mainly in Canada and the USA, with other outlets on US military bases on other continents. Harvey's is a Canadian-only burger restaurant chain, present in every province.\n\nAustralia's fast food market began in the early 1970s, with the opening of several American franchises including McDonald's and KFC. Pizza Hut was introduced in the 1980s, and Burger King followed. However, the Burger King market found that this name was already a registered trademark to a takeaway food shop in Adelaide. Thus, the Burger King Australian market was forced to pick another name, selecting the Hungry Jack's brand name. Prior to this, the Australian fast food market consisted primarily of imports from the UK, fish and chips takeaway.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, many home based fast food operations were closed in the 1970s and 1980s after McDonald's became the number one outlet in the market. However, brands like Wimpy still remain, although the majority of branches became Burger King in 1989.\n\nIn addition to home-grown chains such as Supermac's, numerous American chains such as McDonald's and Burger King have also established a presence in Ireland. In 2015, a study developed by Treated.com was published in the Irish Times, which named Swords in County Dublin as Ireland's 'fast food capital'.\n\nAmerican chains such as Domino's Pizza, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, and KFC have a big presence in Japan, but local gyudon chains such as Sukiya, Matsuya and Yoshinoya also blanket the country. Japan has its own burger chains including MOS Burger, Lotteria and Freshness Burger.\n\nThe major fast food chains in India which serve European/American food are KFC, McDonald's, Starbucks, Burger King, Subway, Pizza Hut, and Dominos. Most of these have had to make a lot of changes to their standard menus to cater to Indian food habits and taste preferences. Some emerging Indian food chains include Haldiram's, Faaso's, Chick King, Pitstop and Café Coffee Day.\n\nFood habits vary widely across states within India. While typical Idli/Dosa is fast food in Southern India, in Maharashtra it is misal-pav / pav-bhaji / pohe etc. Further north in Punjab/Haryana, Chole-bhature are very popular and in Bihar/Jharkhand litti-chokha is their staple fast food. Maintaining consistency in taste and texture of Indian fast food is a challenge and hence local chains are emerging armed with new food-technology.\n\nIn Nigeria, Mr. Bigg's, Chicken Republic, Tantalizers, and Tastee Fried Chicken are the predominant fast food chains. KFC and Domino's Pizza have recently entered the country.\n\nFast food In Pakistan varies. There are many international chains serving fast food, including Nandos, Burger King, KFC, McDonald's, Domino's Pizza, Fatburger, Dunkin' Donuts, Subway, Pizza Hut, Hardees, Telepizza, Steak Escape and Gloria Jean's Coffees. In addition to the international chains, in local cuisine people in Pakistan like to have biryani, bun kebabs, Nihari, kebab rolls etc. as fast food.\n\nMost international fast food chains like Subway, McDonald's, Burger King etc. are represented in major Russian cities. There are also local chains like Teremok specializing in Russian cuisine or having elements of it added into their menu.\n\nKFC is the most popular fast food chain in South Africa according to a 2010 \"Sunday Times\" survey. Chicken Licken, Wimpy and Ocean Basket along with Nando's and Steers are examples of homegrown franchises that are highly popular within the country. McDonald's, Subway and Pizza Hut have a significant presence within South Africa.\n\nIn Hong Kong, although McDonald's and KFC are quite popular, three major local fast food chains provide Hong Kong style fast food, namely Café de Coral, Fairwood, and Maxim MX. Café de Coral alone serves more than 300,000 customers daily. Unlike western fast food chains, these restaurants offer four different menus at different times of the day, namely breakfast, lunch, afternoon tea, and dinner. \"Siu mei\" is offered throughout the day.\n\n\"Dai pai dong\" and traditional Hong Kong street food may be considered close relatives of the conventional fast food outlet.\n\nIn Israel, local burger chain Burger Ranch is popular as are McDonald's and Burger King. Domino's Pizza is also a popular fast food restaurant. Chains like McDonald's offer kosher branches. Non-kosher foods such as cheeseburgers are rare in Israeli fast food chains, even in non-kosher branches. There are many small local fast food chains that serve pizza, hamburgers, sushi and local foods such as hummus, falafel and shawarma.\n\nIn New Zealand, the fast food market began in the 1970s with KFC (opened 1971), Pizza Hut (1974), and McDonald's (1976), and all three remain popular today. Burger King and Domino's entered the market later in the 1990s. Australian pizza chains Eagle Boys and Pizza Haven also entered the market in the 1990s, but their New Zealand operations were later sold to Pizza Hut and Domino's.\n\nA few fast food chains have been founded in New Zealand, including Burger Fuel (founded 1995), Georgie Pie (founded 1977, but closed 1998 after falling into financial trouble and being bought out by McDonald's) and Hell Pizza (founded 1996).\n\nIn the Philippines, fast-food is the same as in the US. However, the only difference is that they serve Filipino dishes and a few American products being served Filipino-style. Jollibee is the leading fast food chain in the country with 1,000 stores nationwide.\n\nA fast food chain restaurant is generally owned either by the parent company of the fast food chain or a franchisee – an independent party given the right to use the company's trademark and trade name. In the latter case, a contract is made between the franchisee and the parent company, typically requiring the franchisee to pay an initial, fixed fee in addition to a continual percentage of monthly sales. Upon opening for business, the franchisee oversees the day-to-day operations of the restaurant and acts as a manager of the store. Once the contract expires, the parent company may choose to \"renew the contract, sell the franchise to another franchisee, or operate the restaurant itself.\" In most fast food chains, the number of franchised locations exceeds the number of company owned locations.\n\nFast food chains rely on consistency and uniformity, in internal operations and brand image, across all of their restaurant locations in order to convey a sense of reliability to their customers. This sense of reliability coupled with a positive customer experience brings customers to place trust in the company. This sense of trust leads to increased customer loyalty which gives the company a source of recurring business. When a person is presented with a choice of different restaurants to eat at, it is much easier for them to stick with what they know, rather than to take a gamble and dive into the unknown.\n\nDue to the importance of consistency, most companies set standards unifying their various restaurant locations with a set of common rules and regulations. Parent companies often rely on field representatives to ensure that the practices of franchised locations are consistent with the company's standards. However, the more locations a fast food chain has, the harder it is for the parent company to guarantee that these standards are being followed. Moreover, it is much more expensive to discharge a franchisee for noncompliance with company standards, than it is to discharge an employee for that same reason. As a consequence, parent companies tend to deal with franchisee violations in a more relaxed manner.\n\nFor the most part, someone visiting a McDonald's in the United States will have the same experience as someone visiting a McDonald's in Japan. The interior design, the menu, the speed of service, and the taste of the food will all be very similar. However, some differences do exist to tailor to particular cultural differences. For example, in October 2005 during a midst of plummeting sales in Japan, McDonald's added a shrimp burger to the Japanese menu. The choice to introduce a shrimp burger was no coincidence, as a 1989 study stated that world consumption of shrimp was \"led by Japan.\" \n\nIn March 2010, Taco Bell opened their first restaurant in India. Because non-consumption of beef is a cultural norm in light of India's Dharmic beliefs, Taco Bell had to tailor its menu to the dietary distinctions of Indian culture by replacing all of the beef with chicken. By the same token, completely meatless options were introduced to the menu due to the prevalence of vegetarianism throughout the country.\n\nSome of the large fast food chains are beginning to incorporate healthier alternatives in their menu, e.g., white meat, snack wraps, salads, and fresh fruit. However, some people see these moves as a tokenistic and commercial measure, rather than an appropriate reaction to ethical concerns about the world ecology and people's health. McDonald's announced that in March 2006, the chain would include nutritional information on the packaging of all of its products.\n\nIn September and October 2000, during the Starlink corn recalls, up to $50 million worth of corn-based foods were recalled from restaurants as well as supermarkets. The products contained Starlink genetically modified corn that was not approved for human consumption. It was the first-ever recall of a genetically modified food. The environmental group Friends of the Earth that had first detected the contaminated shells was critical of the FDA for not doing its own job.\n\nFast food outlets have become popular with consumers for several reasons. One is that through economies of scale in purchasing and producing food, these companies can deliver food to consumers at a very low cost. In addition, although some people dislike fast food for its predictability, it can be reassuring to a hungry person in a hurry or far from home.\n\nIn the post-World War II period in the United States, fast food chains like McDonald's rapidly gained a reputation for their cleanliness, fast service, and a child-friendly atmosphere where families on the road could grab a quick meal, or seek a break from the routine of home cooking. Prior to the rise of the fast food chain restaurant, people generally had a choice between greasy spoon diners where the quality of the food was often questionable and service lacking, or high-end restaurants that were expensive and impractical for families with children. The modern, stream-lined convenience of the fast food restaurant provided a new alternative and appealed to Americans' instinct for ideas and products associated with progress, technology, and innovation. Fast food restaurants rapidly became the eatery \"everyone could agree on\", with many featuring child-size menu combos, play areas, and whimsical branding campaigns, like the iconic Ronald McDonald, designed to appeal to younger customers. Parents could have a few minutes of peace while children played or amused themselves with the toys included in their Happy Meal. There is a long history of fast food advertising campaigns, many of which are directed at children.\n\nFast food marketing largely focuses on children and teenagers. Popular methods of advertising include television, product placement in toys, games, educational materials, songs, and movies, character licensing and celebrity endorsements, and websites. Advertisements targeting children mainly focus on free toys, movie tie-ins and other giveaways. Fast food restaurants use kid's meals with toys, kid friendly mascots, vibrant colors, and play areas to draw children toward their products. . Children's power over their parents' purchases is estimated to total $300 to $500 billion every year. Fast food has become a part of American culture as a reward for children. To deny a child \"desirable things\" such as the advertised fast food restaurant can cause stigmatization of parents as the \"mean parent\" when it is common among other parents to comply with their child's desires.\n\nThe major focus on children by the fast food industry has created controversy due to the rising issue of children obesity in America. As a result of this focus, in 2008 a coalition was created and run by the Council of Better Business Bureaus called Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative(CFBAI), to stop ads aimed at children or to promote only what the council dubs \"better-for- you\" products in ads directed towards children. However, it was not until 2011 that Congress requested guidelines be put in place by the CFBAI, FDA, Agriculture Department, and Centers for Disease Control. There are two basic requirements identified in the guidelines for foods that are advertised for children: (1) The food has to include healthful ingredients; (2) The food can't contain unhealthful amounts of sugar, Saturated fat, Trans fat, and salt. The guidelines are voluntary but companies experience heavy pressure to comply. Once a company complies they have 5–10 years to comply with the guidelines. Many fast food industries have started to comply with the guidelines. Although many companies have ways to go. In 2012 the fast food industry spent $4.6 billion to advertise unhealthy products to children and teens according to a report by the Yale Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity. There are points of progress that include healthier sides and beverages in most fast food restaurant kids' meals. The guidelines are interested in a healthier lifestyle for children and the growing problem of American obesity.\n\nIn other parts of the world, American and American-style fast food outlets have been popular for their quality, customer service, and novelty, even though they are often the targets of popular anger towards American foreign policy or globalization more generally. Many consumers nonetheless see them as symbols of the wealth, progress, and well-ordered openness of Western society and they therefore become trendy attractions in many cities around the world, particularly among younger people with more varied tastes. \n\nOver time, fast food restaurants have been growing rapidly, especially in urban neighborhoods. According to US research, low-income and predominantly African-American neighborhoods have greater exposure to fast food outlets than higher income and predominantly white areas. This has put into question whether urbanized neighborhoods were targeted, which causes a more unhealthy group of people compared to people from a higher socioeconomic status. It has also been shown that there is a lower chance of finding a fast food restaurant in a suburban neighborhood. In a study of selected US locations, Morland et al. (2002) found the number of fast food restaurants and bars was inversely proportional to the wealth of the neighborhood, and that predominantly African-American residential areas were four times less likely to have a supermarket near them than predominantly white areas.\n\n\nThe introduction of the halal option by some fast food companies saw the expansion of fast food chains into Muslim majority countries has resulted in a rise of restaurant options in non-western nations and has also increased revenue for some western restaurant chains. Some outlets offering Halal options include KFC, Nando's, Pizza Express, and Subway. McDonald's carried out a trial but decided that the cost of operations would be too high. There have also been court cases involving start-up businesses during attempts to alter the halal-certified method by machine killing, which is against the beliefs of some Muslims. However, the trend towards halal has been unpopular in some communities which have at times resulted in internet petitions.\n\nThe fast food industry is a popular target for critics, from anti-globalization activists like José Bové to vegetarian activist groups such as PETA as well as the workers themselves. A number of fast food worker strikes occurred in the United States in the 2010s.\n\nIn his best-selling 2001 book \"Fast Food Nation\", investigative journalist Eric Schlosser leveled a broad, socioeconomic critique against the fast food industry, documenting how fast food rose from small, family-run businesses (like the McDonald brothers' burger joint) into large, multinational corporate juggernauts whose economies of scale radically transformed agriculture, meat processing, and labor markets in the late twentieth century. Schlosser argues that while the innovations of the fast food industry gave Americans more and cheaper dining options, it has come at the price of destroying the environment, economy, and small-town communities of rural America while shielding consumers from the real costs of their convenient meal, both in terms of health and the broader impact of large-scale food production and processing on workers, animals, and land.\n\nThe fast food industry is popular in the United States, the source of most of its innovation, and many major international chains are based there. Seen as symbols of US dominance and perceived cultural imperialism, American fast food franchises have often been the target of Anti-globalization protests and demonstrations against the US government. In 2005, for example, rioters in Karachi, Pakistan, who were initially angered because of the bombing of a Shiite mosque, destroyed a KFC restaurant.\n\nIn 2003, McDonald's was sued in a New York court by a family who claimed that the restaurant chain was responsible for their teenage daughter's obesity and attendant health problems. By manipulating food's taste, sugar and fat content, and directing their advertising to children, the suit argued that the company purposely misleads the public about the nutritional value of its product. A judge dismissed the case, but the fast food industry disliked the publicity of its practices, particularly the way it targets children in its advertising. Although further lawsuits have not materialized, the issue is kept alive in the media and political circles by those promoting the need for tort reform.\n\nIn response to this, the \"Cheeseburger Bill\" was passed by the US House of Representatives in 2004; it later stalled in the US Senate. The law was reintroduced in 2005, only to meet the same fate. This law was claimed to \"[ban] frivolous lawsuits against producers and sellers of food and non-alcoholic drinks arising from obesity claims.\"\nThe bill arose because of an increase in lawsuits against fast food chains by people who claimed that eating their products \"made\" them obese, disassociating themselves from any of the blame.\n\n\n"

                "Border Collie\n\nThe Border Collie is a working and herding dog breed developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region for herding livestock, especially sheep. It was specifically bred for intelligence and obedience.\n\nConsidered highly intelligent, extremely energetic, acrobatic and athletic, they frequently compete with great success in sheepdog trials and dog sports. They are often cited as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs. Border Collies continue to be employed in their traditional work of herding livestock throughout the world.\n\nIn general, Border Collies are medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is most often thick and sheds often. They have a double coat that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. While black and white is the most commonly seen colour pattern of the Border Collie, the breed appears in just about any colour and pattern known to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolour (black/tan/white), liver and white, and red tricolour (red/tan/white) which have also been seen regularly, and other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. Some Border Collies may also have single-colour coats.\n\nEye colour varies from brown to blue, and occasionally eyes of differing colour occur; this is usually seen with merles. The ears of the Border Collie are also variable — some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect ears (similar to those of the rough Collie). Although working Border Collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general a dog's appearance is considered by the American Border Collie Association to be irrelevant. It is considered much more useful to identify a working Border Collie by its attitude and ability than by its looks.\n\nDogs bred for show are more homogeneous in appearance than working Border Collies, since to win in conformation showing they must conform closely to breed club standards that are specific on many points of the structure, coat, and colour. Kennel clubs specify, for example, that the Border Collie must have a \"keen and intelligent\" expression, and that the preferred eye colour is dark brown. In deference to the dog's working origin, scars and broken teeth received in the line of duty are not to be counted against a Border Collie in the show ring. The males' height from withers comes from , females from .\n\nBorder Collies require considerably more daily physical exercise and mental stimulation than many other breeds. The Border Collie is an intelligent dog breed; in fact, it is widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed. Although the primary role of the Border Collie is to herd livestock, this breed is becoming increasingly popular as a companion animal.\n\nIn this role, due to their working heritage, Border Collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic. They thrive best in households that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many Border Collies develop problematic behaviours in households that are not able to provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls, furniture such as chairs and table legs, destructive scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border Collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs. The breed's herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, as it was in the dogs from which the Border Collie was developed, by selective breeding for many generations. However, being eminently trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialisation training.\n\nBefore taking on the breed as a household pet, potential owners should be sure they can provide regular exercise commensurate with the collie's high energy and prodigious stamina. A working collie may run many miles a day, using its experience, personality and intelligence to control challenging livestock, and these dogs will be distressed and frustrated if left in isolation, ignored or inactive. \nLike many working breeds, Border Collies can be motion-sensitive and may chase moving vehicles and bicycles, but this behaviour can be modified by training. Some of the more difficult behaviours require patience, as they are developmental and may disappear as the dog matures.\n\nThe natural life span of the Border Collie is between 10 and 14 years, with an average lifespan of 12 years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are usually 12 to 13 years.\n\nLeading causes of death are cancer (23.6%), old age (17.9%) and cerebral vascular afflictions (9.4%).\n\nHip dysplasia, Collie eye anomaly (CEA), and epilepsy are considered the primary genetic diseases of concern in the breed at this time. CEA is a congenital, inherited eye disease involving the retina, choroid, and sclera that sometimes affects Border Collies. In Border Collies, it is generally a mild disease and rarely significantly impairs vision. However, other eye conditions such as PRA slowly disintegrates the retina and can cause Border Collies to lose almost all of their vision at night which can progress into complete daytime blindness. There is now a DNA test available for CEA and, through its use, breeders can ensure that they will not produce affected pups. There are different types of hip testing available including OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) and PennHip. Radiographs are taken and sent to these organizations to determine a dog's hip and elbow quality.\n\nTwo types of hearing loss occur in the breed. The first type is pigment associated and is found in Border Collie puppies, although the puppies can have congenital sensorineural deafness from birth as well. The second type is known as adult onset hearing loss. These dogs have a normal auditory brainstem response test as pups but gradually lose their hearing some time between one and eight years of age. A study is currently underway at The Translational Genomics Research Institute to identify the genetic cause of adult onset hearing loss in the breed.\n\nNeuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a rare but serious disease that is limited to show Border Collies. NCL results in severe neurological impairment and early death; afflicted dogs rarely survive beyond two years of age. The mutation causing the form of the disease found in Border Collies was identified by Scott Melville in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no treatment or cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.\n\nTrapped Neutrophil Syndrome (TNS) is a hereditary disease in which the bone marrow produces neutrophils (white cells) but is unable to effectively release them into the bloodstream. Affected puppies have an impaired immune system and will eventually die from infections they cannot fight. The mutation responsible for TNS has been found in Border Collies in English working dogs, in show dogs that had originated in Australia and New Zealand, and in unrelated Australian working dogs. This indicates that the gene is widespread and probably as old as the breed itself. TNS was identified by Jeremy Shearman in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.\n\nOther diseases found less commonly include glaucoma, juvenile cataracts, osteochondritis, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus and canine cyclic neutropaenia, carpal soft-tissue injury. A syndrome of exercise induced collapse similar to that seen in Labrador Retrievers (otherwise termed Border Collie Collapse) and triggered by episodes of collapse associated with periods of intense exercise has been described in Border Collies in North America, Europe and Australia; and is currently the subject of further investigation.\n\nElbow dysplasia may also occur in the breed. Dogs homozygous for the merle gene, sometimes referred to as \"double merles\", are likely to have ocular and/or auditory defects.\n\nThe Border Collie is descended from landrace collies, a type found widely in the British Isles. The name for the breed came from its probable place of origin along the Anglo-Scottish border. Mention of the \"Collie\" or \"Colley\" type first appeared toward the end of the 19th century, although the word \"collie\" is older than this and has its origin in the Scots language. It is also thought that the word 'collie' comes from the old Celtic word for useful. Many of the best Border Collies today can be traced back to a dog known as Old Hemp.\n\nIn 1915, James Reid, Secretary of the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) in the United Kingdom first used the term \"Border Collie\" to distinguish those dogs registered by the ISDS from the Kennel Club's Collie (or Scotch Collie, including the Rough Collie and Smooth Collie) which originally came from the same working stock but had developed a different, standardised appearance following introduction to the show ring in 1860 and mixture with different types breeds.\n\nOld Hemp, a tricolour dog, was born in Northumberland in September 1893 and died in May 1901. He was bred by Adam Telfer from Roy, a black and tan dog, and Meg, a black-coated, strong-eyed dog. Hemp was a quiet, powerful dog to which sheep responded easily. Many shepherds used him for stud and Hemp's working style became the Border Collie style. All pure Border Collies alive today can trace an ancestral line back to Old Hemp.\n\nWiston Cap (b. 28 September 1963)<ref name=\"http://db.kennel.dk/\"></ref> is the dog that the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) badge portrays in the characteristic Border Collie herding pose. He was a popular stud dog in the history of the breed, and his bloodline can be seen in most bloodlines of the modern day Collie. Bred by W. S. Hetherington and trained and handled by John Richardson, Cap was a biddable and good-natured dog. His bloodlines all trace back to the early registered dogs of the stud book, and to J. M. Wilson's Cap, whose name occurs 16 times within seven generations in his pedigree. Wiston Cap sired three Supreme Champions and is grand-sire of three others, one of whom was E. W. Edwards' Bill, who won the championship twice.\n\nCollies were listed as imports to New Zealand as early as 1858, but the type was not specified. In the late 1890s James Lilico (1861?–1945) of Christchurch, New Zealand, imported a number of working dogs from the United Kingdom. These included Hindhope Jed, a black, tan and white born in Hindhope, Scotland in 1895, as well as Maudie, Moss of Ancrum, Ness and Old Bob.\n\nIt is unclear whether Hindhope Jed was a descendant of Old Hemp. Born two years after him, she is mentioned in a \"British Hunts and Huntsmen\" article concerning a Mr John Elliot of Jedburgh:\n\nMr Elliot himself is well known for his breed of Collies. His father supplied Noble to the late Queen Victoria and it was from our subject that the McLeod got Hindhope Jed, now the champion of New Zealand and Australia.\n\nAt the time of her departure to New Zealand, Hindhope Jed was already in pup to \"Captain\", another of the then new \"Border\" strain. Hindhope Jed had won three trials in her native Scotland, and was considered to be the \"best to cross the equator\".\n\nIn 1901 the King and Mcleod stud, created by Charles Beechworth King (b. 1855, Murrumbidgee, NSW), his brother and Alec McLeod at Canonbar, near Nyngan (north-west of Sydney), brought Hindhope Jed to Australia, where she enjoyed considerable success at sheep dog trials.\n\nThere are two types of tests, or standards, to determine the breeding quality of a Border Collie: the original ISDS sheepdog trial and appearance.\n\nThe original test is the ISDS sheepdog trial. It is still used today, where a dog and handler collect groups of livestock and move them quietly around a course. There are certain standard elements to this test depending on the level: national or international. For both levels, sheep must be gathered as calmly as possible without being distressed. For a national competition, normally held between England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, trials run over a 400-yard course. International courses use a 400-yard course for the qualifying trials, but on the third and final day, trials are held in a course of 800 yards. The international test involves a \"double fetch\", where the sheepdog must gather 10 sheep from 800 yards away, bring them on an angle to the center of the field, and then be sent back in another direction to gather another 10 sheep, also placed 800 yards from the handler. Five of those 20 sheep will have collars on, and at the end of a triangular drive, the sheep are gathered into a circular \"shedding ring\" and the 15 sheep without collars driven away as the five collared sheep are kept inside the ring and then penned. Sheepdogs must be directed through obstacles at varying distance from the handler, and then the dog must demonstrate the ability to do work close at hand by penning the sheep and sorting them out.\n\nIn nearly every region of the world, the Border Collie is now also a breed which is shown in ring or bench shows. For the people who participate in these events, the Border Collie is defined by the breed standard, which is a description of how the dog should look. In New Zealand and Australia, where the breed has been shown throughout most of the twentieth century, the Border Collie standards have produced a dog with the longer double coat (smooth coats are allowed), a soft dark eye, a body slightly longer than tall, a well-defined stop, semi-pricked ears, as well as a gentle and friendly temperament. This style of Border Collie has become popular in winning show kennels around the world, as well as among prestigious judges. Breed standards state that its tail must be slightly curved and must stop at the hock. The fur must be lush. It should show good expression in its eyes, and must be intelligent. It is energetic with most commonly a black and white coat (sometimes brown). It should have a very strong herding instinct. \nAway from breed standards, short haired Border collie variants are also found, offering householders a less demanding task clearing year-round shed hair. Crossing collies with German Shepherd dogs produces a strong intelligent hybrid of intermediate size, popularly named a \"shollie\", used as a working dog with livestock and as an animal companion.\n\nOther enthusiasts oppose the use of Border Collies as show dogs, for fear that breeding for appearance will lead to a decline in the breed's working dog traits. Few handlers of working Border Collies participate in conformation shows, as working dogs are bred to a performance standard rather than appearance standard. Likewise, conformation-bred dogs are seldom seen on the sheepdog trial field, except in Kennel Club-sponsored events. Dogs registered with either working or conformation based registries are seen in other performance events such as agility, obedience, tracking or flyball; however, these dogs do not necessarily conform to the breed standard of appearance as closely as the dogs shown in the breed rings as this is not a requirement in performance events, nor do they necessarily participate in herding activities.\n\nIn the UK, there are two separate registries for Border Collies. The International Sheep Dog Society encourages breeding for herding ability, whereas the Kennel Club (UK) encourages breeding for a standardised appearance. The ISDS registry is by far the older of the two, and ISDS dogs are eligible for registration as pedigree Border Collies with the Kennel Club (KC) — but not vice versa. The only way for a Border Collie without an ISDS pedigree to be added to the ISDS registry is by proving its worth as a herding dog so that it can be Registered on Merit (ROM).\n\nOne of the principal registries for Border Collies in the United States is the American Border Collie Association (ABCA), which is dedicated to the preservation of the traditional working dog. The breed was also recognised in 1995 by the American Kennel Club (AKC) after occupying the AKC's Miscellaneous Class for over 50 years. The recognition was under protest from the majority of Border Collie affiliated groups, such as the United States Border Collie Club, which felt that emphasis on the breed's working skills would be lost under AKC recognition. AKC registrations have gradually increased since recognition and by the year 2004 there were 1,984 new AKC registrations of Border Collies, with a further 2,378 for the year 2005. By contrast, the American Border Collie Association registers approximately 20,000 Border Collies annually. Because of the inherent tension between the goals of breeding to a working standard and to an appearance standard, the American Border Collie Association voted in 2003 that dogs who attained a conformation championship would be delisted from the ABCA registry, regardless of ability. Cross-registration is allowed between the working registries, and AKC accepts dogs registered with ABCA and NASDS, but none of the working registries in the U.S. honors AKC pedigrees.\n\nIn Australia, Border Collies are registered with an Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) affiliated state control body or with a working dog registry. Between 2,011 and 2,701 ANKC pedigreed Border Collies have been registered with the ANKC each year since 1986. Inclusion on the ANKC affiliate's main register allows Border Collies to compete in conformation, obedience, agility, tracking, herding and other ANKC-sanctioned events held by an ANKC affiliated club, while inclusion on the limited register prohibits entry in conformation events. The ANKC provides a breed standard; however, this applies to conformation events only and has no influence on dogs entering in performance events. Non-ANKC pedigreed dogs may also be eligible for inclusion on an ANKC associate or sporting register and be able to compete in ANKC performance or herding events. Agility organisations such as the Agility Dog Association of Australia (ADAA) have their own registry which allows the inclusion of any dog wishing to compete in their events.\n\nIn Canada, Agriculture Canada has recognised the Canadian Border Collie Association as the registry under the Animal Pedigree Act for any Border Collie that is designated as \"Pure Breed\" in Canada.\n\nThe criteria used are based on herding lineage rather than appearance. It is a two-tiered registry in that dogs imported that are registered with a foreign Kennel Club that does hold conformation shows are given a \"B\" registration, whereas those that come directly from other working registries are placed on the \"A\" registry.\n\nRecently, the Canadian Kennel Club has polled its members to decide if Border Collies should be included on the CKC \"Miscellaneous List\". This designation would allow Border Collie owners the ability to compete in all CKC events, but the CKC would not be the registering body. People who compete in performance events support the move. The CBCA is against this designation.\n\nThe registration of working sheepdogs in South Africa is the responsibility of the South African Sheepdog Association. ISDS registered dogs imported into the country can be transferred onto the SASDA register. Dogs not registered can become eligible for registration by being awarded a certificate of working ability by a registered judge. Occasionally they will facilitate the testing of dogs used for breeding, for Hip dysplasia and Collie eye anomaly, to encourage the breeding of dogs without these genetic flaws.\n\nThe registration of working Border Collies in Turkey is the province of the Border Collie Dernegi (Turkish Border Collie Association) established in 2007.\n\nThe Border Collie breed is also recognised as the prime sheep dog by the International Stock Dog Federation (ISDF), based in Piccadilly, London, UK.\n\nBorder Collies are one of the most popular breeds for dog agility competitions. They also excel at competitive obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and USBCHA Sheepdog trials and herding events.\n\nWorking Border Collies can take direction by voice and by whistle at long distances when herding. Their great energy and herding instinct are still used to herd all kinds of animals, from the traditional sheep and cattle, to free range poultry, pigs, and ostriches. They are also used to remove unwanted wild birds from airport runways, golf courses, and other public and private areas.\n\nThe use of dogs for herding sheep makes good economic sense for many farmers. In a typical pasture environment each trained sheepdog will do the work of three humans. In vast arid areas like the Australian Outback or the Karoo Escarpment, the number increases to five or more. Attempts to replace them with mechanical approaches to herding have only achieved a limited amount of success. Thus, stock handlers find trained dogs more reliable and economical.\n\nShepherds in the UK have taken the most critical elements of herding and incorporated them into a sheepdog trial. The first recorded sheepdog trials were held in Bala, North Wales, in 1873. These competitions enable farmers and shepherds to evaluate possible mates for their working dogs, but they have developed a sport aspect as well, with competitors from outside the farming community also taking part.\n\nIn the USA, the national sanctioning body for these competitions is the USBCHA. In the UK it is the International Sheep Dog Society, in Canada the Canadian Border Collie Association (CBCA) and in South Africa it is the South African Sheepdog Association.\n\nBorder Collies excel at several dog sports in addition to their success in sheepdog trials. Because of the high instinct of herding, they are excellent at this sport. Herding instincts and trainability can be tested for when introduced to sheep or at noncompetitive instinct tests. Border Collies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in sheepdog trials and other herding events. They perform well at some higher jump heights at dog agility competitions, so much so that in England, competitions often include classes for ABC dogs, \"Anything But Collies\".\n\nThe Border Collie's speed, agility, and stamina have allowed them to dominate in dog activities like flyball and disc dog competitions. Their trainability has also given them a berth in dog dancing competitions.\n\nBorder Collies have a highly developed sense of smell and with their high drive make excellent and easily motivated tracking dogs for Tracking trials. These trials simulate the finding of a lost person in a controlled situation where the performance of the dog can be evaluated, with titles awarded for successful dogs.\n\n\n",
                "Herding dog\n\nA herding dog, also known as a stock dog or working dog, is a type of pastoral dog that either has been trained in herding or belongs to breeds developed for herding. Their ability to be trained to act on the sound of a whistle or word of command is renowned throughout the world. Collies are recommended as herding dogs.\n\nAll herding behavior is modified predatory behavior. Through selective breeding, humans have been able to minimize the dog's natural inclination to treat cattle and sheep as prey while simultaneously maintaining the dog's hunting skills, thereby creating an effective herding dog.\n\nDogs can work other animals in a variety of ways. Some breeds, such as the Australian Cattle Dog, typically nip at the heels of animals (for this reason they are called \"heelers\") and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi and the Pembroke Welsh Corgi were historically used in a similar fashion in the cattle droves that moved cattle from Wales to the Smithfield Meat Market in London but are rarely used for herding today.\n\nOther breeds, notably the Border Collie, get in front of the animals and use what is called \"strong eye\" to stare down the animals; they are known as \"headers\". The \"headers\" or fetching dogs keep livestock in a group. They consistently go to the front or head of the animals to turn or stop the animal's movement. The \"heelers\" or driving dogs keep pushing the animals forward. Typically, they stay behind the herd. The Australian Kelpie and Australian Koolie use both these methods and also run along the backs of sheep so are said to head, heel, and back. Other types such as the Australian Shepherd, English Shepherd and Welsh Sheepdog are \"moderate\" to \"loose eyed\", working more independently. The New Zealand Huntaway uses its loud, deep bark to muster mobs of sheep. Belgian Shepherds, German Shepherd Dogs and Briards are historically \"tending\" dogs, who act as a \"living fence,\" guiding large flocks of sheep to graze while preventing them from eating valuable crops and wandering onto roads.\n\nHerding instincts and trainability can be measured when introducing a dog to livestock or at noncompetitive herding tests. Individuals exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\nIn Australia, New Zealand and the United States herding dogs are known as \"working dogs\" irrespective of their breeding. Some herding breeds work well with any kind of animals; others have been bred for generations to work with specific kinds of animals and have developed physical characteristics or styles of working that enhance their ability to handle these animals. Commonly mustered animals include cattle, sheep, goats and reindeer, although it is not unusual for poultry to be handled by dogs.\n\nThe term \"herding dog\" is sometimes erroneously used to describe livestock guardian dogs, whose primary function is to guard flocks and herds from predation and theft, and they lack the herding instinct. Although herding dogs may guard flocks their primary purpose is to move them; both herding dogs and livestock guardian dogs may be called \"sheep dogs\".\n\nIn general terms when categorizing dog breeds, herding dogs are considered a subcategory of working dogs, but for conformation shows they usually form a separate group.\n\nAustralia has the world's largest cattle stations and sheep stations and some of the best-known herding dogs, such as the Koolie, Kelpie, Red and Blue Heelers are bred and found there.\n\nThe competitive dog sport in which herding dogs move animals around a field, fences, gates, or enclosures as directed by their handlers is called a \"sheepdog trial\", \"herding test\" or \"stockdog trial\" depending on the area. Such events are particularly associated with hill farming areas, where sheep range widely on largely unfenced land. These trials are popular in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Chile, Canada, the USA, Australia, New Zealand and other farming nations, and have occasionally even become primetime television fare.\n\nIn the US, regular events are run by the United States Border Collie Handler's Association, Australian Shepherd Club of America, American Kennel Club and many others.\n\nThe world record price for a working sheep dog was broken February 2011 at the auction at Skipton Market, England, with £6,300 ($10,270) for Dewi Fan. The previous record was £5,145 ($8,390)\n\n\nThese commands may be indicated by a hand movement, whistle or voice. There are many other commands that are also used when working stock and in general use away from stock. Herding dog commands are generally taught using livestock as the modus operandi. Urban owners without access to livestock are able to teach basic commands through herding games.\n\nThese are not the only commands used: there are many variations. When whistles are used, each individual dog usually has a different set of commands to avoid confusion when several dogs are being worked at one time.\n\nHerding dogs are often chosen as family pets. The collie breeds including the Bearded Collie and Border Collie are well known, as are the Welsh Corgis. Although they make good family dogs and show dogs they are at their best when they have a job to do. These dogs have been bred as working dogs and need to be active. They retain their herding instincts and may sometimes nip at people's heels or bump them in an effort to 'herd' their family, and may need to be trained not to do so. Their activity level and intelligence makes them excellent canine athletes. The Australian Shepherd, Shetland Sheepdog, Rough Collie, Smooth Collie and Old English Sheepdog are more popular as family companion dogs.\n\nHerding breeds include the following:\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Pyrenean Shepherd\n\nThe Pyrenean Shepherd (known in France originally, and also in non-AKC registries such as the UKC, as the Berger des Pyrénées, and in Spain as the Pastor de los Pirineos) is a medium-small breed of dog native to the Pyrenees mountains in southern France and northern Spain, bred since at least medieval times for herding livestock, especially sheep. It worked as an active herder together with the Great Pyrenees, another mountain dog, which acted as the flock's guardian.\n\nThe Pyrenean Shepherd is the smallest of the French and Spanish herding dogs. The breed comes in two varieties: Rough-faced and smooth-Faced. Rough-faced males are at the withers, and rough-faced females are . Smooth-faced males are at the withers, and smooth-faced females are inches at the withers. The weight is between , aiming for lithe and muscular, never fat.\n\nThe head is of small proportions in comparison to the dog, with a rather flat skull, and a somewhat short, triangular muzzle. The face is expressive and intelligent, with dark eyes, except in the case of merles or slate grey coat colour. Traditionally the dog's ears are cropped. If natural, the Pyrenean Shepherd should have semi-prick or rose ears. Naturally prick ears are not correct for the breed, and may indicate an outcross.\n\nThe body is long and lean, and should reflect the natural energetic athleticism of the dog. The legs are well proportioned, with lean, well-angulated, well-let-down hocks typical of a sure-footed mountain breed. The tail can be docked short, a natural bob-tail, or naturally long with a crook in the end, so long as its carried below the topline at rest and in motion.\n\nThe coat has two basic varieties, smooth-faced and rough-faced (demi-long or long-haired). The smooth-faced variety has short, fine hairs on the muzzle, with a modest ruff around the face and neck, and some feathering along the legs, tail, and belly. In contrast, the rough-faced has longer hair on the muzzle and face, though never enough to cover or obscure the eyes or create a bearded effect, and demi-long or long, coarse hair over the rest of the body. The rough-faced dog can also form cords over his hindquarters and front legs.\n\nShades of fawn are most typical for the breed, either with or without black mask and overlay. Also very common are brindles and various shades of grey. Less common are merles of various kinds (blue merle, brindle merle, fawn merle), and black. All colors allow for some white at the head, chest, and feet, but solid colors are preferred.\n\nThe Pyrenean Shepherd was designed to be a sheepdog, and as such is full of the same sort of energy that other herding dogs have, but in a surprisingly small package. This adaptive dog wants to, and can, do all the jobs on the field, and is a natural herder. A dog that needs a job, its cleverness makes it ideal for other work and dog sports such as flyball, competitive obedience, and agility. This dog is good with, and protective of, children with whom they were brought up.\n\nPyr Sheps are \"one-man\" dogs, attached and dedicated to their owners, with a desire to follow them around the house to help with daily chores. They sense every mood and often seem to be able to read their masters' minds, as they are constantly watchful. Because of this, they are extremely trainable.\n\nTheir natural wariness, while valuable in a herding dog which might need to alert their shepherd of strange animals or people, combined with their herding bossiness, can lead to shyness or aggression in even the most friendly puppy if not properly managed. Frequent socialization from a very young age can help counter this trait.\n\nPyrenean Shepherds can compete in dog agility trials, obedience, showmanship, flyball, and tracking events.\n\nOn 1 January 2009, the Pyrenean Shepherd finally became eligible to compete in herding events in the United States sponsored by the AKC. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Pyr Sheps exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\nPyrenean Shepherds need only a weekly brush, as well as regular checks for burrs or mats, to keep their coat in good condition. They also need a lot of space indoors, and space to exercise outdoors.\n\nSome specialists argue that the Pyrenean Shepherd was there long before the arrival of the Roman armies which dominated Gaul and Hispania and this was mixed with large molossers that the Romans had in their army. Other theories suggest that its origin is linked to the passage of the Vandals and Suebi through the Pyrenees to the south.\n\nAfter the first World War, the Pyrenean Shepherd, or \"Pyr Shep\", gained national recognition in France for their valiant work as couriers, search and rescue dogs, watch dogs, and company mascots.\n\nThe smooth-faced Pyrenean Shepherd in its harlequin or blue merle coloration may have been one of the foundation breeds for the Australian Shepherd when sheep herders brought their sheepdogs to the American West when they flew to the United States as contract herders for the Western Range Association in the 1940s until the early 1970s.\n\nThe Pyr Shep is not yet a well-known breed outside of its native France and Spain, but its size, intelligence, and attractive coat make it appealing. After one of its breed won the World Agility Championship for midsized dogs in 2003, it gained more attention as an intelligent performance dog for dog sports.\n\nOn 24 January 2015, a male Pyrenean Shepherd, GCh (Grand Champion) La Brise Sun Bear, a dog (i.e., male), was awarded an AKC all-breed Best In Show (BIS). This was the first (and so far only) BIS since having been formally recognized by the AKC for competition (within the Herding Group) effective as of 1 January 2009 (6 years previously).\n\nThe first Pyrenean Sheepdogs were registered with the Kennel Club (UK) in 1988 and the Pyrenean Sheepdog Club of Great Britain was formed in 1992 by a small number of enthusiasts.\n"

                "Border Collie\n\nThe Border Collie is a working and herding dog breed developed in the Anglo-Scottish border region for herding livestock, especially sheep. It was specifically bred for intelligence and obedience.\n\nConsidered highly intelligent, extremely energetic, acrobatic and athletic, they frequently compete with great success in sheepdog trials and dog sports. They are often cited as the most intelligent of all domestic dogs. Border Collies continue to be employed in their traditional work of herding livestock throughout the world.\n\nIn general, Border Collies are medium-sized dogs with a moderate amount of coat, which is most often thick and sheds often. They have a double coat that varies from smooth to rough and is occasionally curled. While black and white is the most commonly seen colour pattern of the Border Collie, the breed appears in just about any colour and pattern known to occur in dogs. Some of these include black tricolour (black/tan/white), liver and white, and red tricolour (red/tan/white) which have also been seen regularly, and other colours such as blue, lilac, red merle, blue merle, brindle, and Australian red (also known as ee red, blonde, recessive red, or gold) which is seen less frequently. Some Border Collies may also have single-colour coats.\n\nEye colour varies from brown to blue, and occasionally eyes of differing colour occur; this is usually seen with merles. The ears of the Border Collie are also variable — some have fully erect ears, some fully dropped ears, and others semi-erect ears (similar to those of the rough Collie). Although working Border Collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general a dog's appearance is considered by the American Border Collie Association to be irrelevant. It is considered much more useful to identify a working Border Collie by its attitude and ability than by its looks.\n\nDogs bred for show are more homogeneous in appearance than working Border Collies, since to win in conformation showing they must conform closely to breed club standards that are specific on many points of the structure, coat, and colour. Kennel clubs specify, for example, that the Border Collie must have a \"keen and intelligent\" expression, and that the preferred eye colour is dark brown. In deference to the dog's working origin, scars and broken teeth received in the line of duty are not to be counted against a Border Collie in the show ring. The males' height from withers comes from , females from .\n\nBorder Collies require considerably more daily physical exercise and mental stimulation than many other breeds. The Border Collie is an intelligent dog breed; in fact, it is widely considered to be the most intelligent dog breed. Although the primary role of the Border Collie is to herd livestock, this breed is becoming increasingly popular as a companion animal.\n\nIn this role, due to their working heritage, Border Collies are very demanding, playful, and energetic. They thrive best in households that can provide them with plenty of play and exercise, either with humans or other dogs. Due to their demanding personalities and need for mental stimulation and exercise, many Border Collies develop problematic behaviours in households that are not able to provide for their needs. They are infamous for chewing holes in walls, furniture such as chairs and table legs, destructive scraping and hole digging, due to boredom. Border Collies may exhibit a strong desire to herd, a trait they may show with small children, cats, and other dogs. The breed's herding trait has been deliberately encouraged, as it was in the dogs from which the Border Collie was developed, by selective breeding for many generations. However, being eminently trainable, they can live amicably with other pets if given proper socialisation training.\n\nBefore taking on the breed as a household pet, potential owners should be sure they can provide regular exercise commensurate with the collie's high energy and prodigious stamina. A working collie may run many miles a day, using its experience, personality and intelligence to control challenging livestock, and these dogs will be distressed and frustrated if left in isolation, ignored or inactive. \nLike many working breeds, Border Collies can be motion-sensitive and may chase moving vehicles and bicycles, but this behaviour can be modified by training. Some of the more difficult behaviours require patience, as they are developmental and may disappear as the dog matures.\n\nThe natural life span of the Border Collie is between 10 and 14 years, with an average lifespan of 12 years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are usually 12 to 13 years.\n\nLeading causes of death are cancer (23.6%), old age (17.9%) and cerebral vascular afflictions (9.4%).\n\nHip dysplasia, Collie eye anomaly (CEA), and epilepsy are considered the primary genetic diseases of concern in the breed at this time. CEA is a congenital, inherited eye disease involving the retina, choroid, and sclera that sometimes affects Border Collies. In Border Collies, it is generally a mild disease and rarely significantly impairs vision. However, other eye conditions such as PRA slowly disintegrates the retina and can cause Border Collies to lose almost all of their vision at night which can progress into complete daytime blindness. There is now a DNA test available for CEA and, through its use, breeders can ensure that they will not produce affected pups. There are different types of hip testing available including OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) and PennHip. Radiographs are taken and sent to these organizations to determine a dog's hip and elbow quality.\n\nTwo types of hearing loss occur in the breed. The first type is pigment associated and is found in Border Collie puppies, although the puppies can have congenital sensorineural deafness from birth as well. The second type is known as adult onset hearing loss. These dogs have a normal auditory brainstem response test as pups but gradually lose their hearing some time between one and eight years of age. A study is currently underway at The Translational Genomics Research Institute to identify the genetic cause of adult onset hearing loss in the breed.\n\nNeuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) is a rare but serious disease that is limited to show Border Collies. NCL results in severe neurological impairment and early death; afflicted dogs rarely survive beyond two years of age. The mutation causing the form of the disease found in Border Collies was identified by Scott Melville in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no treatment or cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.\n\nTrapped Neutrophil Syndrome (TNS) is a hereditary disease in which the bone marrow produces neutrophils (white cells) but is unable to effectively release them into the bloodstream. Affected puppies have an impaired immune system and will eventually die from infections they cannot fight. The mutation responsible for TNS has been found in Border Collies in English working dogs, in show dogs that had originated in Australia and New Zealand, and in unrelated Australian working dogs. This indicates that the gene is widespread and probably as old as the breed itself. TNS was identified by Jeremy Shearman in the laboratory of Dr. Alan Wilton of the School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, University of New South Wales. There is no cure, but a DNA test is now available to detect carriers as well as affected dogs.\n\nOther diseases found less commonly include glaucoma, juvenile cataracts, osteochondritis, hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus and canine cyclic neutropaenia, carpal soft-tissue injury. A syndrome of exercise induced collapse similar to that seen in Labrador Retrievers (otherwise termed Border Collie Collapse) and triggered by episodes of collapse associated with periods of intense exercise has been described in Border Collies in North America, Europe and Australia; and is currently the subject of further investigation.\n\nElbow dysplasia may also occur in the breed. Dogs homozygous for the merle gene, sometimes referred to as \"double merles\", are likely to have ocular and/or auditory defects.\n\nThe Border Collie is descended from landrace collies, a type found widely in the British Isles. The name for the breed came from its probable place of origin along the Anglo-Scottish border. Mention of the \"Collie\" or \"Colley\" type first appeared toward the end of the 19th century, although the word \"collie\" is older than this and has its origin in the Scots language. It is also thought that the word 'collie' comes from the old Celtic word for useful. Many of the best Border Collies today can be traced back to a dog known as Old Hemp.\n\nIn 1915, James Reid, Secretary of the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) in the United Kingdom first used the term \"Border Collie\" to distinguish those dogs registered by the ISDS from the Kennel Club's Collie (or Scotch Collie, including the Rough Collie and Smooth Collie) which originally came from the same working stock but had developed a different, standardised appearance following introduction to the show ring in 1860 and mixture with different types breeds.\n\nOld Hemp, a tricolour dog, was born in Northumberland in September 1893 and died in May 1901. He was bred by Adam Telfer from Roy, a black and tan dog, and Meg, a black-coated, strong-eyed dog. Hemp was a quiet, powerful dog to which sheep responded easily. Many shepherds used him for stud and Hemp's working style became the Border Collie style. All pure Border Collies alive today can trace an ancestral line back to Old Hemp.\n\nWiston Cap (b. 28 September 1963)<ref name=\"http://db.kennel.dk/\"></ref> is the dog that the International Sheep Dog Society (ISDS) badge portrays in the characteristic Border Collie herding pose. He was a popular stud dog in the history of the breed, and his bloodline can be seen in most bloodlines of the modern day Collie. Bred by W. S. Hetherington and trained and handled by John Richardson, Cap was a biddable and good-natured dog. His bloodlines all trace back to the early registered dogs of the stud book, and to J. M. Wilson's Cap, whose name occurs 16 times within seven generations in his pedigree. Wiston Cap sired three Supreme Champions and is grand-sire of three others, one of whom was E. W. Edwards' Bill, who won the championship twice.\n\nCollies were listed as imports to New Zealand as early as 1858, but the type was not specified. In the late 1890s James Lilico (1861?–1945) of Christchurch, New Zealand, imported a number of working dogs from the United Kingdom. These included Hindhope Jed, a black, tan and white born in Hindhope, Scotland in 1895, as well as Maudie, Moss of Ancrum, Ness and Old Bob.\n\nIt is unclear whether Hindhope Jed was a descendant of Old Hemp. Born two years after him, she is mentioned in a \"British Hunts and Huntsmen\" article concerning a Mr John Elliot of Jedburgh:\n\nMr Elliot himself is well known for his breed of Collies. His father supplied Noble to the late Queen Victoria and it was from our subject that the McLeod got Hindhope Jed, now the champion of New Zealand and Australia.\n\nAt the time of her departure to New Zealand, Hindhope Jed was already in pup to \"Captain\", another of the then new \"Border\" strain. Hindhope Jed had won three trials in her native Scotland, and was considered to be the \"best to cross the equator\".\n\nIn 1901 the King and Mcleod stud, created by Charles Beechworth King (b. 1855, Murrumbidgee, NSW), his brother and Alec McLeod at Canonbar, near Nyngan (north-west of Sydney), brought Hindhope Jed to Australia, where she enjoyed considerable success at sheep dog trials.\n\nThere are two types of tests, or standards, to determine the breeding quality of a Border Collie: the original ISDS sheepdog trial and appearance.\n\nThe original test is the ISDS sheepdog trial. It is still used today, where a dog and handler collect groups of livestock and move them quietly around a course. There are certain standard elements to this test depending on the level: national or international. For both levels, sheep must be gathered as calmly as possible without being distressed. For a national competition, normally held between England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, trials run over a 400-yard course. International courses use a 400-yard course for the qualifying trials, but on the third and final day, trials are held in a course of 800 yards. The international test involves a \"double fetch\", where the sheepdog must gather 10 sheep from 800 yards away, bring them on an angle to the center of the field, and then be sent back in another direction to gather another 10 sheep, also placed 800 yards from the handler. Five of those 20 sheep will have collars on, and at the end of a triangular drive, the sheep are gathered into a circular \"shedding ring\" and the 15 sheep without collars driven away as the five collared sheep are kept inside the ring and then penned. Sheepdogs must be directed through obstacles at varying distance from the handler, and then the dog must demonstrate the ability to do work close at hand by penning the sheep and sorting them out.\n\nIn nearly every region of the world, the Border Collie is now also a breed which is shown in ring or bench shows. For the people who participate in these events, the Border Collie is defined by the breed standard, which is a description of how the dog should look. In New Zealand and Australia, where the breed has been shown throughout most of the twentieth century, the Border Collie standards have produced a dog with the longer double coat (smooth coats are allowed), a soft dark eye, a body slightly longer than tall, a well-defined stop, semi-pricked ears, as well as a gentle and friendly temperament. This style of Border Collie has become popular in winning show kennels around the world, as well as among prestigious judges. Breed standards state that its tail must be slightly curved and must stop at the hock. The fur must be lush. It should show good expression in its eyes, and must be intelligent. It is energetic with most commonly a black and white coat (sometimes brown). It should have a very strong herding instinct. \nAway from breed standards, short haired Border collie variants are also found, offering householders a less demanding task clearing year-round shed hair. Crossing collies with German Shepherd dogs produces a strong intelligent hybrid of intermediate size, popularly named a \"shollie\", used as a working dog with livestock and as an animal companion.\n\nOther enthusiasts oppose the use of Border Collies as show dogs, for fear that breeding for appearance will lead to a decline in the breed's working dog traits. Few handlers of working Border Collies participate in conformation shows, as working dogs are bred to a performance standard rather than appearance standard. Likewise, conformation-bred dogs are seldom seen on the sheepdog trial field, except in Kennel Club-sponsored events. Dogs registered with either working or conformation based registries are seen in other performance events such as agility, obedience, tracking or flyball; however, these dogs do not necessarily conform to the breed standard of appearance as closely as the dogs shown in the breed rings as this is not a requirement in performance events, nor do they necessarily participate in herding activities.\n\nIn the UK, there are two separate registries for Border Collies. The International Sheep Dog Society encourages breeding for herding ability, whereas the Kennel Club (UK) encourages breeding for a standardised appearance. The ISDS registry is by far the older of the two, and ISDS dogs are eligible for registration as pedigree Border Collies with the Kennel Club (KC) — but not vice versa. The only way for a Border Collie without an ISDS pedigree to be added to the ISDS registry is by proving its worth as a herding dog so that it can be Registered on Merit (ROM).\n\nOne of the principal registries for Border Collies in the United States is the American Border Collie Association (ABCA), which is dedicated to the preservation of the traditional working dog. The breed was also recognised in 1995 by the American Kennel Club (AKC) after occupying the AKC's Miscellaneous Class for over 50 years. The recognition was under protest from the majority of Border Collie affiliated groups, such as the United States Border Collie Club, which felt that emphasis on the breed's working skills would be lost under AKC recognition. AKC registrations have gradually increased since recognition and by the year 2004 there were 1,984 new AKC registrations of Border Collies, with a further 2,378 for the year 2005. By contrast, the American Border Collie Association registers approximately 20,000 Border Collies annually. Because of the inherent tension between the goals of breeding to a working standard and to an appearance standard, the American Border Collie Association voted in 2003 that dogs who attained a conformation championship would be delisted from the ABCA registry, regardless of ability. Cross-registration is allowed between the working registries, and AKC accepts dogs registered with ABCA and NASDS, but none of the working registries in the U.S. honors AKC pedigrees.\n\nIn Australia, Border Collies are registered with an Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) affiliated state control body or with a working dog registry. Between 2,011 and 2,701 ANKC pedigreed Border Collies have been registered with the ANKC each year since 1986. Inclusion on the ANKC affiliate's main register allows Border Collies to compete in conformation, obedience, agility, tracking, herding and other ANKC-sanctioned events held by an ANKC affiliated club, while inclusion on the limited register prohibits entry in conformation events. The ANKC provides a breed standard; however, this applies to conformation events only and has no influence on dogs entering in performance events. Non-ANKC pedigreed dogs may also be eligible for inclusion on an ANKC associate or sporting register and be able to compete in ANKC performance or herding events. Agility organisations such as the Agility Dog Association of Australia (ADAA) have their own registry which allows the inclusion of any dog wishing to compete in their events.\n\nIn Canada, Agriculture Canada has recognised the Canadian Border Collie Association as the registry under the Animal Pedigree Act for any Border Collie that is designated as \"Pure Breed\" in Canada.\n\nThe criteria used are based on herding lineage rather than appearance. It is a two-tiered registry in that dogs imported that are registered with a foreign Kennel Club that does hold conformation shows are given a \"B\" registration, whereas those that come directly from other working registries are placed on the \"A\" registry.\n\nRecently, the Canadian Kennel Club has polled its members to decide if Border Collies should be included on the CKC \"Miscellaneous List\". This designation would allow Border Collie owners the ability to compete in all CKC events, but the CKC would not be the registering body. People who compete in performance events support the move. The CBCA is against this designation.\n\nThe registration of working sheepdogs in South Africa is the responsibility of the South African Sheepdog Association. ISDS registered dogs imported into the country can be transferred onto the SASDA register. Dogs not registered can become eligible for registration by being awarded a certificate of working ability by a registered judge. Occasionally they will facilitate the testing of dogs used for breeding, for Hip dysplasia and Collie eye anomaly, to encourage the breeding of dogs without these genetic flaws.\n\nThe registration of working Border Collies in Turkey is the province of the Border Collie Dernegi (Turkish Border Collie Association) established in 2007.\n\nThe Border Collie breed is also recognised as the prime sheep dog by the International Stock Dog Federation (ISDF), based in Piccadilly, London, UK.\n\nBorder Collies are one of the most popular breeds for dog agility competitions. They also excel at competitive obedience, showmanship, flyball, tracking, and USBCHA Sheepdog trials and herding events.\n\nWorking Border Collies can take direction by voice and by whistle at long distances when herding. Their great energy and herding instinct are still used to herd all kinds of animals, from the traditional sheep and cattle, to free range poultry, pigs, and ostriches. They are also used to remove unwanted wild birds from airport runways, golf courses, and other public and private areas.\n\nThe use of dogs for herding sheep makes good economic sense for many farmers. In a typical pasture environment each trained sheepdog will do the work of three humans. In vast arid areas like the Australian Outback or the Karoo Escarpment, the number increases to five or more. Attempts to replace them with mechanical approaches to herding have only achieved a limited amount of success. Thus, stock handlers find trained dogs more reliable and economical.\n\nShepherds in the UK have taken the most critical elements of herding and incorporated them into a sheepdog trial. The first recorded sheepdog trials were held in Bala, North Wales, in 1873. These competitions enable farmers and shepherds to evaluate possible mates for their working dogs, but they have developed a sport aspect as well, with competitors from outside the farming community also taking part.\n\nIn the USA, the national sanctioning body for these competitions is the USBCHA. In the UK it is the International Sheep Dog Society, in Canada the Canadian Border Collie Association (CBCA) and in South Africa it is the South African Sheepdog Association.\n\nBorder Collies excel at several dog sports in addition to their success in sheepdog trials. Because of the high instinct of herding, they are excellent at this sport. Herding instincts and trainability can be tested for when introduced to sheep or at noncompetitive instinct tests. Border Collies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in sheepdog trials and other herding events. They perform well at some higher jump heights at dog agility competitions, so much so that in England, competitions often include classes for ABC dogs, \"Anything But Collies\".\n\nThe Border Collie's speed, agility, and stamina have allowed them to dominate in dog activities like flyball and disc dog competitions. Their trainability has also given them a berth in dog dancing competitions.\n\nBorder Collies have a highly developed sense of smell and with their high drive make excellent and easily motivated tracking dogs for Tracking trials. These trials simulate the finding of a lost person in a controlled situation where the performance of the dog can be evaluated, with titles awarded for successful dogs.\n\n\n",
                "Herding dog\n\nA herding dog, also known as a stock dog or working dog, is a type of pastoral dog that either has been trained in herding or belongs to breeds developed for herding. Their ability to be trained to act on the sound of a whistle or word of command is renowned throughout the world. Collies are recommended as herding dogs.\n\nAll herding behavior is modified predatory behavior. Through selective breeding, humans have been able to minimize the dog's natural inclination to treat cattle and sheep as prey while simultaneously maintaining the dog's hunting skills, thereby creating an effective herding dog.\n\nDogs can work other animals in a variety of ways. Some breeds, such as the Australian Cattle Dog, typically nip at the heels of animals (for this reason they are called \"heelers\") and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi and the Pembroke Welsh Corgi were historically used in a similar fashion in the cattle droves that moved cattle from Wales to the Smithfield Meat Market in London but are rarely used for herding today.\n\nOther breeds, notably the Border Collie, get in front of the animals and use what is called \"strong eye\" to stare down the animals; they are known as \"headers\". The \"headers\" or fetching dogs keep livestock in a group. They consistently go to the front or head of the animals to turn or stop the animal's movement. The \"heelers\" or driving dogs keep pushing the animals forward. Typically, they stay behind the herd. The Australian Kelpie and Australian Koolie use both these methods and also run along the backs of sheep so are said to head, heel, and back. Other types such as the Australian Shepherd, English Shepherd and Welsh Sheepdog are \"moderate\" to \"loose eyed\", working more independently. The New Zealand Huntaway uses its loud, deep bark to muster mobs of sheep. Belgian Shepherds, German Shepherd Dogs and Briards are historically \"tending\" dogs, who act as a \"living fence,\" guiding large flocks of sheep to graze while preventing them from eating valuable crops and wandering onto roads.\n\nHerding instincts and trainability can be measured when introducing a dog to livestock or at noncompetitive herding tests. Individuals exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in herding trials.\n\nIn Australia, New Zealand and the United States herding dogs are known as \"working dogs\" irrespective of their breeding. Some herding breeds work well with any kind of animals; others have been bred for generations to work with specific kinds of animals and have developed physical characteristics or styles of working that enhance their ability to handle these animals. Commonly mustered animals include cattle, sheep, goats and reindeer, although it is not unusual for poultry to be handled by dogs.\n\nThe term \"herding dog\" is sometimes erroneously used to describe livestock guardian dogs, whose primary function is to guard flocks and herds from predation and theft, and they lack the herding instinct. Although herding dogs may guard flocks their primary purpose is to move them; both herding dogs and livestock guardian dogs may be called \"sheep dogs\".\n\nIn general terms when categorizing dog breeds, herding dogs are considered a subcategory of working dogs, but for conformation shows they usually form a separate group.\n\nAustralia has the world's largest cattle stations and sheep stations and some of the best-known herding dogs, such as the Koolie, Kelpie, Red and Blue Heelers are bred and found there.\n\nThe competitive dog sport in which herding dogs move animals around a field, fences, gates, or enclosures as directed by their handlers is called a \"sheepdog trial\", \"herding test\" or \"stockdog trial\" depending on the area. Such events are particularly associated with hill farming areas, where sheep range widely on largely unfenced land. These trials are popular in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, Chile, Canada, the USA, Australia, New Zealand and other farming nations, and have occasionally even become primetime television fare.\n\nIn the US, regular events are run by the United States Border Collie Handler's Association, Australian Shepherd Club of America, American Kennel Club and many others.\n\nThe world record price for a working sheep dog was broken February 2011 at the auction at Skipton Market, England, with £6,300 ($10,270) for Dewi Fan. The previous record was £5,145 ($8,390)\n\n\nThese commands may be indicated by a hand movement, whistle or voice. There are many other commands that are also used when working stock and in general use away from stock. Herding dog commands are generally taught using livestock as the modus operandi. Urban owners without access to livestock are able to teach basic commands through herding games.\n\nThese are not the only commands used: there are many variations. When whistles are used, each individual dog usually has a different set of commands to avoid confusion when several dogs are being worked at one time.\n\nHerding dogs are often chosen as family pets. The collie breeds including the Bearded Collie and Border Collie are well known, as are the Welsh Corgis. Although they make good family dogs and show dogs they are at their best when they have a job to do. These dogs have been bred as working dogs and need to be active. They retain their herding instincts and may sometimes nip at people's heels or bump them in an effort to 'herd' their family, and may need to be trained not to do so. Their activity level and intelligence makes them excellent canine athletes. The Australian Shepherd, Shetland Sheepdog, Rough Collie, Smooth Collie and Old English Sheepdog are more popular as family companion dogs.\n\nHerding breeds include the following:\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Australian Cattle Dog\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog (ACD), or simply Cattle Dog, is a breed of herding dog originally developed in Australia for droving cattle over long distances across rough terrain. This breed is a medium-sized, short-coated dog that occurs in two main colour forms. It has either brown or black hair distributed fairly evenly through a white coat, which gives the appearance of a \"red\" or \"blue\" dog. \n\nAs with dogs from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is energetic and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, particularly if it is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive blindness (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.\n\nIn the 19th century, New South Wales cattle farmer Thomas Hall crossed the dogs used by drovers in his parents' home county, Northumberland, with dingoes he had tamed. The resulting dogs were known as Halls Heelers. After Hall's death in 1870, the dogs became available beyond the Hall family and their associates. They were subsequently developed into two modern breeds: the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog. Robert Kaleski, who wrote the first standard for the breed, was influential in its development.\n\nAustralian Cattle Dog has been nicknamed a \"Red Heeler\" or \"Blue Heeler\" on the basis of its colouring and practice of moving reluctant cattle by nipping at their heels. Dogs from a line bred in Queensland, Australia, which were successful at shows and at stud in the 1940s, were called \"Queensland Heelers\" to differentiate them from lines bred in New South Wales; this nickname is now occasionally applied to any Australian Cattle Dog.\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact dog that gives the impression of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and dark, with an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.\n\nThe Cattle Dog breed standard states that it should have well-conditioned muscles, even when bred for companion or show purposes, and that its appearance should be symmetrical and balanced, with no individual part of the dog exaggerated. It should not look either delicate or cumbersome, as either characteristic limits the agility and endurance that is necessary for a working dog.\n\nThe female Australian Cattle Dog measures approximately at the withers, and the male measures about at the withers. The dog should be longer than tall, that is, the length of the body from breast bone to buttocks is greater than the height at the withers, in a ratio of 10 to 9. An Australian Cattle Dog in good condition weighs around .\n\nThere are two accepted coat colours, red and blue, though chocolate and cream do occur. Blue dogs can be blue, blue mottled, or blue speckled with or without black, tan, or white markings. Red dogs are evenly speckled with solid red markings. Both red dogs and blue dogs are born white (except for any solid-coloured body or face markings) and the red or black hairs grow in as they mature. The distinctive adult colouration is the result of black or red hairs closely interspersed through a predominantly white coat. This is not merle colouration (a speckled effect that has associated health issues), but rather the result of the ticking gene. A number of breeds show ticking, which is the presence of colour through white areas, though the overall effect depends on other genes that will modify the size, shape and density of the ticking.\n\nIn addition to the primary colouration, an Australian Cattle Dog displays some patches of solid or near-solid colour. In both red and blue dogs, the most common are masks over one or both eyes, a white tip to the tail, a solid spot at the base of the tail, and sometimes solid spots on the body, though these are not desirable in dogs bred for conformation shows. Blue dogs can have tan midway up the legs and extending up the front to breast and throat, with tan on jaws, and tan eyebrows. Both colour forms can have a white \"star\" on the forehead called the \"Bentley Mark\", after a legendary dog owned by Tom Bentley. Common miscolours in the Australian Cattle Dog are black hairs in a red-coated dog, including the extreme of a black saddle on a red dog, and extensive tan on the face and body on a blue dog, called \"creeping tan\". The Cattle Dog has a double coat—the short, straight outer guard hairs are protective in nature, keeping the elements from the dog's skin while the undercoat is short, fine and dense.\nThe mask consists of a black patch over one or both eyes (for the blue coat colour) or a red patch over one or both eyes (for the red coat colour). Depending on whether one or both eyes have a patch, these are called, respectively, \"single\" (or \"half\") mask and \"double\" (or \"full\") mask. Dogs without a mask are called plain-faced. Any of these are acceptable according to the breed standard. In conformation shows, even markings are preferred over uneven markings.\n\nThe breed standards of the Australian, American and Canadian kennel clubs specify that the Australian Cattle Dog should have a natural, long, un-docked tail. There will often be a solid colour spot at the base of the tail and a white tip. The tail should be set moderately low, following the slope of the back. It should hang in a slight curve at rest, though an excited dog may carry its tail higher. The tail should feature a reasonable level of brush.\n\nIn the United States, tails are sometimes docked on working stock. The tail is not docked in Australia, and serves a useful purpose in increasing agility and the ability to turn quickly. The Australian Cattle Dog is a breed distinct from the Australian Stumpy Tail Cattle Dog, a square-bodied dog born with a naturally \"bobbed\" tail. The Stumpy Tail resembles the Australian Cattle Dog, but has a taller, leaner conformation. It occasionally has a natural long thin tail, but most are born without tails.\n\nLike many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog has high energy levels, an active mind, and a level of independence. The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's \"The Intelligence of Dogs\", rated as one of the most intelligent dogs ranked by obedience command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.\n\nWhen on home ground, the Australian Cattle Dog is an affectionate and playful pet. However, it is reserved with people it does not know and naturally cautious in new situations. Its attitude to strangers makes it an excellent guard dog when trained for this task, and it can be socialised to become accustomed to a variety of people from an early age as a family pet. It is good with older, considerate children, but will herd people by nipping at their heels, particularly younger children who run and squeal. By the time puppies are weaned, they should have learned that the company of people is pleasurable, and that responding to cues from a person is rewarding. The bond that this breed can create with its owner is strong and will leave the dog feeling protective towards the owner, typically resulting in the dog's never being too far from the owner's side. The Australian Cattle Dog can be the friendliest of companions although it is quick to respond to the emotions of its owners, and may defend them without waiting for a command. The ACD was originally bred to move reluctant cattle by biting, and it will bite if treated harshly. The Australian Cattle Dog's protective nature and tendency to nip at heels can be dangerous as the dog grows into an adult if unwanted behaviours are left unchecked.\n\nWhile an Australian Cattle Dog generally works silently, it will bark in alarm or to attract attention. It has a distinctive intense, high-pitched bark. Barking can be a sign of boredom or frustration, although research has shown that pet dogs increase their vocalisation when raised in a noisy environment. It responds well to familiar dogs, but when multiple dogs are present, establishing a pecking order can trigger aggression. It is not a breed that lives in a pack with other dogs.\n\nData accumulated from Council reports in New South Wales from April to June 2013, showed that dogs identified as Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in 66 attacks, where an attack is defined as any incident where a dog rushes at, bites, harasses or chases any person or animal. Staffordshire Bull Terrier (155 attacks), German Shepherd (89) and American Staffordshire Terrier (88) were reported to be involved in more incidents. Expressed as a percentage of registered dogs, 0.1% of Australian Cattle Dogs were involved in attacks. The data gathered in 2011–2012 listed the ACD twenty-seventh in involvement in incidents ranked by percentage of dogs registered. A review of incidents in Melbourne where a dog bit, rushed at or chased a person or animal in a public space, found that there were sixty breeds involved and the German Shepherd and German Shepherd crosses, and Australian Cattle Dog and Cattle Dog crosses accounted for 9% of incidents. Surveys of U.S. breed club members showed that both dog-directed aggression and stranger-directed aggression were higher in the ACD than the average of breeds studied, with dog-directed aggression being the more prevalent of the two aggression types. The American Temperament Test Society reports a test pass rate of 79.3% for Australian Cattle Dogs. The average pass rate for all breeds is 80.4%.\n\nKnown as a \"wash and wear\" dog, the Australian Cattle Dog requires little grooming, and an occasional brushing is all that is required to keep the coat clean and odour-free. Even for the show ring it needs no more than wiping down with a moist cloth. It is not a year-round shedder but blows its coat once a year (twice in the case of intact females) and frequent brushing and a warm bath during this period will contain the shedding hair. As with all dogs, regular attention to nails, ears and teeth will help avoid health problems.\n\nIn Katherine Buetow's guide to the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar makes the point that while people think of dog training as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that it is a good idea to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog demands a high level of physical activity. Like many other herding dog breeds, the Cattle Dog has an active and fertile mind and if it is not given jobs to do it will find its own activities. It will appreciate a walk around the neighbourhood, but it needs structured activities that engage and challenge it, and regular interaction with its owner. While individual dogs have their own personalities and abilities, as a breed the Australian Cattle Dog is suited to any activity that calls for athleticism, intelligence, and endurance.\n\nKennel club-sponsored herding trials with a range of events suit the driving abilities of the Cattle Dog and other upright breeds, while sheepdog trials are more suited to the \"eye\" breeds such as the Border Collie and Australian Kelpie. Herding instincts and trainability are measured at non-competitive herding tests, and basic commands are sometimes taught through herding games, where rules such as \"stay\", \"get it\" and \"that'll do\" are applied to fetching a ball or chasing a yard broom.\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog was developed for its ability to encourage reluctant cattle to travel long distances and may be the best breed in the world for this work. However, some working dog trainers have expressed concern that dogs bred for the show ring are increasingly too short in the legs and too stocky in the body to undertake the work for which they were originally bred.\nAmong the most popular activities for an Australian Cattle Dog is dog agility. It is ideally suited for navigating obstacle courses, since as a herding dog it is reactive to the handler's body language and willing to work accurately at a distance from the handler. Agility has been used by Cattle Dog owners to instil confidence in their dogs, and enhance their performance in training and competition.\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog thrives on change and new experiences, and many handlers find training the breed challenging for this reason. An Australian Cattle Dog can excel in obedience competition. It will enjoy the challenges, such as retrieving a scented article, but the breed's problem-solving ability may lead it to find solutions to problems that are not necessarily rewarded by the obedience judges. Rally obedience offers more interaction with the owner and less repetition than traditional obedience trials.\n\nAustralian Cattle Dogs have been successful in a range of dog sports including weight pulling, flyball and schutzhund. The breed is particularly suited to activities that a dog can share with its owner such as canicross, disc dog, and skijoring or bikejoring. It is an effective hiking companion because of its natural endurance, its general lack of interest in hunting, and preference for staying by its owner's side. Most Australian Cattle Dogs love the water and are excellent swimmers. It is not a hyperactive breed, and once one has had its exercise, it is happy to lie at its owner's feet, or to rest in its bed or crate while keeping an ear and eye open for signs of pending activity. The Australian Cattle Dog is an adaptable dog that can accept city or indoor living conditions, if its considerable exercise and companionship needs are met.\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog can be put to work in a number of ways. Cattle Dogs are service dogs for people with a disability or are therapy dogs, some work for customs agencies in drug detection, some as police dogs, others haze pest animals, such as geese, for city or state agencies, and some work as scat-detection dogs, tracking endangered wildlife species.\n\nIn a small sample of 11 deceased dogs, Australian Cattle Dogs had a median longevity of 11.7 years (maximum 15.9 yrs). A larger survey of 100 deceased dogs yielded a mean longevity of 13.41 years with a standard deviation of 2.36 years. The median longevities of breeds of similar size are between 11 and 13 years. There is an anecdotal report of a Cattle Dog named Bluey, born in 1910 and living for 29.5 years, but the record is unverified. Even if true, Bluey's record age would have to be regarded more as an uncharacteristic exception than as an indicator of common exceptional longevity for the entire breed. It remains, however, that Australian Cattle Dogs generally age well and appear to live on average almost a year longer than most dogs of other breeds in the same weight class. Many members of the breed are still well and active at 12 or 14 years of age, and some maintain their sight, hearing and even their teeth until their final days.\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog carries recessive piebald alleles that produce white in the coat and skin and are linked to congenital hereditary deafness, though it is possible that there is a multi-gene cause for deafness in a dog with the piebald pigment genes. Around 2.4% of Cattle Dogs in one study were found to be deaf in both ears and 14.5% were deaf in at least one ear.\n\nThe Australian Cattle Dog is one of the dog breeds affected by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the rods and cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in blindness. PRCD is an autosomal recessive trait and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.\n\nHip dysplasia is not common in the breed, although it occurs sufficiently often for many breeders to have their breeding stock tested. The Cattle Dog has a number of inherited conditions, but most of these are not common. Hereditary polioencephalomyelopathy of the Australian Cattle Dog is a very rare condition caused by an inherited biochemical defect. Dogs identified with the condition were completely paralysed within their first year. Based on a sample of 69 still-living dogs, the most common health issues noted by owners were musculoskeletal (spondylosis, elbow dysplasia, and arthritis) and reproductive (pyometra, infertility, and false pregnancy), and blindness. A study of dogs diagnosed at Veterinary Colleges in the United States and Canada over a thirty-year period described fractures, lameness and cruciate ligament tears as the most common conditions in the Australian Cattle Dogs treated.\n\nGeorge Hall and his family arrived in the New South Wales Colony in 1802. By 1825, the Halls had established two cattle stations in the Upper Hunter Valley, and had begun a northward expansion into the Liverpool Plains, New England and Queensland. Getting his cattle to the Sydney markets presented a problem in that thousands of head of cattle had to be moved for thousands of kilometres along unfenced stock routes through sometimes rugged bush and mountain ranges. A note, in his own writing, records Thomas Hall's anger at losing 200 head in scrub.\n\nA droving dog was needed, but the colonial working dogs are understood to have been of the Old English Sheepdog type, commonly referred to as Smithfields. Descendants of these dogs still exist, but are useful only over short distances and for yard work with domesticated cattle. Thomas Hall addressed the problem by importing several of the dogs used by drovers in Northumberland, his parents' home county. At that time dogs were generally described by their job, regardless of whether they constituted a breed as it is currently understood. In the manner of the time, the Hall family historian, A. J. Howard, gave these blue mottled dogs a name: Northumberland Blue Merle Drovers Dog.\n\nThomas Hall crossed his Drovers Dogs with dingoes he had tamed, and by 1840 was satisfied with his resulting progeny. During the next thirty years, the Halls Heelers, as they became known, were used only by the Halls. Given that they were dependent on the dogs, which gave them an advantage over other cattle breeders, it is understandable that the dogs were not distributed beyond the Hall's properties. It was not until after Thomas Hall's death in 1870, when the properties went to auction with the stock on them, that Halls Heelers became freely available.\nBy the 1890s, the dogs had attracted the attention of the \"Cattle Dog Club of Sydney\", a group of men with a recreational interest in the new practice of showing dogs competitively. None were stockmen working cattle on a daily basis, and initially they were interested in a range of working dogs, including the Smithfield. They reportedly adopted the term \"Australian Cattle Dog\" to refer to the dogs being bred from bloodlines originating from Thomas Hall's \"heelers\", and prominent members of the group concentrated on breeding these lines. Of these breeders, the Bagust family was the most influential. Robert Kaleski, of Moorebank, a young associate of Harry Bagust, wrote \"in 1893 when I got rid of my cross-bred cattle dogs and took up the blues, breeders of the latter had started breeding ... to fix the type. I drew up a standard for them on those lines\". This first breed standard for the Cattle Dog breed was published, with photographs, by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture in 1903.\n\nKaleski's standard was adopted by breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into the early history of the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more dingo in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia at the beginning of the 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.\n\nThrough the 1890s, Cattle Dogs of Halls Heeler derivations were seen in the kennels of exhibiting Queensland dog breeders such as William Byrne of Booval, and these were a different population from those shown in New South Wales. \"Little Logic\" was bred in Rockdale, New South Wales, however Sydney exhibitors saw \"Little Logic\" for the first time after the dog had been added to the \"Hillview\" kennels of Arch Bevis in Brisbane. The show records of \"Little Logic\" and his offspring created a demand in New South Wales for Queensland dogs. By the end of the 1950s, there were few Australian Cattle Dogs whelped that were not descendants of \"Little Logic\" and his best known son, \"Logic Return\". The success and popularity of these dogs led to the growth of the nickname \"Queensland Heeler\".\n\nThe prominence of \"Little Logic\" and \"Logic Return\" in the pedigrees of modern Australian Cattle Dogs was perpetuated by Wooleston Kennels. For some twenty years, Wooleston supplied foundation and supplementary breeding stock to breeders in Australia, North America and Continental Europe. As a result, \"Wooleston Blue Jack\" is ancestral to most, if not all, Australian Cattle Dogs whelped since 1990 in any country.\n\nIn the 1940s Alan McNiven, a Sydney veterinarian, introduced Dingo, Kelpie, German Shepherd, and Kangaroo Hound into his breeding program; however, the Royal Agricultural Society Kennel Club (RASKC) would not register the cross breeds as Australian Cattle Dogs, even though McNiven argued they were true to conformation, colour and temperament. McNiven responded by giving his pups registration papers from dead dogs, and was consequently expelled from the RASKC and all of his dogs removed from the registry. Meanwhile, Greg Lougher, a Napa, California cattle rancher who met Alan McNiven while stationed in Australia during World War II, had imported several adults and several litters from McNiven. After his de-registration McNiven continued to export his \"improved\" dogs to the United States. Many U.S. soldiers who were stationed in Queensland or NSW during the War discovered the Australian Cattle Dog and took one home when they returned.\n\nIn the late 1950s a veterinarian in Santa Rosa, California, Jack Woolsey, was introduced to Lougher's dogs. With his partners, he bought several dogs and started breeding them. The breeders advertised the dogs in \"Western Horsemen\" stating they were guaranteed to work and calling them Queensland Heelers. Woolsey imported several purebred Australian Cattle Dogs to add to his breeding program, including \"Oaklea Blue Ace\", \"Glen Iris Boomerang\" and several Glen Iris bitches. The National Stock Dog Registry of Butler, Indiana, registered the breed, assigning American numbers without reference to Australian registrations.\n\nAustralian Cattle Dogs had been classified in the \"miscellaneous\" category at the American Kennel Club (AKC) since the 1930s; to get the breed full recognition, the AKC required that a National Breed Parent Club be organised for promotion and protection of the breed. In 1967 Esther Ekman met Chris Smith-Risk at an AKC show, and the two fell into conversation about their Australian Cattle Dogs and the process of establishing a parent club for the breed. By 1969 the fledgling club had 12 members and formally applied to the AKC for instructions. One of the requirements was that the Club had to start keeping its own registry for the breed and that all dogs on the registry would have to be an extension of the Australian registry, tracing back to registered dogs in Australia. The AKC Parent Club members began researching their dogs, including exchanging correspondence with McNiven, and discovered that few of them had dogs that could be traced back to dogs registered in Australia. The AKC took over the club registry in 1979 and the breed was fully recognised in September 1980. The Australian Cattle Dog Club of America is still active in the promotion of the breed and the maintenance of breed standards. The National Stock Dog Registry continued to recognise Cattle Dogs without prerequisite links to Australian registered dogs, on the condition that any dog of unknown parentage that was presented for registry would be registered as an \"American Cattle Dog\", and all others would still be registered as \"Australian Cattle Dogs\".\n\nThe breed gained official recognition from the Canadian Kennel Club in January 1980 after five years of collecting pedigrees, gathering support, and lobbying officials by two breeders and enthusiasts. The small number of Australian Cattle Dogs in Canada at the time were primarily working dogs on farms and ranches scattered across large distances. However, the fledgling breed club held conformation shows, obedience and agility competitions, and entered their dogs in sports including flyball and lure coursing. At the end of 1980, \"Landmaster Carina\" was named the first Australian Cattle Dog in Canada to gain both her conformation and obedience titles.\n\nThe first registered Australian Cattle Dogs to arrive in the United Kingdom were two blue puppies, \"Lenthal Flinton\" and \"Lenthal Darlot\", followed in 1980 by \"Landmaster Darling Red\" in whelp. \"Landmaster Darling Red\" was imported by John and Mary Holmes, and proved to be an outstanding brood bitch. Over the next few years additional Cattle Dogs arrived in the UK from the Netherlands, Kenya, Germany and Australia, although prior to relaxation of rules regarding artificial insemination, the UK gene pool was limited. In 1985 an Australian Cattle Dog Society was formed and officially recognised by the Kennel Club; before this they had to compete in the category \"Any Variety Not Separately Classified\". Australian Cattle Dogs were competing successfully in obedience and working trials in the UK during the 1980s.\n\nThe Texas Heeler is a cross between the Australian Cattle Dog and the Australian Shepherd that was first registered with the Animal Research Foundation (ARF) in 1970. The ARF has registered Australian Cattle Dogs without papers as \"Australian Cattledog Queensland Heelers\" since 1965 and was the first organisation to recognise the Australian Shepherd. Although originally bred for its ability to work cattle, the Texas Heeler is increasingly used as a pet and a companion in dog sports. As with most cross breeds, the Texas Heeler's size and appearance is a variable combination of the parent breeds.\n\n"

                "Shaun White\n\nShaun Roger White (born September 3, 1986) is an American professional snowboarder and skateboarder. He is a two-time Olympic gold medalist. He holds the record for the most X-Games gold medals and has won 10 ESPY Awards.\n\nWhite was born in San Diego, California. His ancestry includes Irish and Italian. He was born with a Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect for which he endured two open-heart operations before the age of one. He stands 5'8\" (1.73 m) tall. White spent his formative years riding Okemo Mountain and Bear Mountain, small ski resorts found in Ludlow, Vermont, and the San Bernardino Mountains of Southern California.\n\nWhite quickly drew the eyes of many in the skateboarder scene, including professional skateboarder Tony Hawk. Hawk befriended the nine-year-old White at a local skatepark and mentored him, helping him turn pro in skateboarding at the age of 17. White has won many titles on his skateboard, including the overall title of Action Sports Tour Champion, and was the first person to compete in and win both the Summer and Winter X Games in two different sports.\n\nFollowing in his older brother's footsteps, White switched from skiing to snowboarding at age six, and by age seven he received his first sponsorship. White has participated in three Winter Olympics in his career. At both the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics, White won gold in the snowboard halfpipe event. White has also participated in the Winter X Games, where he has won a medal every year since 2002. Including all winter X Games competitions through 2013, his medal count stands at 18 (13 gold, 3 silver, 2 bronze), among which is the first quadruple win streak by a male athlete in one discipline, the snowboard slopestyle. White's streak was snapped in 2007 when he lost to Andreas Wiig and Teddy Flandreau, with White taking the bronze. He won the Air & Style Contest in 2003 and 2004.\n\nAt the 2006 Winter Olympics, White won gold in the half-pipe. After his first run in qualifications, White was almost out of competition, scoring only 37.7. On his second run, he recorded a score of 45.3. In the finals, White recorded a score of 46.8 (50 is the highest possible score) to win. Fellow American Danny Kass won the silver with a points total of 44.0.\n\nExecuting a near-flawless second run, White captured his third consecutive snowboard halfpipe title at the 2008 U.S. Open Snowboarding Championships to go along with his third US Open slopestyle competition. This followed White's win at the 25th (2007) Burton US Open, where he placed third in slopestlyle and first in the halfpipe. At the 2007 Open, White was also crowned the first \"Burton Global Open Champion\". His take for the event was $100,000 (Global Open Champ), $20,000 (1st Place Halfpipe), $90,000 (3rd Place Slopestyle), and a new Corvette.\n\nOn November 16, 2008, White released his first videogame \"Shaun White Snowboarding\" in North America (November 14, 2008, in Europe). \"Shaun White:Snowboarding\" was the 20th best-selling game of December 2008 in the United States.\n\nThere was a lot of controversy over who won the 2009 SuperPipe at Winter X Games XIII. Kevin Pearce had 5 hits in the pipe, and all were the same tricks White did in his final run. White, on the other hand, had 6 hits and he started off his run with a big backside rodeo 540 where Pearce started his run off with a big grab. Although Pearce went bigger, he had only 5 hits, and his first hit wasn't as technical as White's first hit. Judges came to the conclusion that White deserved the better score because he started off with a more technical trick and he had 1 more hit than Pearce. With the win, White became the second competitor, after Tanner Hall, to win a gold medal in the superpipe in consecutive years at the Winter X Games. He also won a gold medal in Slopestyle, finally winning gold after 2 straight years of bronze.\n\nOn February 14, 2009, White won the FIS World Cup Men's Halfpipe event at Vancouver's Cypress Mountain. Out of the gate in his first qualifying run, he qualified immediately with the day's best score of 45.5. With a thumb sprained on an over-rotated backside 1080 in the second qualifying run, he clinched the event with the first of his two runs in the finals. His first finals run was awarded the highest score ever in FIS halfpipe, a 47.3.\n\nAt the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, White again won gold in the halfpipe. In the finals, White recorded a score of 46.8 on his first run, which proved a high enough score to secure the gold medal without a second run. He performed his second run anyway, as a victory lap, ending his run with a well-anticipated Double McTwist 1260 which he named The Tomahawk. This second run resulted in a record score of 48.4 (50 is the highest possible score) enlarging his margin of victory. His nearest competitor won the silver with a points total of 45.0, 3.4 behind White.\n\nAfter a sub-par performance in the Slopestyle, failing to reach the finals, White \"redeemed\" himself in the Superpipe. With an 89, he sat in second place going into his 2nd of three runs. He completed the run, landing his infamous Double McTwist 1260 and finishing with a score of 97.33 to take the lead and claim the historical 4th straight Gold in the Winter X Games, held in Aspen Colorado. The score tied an X Games record which was set by White one year before. His 3rd run was a simple victory run featuring mostly straight air.\n\nAt Winter X, White became the first person to score a perfect 100 in the men's Snowboard Superpipe in the history of Winter X Games.\n\nWhite won his 6th consecutive SuperPipe victory, placing him as the second participant to ever achieve this, with SnoCross racer Tucker Hibbert achieving his 6th consecutive victory earlier in the same day.\n\nIn December 2013, he won the third place in the Pipe & Slope contest at the FIS Snowboard World Cup in Copper Mountain, Colorado.\n\nWhite finished fourth at the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Halfpipe event.\n\nDuring the winter games, he was the most talked-about Olympic athlete on Facebook.\n\nWhile in New Zealand, training for the 2018 Winter Olympics, Shaun White crashed into the edge of a superpipe. The resulting injuries to his face required 62 stitches. Despite the incident, Shaun White qualified for the 2018 US Olympic Team.\n\n\n\nWhite has had a sponsor since he was seven years old. White signed CAA Sports for representation after working with IMG for eight years. Corporate endorsement deals include or have included Burton Snowboards, Oakley, Inc., Birdhouse Skateboards, Park City Mountain Resort, Target Corporation, Red Bull, Ubisoft, Adio and Hewlett-Packard. White also has his own character on the game \"Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder\" as well as the video games \"Shaun White Snowboarding\" and \"Shaun White Skateboarding\". In 2009, \"Forbes\" magazine estimated that he had earned $9 million from his endorsements in 2008.\n\nWhite has made cameo appearance as himself in the 2011 film \"Friends with Benefits\", the 2013 episode \"Da Flippity Flop\" of the animated TV series \"American Dad!\", and the 2014 Disney Channel Original Movie \"Cloud 9\".\n\nIn a 2007 interview with \"Outside\" magazine, White stated that he had turned down numerous film roles in which \"the first lines [for his character] are always \"What up, brah?'\".\n\nWhite plays guitar in the electronic rock band Bad Things, which also features former Augustana bassist Jared Palomar. The band played in one of the four Saturday headlining slots at the 2013 Lollapalooza festival, as a last minute replacement for Death Grips. Their self-titled debut album was released in January 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Bad Things drummer Lena Zawaideh brought a lawsuit against White, claiming sexual harassment and breach of contract. White and Zawaideh reached an out-of-court settlement in May 2017; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.\n\nIn October 2013, White appeared in the music video for \"City of Angels\" by Thirty Seconds to Mars.\n\n\nWhite has had the longstanding nickname \"The Flying Tomato\", due to his shock of red hair. In 2006, \"Rolling Stone\" wrote about the nickname, \"he used to embrace it, even wearing headbands with a flying-tomato logo, but he has grown tired of it.\" He has also been nicknamed \"animal\", a reference to a character from \"The Muppet Show\".\n\nIn February 2009, Red Bull built White a halfpipe completely out of natural snow in the back country of Colorado on the backside of Silverton Mountain, coordinates (37.838801,-107.710299).\n\nOn September 17, 2012, White was arrested near a hotel in Nashville for public intoxication and vandalism after attending the wedding party of the drummer of The Black Keys, Patrick Carney.\n\n\n",
                "Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder)\n\nPaul Martin Rodriguez Jr. (born December 31, 1984), also known by his nickname P-Rod, is an American professional street skateboarder and actor. Rodriguez has won a total of eight medals at the X Games, four of them gold, with the most recent first-place victory occurring in Los Angeles, United States (U.S.) in July 2012.\n\nRodriguez was born in Tarzana, California, U.S. His father is actor/comedian Paul Rodriguez, and his mother is Laura Martinez. He also has a sister Nikole, and a brother Lucas. \n\nAs a child, Rodriguez occasionally got to meet celebrities through his father. In a later interview, he recounted one such memory:\n\nI'll tell you a good story about Mr. T. I believe it was 1988, every year there was a Christmas Day parade in Pasadena [California, US]; I was probably about three-and-a-half, four years-old—I loved Mr. T. He had the cartoon out at the time and all that. We're, were there at the banquet before the parade started 'cause my dad brought me to take me in the car to wave at the crowd, or whatever. And, ah, I had to go to the bathroom, my dad was getting interviewed, and, like, I tried to tell him; Mr. T was just standing there, chilling, 'cause they were just talking, and Mr. T goes, \"I'll take you\". And he throws me up on his shoulders, and I'm sitting up on top of all his gold chains. I remember it perfectly and he put me on top of his shoulders and walked me to the bathroom; like, just waited outside for me, and it was sick. Mr. T chauffeured me to [the bathroom].\n\nRodriguez's nickname \"P-Rod\" was given to him by his classmates when he was around eleven years old.\n\nWhen he was twelve, Rodriguez received his first skateboard as a Christmas gift from his parents. Rodriguez had seen a group of skateboarders at his new school and was immediately fascinated by \"how they kept their board to their feet and how they could flip it.\" Rodriguez said in June 2014: \"I got money, got myself a board, and it was game over.\"\n\nRodriguez stated in a July 2013 interview that he slept with new skateboard products as a child due to his passion for skateboarding, and admitted that he slept with his first Street League Skateboarding (SLS) trophy.\n\nRodriguez attended Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, CA.\n\nRodriguez was initially recruited to the team of a local skateboard shop named \"One Eighteen\", managed by an Andy Netkin, who was 19 years old at the time, while Rodriguez had just become 14 years old. As he was too shy at the time, Rodriguez asked a friend to submit his \"Sponsor me\" video tape to Netkin, who was immediately impressed and asked the friend to bring Rodriguez into the store. Netkin then offered Rodriguez a place on the store team the following day at their first meeting—Netkin explained in 2014 that, at the time, he had a strong sense of Rodriguez's future as a \"superstar.\" DNA Skateboards was Rodriguez's first company sponsor and he appeared in the 1999 video \"Microanalysis\". Former professional skateboarder Anthony Pappalardo stated in a June 24, 2014 online radio show—hosted by professional skateboarder Alex Olsen—that he encouraged Joe Castrucci, cofounder of the Habitat skateboard brand, to recruit Rodriguez before he was officially sponsored, but Castrucci declined.\n\nAt age sixteen, Rodriguez then rode for City Stars, a company founded by professional skateboarder Kareem Campbell in Los Angeles, U.S. Despite being an amateur at the time, Rodriguez earned the last part in the video \"Street Cinema\", which is an honor typically bestowed to an esteemed professional of the team. Rodriguez explained in 2014 that he was initially opposed to Campbell's use of the Jackson 5 song \"I Want You Back\" for the first half of his part, as it had been used for Guy Mariano's part in the Blind Skateboards video \"Video Days\", but conceded that at the time he \"was oblivious to the statement he [Campbell] was trying to make by choosing that song.\"\n\nAlongside Mikey Taylor, Justin Case, Devine Calloway and Kevin \"Spanky\" Long, Rodriguez was an amateur team member, while the professional team included Lee Smith, Joey Suriel, Ryan Denman and Eric Pupecki. Rodriguez developed his interest in jewelry during this period, as Campbell was a collector and purchased Rodriguez a diamond bracelet. The period also influenced Rodriguez's musical taste, as he commenced listening to artists like Jay-Z and Nas due to the time spent with Campbell.\n\nCity Stars had planned to release a signature skateboard deck design, featuring Rodriguez's name on the grill of a Mercedes Benz (Rodriguez's first car), but Rodriguez's departure from the company resulted in the product's cancellation. Rodriguez explained in February 2013: \"I specifically remember that I knew I wanted to quit and I felt like I could at least show enough respect and tell them before they spent all that money to print up my boards. I didn’t want to leave them with an inventory of boards they couldn’t sell so I made sure to quit well before they went into production.\" In 2014 Rodriguez described his time at the brand as \"the most magical,\" with a team that possessed \"enthusiasm and passion\" that was \"contagious.\"\n\nRodriguez was featured in Transworld Skateboarding's 2002 video, \"In Bloom\". This video showcased a segment of sponsored, talented skaters who were at the start of their respective careers. Following the video's release, Rodriguez commenced riding for Girl Skateboards and achieved professional status in September 2002. Rodriguez explained in a 2013 interview that he was asked to join the Girl team by Eric Koston, whom he called his all-time favorite skateboarder. Rodriguez said that it was the most significant event in his skateboarding career, as it was, \"the moment that my dream happened.\" \nRodriguez was sponsored by Girl from the age of seventeen to nineteen, and appears in the Girl Skateboards film \"Yeah Right\". During this period, he shared a house with professional skateboarder and rap artist Jereme Rogers.\n\nIn February 2013, Rodriguez identified his debut professional signature skateboard with Girl as his favorite deck graphic of all-time. The deck, released in 2002, featured the original Girl logo, Rodriguez's name (written in English), and the Spanish word \"Muchachita\", meaning \"girl\", instead of the usual \"Girl\" brand name. Rodriguez stated that \"That was my first pro board and to have it on a company like Girl was awesome.\" In April 2013 Rodriguez explained that he \"loved\" his time with the Girl company and, prior to receiving contact from Danny Way—who asked him to join the relaunched Plan B company—he considered Girl a lifelong sponsor.\n\nFollowing Girl, Rodriguez joined the relaunched Plan B skateboard deck brand that was under the ownership and guidance of original riders Danny Way and Colin McKay, who continue to own the brand as of March 2014.\n\nRodriguez released a solo Plan B video part, entitled \"Me, Myself, and I\", in 2010. The inaugural Plan B full-length video has been a topic of discussion among the global skateboarding community for a prolonged duration of time, as promotional footage has been released and the company has been in existence for a significant period of time, with a renowned team established during this time period. A late November episode of the internet-based, weekly program, \"Skateline\", broadcast on the RIDE Channel, showed footage of company co-owner and team rider, Danny Way, stating that the video would be made according to a schedule determined by the company regardless of external pressure.\n\nSeven out of Rodriguez's top ten skateboard graphics of all time are Plan B Rodriguez signature designs, according to an interview that was published in February 2013. A collaboration between Plan B and Nike SB is Rodriguez's second favorite graphic, while a Bruce Lee \"Fury\" deck (\"Needless to say, Bruce Lee is my number one influence other than Jesus Christ ... it also shows the three scrapes he had on his face from \"Enter The Dragon\". I love this one.\") and a Muhammad Ali deck were also included in the list.\n\nIn a July 2013 radio interview with Big Boi on Los Angeles' Power 106, Rodriguez confirmed his departure, which had already been widely speculated. During his winning performance at Stop 5 of the 2013 Street League Skateboarding contest in Portland, Oregon, U.S., Rodriguez rode a skateboard deck with the Plan B logo painted over and the company's logo was removed from his personal website as of July 16, 2013. Rodriguez explained in the interview that he is seeking to \"own a little bit more of myself.\"\n\nIn June 2014, following the launch of his own skateboard deck company, Primitive Skateboarding, and his eighth signature shoe with Nike, Rodriguez explained his perspective on the future:\nIt got to a point where I wanted to get my name on a board and did that, wanted my name on a shoe and did that, wanted other endorsements, awards, and to win certain competitions, and did those, too ... Now it’s back to just wanting to get better. I want to keep improving my abilities.\n\nThe design for his Nike signature shoe was first leaked onto the Internet at the beginning of the year, leading to an intense degree of discussion among consumers, described by the Ripped Laces website as \"hate/skepticism.\" The corresponding advertisement featured Nike SB team member, Theotis Beasley, and was produced by the Wieden + Kennedy agency.\n\nIn a promotional day-in-the-life photo diary for the Hypebeast website, published on December 16, 2014, Rodriguez revealed that his personal skateboarding park is scheduled for a remodeling process. He also stated that his daily caffeine fix brings \"happiness,\" and that the only time his mind is clear is while he is skateboarding.\n\nAt the beginning of 2015, Rodriguez joined the Glassy Sunhaters sunglasses brand, co-owned by fellow professional skateboarder Mike Mo Capaldi. His signature sunglasses model was release in February 2015.\n\nRodriguez launched his own skateboard brand, Primitive Skateboarding, in April 2014, with the initial team consisting of himself, Nick Tucker and Carlos Ribeiro.\n\nAs of January 19, 2016, Rodriguez is sponsored by Primitive Skateboarding, Nike Skateboarding, Target, Nixon Watches, Incase Designs, Primitive Skateshop, Glassy Sunhaters, Markisa, Venture, Andalé Bearings As of June 2014, Rodriguez is managed by Circe Wallace.\n\nRodriguez is a senior team rider for the Nike skateboarding division, having released his eighth skate shoe model in May 2014, and was responsible for welcoming Luan Oliviera to Nike in September 2012. Rodriguez released his first signature Nike shoe in 2005 following his departure from skate shoe brand, eS. Rodriguez explained in a 2012 interview for the \"Footnotes\" segment on the Berrics website:\nThe transition from eS to Nike was—after I got through making the phone call—I had to call Koston; I had to call, you know, Tony at eS; had to call a few people 'cause we were close; we were good family over there. So, after I got through that hard part, and I could just, and I was free of that burden, then when I got on Nike, it was just, like, the world was opened up—it was insane.\n\nRodriguez was one of the early riders to be approached by Nike following its second attempt to succeed in the skateboarding market and sub-culture. Rodriguez has explained:\nUm, my thoughts on Nike when they first approached me were cool. I mean, like, I did get some criticisms, selling out, this and that ... and I never really been too worried 'bout that criticism. So my thoughts were just like, I look at it like this, like: My first pair of shoes were the baby Jordans [basketball player, Michael Jordan], you know what I mean, so, like, I had Nikes all my life growing up, and even at the time that I was on eS, any time that I was not skating, I wearing some white-on-white Air Force Ones, or Cortezs—I had a whole flock of Nike anyway ... the way I looked at it, was like, I've been a Nike supporter since birth. So me, I was just stoked, I was just hyped to get on Nike.\n\nRodriguez released his seventh signature model shoe, entitled the \"Paul Rodriguez 7,\" with Nike in mid-2013. It was designed with Shawn Carboy, who Rodriguez first started working with during the design of his fifth signature model. Rodriguez prioritized the functionality of the shoe, and impact protection is its primary feature.\n\nThe \"P-ROD 8\", Rodriguez's eighth signature shoe was released in May 2014. On May 25, 2014, Rodriguez, alongside fellow Nike team member and skateboarding veteran, Lance Mountain, promoted the model in a video interview, whereby the history of the Nike shoe in skateboarding culture forms the foundation of the segment—Mountain explained that prior to the official launch of the Nike brand onto the skateboarding market, skateboarders said, \"This [Nike] is our shoe\". Rodriguez described himself as a \"Jordan baby\", growing up during the peak of Michael Jordan's career, and explained that his eighth Nike shoe model is an \"homage to all those things I grew up loving—even before I met skateboarding. And now it's intertwined.\" The P-ROD 8 features three of Nike's shoe technology developments: \"Lunarlon\", \"Flywire\" and \"Hyperscreen\". (Rodriguez explained in the video with Mountain that the Flywire grips around the foot in the event of a significant fall during the act of skateboarding.)\n\nFollowing the release of the P-ROD 8, Rodriguez was informed by a Nike executive that he is one of only four Nike athletes to have produced eight signature shoe models—the other being Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. In 2014, having been sponsored by Nike for ten years, Rodriguez stated: \"it feels like I've also grown with them. I’ve become intertwined with Nike. Our stories are together — at least with Nike SB. The process of making a shoe, at this point, is like a well-oiled machine.\"\n\nOn August 13, 2010, the Target corporation announced in a press release that Rodriguez had joined its sponsorship ranks. He became the second professional skateboarder to have a sponsorship deal with Target, the first being Shaun White, though White is better known for snowboarding. A Target representative stated in the press release, \"Paul is an amazing competitor and is the perfect personality to add to our program. With so many accomplishments and a promising future ahead of him, Paul is a natural fit for Target and we’re proud to have our brand represented on his skateboard.\" Rodriguez was also quoted in the press release: \"I grew up right across the street from a Target and have many memories of skating over to the store as a kid. I’ve always loved their brand and am excited about the relationship and potential of what we can do together.\"\n\nIn 2012 Rodriguez participated in a competition with AT&T that allowed the winner to participate in the filming of a promotional video featuring Rodriguez. The final video also featured professional skateboarder, Manny Santiago, and was directed by Nigel Alexander, a long-time friend of Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez owns a private skateboard park in the Canoga Park area of California, U.S. that features design elements from his sponsors, Mountain Dew, Nike SB, and Target. Rodriguez designed the park with skateboard park builder Mike Roebke, who used a computer program to blend his own ideas with drawings from Rodriguez. Rodriguez has stated, \"I enjoy skating there and I'm blessed to have that type of place at my fingertips.\"\n\nIn collaboration with the Network A media company, Rodriguez is featured in a six-part internet-based series about himself entitled \"LIFE\". The series, produced and directed by professional skateboarder Steve Berra, was released on a weekly basis on the company's YouTube channel..\n\nThe first episode \"Family First\" follows Rodriguez as he revisits his grandmother's home following her cancer diagnosis (Rodriguez foregoes competing at the notable Tampa Pro contest to undertake the visit). Rodriguez explained in 2013 that Berra was the only other person to accompany him during his visit to his grandmother's home, as Rodriguez trusted Berra to be present. In the second episode, entitled \"mASTA of disASTA\", Rodriguez prepares to compete against Tom Asta in the Battle of the Berrics competition.\n\nIn the third episode, \"Street League Matters\", Rodriguez is filmed in Kansas City, U.S., as he prepares for the qualifying round of one of the stops of the Street League competition. The episode shows Rodriguez as he finishes in fourth place. The fourth episode of \"LIFE\" follows Rodriguez, together with close friends Heath Brinkley (photographer and filmer), Justine Schulte, and Carlos Zarazua, as he visits New Orleans, U.S. for the opening of hip hop artist Lil' Wayne's skate park in the wake of Hurricane Katrina—the skate park is called the \"Truckstop\" and is located in the Lower Ninth Ward area.\n\nIn \"The Other Half\", the fifth episode of \"LIFE\", the camera follows Rodriguez as he competes in the Dew Tour contest and discusses the role of contests in relation to the more fundamental aspects of a professional street skateboarder's life—video footage and street skateboarding.\n\n\"Transworld SKATEboarding\" selected Rodriguez for the thirtieth position of its \"30 Most Influential Skaters of All Time\" list, released in December 2011. In response to the selection, Rodriguez revealed that Koston and Andrew Reynolds are two professional skateboarders who he considers as influential in a career sense, due to their \"longevity\", \"the impacts they’ve had\", and the degree of respect they have garnered. In an April 2013 interview, Rodriguez added Tom Penny to his \"most influential\" list and stated, \"Him [Penny], Koston and Reynolds. That's my combo right there.\". \nIn regard to Rodriguez, professional skateboarder Nyjah Huston explained in December 2013:\nHe is such a good dude, on and off the [skate]board. He's such a professional person. He's an amazing street skater, and just as good of a contest skater. So, he's a pretty ideal professional skateboarder, that's for sure.\n\nAs of June 2014, Rodriguez is the owner of, or an investor in, the skateboard brands Primitive (retail outlet, apparel and skateboard deck company), Markisa (wallets and accessories) and Andale (skateboard bearings), the latter in partnership with fellow professional skateboarder Joey Brezinski. In relation to Andale, Brezinski explained:\nOriginally I was working on the idea and I went through all the legal stuff. I quit my bearing sponsor at the time and I started talking to Paul about it because he had recently quit Silver at that point. I didn't know if he had plans with FKD or not, but I presented Andale to him as something we could do together. He was down and I proceeded to move forward. It took about two years to get to this point, doing a lot of work and a lot of planning.\n\nThe Primitive company consists of a retail store that is located in Los Angeles, U.S. (specializes in footwear), an apparel line and a skateboard deck brand. Rodriguez established the business in around 2005/2006 with three partners, including two friends whom he has known since childhood. In April 2014, Rodriguez was identified as the president of the company, while Netkin is the CEO and founder, and Jubal Jones is the creative director—Netkin and Jones were the original store employees and handled US$300 in sales on the opening day. Netkin describes the Primitive store, which officially opened on July 27, 2008, as a \"cross-genre\" retail outlet that also sells products, which skateboarders can relate to, outside of the skateboarding subculture.\n\nFollowing the eventual success of the retail outlet, the company commenced its apparel brand, which was a part of the founders' original plan. The popularity of the apparel brand grew rapidly and in April 2014, Jones stated that he solely focuses on the brand, while new employees are constantly hired. In 2014 Primitive Apparel is available in 11 countries and the company consists of 25 people.\n\nThe Primitive brand was expanded into a skateboard deck company called \"Primitive Skateboarding\" in April 2014.\n\nTogether with action sports filmmaker Josh Landon and professional US skateboarder Mikey Taylor, Rodriguez cofounded the Saint Archer Brewing Co., a microbrewery that is co-owned by people who are also the brand's \"Ambassadors.\" The team of Ambassadors includes professional skateboarders Eric Koston, Brian \"Slash\" Hansen, and Bryan Herman; professional and non-professional surfers Josh Kerr, Taylor Knox, Dusty Payne, Laura Enever, and Jeff Johnson; former professional snowboarder Todd Richards; photographer Atiba Jefferson; and surfboard shaper Chris Christenson. Together with Saint Archer's other Ambassadors, Rodriguez has participated in \"Tasting Room\" nights that are held at the brewery, in which the Ambassadors pour and serve beers.\n\nIn a June 2014 interview, Rodriguez asserted that he is a \"young, beginning entrepreneur who’s learning the ropes of the game,\" before revealing the philosophy that has benefited him over the course of his career: \"find people that are just as passionate at what they do as you are about what you do.\"\n\nAs of November 2013, Rodriguez resides in Northridge, California. As of August 2010, his partner was Rainbow Alexander and the pair are the parents of daughter Heaven Love. In July 2013, photographs of Rodriguez dating a woman named Rachel Metz were published on the Internet. In an April 2013 interview, Rodriguez described himself as a \"certified workaholic\", and stated that skateboarding and fatherhood are his primary concerns in life. In regard to his Mexican American heritage, Rodriguez has explained:\nIt's my roots. It's where I come from; it's my genetics, my DNA, my body, my build. All from my heritage. My ancestors all before me contributed to the blessings I’m living now. It's where you come from. You can never be ignorant to where you come from because they're responsible for what you are now.\n\nRodriguez has stated in an interview with the NetworkA media channel that holds aspirations for a serious acting career following his time with professional skateboarding—he revealed that he admires the work of Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, and Edward Norton. In addition to Bruce Lee, Alexander the Great, and Jesus Christ, Rodriguez is also influenced by rapper Tupac Shakur, and revealed in February 2013 that a skateboard deck graphic featuring Shakur would be a worthwhile design: \"I’d like to get that photo of Tupac standing on the wall with his shirt off and he’s got the Thug Life tattoo and the glock in his waist band and a blunt in his hand. That would be sick.\"\n\nRodriguez received the 2002 \"Rookie of the Year\" award from the \"Transworld SKATEboarding\" publication.\n\nWe are Blood 2015\n\nBronze: 2003 Los Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n",

                "Shaun White\n\nShaun Roger White (born September 3, 1986) is an American professional snowboarder and skateboarder. He is a two-time Olympic gold medalist. He holds the record for the most X-Games gold medals and has won 10 ESPY Awards.\n\nWhite was born in San Diego, California. His ancestry includes Irish and Italian. He was born with a Tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect for which he endured two open-heart operations before the age of one. He stands 5'8\" (1.73 m) tall. White spent his formative years riding Okemo Mountain and Bear Mountain, small ski resorts found in Ludlow, Vermont, and the San Bernardino Mountains of Southern California.\n\nWhite quickly drew the eyes of many in the skateboarder scene, including professional skateboarder Tony Hawk. Hawk befriended the nine-year-old White at a local skatepark and mentored him, helping him turn pro in skateboarding at the age of 17. White has won many titles on his skateboard, including the overall title of Action Sports Tour Champion, and was the first person to compete in and win both the Summer and Winter X Games in two different sports.\n\nFollowing in his older brother's footsteps, White switched from skiing to snowboarding at age six, and by age seven he received his first sponsorship. White has participated in three Winter Olympics in his career. At both the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics, White won gold in the snowboard halfpipe event. White has also participated in the Winter X Games, where he has won a medal every year since 2002. Including all winter X Games competitions through 2013, his medal count stands at 18 (13 gold, 3 silver, 2 bronze), among which is the first quadruple win streak by a male athlete in one discipline, the snowboard slopestyle. White's streak was snapped in 2007 when he lost to Andreas Wiig and Teddy Flandreau, with White taking the bronze. He won the Air & Style Contest in 2003 and 2004.\n\nAt the 2006 Winter Olympics, White won gold in the half-pipe. After his first run in qualifications, White was almost out of competition, scoring only 37.7. On his second run, he recorded a score of 45.3. In the finals, White recorded a score of 46.8 (50 is the highest possible score) to win. Fellow American Danny Kass won the silver with a points total of 44.0.\n\nExecuting a near-flawless second run, White captured his third consecutive snowboard halfpipe title at the 2008 U.S. Open Snowboarding Championships to go along with his third US Open slopestyle competition. This followed White's win at the 25th (2007) Burton US Open, where he placed third in slopestlyle and first in the halfpipe. At the 2007 Open, White was also crowned the first \"Burton Global Open Champion\". His take for the event was $100,000 (Global Open Champ), $20,000 (1st Place Halfpipe), $90,000 (3rd Place Slopestyle), and a new Corvette.\n\nOn November 16, 2008, White released his first videogame \"Shaun White Snowboarding\" in North America (November 14, 2008, in Europe). \"Shaun White:Snowboarding\" was the 20th best-selling game of December 2008 in the United States.\n\nThere was a lot of controversy over who won the 2009 SuperPipe at Winter X Games XIII. Kevin Pearce had 5 hits in the pipe, and all were the same tricks White did in his final run. White, on the other hand, had 6 hits and he started off his run with a big backside rodeo 540 where Pearce started his run off with a big grab. Although Pearce went bigger, he had only 5 hits, and his first hit wasn't as technical as White's first hit. Judges came to the conclusion that White deserved the better score because he started off with a more technical trick and he had 1 more hit than Pearce. With the win, White became the second competitor, after Tanner Hall, to win a gold medal in the superpipe in consecutive years at the Winter X Games. He also won a gold medal in Slopestyle, finally winning gold after 2 straight years of bronze.\n\nOn February 14, 2009, White won the FIS World Cup Men's Halfpipe event at Vancouver's Cypress Mountain. Out of the gate in his first qualifying run, he qualified immediately with the day's best score of 45.5. With a thumb sprained on an over-rotated backside 1080 in the second qualifying run, he clinched the event with the first of his two runs in the finals. His first finals run was awarded the highest score ever in FIS halfpipe, a 47.3.\n\nAt the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, White again won gold in the halfpipe. In the finals, White recorded a score of 46.8 on his first run, which proved a high enough score to secure the gold medal without a second run. He performed his second run anyway, as a victory lap, ending his run with a well-anticipated Double McTwist 1260 which he named The Tomahawk. This second run resulted in a record score of 48.4 (50 is the highest possible score) enlarging his margin of victory. His nearest competitor won the silver with a points total of 45.0, 3.4 behind White.\n\nAfter a sub-par performance in the Slopestyle, failing to reach the finals, White \"redeemed\" himself in the Superpipe. With an 89, he sat in second place going into his 2nd of three runs. He completed the run, landing his infamous Double McTwist 1260 and finishing with a score of 97.33 to take the lead and claim the historical 4th straight Gold in the Winter X Games, held in Aspen Colorado. The score tied an X Games record which was set by White one year before. His 3rd run was a simple victory run featuring mostly straight air.\n\nAt Winter X, White became the first person to score a perfect 100 in the men's Snowboard Superpipe in the history of Winter X Games.\n\nWhite won his 6th consecutive SuperPipe victory, placing him as the second participant to ever achieve this, with SnoCross racer Tucker Hibbert achieving his 6th consecutive victory earlier in the same day.\n\nIn December 2013, he won the third place in the Pipe & Slope contest at the FIS Snowboard World Cup in Copper Mountain, Colorado.\n\nWhite finished fourth at the 2014 Winter Olympics in the Halfpipe event.\n\nDuring the winter games, he was the most talked-about Olympic athlete on Facebook.\n\nWhile in New Zealand, training for the 2018 Winter Olympics, Shaun White crashed into the edge of a superpipe. The resulting injuries to his face required 62 stitches. Despite the incident, Shaun White qualified for the 2018 US Olympic Team.\n\n\n\nWhite has had a sponsor since he was seven years old. White signed CAA Sports for representation after working with IMG for eight years. Corporate endorsement deals include or have included Burton Snowboards, Oakley, Inc., Birdhouse Skateboards, Park City Mountain Resort, Target Corporation, Red Bull, Ubisoft, Adio and Hewlett-Packard. White also has his own character on the game \"Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder\" as well as the video games \"Shaun White Snowboarding\" and \"Shaun White Skateboarding\". In 2009, \"Forbes\" magazine estimated that he had earned $9 million from his endorsements in 2008.\n\nWhite has made cameo appearance as himself in the 2011 film \"Friends with Benefits\", the 2013 episode \"Da Flippity Flop\" of the animated TV series \"American Dad!\", and the 2014 Disney Channel Original Movie \"Cloud 9\".\n\nIn a 2007 interview with \"Outside\" magazine, White stated that he had turned down numerous film roles in which \"the first lines [for his character] are always \"What up, brah?'\".\n\nWhite plays guitar in the electronic rock band Bad Things, which also features former Augustana bassist Jared Palomar. The band played in one of the four Saturday headlining slots at the 2013 Lollapalooza festival, as a last minute replacement for Death Grips. Their self-titled debut album was released in January 2014.\n\nIn 2016, Bad Things drummer Lena Zawaideh brought a lawsuit against White, claiming sexual harassment and breach of contract. White and Zawaideh reached an out-of-court settlement in May 2017; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed.\n\nIn October 2013, White appeared in the music video for \"City of Angels\" by Thirty Seconds to Mars.\n\n\nWhite has had the longstanding nickname \"The Flying Tomato\", due to his shock of red hair. In 2006, \"Rolling Stone\" wrote about the nickname, \"he used to embrace it, even wearing headbands with a flying-tomato logo, but he has grown tired of it.\" He has also been nicknamed \"animal\", a reference to a character from \"The Muppet Show\".\n\nIn February 2009, Red Bull built White a halfpipe completely out of natural snow in the back country of Colorado on the backside of Silverton Mountain, coordinates (37.838801,-107.710299).\n\nOn September 17, 2012, White was arrested near a hotel in Nashville for public intoxication and vandalism after attending the wedding party of the drummer of The Black Keys, Patrick Carney.\n\n\n",
                "Paul Rodriguez (skateboarder)\n\nPaul Martin Rodriguez Jr. (born December 31, 1984), also known by his nickname P-Rod, is an American professional street skateboarder and actor. Rodriguez has won a total of eight medals at the X Games, four of them gold, with the most recent first-place victory occurring in Los Angeles, United States (U.S.) in July 2012.\n\nRodriguez was born in Tarzana, California, U.S. His father is actor/comedian Paul Rodriguez, and his mother is Laura Martinez. He also has a sister Nikole, and a brother Lucas. \n\nAs a child, Rodriguez occasionally got to meet celebrities through his father. In a later interview, he recounted one such memory:\n\nI'll tell you a good story about Mr. T. I believe it was 1988, every year there was a Christmas Day parade in Pasadena [California, US]; I was probably about three-and-a-half, four years-old—I loved Mr. T. He had the cartoon out at the time and all that. We're, were there at the banquet before the parade started 'cause my dad brought me to take me in the car to wave at the crowd, or whatever. And, ah, I had to go to the bathroom, my dad was getting interviewed, and, like, I tried to tell him; Mr. T was just standing there, chilling, 'cause they were just talking, and Mr. T goes, \"I'll take you\". And he throws me up on his shoulders, and I'm sitting up on top of all his gold chains. I remember it perfectly and he put me on top of his shoulders and walked me to the bathroom; like, just waited outside for me, and it was sick. Mr. T chauffeured me to [the bathroom].\n\nRodriguez's nickname \"P-Rod\" was given to him by his classmates when he was around eleven years old.\n\nWhen he was twelve, Rodriguez received his first skateboard as a Christmas gift from his parents. Rodriguez had seen a group of skateboarders at his new school and was immediately fascinated by \"how they kept their board to their feet and how they could flip it.\" Rodriguez said in June 2014: \"I got money, got myself a board, and it was game over.\"\n\nRodriguez stated in a July 2013 interview that he slept with new skateboard products as a child due to his passion for skateboarding, and admitted that he slept with his first Street League Skateboarding (SLS) trophy.\n\nRodriguez attended Birmingham High School in Van Nuys, CA.\n\nRodriguez was initially recruited to the team of a local skateboard shop named \"One Eighteen\", managed by an Andy Netkin, who was 19 years old at the time, while Rodriguez had just become 14 years old. As he was too shy at the time, Rodriguez asked a friend to submit his \"Sponsor me\" video tape to Netkin, who was immediately impressed and asked the friend to bring Rodriguez into the store. Netkin then offered Rodriguez a place on the store team the following day at their first meeting—Netkin explained in 2014 that, at the time, he had a strong sense of Rodriguez's future as a \"superstar.\" DNA Skateboards was Rodriguez's first company sponsor and he appeared in the 1999 video \"Microanalysis\". Former professional skateboarder Anthony Pappalardo stated in a June 24, 2014 online radio show—hosted by professional skateboarder Alex Olsen—that he encouraged Joe Castrucci, cofounder of the Habitat skateboard brand, to recruit Rodriguez before he was officially sponsored, but Castrucci declined.\n\nAt age sixteen, Rodriguez then rode for City Stars, a company founded by professional skateboarder Kareem Campbell in Los Angeles, U.S. Despite being an amateur at the time, Rodriguez earned the last part in the video \"Street Cinema\", which is an honor typically bestowed to an esteemed professional of the team. Rodriguez explained in 2014 that he was initially opposed to Campbell's use of the Jackson 5 song \"I Want You Back\" for the first half of his part, as it had been used for Guy Mariano's part in the Blind Skateboards video \"Video Days\", but conceded that at the time he \"was oblivious to the statement he [Campbell] was trying to make by choosing that song.\"\n\nAlongside Mikey Taylor, Justin Case, Devine Calloway and Kevin \"Spanky\" Long, Rodriguez was an amateur team member, while the professional team included Lee Smith, Joey Suriel, Ryan Denman and Eric Pupecki. Rodriguez developed his interest in jewelry during this period, as Campbell was a collector and purchased Rodriguez a diamond bracelet. The period also influenced Rodriguez's musical taste, as he commenced listening to artists like Jay-Z and Nas due to the time spent with Campbell.\n\nCity Stars had planned to release a signature skateboard deck design, featuring Rodriguez's name on the grill of a Mercedes Benz (Rodriguez's first car), but Rodriguez's departure from the company resulted in the product's cancellation. Rodriguez explained in February 2013: \"I specifically remember that I knew I wanted to quit and I felt like I could at least show enough respect and tell them before they spent all that money to print up my boards. I didn’t want to leave them with an inventory of boards they couldn’t sell so I made sure to quit well before they went into production.\" In 2014 Rodriguez described his time at the brand as \"the most magical,\" with a team that possessed \"enthusiasm and passion\" that was \"contagious.\"\n\nRodriguez was featured in Transworld Skateboarding's 2002 video, \"In Bloom\". This video showcased a segment of sponsored, talented skaters who were at the start of their respective careers. Following the video's release, Rodriguez commenced riding for Girl Skateboards and achieved professional status in September 2002. Rodriguez explained in a 2013 interview that he was asked to join the Girl team by Eric Koston, whom he called his all-time favorite skateboarder. Rodriguez said that it was the most significant event in his skateboarding career, as it was, \"the moment that my dream happened.\" \nRodriguez was sponsored by Girl from the age of seventeen to nineteen, and appears in the Girl Skateboards film \"Yeah Right\". During this period, he shared a house with professional skateboarder and rap artist Jereme Rogers.\n\nIn February 2013, Rodriguez identified his debut professional signature skateboard with Girl as his favorite deck graphic of all-time. The deck, released in 2002, featured the original Girl logo, Rodriguez's name (written in English), and the Spanish word \"Muchachita\", meaning \"girl\", instead of the usual \"Girl\" brand name. Rodriguez stated that \"That was my first pro board and to have it on a company like Girl was awesome.\" In April 2013 Rodriguez explained that he \"loved\" his time with the Girl company and, prior to receiving contact from Danny Way—who asked him to join the relaunched Plan B company—he considered Girl a lifelong sponsor.\n\nFollowing Girl, Rodriguez joined the relaunched Plan B skateboard deck brand that was under the ownership and guidance of original riders Danny Way and Colin McKay, who continue to own the brand as of March 2014.\n\nRodriguez released a solo Plan B video part, entitled \"Me, Myself, and I\", in 2010. The inaugural Plan B full-length video has been a topic of discussion among the global skateboarding community for a prolonged duration of time, as promotional footage has been released and the company has been in existence for a significant period of time, with a renowned team established during this time period. A late November episode of the internet-based, weekly program, \"Skateline\", broadcast on the RIDE Channel, showed footage of company co-owner and team rider, Danny Way, stating that the video would be made according to a schedule determined by the company regardless of external pressure.\n\nSeven out of Rodriguez's top ten skateboard graphics of all time are Plan B Rodriguez signature designs, according to an interview that was published in February 2013. A collaboration between Plan B and Nike SB is Rodriguez's second favorite graphic, while a Bruce Lee \"Fury\" deck (\"Needless to say, Bruce Lee is my number one influence other than Jesus Christ ... it also shows the three scrapes he had on his face from \"Enter The Dragon\". I love this one.\") and a Muhammad Ali deck were also included in the list.\n\nIn a July 2013 radio interview with Big Boi on Los Angeles' Power 106, Rodriguez confirmed his departure, which had already been widely speculated. During his winning performance at Stop 5 of the 2013 Street League Skateboarding contest in Portland, Oregon, U.S., Rodriguez rode a skateboard deck with the Plan B logo painted over and the company's logo was removed from his personal website as of July 16, 2013. Rodriguez explained in the interview that he is seeking to \"own a little bit more of myself.\"\n\nIn June 2014, following the launch of his own skateboard deck company, Primitive Skateboarding, and his eighth signature shoe with Nike, Rodriguez explained his perspective on the future:\nIt got to a point where I wanted to get my name on a board and did that, wanted my name on a shoe and did that, wanted other endorsements, awards, and to win certain competitions, and did those, too ... Now it’s back to just wanting to get better. I want to keep improving my abilities.\n\nThe design for his Nike signature shoe was first leaked onto the Internet at the beginning of the year, leading to an intense degree of discussion among consumers, described by the Ripped Laces website as \"hate/skepticism.\" The corresponding advertisement featured Nike SB team member, Theotis Beasley, and was produced by the Wieden + Kennedy agency.\n\nIn a promotional day-in-the-life photo diary for the Hypebeast website, published on December 16, 2014, Rodriguez revealed that his personal skateboarding park is scheduled for a remodeling process. He also stated that his daily caffeine fix brings \"happiness,\" and that the only time his mind is clear is while he is skateboarding.\n\nAt the beginning of 2015, Rodriguez joined the Glassy Sunhaters sunglasses brand, co-owned by fellow professional skateboarder Mike Mo Capaldi. His signature sunglasses model was release in February 2015.\n\nRodriguez launched his own skateboard brand, Primitive Skateboarding, in April 2014, with the initial team consisting of himself, Nick Tucker and Carlos Ribeiro.\n\nAs of January 19, 2016, Rodriguez is sponsored by Primitive Skateboarding, Nike Skateboarding, Target, Nixon Watches, Incase Designs, Primitive Skateshop, Glassy Sunhaters, Markisa, Venture, Andalé Bearings As of June 2014, Rodriguez is managed by Circe Wallace.\n\nRodriguez is a senior team rider for the Nike skateboarding division, having released his eighth skate shoe model in May 2014, and was responsible for welcoming Luan Oliviera to Nike in September 2012. Rodriguez released his first signature Nike shoe in 2005 following his departure from skate shoe brand, eS. Rodriguez explained in a 2012 interview for the \"Footnotes\" segment on the Berrics website:\nThe transition from eS to Nike was—after I got through making the phone call—I had to call Koston; I had to call, you know, Tony at eS; had to call a few people 'cause we were close; we were good family over there. So, after I got through that hard part, and I could just, and I was free of that burden, then when I got on Nike, it was just, like, the world was opened up—it was insane.\n\nRodriguez was one of the early riders to be approached by Nike following its second attempt to succeed in the skateboarding market and sub-culture. Rodriguez has explained:\nUm, my thoughts on Nike when they first approached me were cool. I mean, like, I did get some criticisms, selling out, this and that ... and I never really been too worried 'bout that criticism. So my thoughts were just like, I look at it like this, like: My first pair of shoes were the baby Jordans [basketball player, Michael Jordan], you know what I mean, so, like, I had Nikes all my life growing up, and even at the time that I was on eS, any time that I was not skating, I wearing some white-on-white Air Force Ones, or Cortezs—I had a whole flock of Nike anyway ... the way I looked at it, was like, I've been a Nike supporter since birth. So me, I was just stoked, I was just hyped to get on Nike.\n\nRodriguez released his seventh signature model shoe, entitled the \"Paul Rodriguez 7,\" with Nike in mid-2013. It was designed with Shawn Carboy, who Rodriguez first started working with during the design of his fifth signature model. Rodriguez prioritized the functionality of the shoe, and impact protection is its primary feature.\n\nThe \"P-ROD 8\", Rodriguez's eighth signature shoe was released in May 2014. On May 25, 2014, Rodriguez, alongside fellow Nike team member and skateboarding veteran, Lance Mountain, promoted the model in a video interview, whereby the history of the Nike shoe in skateboarding culture forms the foundation of the segment—Mountain explained that prior to the official launch of the Nike brand onto the skateboarding market, skateboarders said, \"This [Nike] is our shoe\". Rodriguez described himself as a \"Jordan baby\", growing up during the peak of Michael Jordan's career, and explained that his eighth Nike shoe model is an \"homage to all those things I grew up loving—even before I met skateboarding. And now it's intertwined.\" The P-ROD 8 features three of Nike's shoe technology developments: \"Lunarlon\", \"Flywire\" and \"Hyperscreen\". (Rodriguez explained in the video with Mountain that the Flywire grips around the foot in the event of a significant fall during the act of skateboarding.)\n\nFollowing the release of the P-ROD 8, Rodriguez was informed by a Nike executive that he is one of only four Nike athletes to have produced eight signature shoe models—the other being Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James. In 2014, having been sponsored by Nike for ten years, Rodriguez stated: \"it feels like I've also grown with them. I’ve become intertwined with Nike. Our stories are together — at least with Nike SB. The process of making a shoe, at this point, is like a well-oiled machine.\"\n\nOn August 13, 2010, the Target corporation announced in a press release that Rodriguez had joined its sponsorship ranks. He became the second professional skateboarder to have a sponsorship deal with Target, the first being Shaun White, though White is better known for snowboarding. A Target representative stated in the press release, \"Paul is an amazing competitor and is the perfect personality to add to our program. With so many accomplishments and a promising future ahead of him, Paul is a natural fit for Target and we’re proud to have our brand represented on his skateboard.\" Rodriguez was also quoted in the press release: \"I grew up right across the street from a Target and have many memories of skating over to the store as a kid. I’ve always loved their brand and am excited about the relationship and potential of what we can do together.\"\n\nIn 2012 Rodriguez participated in a competition with AT&T that allowed the winner to participate in the filming of a promotional video featuring Rodriguez. The final video also featured professional skateboarder, Manny Santiago, and was directed by Nigel Alexander, a long-time friend of Rodriguez.\n\nRodriguez owns a private skateboard park in the Canoga Park area of California, U.S. that features design elements from his sponsors, Mountain Dew, Nike SB, and Target. Rodriguez designed the park with skateboard park builder Mike Roebke, who used a computer program to blend his own ideas with drawings from Rodriguez. Rodriguez has stated, \"I enjoy skating there and I'm blessed to have that type of place at my fingertips.\"\n\nIn collaboration with the Network A media company, Rodriguez is featured in a six-part internet-based series about himself entitled \"LIFE\". The series, produced and directed by professional skateboarder Steve Berra, was released on a weekly basis on the company's YouTube channel..\n\nThe first episode \"Family First\" follows Rodriguez as he revisits his grandmother's home following her cancer diagnosis (Rodriguez foregoes competing at the notable Tampa Pro contest to undertake the visit). Rodriguez explained in 2013 that Berra was the only other person to accompany him during his visit to his grandmother's home, as Rodriguez trusted Berra to be present. In the second episode, entitled \"mASTA of disASTA\", Rodriguez prepares to compete against Tom Asta in the Battle of the Berrics competition.\n\nIn the third episode, \"Street League Matters\", Rodriguez is filmed in Kansas City, U.S., as he prepares for the qualifying round of one of the stops of the Street League competition. The episode shows Rodriguez as he finishes in fourth place. The fourth episode of \"LIFE\" follows Rodriguez, together with close friends Heath Brinkley (photographer and filmer), Justine Schulte, and Carlos Zarazua, as he visits New Orleans, U.S. for the opening of hip hop artist Lil' Wayne's skate park in the wake of Hurricane Katrina—the skate park is called the \"Truckstop\" and is located in the Lower Ninth Ward area.\n\nIn \"The Other Half\", the fifth episode of \"LIFE\", the camera follows Rodriguez as he competes in the Dew Tour contest and discusses the role of contests in relation to the more fundamental aspects of a professional street skateboarder's life—video footage and street skateboarding.\n\n\"Transworld SKATEboarding\" selected Rodriguez for the thirtieth position of its \"30 Most Influential Skaters of All Time\" list, released in December 2011. In response to the selection, Rodriguez revealed that Koston and Andrew Reynolds are two professional skateboarders who he considers as influential in a career sense, due to their \"longevity\", \"the impacts they’ve had\", and the degree of respect they have garnered. In an April 2013 interview, Rodriguez added Tom Penny to his \"most influential\" list and stated, \"Him [Penny], Koston and Reynolds. That's my combo right there.\". \nIn regard to Rodriguez, professional skateboarder Nyjah Huston explained in December 2013:\nHe is such a good dude, on and off the [skate]board. He's such a professional person. He's an amazing street skater, and just as good of a contest skater. So, he's a pretty ideal professional skateboarder, that's for sure.\n\nAs of June 2014, Rodriguez is the owner of, or an investor in, the skateboard brands Primitive (retail outlet, apparel and skateboard deck company), Markisa (wallets and accessories) and Andale (skateboard bearings), the latter in partnership with fellow professional skateboarder Joey Brezinski. In relation to Andale, Brezinski explained:\nOriginally I was working on the idea and I went through all the legal stuff. I quit my bearing sponsor at the time and I started talking to Paul about it because he had recently quit Silver at that point. I didn't know if he had plans with FKD or not, but I presented Andale to him as something we could do together. He was down and I proceeded to move forward. It took about two years to get to this point, doing a lot of work and a lot of planning.\n\nThe Primitive company consists of a retail store that is located in Los Angeles, U.S. (specializes in footwear), an apparel line and a skateboard deck brand. Rodriguez established the business in around 2005/2006 with three partners, including two friends whom he has known since childhood. In April 2014, Rodriguez was identified as the president of the company, while Netkin is the CEO and founder, and Jubal Jones is the creative director—Netkin and Jones were the original store employees and handled US$300 in sales on the opening day. Netkin describes the Primitive store, which officially opened on July 27, 2008, as a \"cross-genre\" retail outlet that also sells products, which skateboarders can relate to, outside of the skateboarding subculture.\n\nFollowing the eventual success of the retail outlet, the company commenced its apparel brand, which was a part of the founders' original plan. The popularity of the apparel brand grew rapidly and in April 2014, Jones stated that he solely focuses on the brand, while new employees are constantly hired. In 2014 Primitive Apparel is available in 11 countries and the company consists of 25 people.\n\nThe Primitive brand was expanded into a skateboard deck company called \"Primitive Skateboarding\" in April 2014.\n\nTogether with action sports filmmaker Josh Landon and professional US skateboarder Mikey Taylor, Rodriguez cofounded the Saint Archer Brewing Co., a microbrewery that is co-owned by people who are also the brand's \"Ambassadors.\" The team of Ambassadors includes professional skateboarders Eric Koston, Brian \"Slash\" Hansen, and Bryan Herman; professional and non-professional surfers Josh Kerr, Taylor Knox, Dusty Payne, Laura Enever, and Jeff Johnson; former professional snowboarder Todd Richards; photographer Atiba Jefferson; and surfboard shaper Chris Christenson. Together with Saint Archer's other Ambassadors, Rodriguez has participated in \"Tasting Room\" nights that are held at the brewery, in which the Ambassadors pour and serve beers.\n\nIn a June 2014 interview, Rodriguez asserted that he is a \"young, beginning entrepreneur who’s learning the ropes of the game,\" before revealing the philosophy that has benefited him over the course of his career: \"find people that are just as passionate at what they do as you are about what you do.\"\n\nAs of November 2013, Rodriguez resides in Northridge, California. As of August 2010, his partner was Rainbow Alexander and the pair are the parents of daughter Heaven Love. In July 2013, photographs of Rodriguez dating a woman named Rachel Metz were published on the Internet. In an April 2013 interview, Rodriguez described himself as a \"certified workaholic\", and stated that skateboarding and fatherhood are his primary concerns in life. In regard to his Mexican American heritage, Rodriguez has explained:\nIt's my roots. It's where I come from; it's my genetics, my DNA, my body, my build. All from my heritage. My ancestors all before me contributed to the blessings I’m living now. It's where you come from. You can never be ignorant to where you come from because they're responsible for what you are now.\n\nRodriguez has stated in an interview with the NetworkA media channel that holds aspirations for a serious acting career following his time with professional skateboarding—he revealed that he admires the work of Johnny Depp, Christian Bale, and Edward Norton. In addition to Bruce Lee, Alexander the Great, and Jesus Christ, Rodriguez is also influenced by rapper Tupac Shakur, and revealed in February 2013 that a skateboard deck graphic featuring Shakur would be a worthwhile design: \"I’d like to get that photo of Tupac standing on the wall with his shirt off and he’s got the Thug Life tattoo and the glock in his waist band and a blunt in his hand. That would be sick.\"\n\nRodriguez received the 2002 \"Rookie of the Year\" award from the \"Transworld SKATEboarding\" publication.\n\nWe are Blood 2015\n\nBronze: 2003 Los Angeles\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                "Surfing\n\nSurfing is a surface water sport in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or deep face of a moving wave, which is usually carrying the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or in rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools.\n\nThe term \"surfing\" refers to the act of riding a wave, regardless of whether the wave is ridden with a board or without a board, and regardless of the stance used. The native peoples of the Pacific, for instance, surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such craft, and did so on their belly and knees. The modern-day definition of surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing up on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.\n\nAnother prominent form of surfing is body boarding, when a surfer rides a wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee, or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats), and using foils. Body surfing, where the wave is surfed without a board, using the surfer's own body to catch and ride the wave, is very common and is considered by some to be the purest form of surfing.\n\nThree major subdivisions within standing-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style, and the kind of wave that is ridden.\n\nIn tow-in surfing (most often, but not exclusively, associated with big wave surfing), a motorized water vehicle, such as a personal watercraft, tows the surfer into the wave front, helping the surfer match a large wave's speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. Surfing-related sports such as paddle boarding and sea kayaking do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as kite surfing and windsurfing rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may also be used to ride waves. Recently with the use of V-drive boats, Wakesurfing, in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged. The Guinness Book of World Records recognized a wave ride by Garrett McNamara at Nazaré, Portugal as the largest wave ever surfed.\n\nFor hundreds of years, surfing was a central part of ancient Polynesian culture. Surfing may have first been observed by British explorers at Tahiti in 1767. Samuel Wallis and the crew members of the \"Dolphin\" who were the first Britons to visit the island in June of that year. Another candidate is the botanist Joseph Banks being part of the first voyage of James Cook on the HMS \"Endeavour\", who arrived on Tahiti on 10 April 1769. Lieutenant James King was the first person to write about the art of surfing on Hawaii when he was completing the journals of Captain James Cook upon Cook's death in 1779.\n\nWhen Mark Twain visited Hawaii in 1866 he wrote,\nIn one place we came upon a large company of naked natives, of both sexes and all ages, amusing themselves with the national pastime of surf-bathing.\n\nReferences to surf riding on planks and single canoe hulls are also verified for pre-contact Samoa, where surfing was called \"fa'ase'e\" or \"se'egalu\" (see Augustin Krämer, \"The Samoa Islands\"), and Tonga, far pre-dating the practice of surfing by Hawaiians and eastern Polynesians by over a thousand years.\n\nIn July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew’s Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California. There, David Kawānanakoa, Edward Keliʻiahonui and Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians Kim Stoner and Geoff Dunn.\n\nGeorge Freeth (8 November 1883 – 7 April 1919) is often credited as being the \"Father of Modern Surfing\". He is thought to have been the first modern surfer.\n\nIn 1907, the eclectic interests of the land baron Henry E. Huntington brought the ancient art of surfing to the California coast. While on vacation, Huntington had seen Hawaiian boys surfing the island waves. Looking for a way to entice visitors to the area of Redondo Beach, where he had heavily invested in real estate, he hired a young Hawaiian to ride surfboards. George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge 16-foot hardwood boards that were popular at that time. When he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original \"Long board\", which made him the talk of the islands. To the delight of visitors, Freeth exhibited his surfing skills twice a day in front of the Hotel Redondo.\n\nIn 1975, professional contests started. That year Margo Oberg became the first female professional surfer.\n\nSwell is generated when wind blows consistently over a large area of open water, called the wind's fetch. The size of a swell is determined by the strength of the wind and the length of its fetch and duration. Because of this, surf tends to be larger and more prevalent on coastlines exposed to large expanses of ocean traversed by intense low pressure systems.\n\nLocal wind conditions affect wave quality, since the surface of a wave can become choppy in blustery conditions. Ideal conditions include a light to moderate \"offshore\" wind, because it blows into the front of the wave, making it a \"barrel\" or \"tube\" wave. Waves are Left handed and Right Handed depending upon the breaking formation of the wave.\n\nWaves are generally recognized by the surfaces over which they break. For example, there are Beach breaks, Reef breaks and Point breaks.\n\nThe most important influence on wave shape is the topography of the seabed directly behind and immediately beneath the breaking wave. The contours of the reef or bar front becomes stretched by diffraction. Each break is different, since each location's underwater topography is unique. At beach breaks, sandbanks change shape from week to week. Surf forecasting is aided by advances in information technology. Mathematical modeling graphically depicts the size and direction of swells around the globe.\n\nSwell regularity varies across the globe and throughout the year. During winter, heavy swells are generated in the mid-latitudes, when the North and South polar fronts shift toward the Equator. The predominantly Westerly winds generate swells that advance Eastward, so waves tend to be largest on West coasts during winter months. However, an endless train of mid-latitude cyclones cause the isobars to become undulated, redirecting swells at regular intervals toward the tropics.\n\nEast coasts also receive heavy winter swells when low-pressure cells form in the sub-tropics, where slow moving highs inhibit their movement. These lows produce a shorter fetch than polar fronts, however they can still generate heavy swells, since their slower movement increases the duration of a particular wind direction. The variables of fetch and duration both influence how long wind acts over a wave as it travels, since a wave reaching the end of a fetch behaves as if the wind died.\n\nDuring summer, heavy swells are generated when cyclones form in the tropics. Tropical cyclones form over warm seas, so their occurrence is influenced by El Niño & La Niña cycles. Their movements are unpredictable.\n\nSurf travel and some surf camps offer surfers access to remote, tropical locations, where tradewinds ensure offshore conditions. Since winter swells are generated by mid-latitude cyclones, their regularity coincides with the passage of these lows. Swells arrive in pulses, each lasting for a couple of days, with a few days between each swell.\n\nThe availability of free model data from the NOAA has allowed the creation of several surf forecasting websites.\n\nThe value of good surf in attracting surf tourism has prompted the construction of artificial reefs and sand bars. Artificial surfing reefs can be built with durable sandbags or concrete, and resemble a submerged breakwater. These artificial reefs not only provide a surfing location, but also dissipate wave energy and shelter the coastline from erosion. Ships such as Seli 1 that have accidentally stranded on sandy bottoms, can create sandbanks that give rise to good waves.\n\nAn artificial reef known as Chevron Reef was constructed in El Segundo, California in hopes of creating a new surfing area. However, the reef failed to produce any quality waves and was removed in 2008. In Kovalam, South West India, an artificial reef has, however, successfully provided the local community with a quality lefthander, stabilized coastal soil erosion, and provided good habitat for marine life. ASR Ltd., a New Zealand-based company, constructed the Kovalam reef and is working on another reef in Boscombe, England.\n\nEven with artificial reefs in place, a tourist's vacation time may coincide with a \"flat spell\", when no waves are available. Completely artificial Wave pools aim to solve that problem by controlling all the elements that go into creating perfect surf, however there are only a handful of wave pools that can simulate good surfing waves, owing primarily to construction and operation costs and potential liability. Most wave pools generate waves that are too small and lack the power necessary to surf. The Seagaia Ocean Dome, located in Miyazaki, Japan, was an example of a surfable wave pool. Able to generate waves with up to 10-foot faces, the specialized pump held water in 20 vertical tanks positioned along the back edge of the pool. This allowed the waves to be directed as they approach the artificial sea floor. Lefts, Rights, and A-frames could be directed from this pump design providing for rippable surf and barrel rides. The Ocean Dome cost about $2 billion to build and was expensive to maintain. The Ocean Dome was closed in 2007. In England, construction is nearing completion on the Wave, situated near Bristol, which will enable people unable to get to the coast to enjoy the waves in a controlled environment, set in the heart of nature.\n\nThere are two main types of artificial waves that exist today. One being artificial or stationary waves which simulate a moving, breaking wave by pumping a layer of water against a smooth structure mimicking the shape of a breaking wave. Because of the velocity of the rushing water the wave and the surfer can remain stationary while the water rushes by under the surfboard. Artificial waves of this kind provide the opportunity to try surfing and learn its basics in a moderately small and controlled environment near or far from locations with natural surf.\n\nAnother artificial wave can be made through use of a wave pool such as Kelly Slater's Wave Co. and NLand Surf Park in Austin, TX. These wave pools strive to make a wave that replicates a real ocean wave more than the stationary wave does.\n\nSurfers represent a diverse culture based on riding the waves. Some people practice surfing as a recreational activity while others make it the central focus of their lives. Surfing culture is most dominant in Hawaii and California because these two states offer the best surfing conditions. However, waves can be found wherever there is coastline, and a tight-knit yet far-reaching subculture of surfers has emerged throughout America. Some historical markers of the culture included the woodie, the station wagon used to carry surfers' boards, as well as boardshorts, the long swim shorts typically worn while surfing. Surfers also wear wetsuits in colder regions.\n\nThe sport of surfing now represents a multibillion-dollar industry especially in clothing and fashion markets. The World Surf League (WSL) runs the championship tour, hosting top competitors in some of the best surf spots around the globe. A small number of people make a career out of surfing by receiving corporate sponsorships and performing for photographers and videographers in far-flung destinations; they are typically referred to as freesurfers.Sixty-six surfboarders on a 42-foot surfboard set a record in Huntington Beach, California for most people on a surfboard at one time.As for people who take it more seriously, such as Dale Webster, he consecutively surfed for 14,641 days, making it his main life focus.\n\nWhen the waves were flat, surfers persevered with sidewalk surfing, which is now called skateboarding. Sidewalk surfing has a similar feel to surfing and requires only a paved road or sidewalk. To create the feel of the wave, surfers even sneak into empty backyard swimming pools to ride in, known as pool skating. Eventually, surfing made its way to the slopes with the invention of the Snurfer, later credited as the first snowboard. Many other board sports have been invented over the years, but all can trace their heritage back to surfing.\n\nMany surfers claim to have a spiritual connection with the ocean, describing surfing, the surfing experience, both in and out of the water, as a type of spiritual experience or a religion.\n\nStandup surfing begins when the surfer paddles toward shore in an attempt to match the speed of the wave (The same applies whether the surfer is standup paddling, bodysurfing, boogie-boarding or using some other type of watercraft, such as a waveski or kayak.). Once the wave begins to carry the surfer forward, the surfer stands up and proceeds to ride the wave. The basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (whitewash) of the wave. A common problem for beginners is being able to catch the wave at all.\n\nSurfers' skills are tested by their ability to control their board in difficult conditions, riding challenging waves, and executing maneuvers such as strong turns and cutbacks (turning board back to the breaking wave) and \"carving\" (a series of strong back-to-back maneuvers). More advanced skills include the \"floater\" (riding on top of the breaking curl of the wave), and \"off the lip\" (banking off the breaking wave). A newer addition to surfing is the progression of the \"air\" whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely up into the air, and then successfully lands the board back on the wave.\nThe tube ride is considered to be the ultimate maneuver in surfing. As a wave breaks, if the conditions are ideal, the wave will break in an orderly line from the middle to the shoulder, enabling the experienced surfer to position themselves inside the wave as it is breaking. This is known as a tube ride. Viewed from the shore, the tube rider may disappear from view as the wave breaks over the rider's head. The longer the surfer remains in the tube, the more successful the ride. This is referred to as getting tubed, barreled, shacked or pitted. Some of the world's best known waves for tube riding include Pipeline on the North shore of Oahu, Teahupoo in Tahiti and G-Land in Java. Other names for the tube include \"the barrel\", and \"the pit\".\n\nHanging ten and hanging five are moves usually specific to long boarding. Hanging Ten refers to having both feet on the front end of the board with all of the surfer's toes off the edge, also known as nose-riding. Hanging Five is having just one foot near the front, with five toes off the edge.\n\nCutback: Generating speed down the line and then turning back to reverse direction.\n\nFloater: Suspending the board atop the wave. Very popular on small waves.\n\nTop-Turn: Turn off the top of the wave. Sometimes used to generate speed and sometimes to shoot spray.\n\nAir / Aerial: Launching the board off the wave entirely, then re-entering the wave. Various airs include ollies, lien airs, method airs, and other skateboard-like maneuvers.\n\nThe Glossary of surfing includes some of the extensive vocabulary used to describe various aspects of the sport of surfing as described in literature on the subject. In some cases terms have spread to a wider cultural use. These terms were originally coined by people who were directly involved in the sport of surfing.\n\nMany popular surfing destinations have surf schools and surf camps that offer lessons. Surf camps for beginners and intermediates are multi-day lessons that focus on surfing fundamentals. They are designed to take new surfers and help them become proficient riders. All-inclusive surf camps offer overnight accommodations, meals, lessons and surfboards. Most surf lessons begin with instruction and a safety briefing on land, followed by instructors helping students into waves on longboards or \"softboards\". The softboard is considered the ideal surfboard for learning, due to the fact it is safer, and has more paddling speed and stability than shorter boards. Funboards are also a popular shape for beginners as they combine the volume and stability of the longboard with the manageable size of a smaller surfboard.\nNew and inexperienced surfers typically learn to catch waves on softboards around the 7–8 foot funboard size. Due to the softness of the surfboard the chance of getting injured is substantially minimized.\n\nTypical surfing instruction is best performed one-on-one, but can also be done in a group setting. The most popular surf locations offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for advanced students. The ideal conditions for learning would be small waves that crumble and break softly, as opposed to the steep, fast-peeling waves desired by more experienced surfers. When available, a sandy seabed is generally safer.\n\nSurfing can be broken into several skills: Paddling strength, Positioning to catch the wave, timing, and balance. Paddling out requires strength, but also the mastery of techniques to break through oncoming waves (\"duck diving\", \"eskimo roll\"). Take-off positioning requires experience at predicting the wave set and where they will break. The surfer must pop up quickly as soon as the wave starts pushing the board forward. Preferred positioning on the wave is determined by experience at reading wave features including where the wave is breaking. Balance plays a crucial role in standing on a surfboard. Thus, balance training exercises are a good preparation. Practicing with a Balance board or swing boarding helps novices master the art.\n\nSurfing can be done on various equipment, including surfboards, longboards, Stand Up Paddle boards (SUP's), bodyboards, wave skis, skimboards, kneeboards, surf mats and macca's trays. Surfboards were originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to long and ). Lighter balsa wood surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability.\n\nMost modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or \"stringers\", fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin (PE). An emerging board material is epoxy resin and Expanded Polystyrene foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction. Even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. Since epoxy/EPS surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional PU/PE board of similar size, shape and thickness. This makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. However, a common complaint of EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional PU/PE board. For this reason, many advanced surfers prefer that their surfboards be made from traditional materials.\n\nOther equipment includes a leash (to stop the board from drifting away after a wipeout, and to prevent it from hitting other surfers), surf wax, traction pads (to keep a surfer's feet from slipping off the deck of the board), and fins (also known as \"skegs\") which can either be permanently attached (\"glassed-on\") or interchangeable. Sportswear designed or particularly suitable for surfing may be sold as \"boardwear\" (the term is also used in snowboarding). In warmer climates, swimsuits, surf trunks or boardshorts are worn, and occasionally rash guards; in cold water surfers can opt to wear wetsuits, boots, hoods, and gloves to protect them against lower water temperatures. A newer introduction is a rash vest with a thin layer of titanium to provide maximum warmth without compromising mobility. In recent years, there have been advancements in technology that have allowed surfers to pursue even bigger waves with added elements of safety. Big wave surfers are now experimenting with inflatable vests or colored dye packs to help decrease their odds of drowning.\n\nThere are many different surfboard sizes, shapes, and designs in use today. Modern longboards, generally in length, are reminiscent of the earliest surfboards, but now benefit from modern innovations in surfboard shaping and fin design. Competitive longboard surfers need to be competent at traditional \"walking\" manoeuvres, as well as the short-radius turns normally associated with shortboard surfing. The modern shortboard began life in the late 1960s and has evolved into today's common \"thruster\" style, defined by its three fins, usually around in length. The thruster was invented by Australian shaper Simon Anderson.\n\nMidsize boards, often called funboards, provide more maneuverability than a longboard, with more flotation than a shortboard. While many surfers find that funboards live up to their name, providing the best of both surfing modes, others are critical.\n\nThere are also various niche styles, such as the \"Egg\", a longboard-style short board targeted for people who want to ride a shortboard but need more paddle power. The \"Fish\", a board which is typically shorter, flatter, and wider than a normal shortboard, often with a split tail (known as a \"swallow tail\"). The Fish often has two or four fins and is specifically designed for surfing smaller waves. For big waves there is the \"Gun\", a long, thick board with a pointed nose and tail (known as a pin tail) specifically designed for big waves.\n\nThe physics of surfing involves the physical oceanographic properties of wave creation in the surf zone, the characteristics of the surfboard, and the surfer's interaction with the water and the board.\n\nOcean waves are defined as a collection of dislocated water parcels that undergo a cycle of being forced past their normal position and being restored back to their normal position. Wind caused ripples and eddies form waves that gradually gain speed and distance (fetch). Waves increase in energy and speed, and then become longer and stronger. The fully developed sea has the strongest wave action that experiences storms lasting 10-hours and creates 15 meter wave heights in the open ocean.\n\nThe waves created in the open ocean are classified as deep-water waves. Deep-water waves have no bottom interaction and the orbits of these water molecules are circular; their wavelength is short relative to water depth and the velocity decays before the reaching the bottom of the water basin. Deep waves have depths greater than ½ their wavelengths. Wind forces waves to break in the deep sea.\n\nDeep-water waves travel to shore and become shallow water waves. Shallow water waves have depths less than ½ of their wavelength. Shallow wave's wavelengths are long relative to water depth and have elliptical orbitals. The wave velocity effects the entire water basin. The water interacts with the bottom as it approaches shore and has a drag interaction. The drag interaction pulls on the bottom of the wave, causes refraction, increases the height, decreases the celerity (or the speed of the wave form), and the top (crest) falls over. This phenomenon happens because the velocity of the top of the wave is greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave.\n\nThe surf zone is place of convergence of multiple waves types creating complex wave patterns. A wave suitable for surfing results from maximum speeds of 5 meters per second. This speed is relative because local onshore winds can cause waves to break. In the surf zone, shallow water waves are carried by global winds to the beach and interact with local winds to make surfing waves.\n\nDifferent onshore and off shore wind patterns in the surf zone create different types of waves. Onshore winds cause random wave breaking patterns and are more suitable for experienced surfers. Light offshore winds create smoother waves, while strong direct offshore winds cause plunging or large barrel waves. Barrel waves are large because the water depth is small when the wave breaks. Thus, the breaker intensity (or force) increases, and the wave speed and height increase. Off shore winds produce non-surfable conditions by flattening a weak swell. Weak swell is made from surface gravity forces and has long wavelengths.\n\nSurfing waves can be analyzed using the following parameters: breaking wave height, wave peel angle (α), wave breaking intensity, and wave section length. The breaking wave height has two measurements, the relative heights estimated by surfers and the exact measurements done by physical oceanographers. Measurements done by surfers were 1.36 to 2.58 times higher than the measurements done by scientists. The scientifically concluded wave heights that are physically possible to surf are 1 to 20 meters.\n\nThe wave peel angle is one of the main constituents of a potential surfing wave. Wave peel angle measures the distance between the peel-line and the line tangent to the breaking crest line. This angle controls the speed of the wave crest. The speed of the wave is an addition of the propagation velocity vector (Vw) and peel velocity vector (Vp), which results in the overall velocity of the wave (Vs).\n\nWave breaking intensity measures the force of the wave as it breaks, spills, or plunges (a plunging wave is termed by surfers as a “barrel wave”). Wave section length is the distance between two breaking crests in a wave set. Wave section length can be hard to measure because local winds, non-linear wave interactions, island sheltering, and swell interactions can cause multifarious wave configurations in the surf zone.\n\nThe parameters breaking wave height, wave peel angle (α), and wave breaking intensity, and wave section length are important because they are standardized by past oceanographers who researched surfing; these parameters have been used to create a guide that matches the type of wave formed and the skill level of surfer.\n\nTable 1 shows a relationship of smaller peel angles correlating with a higher skill level of surfer. Smaller wave peel angles increase the velocities of waves. A surfer must know how to react and paddle quickly to match the speed of the wave to catch it. Therefore, more experience is required to catch a low peel angle waves. Also, more experienced surfers can handle longer section lengths, increased velocities, and higher wave heights. Different locations offer different types of surfing conditions for each skill level.\n\nA surf break is an area with an obstruction or an object that causes a wave to break. Surf breaks entail multiple scale phenomena. Wave section creation has microscale factors of peel angle and wave breaking intensity. The microscale components influence wave height and variations on wave crests. The mesoscale components of surf breaks are the ramp, platform, wedge, or ledge that may be present at a surf break. Macroscale processes are the global winds that initially produce offshore waves. Types of surf breaks are headlands (point break), beach break, river/estuary entrance bar, reef breaks, and ledge breaks.\n\nA headland or point break interacts with the water by causing refraction around the point or headland. The point absorbs the high frequency waves and long period waves persist, which are easier to surf. Examples of locations that have headland or point break induced surf breaks are Dunedin (New Zealand), Raglan, Malibu (California), Rincon (California), and Kirra (Australia).\n\nA beach break happens where waves break from offshore waves, and onshore sandbars and rips. Wave breaks happen successively at beach breaks. Example locations are Tairua and Aramoana Beach (New Zealand) and the Gold Coast (Australia).\n\nA river or estuary entrance bar creates waves from the ebb tidal delta, sediment outflow, and tidal currents. An ideal estuary entrance bar exists in Whangamata Bar, New Zealand.\n\nA reef break is conducive to surfing because large waves consistently break over the reef. The reef is usually made of coral, and because of this, many injuries occur while surfing reef breaks. However, the waves that are produced by reef breaks are some of the best in the world. Famous reef breaks are present in Padang Padang (Indonesia), Pipeline (Hawaii), Uluwatu (Bali), and Teahupo'o (Tahiti).\n\nA ledge break is formed by steep rocks ledges that makes intense waves because the waves travel through deeper water then abruptly reach shallower water at the ledge. Shark Island, Australia is a location with a ledge break. Ledge breaks create difficult surfing conditions, sometimes only allowing body surfing as the only feasible way to confront the waves.\n\nJetties are added to bodies of water to regulate erosion, preserve navigation channels, and make harbors. Jetties are classified into four different types and have two main controlling variables: the type of delta and the size of the jetty.\n\nThe first classification is a type 1 jetty. This type of jetty is significantly longer than the surf zone width and the waves break at the shore end of the jetty. The effect of a Type 1 jetty is sediment accumulation in a wedge formation on the jetty. These waves are large and increase in size as they pass over the sediment wedge formation. An example of a Type 1 jetty is Mission Beach, San Diego, California. This 1000-meter jetty was installed in 1950 at the mouth of Mission Bay. The surf waves happen north of the jetty, are longer waves, and are powerful. The bathymetry of the sea bottom in Mission Bay has a wedge shape formation that causes the waves to refract as they become closer to the jetty. The waves converge constructively after they refract and increase the sizes of the waves.\n\nA type 2 jetty occurs in an ebb tidal delta, a delta transitioning between high and low tide. This area has shallow water, refraction, and a distinctive seabed shapes that creates large wave heights.\n\nAn example of a type 2 jetty is called \"The Poles\" in Atlantic Beach, Florida. Atlantic Beach is known to have flat waves, with exceptions during major storms. However, \"The Poles\" has larger than normal waves due to a 500-meter jetty that was installed on the south side of the St. Johns. This jetty was built to make a deep channel in the river. It formed a delta at \"The Poles\". This is special area because the jetty increases wave size for surfing, when comparing pre-conditions and post-conditions of the southern St. Johns River mouth area.\n\nThe wave size at \"The Poles\" depends on the direction of the incoming water. When easterly waters (from 55°) interact with the jetty, they create waves larger than southern waters (from 100°). When southern waves (from 100°) move toward \"The Poles\", one of the waves breaks north of the southern jetty and the other breaks south of the jetty. This does not allow for merging to make larger waves. Easterly waves, from 55°, converge north of the jetty and unite to make bigger waves.\n\nA type 3 jetty is in an ebb tidal area with an unchanging seabed that has naturally created waves. Examples of a Type 3 jetty occurs in “Southside” Tamarack, Carlsbad, California.\n\nA type 4 jetty is one that no longer functions nor traps sediment. The waves are created from reefs in the surf zone. A type 4 jetty can be found in Tamarack, Carlsbad, California.\n\nRip currents are fast, narrow currents that are caused by onshore transport within the surf zone and the successive return of the water seaward. The wedge bathymetry makes a convenient and consistent rip current of 5–10 meters that brings the surfers to the “take off point” then out to the beach.\n\nOceanographers have two theories on rip current formation. The wave interaction model assumes that two edges of waves interact, create differing wave heights, and cause longshore transport of nearshore currents. The Boundary Interaction Model assumes that the topography of the sea bottom causes nearshore circulation and longshore transport; the result of both models is a rip current.\n\nRip currents can be extremely strong and narrow as they extend out of the surf zone into deeper water, reaching speeds of 1–2 feet per second to 8 feet per second. The water in the jet is sediment rich, bubble rich, and moves rapidly. The rip head of the rip current has long shore movement. Rip currents are common on beaches with mild slopes that experience sizable and frequent oceanic swell.\n\nThe vorticity and inertia of rip currents have been studied. From a model of the vorticity of a rip current done at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, it was found that a fast rip current extends away from shallow water, the vorticity of the current increases, and the width of the current decreases. This model also acknowledges that friction plays a role and waves are irregular in nature. From data from Sector-Scanning Doppler Sonar at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, it was found that rip currents in La Jolla, CA lasted several minutes, reoccurred one to four times per hour, and created a wedge with a 45° arch and a radius 200–400 meters.\n\nA long surfboard (10 feet) causes more friction with the water; therefore, it will be slower than a smaller lighter board (6 feet). Longer boards are good for beginners who need help balancing. Smaller boards are good for more experienced surfers who want to have more control and maneuverability.\n\nWhen practicing the sport of surfing, the surfer paddles out past the wave break to wait for a wave. When a surfable wave arrives, the surfer must paddle extremely fast to match the velocity of the wave so the wave can accelerate him or her.\n\nWhen the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, and stay toward the front of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The acceleration is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (Fsinθ) and the vertical force (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain more speed, and lean on back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.\n\n\nSurfing, like all water sports, carries the inherent danger of drowning. Anyone at any age can learn to surf, but should have at least intermediate swimming skills. Although the board assists a surfer in staying buoyant, it can become separated from the user. A leash, attached to the ankle or knee, can keep a board from being swept away, but does not keep a rider on the board or above water. In some cases, possibly including the drowning of professional surfer Mark Foo, a leash can even be a cause of drowning by snagging on a reef or other object and holding the surfer underwater. By keeping the surfboard close to the surfer during a wipeout, a leash also increases the chances that the board may strike the rider, which could knock him or her unconscious and lead to drowning. A fallen rider's board can become trapped in larger waves, and if the rider is attached by a leash, he or she can be dragged for long distances underwater. Surfers should be careful to remain in smaller surf until they have acquired the advanced skills and experience necessary to handle bigger waves and more challenging conditions. However, even world-class surfers have drowned in extremely challenging conditions.\n\nUnder the wrong set of conditions, anything that a surfer's body can come in contact with is potentially a danger, including sand bars, rocks, small ice, reefs, surfboards, and other surfers. Collisions with these objects can sometimes cause injuries such as cuts and scrapes and in rare instances, death.\n\nA large number of injuries, up to 66%, are caused by collision with a surfboard (nose or fins). Fins can cause deep lacerations and cuts, as well as bruising. While these injuries can be minor, they can open the skin to infection from the sea; groups like Surfers Against Sewage campaign for cleaner waters to reduce the risk of infections. Local bugs and disease can be a dangerous factor when surfing around the globe.\n\nFalling off a surfboard or colliding with others is commonly referred to as a \"wipeout\".\n\nSea life can sometimes cause injuries and even fatalities. Animals such as sharks, stingrays, Weever fish, seals and jellyfish can sometimes present a danger. Warmer-water surfers often do the \"stingray shuffle\" as they walk out through the shallows, shuffling their feet in the sand to scare away stingrays that may be resting on the bottom.\n\nRip currents are water channels that flow away from the shore. Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current appears to be an area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or fifty feet. However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.\n\nThe seabed can pose dangers for surfers. If a surfer falls while riding a wave, the wave tosses and tumbles the surfer around, often in a downwards direction. At reef breaks and beach breaks, surfers have been seriously injured and even killed because of a violent collision with the sea bed, the water above which can sometimes be very shallow, especially at beach breaks or reef breaks during low tide. Cyclops, Western Australia, for example is one of the biggest and thickest reef breaks in the world, with waves measuring up to 10 metres high, but the reef below is only about below the surface of the water.\n\nA January 2018 study by the University of Exeter called the \"Beach Bum Survey\" found surfers and bodyboarders to be three times as likely as non-surfers to harbor antibiotic-resistant \"E. coli\" and four times as likely to harbor other bacteria capable of easily becoming antibiotic resistant. The researchers attributed this to the fact that surfers swallow roughly ten times as much seawater as swimmers.\n\n",
                "Surf culture\n\nSurf culture is the culture that includes the people, language, fashion, and lifestyle surrounding the sport of surfing. The history of surfing began with the ancient Polynesians. That initial culture directly influenced modern surfing, which began to flourish and evolve in the early 20th century, with its popularity spiking during the 1950s and 1960s (principally in Hawaii, Australia, and California). It has affected music, clothing fashion, literature, film, art, and youth jargon in popular culture' the number of surfers throughout the world continues to increase.\n\nSurfers' desire for the best possible waves to ride make them dependent on conditions that may change rapidly, given the unpredictable nature of weather events and their effect on the surface of the ocean. Because surfing was limited by the geographical necessity of an ocean coastline with beaches, the culture of beach life often influenced surfers and vice versa. The staff of \"Surfer Magazine\", founded in the 1960s when surfing had gained popularity with teenagers, used to say that if they were hard at work and someone yelled \"Surf's up!\" the office would suddenly empty. Localism or territorialism is a part of the development of surf culture in which individuals or groups of surfers claim certain key surfing spots as their own.\n\nAspects of 1960s surf culture in Southern California, where it was first popularized, include the woodie, bikinis and other beach wear, such as boardshorts or baggies, and surf music. Surfers developed the skateboard to be able to \"surf\" on land; and a number of other boardsports.\n\nA non-competitive adventure activity involving riding the biggest waves possible (known as \"rhino hunting\") is also popular with some surfers. A practice popularized in the 1990s has seen big wave surfing revolutionized, as surfers use personal watercraft to tow them out to a position where they can catch previously unrideable waves (see tow-in surfing). These waves were previously unrideable due to the speed at which they travel. Some waves reach speeds of over 60 km/h; personal watercraft enable surfers to catch up to the speed of the wave, thereby making them rideable. Personal watercraft also allow surfers to survive wipeouts. In many instances surfers would not survive the battering of the \"sets\" (groups of waves together). This spectacular activity is extremely popular with television crews, but because such waves rarely occur in heavily populated regions, and usually only a very long way out to sea on outer reefs, few spectators see such events directly.\n\nThough surfers come from all walks of life, the basis of the beach bum stereotype comes from that great enthusiasm that surfers can have for their sport. Dedication and perfectionism are also qualities that surfers bring to what many have traditionally regarded as a commitment to a lifestyle as well as a sport.\n\nFor specific surf spots, the state of the ocean tide can play a significant role in the quality of waves or hazards of surfing there. Tidal variations vary greatly among the various global surfing regions, and the effect the tide has on specific spots can vary greatly among the spots within each area. Locations such as Bali, Panama, and Ireland experience 2-3 meter tide fluctuations, whereas in Hawaii the difference between high and low tide is typically less than one meter.\n\nEach surf break is different, since the underwater topography of one place is unlike any other. At beach breaks, the sandbanks can change shape from week to week, so it takes commitment to get good waves.\n\nThe saying \"You should have been here yesterday,\" became a commonly used phrase for bad conditions. Nowadays, however, surf forecasting is aided by advances in information technology, whereby mathematical modeling graphically depicts the size and direction of swells moving around the globe.\n\nThe quest for perfect surf has given rise to a field of tourism based on the surfing adventure. Yacht charters and surf camps offer surfers access to the high quality surf found in remote, tropical locations, where tradewinds ensure offshore conditions.\n\nAlong with the rarity of what surfers consider truly perfect surf conditions (due to changing weather and surf condition) and the inevitable hunt for great waves, surfers often become dedicated to their sport in a way that precludes a more traditional life. Surfing, instead, becomes their lifestyle.\n\nThe goals of those who practice the sport vary, but throughout its history, many have seen surfing as more than a sport, as an opportunity to harness the waves and to relax and forget about their daily routines. Surfers have veered from even this beaten path, and foregone the traditional goals of first world culture in the hunt for a continual 'stoke', harmony with life, their surfing, and the ocean. These \"Soul Surfers\" are a vibrant and long-standing sub-group. Competitive surf culture, centered around surf contests and endorsement deals, and localism's disturbance of the peace, are often seen in opposition to this.\n\nEven though waves break everywhere along a coast, good surf spots are rare. A surf break that forms great surfable waves may easily become a coveted commodity, especially if the wave only breaks there rarely. If this break is near a large population center with many surfers, territorialism often arises. Regular surfers who live around a desirable surf break may often guard it jealously, hence the expression \"locals only.\" The expression \"locals only\" is common among beach towns, especially those that are seasonally encroached upon by vacationers who live outside the area. Localism is expressed when surfers are involved in verbal or physical threats or abuse to deter people from surfing at certain surf spots. It is based in part on the belief that fewer people mean more waves per surfer.\n\nSome locals have been known to form loose gangs that surf in a certain break or beach and fiercely protect their \"territory\" from outsiders.\nThese surfers are often referred to as \"surf punks\" or \"surf nazis.\" The local surfer gangs in Malibu and on Hawaii, known as da hui, have been known to threaten tourists with physical violence for invading their territory. In Southern California, at the Venice and Santa Monica beaches, local surfers are especially hostile to the surfers from the San Fernando Valley whom they dub \"vallies\" or \"valley kooks\". The expression \"Surf Nazi\" arose in the 1960s to describe territorial, aggressive, and obsessive surfers, often involved in surf gangs or surf clubs. The term \"Surf Nazi\" was originally used simply to denote the strict territorialism, violence and hostility to outsiders and the absolute obsession with surfing that was characteristic in the so-called \"surf nazis.\" However, some surfers reclaimed and accepted the term, and a few actually embraced Nazism or Nazi symbolism. Some surf clubs in the 1960s, particularly at Windansea in La Jolla, embraced the term by using the swastika symbol on their boards and identified with Nazism as a counterculture (though this may have just been an effort to keep out or scare non-locals and may have been a tongue-in-cheek embrace of the \"surf nazi\" label as a form of rebellion). The \"locals only\" attitude and protectionism of the Santa Monica surf spots in the early 1970s was depicted in the movie \"Lords of Dogtown\", which was based on the documentary \"Dogtown and Z-Boys\".\n\nLocalism often exists due to socioeconomic factors as well. Until relatively recently, surfers were looked down upon as lazy people on the fringe of society (hence the term \"beach bum.\") Many who surfed were locals of beach towns who lived there year-round, and were from a lower economic class. For that reason as much as any other, these groups were resentful of outsiders, particularly those who were well-to-do and came to their beaches to surf recreationally rather than as a way of life. Australia has its own history where surfers were openly treated with hostility from local governments in the sport's early days, and the tension never really went away, despite the sport's enormous increase in popularity. Maroubra Beach in Australia became infamous for localism and other violence chronicled in the documentary film \"Bra Boys\" about the eponymous group, although the surfers in the film maintain they are not a \"gang.\"\n\nSurf gangs often form to preserve cultural identity through the protection of beach towns and shorelines. If known territory is trespassed by members of another surf gang, violence usually occurs. Long Beach is home to one of the oldest and biggest surf gangs, called \"Longos.\" Some surf gangs have been known to not only claim land territory, but also claim specific surfing waves as territory. Surf gangs have gained notoriety over the years, especially with the production of \"Bra Boys\".\n\nThe Lunada Bay Boys (in Palos Verdes Estates, California) became the subject of a class action lawsuit in 2016.\n\nThe Wolfpak was originally composed of a few select surfers from Kauai, Hawaii who believed in respecting localism. Kauai, according to a Wolfpak member, is a place where one is raised to honor the value of respect. This value is what led to the group’s effort to manage the chaos associated with North Shore surfing. Some notable members have been pro surfers Andy Irons and Bruce Irons, as well as the reality show 808 star and Blue Crush actor, Kala Alexander.\n\nWolfpak began in 2001 when leader Kala Alexander moved to North Shore in search for job opportunities, and found disorganization and lack of respect in the surf lineup at surf reef break, Pipeline. Alexander found it necessary to dictate organization in who would surf the Pipeline to both preserve the value, and also protect surfers from the reef’s potentially life-threatening waves.\n\nThe waves at Pipeline can reach over 20 feet and its powerful disposition has taken the lives of professional surfers. If a visiting surfer collided with another surfer, this could result in serious harm or death. These observations led to the Wolfpak’s proactive enforcement on the North Shore.\n\nThe Wolfpak’s territorial enforcement has drawn attention because of its violent means. In an incident where a tourist cut off a friend of Alexander’s in a dangerous six-foot swell, the Wolfpak leader assaulted the tourist. Comments from anonymous locals show that the presence of Wolfpak is well perceived, if not intimidating. Some locals who hold similar values of cultural respect support what the members are trying to do.\n\nAlexander does not view Wolfpak as a gang, but says they look out for every local Hawaiian. They attempt to preserve their way of life and realize the implications that a lack of respect can have on Hawaiian culture.\n\nThe Bra Boys are a popular surf gang founded in Maroubra, a beachside suburb in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney, Australia. They established international fame and attention in 2007 with the release of \"\", a documentary about the bonds and struggles of the many gang members. The Bra Boys name originates both from the slang word for brother, and as a reference to the gang's home suburb, Maroubra. Gang members tattoo \"My Brothers Keeper\" across the front of their chests and the Maroubra area code across their back.\n\nMany of the Bra Boys came from impoverished homes and families torn apart by drug use. Brothers Sunny, Jai, Koby and Dakota Abberton, came from an especially difficult upbringing. To them the Bra Boys were much more than a gang, they were a group of friends, a family of their own that loved to surf and always stood up for each other. The documentary, written and directed by the gang members themselves, showed the raw gritty side of a surf life previously glamorized by Hollywood.\n\nSurfing (particularly in Southern California) has its own sociolect, which has comingled with Valleyspeak. Words such as \"dude\", \"tubular\", \"radical\", and \"gnarly\" are associated with both and Northern California created its own unique surf terms as well that include \"groovy\", \"hella\", and \"tight\". One of the primary terms used by surfers around the world is the word \"stoked\". This refers to a mixed feeling of anxiety and happiness towards the waves breaking. Surfers have often been associated with being slackers or 'beach bums' (with women being known as 'beach bunnies').\n\nA beach bunny is general North American popular culture term for a young woman who spends her free time at the beach. In surf culture it may also refer to a female surfer. Beach bunnies are known for the amount of time they spend sun tanning and are usually represented wearing bikinis, see Muscle Beach Party and Gidget.\n\nThe shaka sign, associated with Hawaii, origins unknown, is a common greeting in surfer culture.\n\nEnvironmental damage, and increasing riparian development may continue to increase pressure on the sport. Oil spills and toxic algae growth can threaten surfing regions.\n\nSome of these stresses may be overcome by building of artificial reefs for surfing. Several have been built in recent years (one is at Cables in Western Australia), and there is widespread enthusiasm in the global surfing community for additional projects. However, environmental opposition and rigorous coastal permitting regulations is dampening prospects for building such reefs in some countries, such as the United States.\n\nSurfing, as a sport, is heavily dependent on a healthy environment. As a result, interest groups have blossomed to influence the utilization of coastal properties relevant to surfing. There is conflict between surfers and other user groups over the allocation of coastal resources. Common to most disputes are two issues, disposal of sewage and toxic waste into near shore waters and the formation of harbors, breakwaters and jetties. Sewage and toxic waste almost always affects mammals in a negative way. Coastal construction and engineering projects can have either good or bad effects on surf breaks.\nWhile some sources suspect the effectiveness of surfing environmentalist groups, notable victories have been achieved by surfers championing their issues. Some examples of these victories include:\n\nThe surf industry is a billion dollar industry whose popularity as a recreational sport has gained momentum in many coastal areas around the world over the past decades. With the publicizing of new surf destinations through television, movies, magazines, and the Internet, and other media, as well as greater access to traveling accommodations, surf tourism has created large impacts on local communities and environments in developing countries as well as in established areas around the world. Tourism is not always the main reason for fast expansion in developing countries, but under those circumstances groups of activists and non-profits such as Surfrider Foundation, SurfAid, IJourneyGreen, Surf Resource Network, World Tourism Organization, NEF, and UNESCO have begun working with locals and their governments to minimize the negative impacts of tourism upon host communities’ environments and maximize and equitably distribute the positive impacts of tourism. Some of the negative impacts of tourism relevant to surf dominant communities are:\nSome of the positive impacts of tourism relevant to surf dominant communities include: \n\nMany surfers combine their love of the sport with their own religious or spiritual beliefs. In Huntington Beach, California for example, a local Christian non-denominational church occasionally meets on the beach for Sunday early-morning services. After the closing prayer, the minister and paddle out for a morning session. Many surfing communities organize and take part in memorial services for fallen surfers, sometimes on the anniversary of passing such as the Eddie Aikau memorial service held annually at Waimea Bay, Hawaii.\n\nParticipants in the memorial service paddle out to a suitable location with flower leis around their necks or with loose flowers (sometimes held between their teeth). The participants then get into a circular formation, hold hands, and silently pray. Sometimes they will raise their clasped hands skyward before tossing their flowers or leis into the center of the ring. Afterward, they paddle back toward the beach to begin their surf session. Often these services take place at sunrise or sunset. In locations with a pier, such as Huntington Beach, Orange County, California, the service can take place near the end of the pier so that any non-surfers, such as elderly relatives, can watch and participate. Often the participants on the pier will throw down bouquets of flowers into the center of the ring.\n\nSurf culture is reflected in surf music, with subgenres such as surf rock and surf pop. This includes works from such artists as Jan and Dean, The Beach Boys, The Surfaris (\"Wipe Out!\"), Dick Dale, The Shadows, and The Ventures. The music inspired dance crazes such as The Stomp, The Frug, and The Watusi. While the category surf music helped popularize surfing, most surfers at the time, such as Miki Dora, preferred R&B and blues. A newer wave of surf music has started in the acoustic riffs of artists such as Jack Johnson and Donavon Frankenreiter, who are both former professional surfers.\n\n\n\n\n\nMany people have incorporated the free spirited and hippie nature of many surfing lifestyles into their paintings and murals such as the Surfing Madonna mosaic in Encinitas.\n\nSurfwear is a popular style of casual clothing, inspired by surf culture. Many surf-related brand names originated as cottage industry, supplying local surfers with boardshorts, wetsuits, surfboards or leashes, as well as other hardware.\n\nAn early Australian surf fashion company was Kuta Lines, founded by Tony Brown after visiting Bali in 1973. Brown adapted Indonesian textiles and designs for his surfwear. From the 1980s, Kuta Lines used traditional ikat weaving and dyeing techniques, adapted to a heavier, fleecy fabric for cool climate surfing.\n\nSome other clothing brands include O'Neill, Rip Curl, Quiksilver, Town & Country, Ocean Pacific, Billabong, Oakley, DaKine, Reef, Roxy, Volcom, Element, Hurley, Von Zipper, Golden Breed and RVCA.\n\nInternational Surfing Day celebrates the sport and lifestyle on June 20.\n\nCompetitive surfing is a comparison sport. Riders, competing in pairs or small groups, are allocated a certain amount of time to ride waves and display their prowess and mastery of the craft. Competitors are then judged according to how competently the wave is ridden, including the level of difficulty, as well as frequency of maneuvers. There is a professional surfing world surfing championship series held annually at surf breaks around the world.\n\nAlthough competitive surfing has become an extremely popular and lucrative activity, both for its participants and its sponsors, the sport does not have its origins as a competitive pursuit. It is common to hear debate rage between purists of the sport, who still maintain the ideal of \"soul surfing\", and surfers who engage in the competitive and, consequently, commercial side of the activity. An organisation called the Spirit of Surfing has chosen not to accept surf label sponsorship, since an association of that sort could detract from the sentiment they wish to promote.\n\n\nSurfers developed the skateboard to be able to \"surf\" on land. Later came windsurfing (also known as \"sailboarding\"), bodyboarding, wakeboarding, wakesurfing, skimboarding, snowboarding, riverboarding, kiteboarding, sandboarding, mountainboarding, carveboarding all now competitive sports. Another fast growing boardsport is skurfing a mix of surfing and more conventional water sports in which the participant is towed behind the boat. Pineboarding and sandboarding are recreational boardsports.\n\nThe surf culture is reflected in film. Bruce Brown's classic movie \"The Endless Summer\" glorified surfing in a round-the-world search for the perfect wave. John Milius's homage to the Malibu of his youth in \"Big Wednesday\" remains a poignant metaphor for the similarities between the changing surf and life. The 1980s cult classics \"North Shore\" and \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\" serve as mainstream introductions to teenage, light-hearted, superficial surf life (from the \"heyday\"). Beach movies such as the Gidget series, and \"Beach Party\" films such as \"Beach Blanket Bingo\" are less reverential depictions of the culture. \"Liquid Time\" (2002) is an avant-garde surf film that focuses solely on the fluid forms of tubing waves. \"Blue Crush\" (2002) is a film about surfer girls on Hawaii's North Shore. The sequel, \"Blue Crush 2\" (2011) is a film about a California rich girl who travels to South Africa to find out more about her mother and herself. The 1991 film \"Point Break\" involves a group of bank robbers who are also surfers. The 1987 comedy film \"Surf Nazis Must Die\" features surfer gangs in the wake of an earthquake that destroys the California coastline. \"Soul Surfer\" is a biopic about real-life surfer Bethany Hamilton in Hawaii.\n\nSome film events include the Sydney Fringe Festival, Bondi Beach, Sydney, Australia. the Surf Film Festival, Saint Jean de Luz Surf Film Festival, Wavescape Surf Film Festival in South Africa, and the New York Surfing Film Festival.\n\n\n\n• Duke: \"Man, five days on that board and I'm nothing but skin and bones.\" • Ginger: \"What skin.\" • Mary Ann: \"And what bones.\"\n\nMajor advertisers appeal to the surfing market (and to would-be surfers) with commercials featuring, in some cases famed surfing athletes, such as the Coca-Cola commercial featuring Kalani Robb and Maila Jones, and a Kashi food commercial featuring Kashi nutritionist and surfer Jeff Johnson, 2006\n\n\nThe word \"surf\" is polysemous; having multiple, related meanings. \"Surfing\" the World Wide Web is the act of following hyperlinks. The phrase \"surfing the Internet\" was first popularized in print by Jean Armour Polly, a librarian, in an article called \"Surfing the INTERNET\", published in the Wilson Library Bulletin in June 1992.\n\n\n\n\n\nPhilosophical novels\n\n",
                "History of surfing\n\nThe riding of waves has likely existed since humans began swimming in the ocean. In this sense, bodysurfing is the oldest type of wave-catching. Standing up on what is now called a surfboard is a relatively recent innovation developed by the Polynesians.The influences for modern surfing can be directly traced to the surfers of pre-contact Hawaii.\n\nThe art of surfing, known as \"heʻe ʻana\" (\"heʻe\" means \"to surf\", and \"ʻana\" is the nominilizing particle) in the Hawaiian language, was first discovered by Joseph Banks on the HMS Endeavour during the first voyage of James Cook, during the ship's stay in Tahiti. Surfing was a central part of ancient Polynesian culture and predates European contact. The chief (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.\n\nIn Tahiti and Samoa surfing was a popular past time that was often used as part of warriors training. Warriors often paddled to surf breaks and were recorded by early European historians in print as spending many hours bravely paddling head on into large surf and riding waves. Canoes often accompanied\nsurfing parties and the men would often swap between canoeing, paddling boards and catch fish after their recreational activities. In Hawai'i Surfing became more of a spiritual pastime and became ingrained into the very fabric of Hawaii'an religion and culture.\n\nThe sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed Samoans surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as \"fa'ase'e\" or \"se'egalu.\" Edward Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing was also practiced in Tonga, where the late king Taufa'ahau Tupou IV was the foremost Tongan surfer of his time.\n\nThe practice of riding a vessel with a wave was practiced since the Pre-Incan civilization (Mochica/Moche culture) around 2000 years ago and continued in the Chimu culture. The vessels the Mochica people used were called\n\"Caballitos de Totora\", ('Straw SeaHorses'). Although the Mochica used the Caballitos de Totora for fishing purposes, it is also possible that they were used for fun, as their archaeology suggests. It is also likely that the Mochica people did in fact 'surf for fun' given that the longest rideable wave of world 'Chicama' was within their empire. Chicama is located in Puerto Malabrigo, La Libertad, close to the city of Trujillo, Peru. To this day Caballitos de Totora are still used by local fishermen and can be also be ridden by tourists for recreational purposes.\n\nIt is questioned whether this is the first observed form of surfing, given that the Mochica/Chimu also used a paddle/stick to displace themselves in the ocean, thus the Caballito de Totora has a closer resemblance to Stand-Up Paddle boarding than surfing.\n\nThe Ancient Hawaiian people did not consider surfing a mere recreational activity, hobby, extreme sport, or career as it is viewed today. Rather, the Hawaiian people integrated surfing into their culture and made surfing more of an art than anything else. They referred to this art as \"hee nalu\" which translates into English as “wave sliding.” The art began before entering the mysterious ocean as the Hawaiians prayed to the gods for protection and strength to undertake the powerful mystifying ocean. If the ocean was tamed, frustrated surfers would call upon the \"kahuna\" (priest), who would aid them in a surfing prayer asking the gods to deliver great surf. Prior to entering the ocean, the priest would also aid the surfers (mainly of the upper class) in undertaking the spiritual ceremony of constructing a surfboard.\n\nHawaiians would carefully select one of three types of trees. The trees included the \"koa\" (\"Acacia koa\"), \"ulu\" (\"Artocarpus altilis\"), and \"wiliwili\" (\"Erythrina sandwicensis\") trees. Once selected, the surfer would dig the tree out and place fish in the hole as an offering to the gods. Selected craftsmen of the community were then hired to shape, stain, and prepare the board for the surfer. There were three primary shapes: the \"olo\", \"kikoo\", and the \"alaia\". The \"olo\" is thick in the middle and gradually gets thinner towards the edges. The \"kikoo\" ranges in length from and requires great skill to maneuver. The \"alaia\" board is around long and requires great skill to ride and master. Aside from the preparatory stages prior to entering the water, the most skilled surfers were and pastors,[please clarify] including chiefs and warriors that surfed amongst the best waves on the island. These upper class Hawaiians gained respect through their enduring ability to master the waves and this art the Hawaiians referred to as surfing.\nSome ancient sites still popular today include Kahaluu Bay and Holualoa Bay.\n\nIn July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew’s Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California. There, David Kawananakoa, Edward Keliʻiahonui and Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana'ole surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians Kim Stoner and Geoff Dunn.\nIn 1907 George Freeth was brought to California from Hawaii, to demonstrate surfboard riding as a publicity stunt to promote the opening of the Los Angeles-Redondo-Huntington railroad owned by Henry Huntington, who gave his name to Huntington Beach. Freeth surfed at the Huntington Beach pier and travelled up and down the coast demonstrating surfing and life guard skills.\n\nSurfing on the East Coast of the United States began in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina in 1909 when Burke Haywood Bridgers and a colony of surfers introduced surfing to the East Coast. The State of North Carolina honored Burke Haywood Bridgers and the colony of surfers by placing a North Carolina Highway Marker for PIONEER EAST COAST SURFING on Wrightsville Beach and designated Wrightsville Beach as the birthplace of surfing in North Carolina in 2015. North Carolina has the greater weight of published verifiable accurate evidence and impacts a broader geographical area when compared to other east coast states. Burke Haywood Bridgers and the colony of surfers activities are among the earliest appearances of surfboards in the Atlantic Ocean. The early twentieth century surfers proved that surfing migrated from Hawaii to California and North Carolina about the same time, then Florida.\nThe Wrightsville Beach Museum Waterman Hall of Fame honors, recognizes, and inducts community members for their contributions to the island’s watersport culture.\n\nIn 1910, Tommy Walker returned to Manly Beach, Sydney, with a 10-foot surfboard \"bought at Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, for two dollars.\" Walker became an expert rider and in 1912 gave several exhibitions in Sydney.\n\nSurfboard riding received national exposure with the exhibitions by Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku in the summer of 1914-1915 at several Sydney beaches. As a current Olympic sprint champion, Kahanamoku was invited to tour the Eastern states for an extensive series of swimming carnivals and at his first appearance in the Domain Pool, Sydney, smashed his previous world record for 100 yards by a full second.\nFollowing the first exhibition at Freshwater on 24 December 1914, in the New Year Kahanamoku demonstrated his skill at Freshwater and Manly, followed by appearances at Dee Why and Cronulla.\n\nDuke Kahanamoku's board is now on display in the Freshwater Surf Life Saving Club, Sydney, Australia.\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, Hawaiians living close to Waikiki began to revive surfing, and soon re-established surfing as a sport. The revival is linked to real estate development and efforts to boost tourism. Duke Kahanamoku, \"Ambassador of Aloha,\" Olympic medalist, and avid waterman, helped expose surfing to the world. Kahanamoku's role was later memorialized by a 2002 first class letter rate postage stamp of the United States Postal Service. Author Jack London wrote about the sport after having attempted surfing on his visit to the islands. Surfing progressed tremendously in the 20th century, through innovations in board design and ever increasing public exposure.\n\nSurfing's development and culture was centered primarily in three locations: Hawaii, Australia, and California, although the first footage of surfing in the UK was in 1929 by Louis Rosenberg and a number of friends after being fascinated by watching some Australian surfers. In 1959 the release of the film Gidget, based on the life of surfer Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman, boosted the sport's popularity immensely, moving surfing from an underground culture into a national fad and packing many surf breaks with sudden and previously unheard of crowds. B-movies and surf music such as the Beach Boys and Surfaris based on surfing and Southern California beach culture (Beach Party films) as it exploded, formed most of the world's first ideas of surfing and surfers. This conception was revised again in the 1980s, with newer mainstream portrayals of surfers represented by characters like Jeff Spicoli from \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\".\nThe anonymous sleeve notes on the 1962 album \"Surfin' Safari\", the first album to be released on the Capitol label by The Beach Boys, include a rather tongue-in-cheek description of the sport of surfing thus:\"For those not familiar with the latest craze to invade the sun-drenched Pacific coast of Southern California, here is a definition of \"surfing\" - a water sport in which the participant stands on a floating slab of wood, resembling an ironing board in both size and shape, and attempts to remain perpendicular while being hurtled toward the shore at a rather frightening rate of speed on the crest of a huge wave (especially recommended for teen-agers and all others without the slightest regard for either life or limb).\"\n\nRegardless of its usually erroneous portrayal in the media, true surfing culture continued to evolve quietly by itself, changing decade by decade. From the 1960s fad years to the creation and evolution of the short board in the late 60s and early 70s to the performance hotdogging of the neon-drenched 1980s and the epic professional surfing of the 1990s (typified by Kelly Slater, the \"Michael Jordan of Surfing\"). In 1975, professional contests started. That year Margo Oberg became the first female professional surfer.\n\nSurfing documentaries have been one of the main ways in which surfing culture grows and replenishes itself, not just as a sport but as an art form, the style and quality of surf films have often tracked well the evolution of the sport.\n\n\n"

                "Surfing\n\nSurfing is a surface water sport in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or deep face of a moving wave, which is usually carrying the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or in rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools.\n\nThe term \"surfing\" refers to the act of riding a wave, regardless of whether the wave is ridden with a board or without a board, and regardless of the stance used. The native peoples of the Pacific, for instance, surfed waves on alaia, paipo, and other such craft, and did so on their belly and knees. The modern-day definition of surfing, however, most often refers to a surfer riding a wave standing up on a surfboard; this is also referred to as stand-up surfing.\n\nAnother prominent form of surfing is body boarding, when a surfer rides a wave on a bodyboard, either lying on their belly, drop knee, or sometimes even standing up on a body board. Other types of surfing include knee boarding, surf matting (riding inflatable mats), and using foils. Body surfing, where the wave is surfed without a board, using the surfer's own body to catch and ride the wave, is very common and is considered by some to be the purest form of surfing.\n\nThree major subdivisions within standing-up surfing are stand-up paddling, long boarding and short boarding with several major differences including the board design and length, the riding style, and the kind of wave that is ridden.\n\nIn tow-in surfing (most often, but not exclusively, associated with big wave surfing), a motorized water vehicle, such as a personal watercraft, tows the surfer into the wave front, helping the surfer match a large wave's speed, which is generally a higher speed than a self-propelled surfer can produce. Surfing-related sports such as paddle boarding and sea kayaking do not require waves, and other derivative sports such as kite surfing and windsurfing rely primarily on wind for power, yet all of these platforms may also be used to ride waves. Recently with the use of V-drive boats, Wakesurfing, in which one surfs on the wake of a boat, has emerged. The Guinness Book of World Records recognized a wave ride by Garrett McNamara at Nazaré, Portugal as the largest wave ever surfed.\n\nFor hundreds of years, surfing was a central part of ancient Polynesian culture. Surfing may have first been observed by British explorers at Tahiti in 1767. Samuel Wallis and the crew members of the \"Dolphin\" who were the first Britons to visit the island in June of that year. Another candidate is the botanist Joseph Banks being part of the first voyage of James Cook on the HMS \"Endeavour\", who arrived on Tahiti on 10 April 1769. Lieutenant James King was the first person to write about the art of surfing on Hawaii when he was completing the journals of Captain James Cook upon Cook's death in 1779.\n\nWhen Mark Twain visited Hawaii in 1866 he wrote,\nIn one place we came upon a large company of naked natives, of both sexes and all ages, amusing themselves with the national pastime of surf-bathing.\n\nReferences to surf riding on planks and single canoe hulls are also verified for pre-contact Samoa, where surfing was called \"fa'ase'e\" or \"se'egalu\" (see Augustin Krämer, \"The Samoa Islands\"), and Tonga, far pre-dating the practice of surfing by Hawaiians and eastern Polynesians by over a thousand years.\n\nIn July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew’s Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California. There, David Kawānanakoa, Edward Keliʻiahonui and Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians Kim Stoner and Geoff Dunn.\n\nGeorge Freeth (8 November 1883 – 7 April 1919) is often credited as being the \"Father of Modern Surfing\". He is thought to have been the first modern surfer.\n\nIn 1907, the eclectic interests of the land baron Henry E. Huntington brought the ancient art of surfing to the California coast. While on vacation, Huntington had seen Hawaiian boys surfing the island waves. Looking for a way to entice visitors to the area of Redondo Beach, where he had heavily invested in real estate, he hired a young Hawaiian to ride surfboards. George Freeth decided to revive the art of surfing, but had little success with the huge 16-foot hardwood boards that were popular at that time. When he cut them in half to make them more manageable, he created the original \"Long board\", which made him the talk of the islands. To the delight of visitors, Freeth exhibited his surfing skills twice a day in front of the Hotel Redondo.\n\nIn 1975, professional contests started. That year Margo Oberg became the first female professional surfer.\n\nSwell is generated when wind blows consistently over a large area of open water, called the wind's fetch. The size of a swell is determined by the strength of the wind and the length of its fetch and duration. Because of this, surf tends to be larger and more prevalent on coastlines exposed to large expanses of ocean traversed by intense low pressure systems.\n\nLocal wind conditions affect wave quality, since the surface of a wave can become choppy in blustery conditions. Ideal conditions include a light to moderate \"offshore\" wind, because it blows into the front of the wave, making it a \"barrel\" or \"tube\" wave. Waves are Left handed and Right Handed depending upon the breaking formation of the wave.\n\nWaves are generally recognized by the surfaces over which they break. For example, there are Beach breaks, Reef breaks and Point breaks.\n\nThe most important influence on wave shape is the topography of the seabed directly behind and immediately beneath the breaking wave. The contours of the reef or bar front becomes stretched by diffraction. Each break is different, since each location's underwater topography is unique. At beach breaks, sandbanks change shape from week to week. Surf forecasting is aided by advances in information technology. Mathematical modeling graphically depicts the size and direction of swells around the globe.\n\nSwell regularity varies across the globe and throughout the year. During winter, heavy swells are generated in the mid-latitudes, when the North and South polar fronts shift toward the Equator. The predominantly Westerly winds generate swells that advance Eastward, so waves tend to be largest on West coasts during winter months. However, an endless train of mid-latitude cyclones cause the isobars to become undulated, redirecting swells at regular intervals toward the tropics.\n\nEast coasts also receive heavy winter swells when low-pressure cells form in the sub-tropics, where slow moving highs inhibit their movement. These lows produce a shorter fetch than polar fronts, however they can still generate heavy swells, since their slower movement increases the duration of a particular wind direction. The variables of fetch and duration both influence how long wind acts over a wave as it travels, since a wave reaching the end of a fetch behaves as if the wind died.\n\nDuring summer, heavy swells are generated when cyclones form in the tropics. Tropical cyclones form over warm seas, so their occurrence is influenced by El Niño & La Niña cycles. Their movements are unpredictable.\n\nSurf travel and some surf camps offer surfers access to remote, tropical locations, where tradewinds ensure offshore conditions. Since winter swells are generated by mid-latitude cyclones, their regularity coincides with the passage of these lows. Swells arrive in pulses, each lasting for a couple of days, with a few days between each swell.\n\nThe availability of free model data from the NOAA has allowed the creation of several surf forecasting websites.\n\nThe value of good surf in attracting surf tourism has prompted the construction of artificial reefs and sand bars. Artificial surfing reefs can be built with durable sandbags or concrete, and resemble a submerged breakwater. These artificial reefs not only provide a surfing location, but also dissipate wave energy and shelter the coastline from erosion. Ships such as Seli 1 that have accidentally stranded on sandy bottoms, can create sandbanks that give rise to good waves.\n\nAn artificial reef known as Chevron Reef was constructed in El Segundo, California in hopes of creating a new surfing area. However, the reef failed to produce any quality waves and was removed in 2008. In Kovalam, South West India, an artificial reef has, however, successfully provided the local community with a quality lefthander, stabilized coastal soil erosion, and provided good habitat for marine life. ASR Ltd., a New Zealand-based company, constructed the Kovalam reef and is working on another reef in Boscombe, England.\n\nEven with artificial reefs in place, a tourist's vacation time may coincide with a \"flat spell\", when no waves are available. Completely artificial Wave pools aim to solve that problem by controlling all the elements that go into creating perfect surf, however there are only a handful of wave pools that can simulate good surfing waves, owing primarily to construction and operation costs and potential liability. Most wave pools generate waves that are too small and lack the power necessary to surf. The Seagaia Ocean Dome, located in Miyazaki, Japan, was an example of a surfable wave pool. Able to generate waves with up to 10-foot faces, the specialized pump held water in 20 vertical tanks positioned along the back edge of the pool. This allowed the waves to be directed as they approach the artificial sea floor. Lefts, Rights, and A-frames could be directed from this pump design providing for rippable surf and barrel rides. The Ocean Dome cost about $2 billion to build and was expensive to maintain. The Ocean Dome was closed in 2007. In England, construction is nearing completion on the Wave, situated near Bristol, which will enable people unable to get to the coast to enjoy the waves in a controlled environment, set in the heart of nature.\n\nThere are two main types of artificial waves that exist today. One being artificial or stationary waves which simulate a moving, breaking wave by pumping a layer of water against a smooth structure mimicking the shape of a breaking wave. Because of the velocity of the rushing water the wave and the surfer can remain stationary while the water rushes by under the surfboard. Artificial waves of this kind provide the opportunity to try surfing and learn its basics in a moderately small and controlled environment near or far from locations with natural surf.\n\nAnother artificial wave can be made through use of a wave pool such as Kelly Slater's Wave Co. and NLand Surf Park in Austin, TX. These wave pools strive to make a wave that replicates a real ocean wave more than the stationary wave does.\n\nSurfers represent a diverse culture based on riding the waves. Some people practice surfing as a recreational activity while others make it the central focus of their lives. Surfing culture is most dominant in Hawaii and California because these two states offer the best surfing conditions. However, waves can be found wherever there is coastline, and a tight-knit yet far-reaching subculture of surfers has emerged throughout America. Some historical markers of the culture included the woodie, the station wagon used to carry surfers' boards, as well as boardshorts, the long swim shorts typically worn while surfing. Surfers also wear wetsuits in colder regions.\n\nThe sport of surfing now represents a multibillion-dollar industry especially in clothing and fashion markets. The World Surf League (WSL) runs the championship tour, hosting top competitors in some of the best surf spots around the globe. A small number of people make a career out of surfing by receiving corporate sponsorships and performing for photographers and videographers in far-flung destinations; they are typically referred to as freesurfers.Sixty-six surfboarders on a 42-foot surfboard set a record in Huntington Beach, California for most people on a surfboard at one time.As for people who take it more seriously, such as Dale Webster, he consecutively surfed for 14,641 days, making it his main life focus.\n\nWhen the waves were flat, surfers persevered with sidewalk surfing, which is now called skateboarding. Sidewalk surfing has a similar feel to surfing and requires only a paved road or sidewalk. To create the feel of the wave, surfers even sneak into empty backyard swimming pools to ride in, known as pool skating. Eventually, surfing made its way to the slopes with the invention of the Snurfer, later credited as the first snowboard. Many other board sports have been invented over the years, but all can trace their heritage back to surfing.\n\nMany surfers claim to have a spiritual connection with the ocean, describing surfing, the surfing experience, both in and out of the water, as a type of spiritual experience or a religion.\n\nStandup surfing begins when the surfer paddles toward shore in an attempt to match the speed of the wave (The same applies whether the surfer is standup paddling, bodysurfing, boogie-boarding or using some other type of watercraft, such as a waveski or kayak.). Once the wave begins to carry the surfer forward, the surfer stands up and proceeds to ride the wave. The basic idea is to position the surfboard so it is just ahead of the breaking part (whitewash) of the wave. A common problem for beginners is being able to catch the wave at all.\n\nSurfers' skills are tested by their ability to control their board in difficult conditions, riding challenging waves, and executing maneuvers such as strong turns and cutbacks (turning board back to the breaking wave) and \"carving\" (a series of strong back-to-back maneuvers). More advanced skills include the \"floater\" (riding on top of the breaking curl of the wave), and \"off the lip\" (banking off the breaking wave). A newer addition to surfing is the progression of the \"air\" whereby a surfer propels off the wave entirely up into the air, and then successfully lands the board back on the wave.\nThe tube ride is considered to be the ultimate maneuver in surfing. As a wave breaks, if the conditions are ideal, the wave will break in an orderly line from the middle to the shoulder, enabling the experienced surfer to position themselves inside the wave as it is breaking. This is known as a tube ride. Viewed from the shore, the tube rider may disappear from view as the wave breaks over the rider's head. The longer the surfer remains in the tube, the more successful the ride. This is referred to as getting tubed, barreled, shacked or pitted. Some of the world's best known waves for tube riding include Pipeline on the North shore of Oahu, Teahupoo in Tahiti and G-Land in Java. Other names for the tube include \"the barrel\", and \"the pit\".\n\nHanging ten and hanging five are moves usually specific to long boarding. Hanging Ten refers to having both feet on the front end of the board with all of the surfer's toes off the edge, also known as nose-riding. Hanging Five is having just one foot near the front, with five toes off the edge.\n\nCutback: Generating speed down the line and then turning back to reverse direction.\n\nFloater: Suspending the board atop the wave. Very popular on small waves.\n\nTop-Turn: Turn off the top of the wave. Sometimes used to generate speed and sometimes to shoot spray.\n\nAir / Aerial: Launching the board off the wave entirely, then re-entering the wave. Various airs include ollies, lien airs, method airs, and other skateboard-like maneuvers.\n\nThe Glossary of surfing includes some of the extensive vocabulary used to describe various aspects of the sport of surfing as described in literature on the subject. In some cases terms have spread to a wider cultural use. These terms were originally coined by people who were directly involved in the sport of surfing.\n\nMany popular surfing destinations have surf schools and surf camps that offer lessons. Surf camps for beginners and intermediates are multi-day lessons that focus on surfing fundamentals. They are designed to take new surfers and help them become proficient riders. All-inclusive surf camps offer overnight accommodations, meals, lessons and surfboards. Most surf lessons begin with instruction and a safety briefing on land, followed by instructors helping students into waves on longboards or \"softboards\". The softboard is considered the ideal surfboard for learning, due to the fact it is safer, and has more paddling speed and stability than shorter boards. Funboards are also a popular shape for beginners as they combine the volume and stability of the longboard with the manageable size of a smaller surfboard.\nNew and inexperienced surfers typically learn to catch waves on softboards around the 7–8 foot funboard size. Due to the softness of the surfboard the chance of getting injured is substantially minimized.\n\nTypical surfing instruction is best performed one-on-one, but can also be done in a group setting. The most popular surf locations offer perfect surfing conditions for beginners, as well as challenging breaks for advanced students. The ideal conditions for learning would be small waves that crumble and break softly, as opposed to the steep, fast-peeling waves desired by more experienced surfers. When available, a sandy seabed is generally safer.\n\nSurfing can be broken into several skills: Paddling strength, Positioning to catch the wave, timing, and balance. Paddling out requires strength, but also the mastery of techniques to break through oncoming waves (\"duck diving\", \"eskimo roll\"). Take-off positioning requires experience at predicting the wave set and where they will break. The surfer must pop up quickly as soon as the wave starts pushing the board forward. Preferred positioning on the wave is determined by experience at reading wave features including where the wave is breaking. Balance plays a crucial role in standing on a surfboard. Thus, balance training exercises are a good preparation. Practicing with a Balance board or swing boarding helps novices master the art.\n\nSurfing can be done on various equipment, including surfboards, longboards, Stand Up Paddle boards (SUP's), bodyboards, wave skis, skimboards, kneeboards, surf mats and macca's trays. Surfboards were originally made of solid wood and were large and heavy (often up to long and ). Lighter balsa wood surfboards (first made in the late 1940s and early 1950s) were a significant improvement, not only in portability, but also in increasing maneuverability.\n\nMost modern surfboards are made of fiberglass foam (PU), with one or more wooden strips or \"stringers\", fiberglass cloth, and polyester resin (PE). An emerging board material is epoxy resin and Expanded Polystyrene foam (EPS) which is stronger and lighter than traditional PU/PE construction. Even newer designs incorporate materials such as carbon fiber and variable-flex composites in conjunction with fiberglass and epoxy or polyester resins. Since epoxy/EPS surfboards are generally lighter, they will float better than a traditional PU/PE board of similar size, shape and thickness. This makes them easier to paddle and faster in the water. However, a common complaint of EPS boards is that they do not provide as much feedback as a traditional PU/PE board. For this reason, many advanced surfers prefer that their surfboards be made from traditional materials.\n\nOther equipment includes a leash (to stop the board from drifting away after a wipeout, and to prevent it from hitting other surfers), surf wax, traction pads (to keep a surfer's feet from slipping off the deck of the board), and fins (also known as \"skegs\") which can either be permanently attached (\"glassed-on\") or interchangeable. Sportswear designed or particularly suitable for surfing may be sold as \"boardwear\" (the term is also used in snowboarding). In warmer climates, swimsuits, surf trunks or boardshorts are worn, and occasionally rash guards; in cold water surfers can opt to wear wetsuits, boots, hoods, and gloves to protect them against lower water temperatures. A newer introduction is a rash vest with a thin layer of titanium to provide maximum warmth without compromising mobility. In recent years, there have been advancements in technology that have allowed surfers to pursue even bigger waves with added elements of safety. Big wave surfers are now experimenting with inflatable vests or colored dye packs to help decrease their odds of drowning.\n\nThere are many different surfboard sizes, shapes, and designs in use today. Modern longboards, generally in length, are reminiscent of the earliest surfboards, but now benefit from modern innovations in surfboard shaping and fin design. Competitive longboard surfers need to be competent at traditional \"walking\" manoeuvres, as well as the short-radius turns normally associated with shortboard surfing. The modern shortboard began life in the late 1960s and has evolved into today's common \"thruster\" style, defined by its three fins, usually around in length. The thruster was invented by Australian shaper Simon Anderson.\n\nMidsize boards, often called funboards, provide more maneuverability than a longboard, with more flotation than a shortboard. While many surfers find that funboards live up to their name, providing the best of both surfing modes, others are critical.\n\nThere are also various niche styles, such as the \"Egg\", a longboard-style short board targeted for people who want to ride a shortboard but need more paddle power. The \"Fish\", a board which is typically shorter, flatter, and wider than a normal shortboard, often with a split tail (known as a \"swallow tail\"). The Fish often has two or four fins and is specifically designed for surfing smaller waves. For big waves there is the \"Gun\", a long, thick board with a pointed nose and tail (known as a pin tail) specifically designed for big waves.\n\nThe physics of surfing involves the physical oceanographic properties of wave creation in the surf zone, the characteristics of the surfboard, and the surfer's interaction with the water and the board.\n\nOcean waves are defined as a collection of dislocated water parcels that undergo a cycle of being forced past their normal position and being restored back to their normal position. Wind caused ripples and eddies form waves that gradually gain speed and distance (fetch). Waves increase in energy and speed, and then become longer and stronger. The fully developed sea has the strongest wave action that experiences storms lasting 10-hours and creates 15 meter wave heights in the open ocean.\n\nThe waves created in the open ocean are classified as deep-water waves. Deep-water waves have no bottom interaction and the orbits of these water molecules are circular; their wavelength is short relative to water depth and the velocity decays before the reaching the bottom of the water basin. Deep waves have depths greater than ½ their wavelengths. Wind forces waves to break in the deep sea.\n\nDeep-water waves travel to shore and become shallow water waves. Shallow water waves have depths less than ½ of their wavelength. Shallow wave's wavelengths are long relative to water depth and have elliptical orbitals. The wave velocity effects the entire water basin. The water interacts with the bottom as it approaches shore and has a drag interaction. The drag interaction pulls on the bottom of the wave, causes refraction, increases the height, decreases the celerity (or the speed of the wave form), and the top (crest) falls over. This phenomenon happens because the velocity of the top of the wave is greater than the velocity of the bottom of the wave.\n\nThe surf zone is place of convergence of multiple waves types creating complex wave patterns. A wave suitable for surfing results from maximum speeds of 5 meters per second. This speed is relative because local onshore winds can cause waves to break. In the surf zone, shallow water waves are carried by global winds to the beach and interact with local winds to make surfing waves.\n\nDifferent onshore and off shore wind patterns in the surf zone create different types of waves. Onshore winds cause random wave breaking patterns and are more suitable for experienced surfers. Light offshore winds create smoother waves, while strong direct offshore winds cause plunging or large barrel waves. Barrel waves are large because the water depth is small when the wave breaks. Thus, the breaker intensity (or force) increases, and the wave speed and height increase. Off shore winds produce non-surfable conditions by flattening a weak swell. Weak swell is made from surface gravity forces and has long wavelengths.\n\nSurfing waves can be analyzed using the following parameters: breaking wave height, wave peel angle (α), wave breaking intensity, and wave section length. The breaking wave height has two measurements, the relative heights estimated by surfers and the exact measurements done by physical oceanographers. Measurements done by surfers were 1.36 to 2.58 times higher than the measurements done by scientists. The scientifically concluded wave heights that are physically possible to surf are 1 to 20 meters.\n\nThe wave peel angle is one of the main constituents of a potential surfing wave. Wave peel angle measures the distance between the peel-line and the line tangent to the breaking crest line. This angle controls the speed of the wave crest. The speed of the wave is an addition of the propagation velocity vector (Vw) and peel velocity vector (Vp), which results in the overall velocity of the wave (Vs).\n\nWave breaking intensity measures the force of the wave as it breaks, spills, or plunges (a plunging wave is termed by surfers as a “barrel wave”). Wave section length is the distance between two breaking crests in a wave set. Wave section length can be hard to measure because local winds, non-linear wave interactions, island sheltering, and swell interactions can cause multifarious wave configurations in the surf zone.\n\nThe parameters breaking wave height, wave peel angle (α), and wave breaking intensity, and wave section length are important because they are standardized by past oceanographers who researched surfing; these parameters have been used to create a guide that matches the type of wave formed and the skill level of surfer.\n\nTable 1 shows a relationship of smaller peel angles correlating with a higher skill level of surfer. Smaller wave peel angles increase the velocities of waves. A surfer must know how to react and paddle quickly to match the speed of the wave to catch it. Therefore, more experience is required to catch a low peel angle waves. Also, more experienced surfers can handle longer section lengths, increased velocities, and higher wave heights. Different locations offer different types of surfing conditions for each skill level.\n\nA surf break is an area with an obstruction or an object that causes a wave to break. Surf breaks entail multiple scale phenomena. Wave section creation has microscale factors of peel angle and wave breaking intensity. The microscale components influence wave height and variations on wave crests. The mesoscale components of surf breaks are the ramp, platform, wedge, or ledge that may be present at a surf break. Macroscale processes are the global winds that initially produce offshore waves. Types of surf breaks are headlands (point break), beach break, river/estuary entrance bar, reef breaks, and ledge breaks.\n\nA headland or point break interacts with the water by causing refraction around the point or headland. The point absorbs the high frequency waves and long period waves persist, which are easier to surf. Examples of locations that have headland or point break induced surf breaks are Dunedin (New Zealand), Raglan, Malibu (California), Rincon (California), and Kirra (Australia).\n\nA beach break happens where waves break from offshore waves, and onshore sandbars and rips. Wave breaks happen successively at beach breaks. Example locations are Tairua and Aramoana Beach (New Zealand) and the Gold Coast (Australia).\n\nA river or estuary entrance bar creates waves from the ebb tidal delta, sediment outflow, and tidal currents. An ideal estuary entrance bar exists in Whangamata Bar, New Zealand.\n\nA reef break is conducive to surfing because large waves consistently break over the reef. The reef is usually made of coral, and because of this, many injuries occur while surfing reef breaks. However, the waves that are produced by reef breaks are some of the best in the world. Famous reef breaks are present in Padang Padang (Indonesia), Pipeline (Hawaii), Uluwatu (Bali), and Teahupo'o (Tahiti).\n\nA ledge break is formed by steep rocks ledges that makes intense waves because the waves travel through deeper water then abruptly reach shallower water at the ledge. Shark Island, Australia is a location with a ledge break. Ledge breaks create difficult surfing conditions, sometimes only allowing body surfing as the only feasible way to confront the waves.\n\nJetties are added to bodies of water to regulate erosion, preserve navigation channels, and make harbors. Jetties are classified into four different types and have two main controlling variables: the type of delta and the size of the jetty.\n\nThe first classification is a type 1 jetty. This type of jetty is significantly longer than the surf zone width and the waves break at the shore end of the jetty. The effect of a Type 1 jetty is sediment accumulation in a wedge formation on the jetty. These waves are large and increase in size as they pass over the sediment wedge formation. An example of a Type 1 jetty is Mission Beach, San Diego, California. This 1000-meter jetty was installed in 1950 at the mouth of Mission Bay. The surf waves happen north of the jetty, are longer waves, and are powerful. The bathymetry of the sea bottom in Mission Bay has a wedge shape formation that causes the waves to refract as they become closer to the jetty. The waves converge constructively after they refract and increase the sizes of the waves.\n\nA type 2 jetty occurs in an ebb tidal delta, a delta transitioning between high and low tide. This area has shallow water, refraction, and a distinctive seabed shapes that creates large wave heights.\n\nAn example of a type 2 jetty is called \"The Poles\" in Atlantic Beach, Florida. Atlantic Beach is known to have flat waves, with exceptions during major storms. However, \"The Poles\" has larger than normal waves due to a 500-meter jetty that was installed on the south side of the St. Johns. This jetty was built to make a deep channel in the river. It formed a delta at \"The Poles\". This is special area because the jetty increases wave size for surfing, when comparing pre-conditions and post-conditions of the southern St. Johns River mouth area.\n\nThe wave size at \"The Poles\" depends on the direction of the incoming water. When easterly waters (from 55°) interact with the jetty, they create waves larger than southern waters (from 100°). When southern waves (from 100°) move toward \"The Poles\", one of the waves breaks north of the southern jetty and the other breaks south of the jetty. This does not allow for merging to make larger waves. Easterly waves, from 55°, converge north of the jetty and unite to make bigger waves.\n\nA type 3 jetty is in an ebb tidal area with an unchanging seabed that has naturally created waves. Examples of a Type 3 jetty occurs in “Southside” Tamarack, Carlsbad, California.\n\nA type 4 jetty is one that no longer functions nor traps sediment. The waves are created from reefs in the surf zone. A type 4 jetty can be found in Tamarack, Carlsbad, California.\n\nRip currents are fast, narrow currents that are caused by onshore transport within the surf zone and the successive return of the water seaward. The wedge bathymetry makes a convenient and consistent rip current of 5–10 meters that brings the surfers to the “take off point” then out to the beach.\n\nOceanographers have two theories on rip current formation. The wave interaction model assumes that two edges of waves interact, create differing wave heights, and cause longshore transport of nearshore currents. The Boundary Interaction Model assumes that the topography of the sea bottom causes nearshore circulation and longshore transport; the result of both models is a rip current.\n\nRip currents can be extremely strong and narrow as they extend out of the surf zone into deeper water, reaching speeds of 1–2 feet per second to 8 feet per second. The water in the jet is sediment rich, bubble rich, and moves rapidly. The rip head of the rip current has long shore movement. Rip currents are common on beaches with mild slopes that experience sizable and frequent oceanic swell.\n\nThe vorticity and inertia of rip currents have been studied. From a model of the vorticity of a rip current done at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, it was found that a fast rip current extends away from shallow water, the vorticity of the current increases, and the width of the current decreases. This model also acknowledges that friction plays a role and waves are irregular in nature. From data from Sector-Scanning Doppler Sonar at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, it was found that rip currents in La Jolla, CA lasted several minutes, reoccurred one to four times per hour, and created a wedge with a 45° arch and a radius 200–400 meters.\n\nA long surfboard (10 feet) causes more friction with the water; therefore, it will be slower than a smaller lighter board (6 feet). Longer boards are good for beginners who need help balancing. Smaller boards are good for more experienced surfers who want to have more control and maneuverability.\n\nWhen practicing the sport of surfing, the surfer paddles out past the wave break to wait for a wave. When a surfable wave arrives, the surfer must paddle extremely fast to match the velocity of the wave so the wave can accelerate him or her.\n\nWhen the surfer is at wave speed, the surfer must quickly pop up, stay low, and stay toward the front of the wave to become stable and prevent falling as the wave steepens. The acceleration is less toward the front than toward the back. The physics behind the surfing of the wave involves the horizontal acceleration force (Fsinθ) and the vertical force (Fcosθ=mg). Therefore, the surfer should lean forward to gain more speed, and lean on back foot to brake. Also, to increase the length of the ride of the wave, the surfer should travel parallel to the wave crest.\n\n\nSurfing, like all water sports, carries the inherent danger of drowning. Anyone at any age can learn to surf, but should have at least intermediate swimming skills. Although the board assists a surfer in staying buoyant, it can become separated from the user. A leash, attached to the ankle or knee, can keep a board from being swept away, but does not keep a rider on the board or above water. In some cases, possibly including the drowning of professional surfer Mark Foo, a leash can even be a cause of drowning by snagging on a reef or other object and holding the surfer underwater. By keeping the surfboard close to the surfer during a wipeout, a leash also increases the chances that the board may strike the rider, which could knock him or her unconscious and lead to drowning. A fallen rider's board can become trapped in larger waves, and if the rider is attached by a leash, he or she can be dragged for long distances underwater. Surfers should be careful to remain in smaller surf until they have acquired the advanced skills and experience necessary to handle bigger waves and more challenging conditions. However, even world-class surfers have drowned in extremely challenging conditions.\n\nUnder the wrong set of conditions, anything that a surfer's body can come in contact with is potentially a danger, including sand bars, rocks, small ice, reefs, surfboards, and other surfers. Collisions with these objects can sometimes cause injuries such as cuts and scrapes and in rare instances, death.\n\nA large number of injuries, up to 66%, are caused by collision with a surfboard (nose or fins). Fins can cause deep lacerations and cuts, as well as bruising. While these injuries can be minor, they can open the skin to infection from the sea; groups like Surfers Against Sewage campaign for cleaner waters to reduce the risk of infections. Local bugs and disease can be a dangerous factor when surfing around the globe.\n\nFalling off a surfboard or colliding with others is commonly referred to as a \"wipeout\".\n\nSea life can sometimes cause injuries and even fatalities. Animals such as sharks, stingrays, Weever fish, seals and jellyfish can sometimes present a danger. Warmer-water surfers often do the \"stingray shuffle\" as they walk out through the shallows, shuffling their feet in the sand to scare away stingrays that may be resting on the bottom.\n\nRip currents are water channels that flow away from the shore. Under the wrong circumstances these currents can endanger both experienced and inexperienced surfers. Since a rip current appears to be an area of flat water, tired or inexperienced swimmers or surfers may enter one and be carried out beyond the breaking waves. Although many rip currents are much smaller, the largest rip currents have a width of forty or fifty feet. However, by paddling parallel to the shore, a surfer can easily exit a rip current. Alternatively, some surfers actually ride on a rip current because it is a fast and effortless way to get out beyond the zone of breaking waves.\n\nThe seabed can pose dangers for surfers. If a surfer falls while riding a wave, the wave tosses and tumbles the surfer around, often in a downwards direction. At reef breaks and beach breaks, surfers have been seriously injured and even killed because of a violent collision with the sea bed, the water above which can sometimes be very shallow, especially at beach breaks or reef breaks during low tide. Cyclops, Western Australia, for example is one of the biggest and thickest reef breaks in the world, with waves measuring up to 10 metres high, but the reef below is only about below the surface of the water.\n\nA January 2018 study by the University of Exeter called the \"Beach Bum Survey\" found surfers and bodyboarders to be three times as likely as non-surfers to harbor antibiotic-resistant \"E. coli\" and four times as likely to harbor other bacteria capable of easily becoming antibiotic resistant. The researchers attributed this to the fact that surfers swallow roughly ten times as much seawater as swimmers.\n\n",
                "Windsurfing\n\nWindsurfing is a surface water sport that combines elements of surfing and sailing. It consists of a board usually 2.5 to 3 meters long, with displacements typically between 60 and 250 litres, powered by wind on a sail. The rig is connected to the board by a free-rotating universal joint and consists of a mast, boom and sail. The sail area generally ranges from 2.5 m to 12 m depending on the conditions, the skill of the sailor, the type of windsurfing being undertaken and the weight of the person windsurfing.\n\nSome credit S. Newman Darby with the origination of windsurfing by 1964 on the Susquehanna River, Pennsylvania, USA when he invented the \"sailboard\", which, incidentally, he did not patent. In 1964, Darby began selling his sailboards. A promotional article by Darby was published in the August 1965 edition of Popular Science magazine.\n\nWhile Darby's \"sailboard\" incorporated a pivoting rig, it was \"square rigged\" and suffered all the associated limitations. The sailboard was operated with the sailor's back to the lee side of a kite-shaped sail. Darby's article boasted that \"\"...you can learn to master a type of manoeuvering that's been dead since the age of the picturesque square riggers\"\"\n\nWindsurfing can be said to straddle both the laid-back culture of surf sports and the more rules-based environment of sailing. Although it might be considered a minimalistic version of a sailboat, windsurfing offers experiences that are outside the scope of other sailing craft designs. Windsurfers can perform jumps, inverted loops, spinning maneuvers, and other \"freestyle\" moves that cannot be matched by any sailboat. Windsurfers were the first to ride the world's largest waves, such as Jaws on the island of Maui, and, with very few exceptions, it was not until the advent of tow-in surfing that waves of that size became accessible to surfers on more traditional surfboards. Extreme waves aside, many expert windsurfers will ride the same waves as surfers do (wind permitting).\n\nAt one time referred to as \"surfing's ginger haired cousin\" by the sport's legendary champion, Robby Naish, windsurfing has long struggled to present a coherent image of the sport to outsiders. As a result of attempts to claim the word \"windsurfer\" as a trademark, participants have been encouraged to use different names to describe the sport, including \"sailboarding\" and \"boardsailing\". The term \"windsurfing\" has persisted as the accepted name for the sport, and the word \"windsurfer\" persists for both participants and equipment.\n\nWindsurfing is predominately undertaken on a non-competitive basis. Organised competition does take place at all levels across the world, including in the Olympics. Typical formats for competitive windsurfing include Formula Windsurfing, speed sailing, slalom, course racing, wave sailing, superX, and freestyle.\n\nThe boom of the 1980s led windsurfing to be recognized as an Olympic sport in 1984. However, windsurfing's popularity saw a sharp decline in the mid-1990s, thanks to licensing battles, and equipment becoming more specialized and requiring more expertise to sail. The sport experienced a modest revival, as new beginner-friendly designs became available. Further pressure came as a proportion of avid windsurfers took up the similar sport of kitesurfing.\n\nWindsurfing, as a sport and recreational activity, did not emerge until the latter half of the 20th century. But before this, there have been sailing boats of various designs that have used wind as the driving force for millennia, and Polynesians have been riding waves for many of them, undertaking day trips over oceans standing upright on a solid board with a vertical sail.\n\nIn 1948, 20-year-old Newman Darby was the first to conceive the idea of using a handheld sail and rig mounted on a universal joint so that he could control his small catamaran—the first rudderless sailboard ever built that allowed a person to steer by shifting his or her weight in order to tilt the sail fore and aft. Darby did not file a patent for the sailboard. However, he is widely recognized as its inventor as well as the first to conceive, design, and build a sailboard with a universal joint. In his own words, Darby experimented throughout much of the 1950s and 1960s and it wasn't until 1963 that an improved sailboard with a conventional stayed sloop rig sail arrangement made it more stable than the one built in 1948. In 1964, Darby began selling his sailboards.\n\nTwelve-year-old Peter Chilvers is often cited for inventing a sailboard in 1958. In the 1960s, Jim Drake was the first to solve many problems of getting the board to sail while Hoyle Schweitzer was the first to be successful in marketing the sailboard.\n\nIn 1964, during a discussion on water sports over a brandy at his home in Southern California, RAND Corporation aeronautical engineer Jim Drake and his former Rockwell boss and good friend Fred Payne, who worked at The Pentagon, discussed options for creating a wind-powered water-ski which would allow Payne to travel on the Potomac River. That night they developed the idea of a kite-powered surfboard. On later reflection, Drake didn't like the integrity of the idea and dismissed it. There were already a number of sailboard designs available, and Drake also was concerned about the integrity of a design needing taut wire close to a human body to keep the sail upright.\n\nStill developing the idea, Drake's wife met the pregnant Diana Schweitzer, and the two families became good friends through their children. Drake mentioned the idea to surfer Hoyle Schweitzer who wanted to develop it, but Drake was still unsure of how to control and steer what he envisaged in a design concept as a surfboard with upright sail design, whereby the sailor stood upright on the board holding the sail.\n\nThe technical problem was that most boats steer by varying the angle of attack in the water between the centreboard and the rudder, and Drake's question came down to simple operation of how a standing person could control both the power of the sail as well as the direction of the craft.\n\nIn 1967, while driving between his home and a contract at the Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino, Drake had time to reflect on early 17th century based sail ship control. Rudders then were weak and ineffective, mostly used for trimming course. Hence with multi-masted boats, the sailors would trim the upper sails on the forward and rearwards masts to steer the ship.\n\nDismissing the idea of a design with two upright sails, Drake decided to move the sail by rotation, as moving it linearly would require a mechanical system. Experimenting with a rotational design which became the concept for the universal joint, whereby the angle of attack of the sail to the board could be varied to allow control of both power and direction. Drake finished the design by using an earlier but for them failed invention of East Coast racing sail, and added a wishbone boom.\n\nOn March 27, 1968, Hoyle Schweitzer and Jim Drake filed the very first windsurfing patent, which was granted by the USPTO in 1970. There is no evidence that they had knowledge of any prior inventions similar to theirs, but Drake accepted in retrospect that although he can be credited with invention, he was \"probably no better than third,\" behind mid-west based Newman Darby and Englishman Peter Chilvers.\n\nThe early windsurfing boards were made of foam in the garages of Schweitzer and Drake, with the booms, tees and daggerboards handcrafted in teak. Hoyle sub-contracted the manufacture of the teak items to boat builder Ennals Ives in Taiwan, but the quality and costs of transportation brought other issues. One of the early customers was Bert Salisbury, and the first international shipment of a container of boards went to Sweden. Early customers also included Lufthansa pilots who had read about the board, who simply included one as personal luggage on their return journey from Los Angeles International Airport.\n\nTo ensure the quality of the product and handle marketing, in 1968 Hoyle and Diana Schweitzer founded the company Windsurfing International in Southern California to manufacture, promote and license a windsurfer design. The jointly owned patent was wholly licensed to Windsurfing International. Working in a factory unit in Torrance, California, Hoyle, who had previously built personal surfboards in his garage, was unhappy with the durability of the early \"Baja Board.\" He therefore developed a new mould, based on an old Malibu surfboard design that Matt Kivlin had developed, which the company sub-contracted for mass manufacture to Elmer Good.\n\nThe company registered the term \"windsurfer\" as a trademark at the United States Patent and Trademark Office in 1973, launching the craft as a one-design class. Going one-design was influenced by the success of the Laser and Hobie Cat classes. Each Windsurfer had an identical computer-cut sail, a technology new at that time and pioneered by Ian Bruce and the Laser class.\n\nIn 1968, Hoyle's computer business collapsed, and he and Diane moved to Newport Beach; at the same time Drake accepted a two-year assignment to The Pentagon, and moved to Washington DC. Immediately, Hoyle offered Drake to buy out his half of the patent, and it was only when Hoyle pointed out ownership of the company that the relationship between the pair began to fall apart. Having returned to California, in 1973 Drake sold his half of the patent to Windsurfing International for the sum of $36,000.\n\nThrough the seventies, Schweitzer aggressively promoted and licensed the Windsurfing International design and licensed the patent to manufacturers worldwide, mainly through competition and the publication of a magazine. As a result, the sport underwent very rapid growth, particularly in Europe after the sale of a sub-license sold to Ten Cate in the Netherlands.\n\nAt the same time, Schweitzer also sought to defend his patent rights vigorously against unauthorized manufacturers. This led to a host of predating windsurfer-like devices being presented to courts around the world by companies disputing Windsurfing International's rights to the invention.\n\nIn 1979, Schweitzer licensed Brittany, France-based company Dufour Wing, which was later merged with Tabur Marine – the precursor of Bic Sport. Europe was now the largest growing market for windsurfers, and the sub-licensed companies – Tabur, F2, Mistral – wanted to find a way to remove or reduce their royalty payments to Windsurfing International.\n\nTabur lawyers found prior art, in a local English newspaper which had published a story with a picture about Peter Chilvers, who as a young boy on Hayling Island on the south coast of England, assembled his first board combined with a sail, in 1958. This board used a universal joint, one of the key parts of the Windsurfing International's patent. They also found stories published about the 1948 invention of the sailboard by Newman Darby and his wife Naomi in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn \"Windsurfing International Inc. v Tabur Marine (GB) Ltd. 1985 RPC 59\", with Tabur backed financially by French sailing fan Baron Marcel Bich, British courts recognized the prior art of Peter Chilvers. It did not incorporate the curved wishbone booms of the modern windsurfer, but rather a \"straight boom\" that became curved in use. The courts found that the Schweitzer windsurfer boom was \"merely an obvious extension\". It is worthy of note that this court case set a significant precedent for patent law in the United Kingdom, in terms of inventive step and non-obviousness; the court upheld the defendant's claim that the Schweitzer patent was invalid, based on film footage of Chilvers. Schweitzer then sued the company in Canada, where the opposition team again financially backed by Bic included Chilvers and Jim Drake, and Schweitzer lost again. After the cases, no longer obliged to pay Windsurfing International any royalty payments, the now renamed Bic Sport became the world’s largest producer of windsurfing equipment, with an annual production of 15,000 boards.\n\nIn 1983, Schweitzer sued Swiss board manufacturer Mistral and lost. Mistral's defense hinged on the work of US inventor Newman Darby, who by 1965 conceived the \"sailboard\": a hand-held square rigged \"kite\" sail on a floating platform for recreational use.\n\nEventually US courts recognized the Schweitzer windsurfer as an obvious step from Darby's prior art. Schweitzer had to reapply for a patent under severely limited terms, and finally it expired in 1987. Shortly thereafter, having lost its license royalty income, Windsurfing International ceased operations.\n\nIn 1984, Australian courts determined a patent case: Windsurfing International Inc & Anor -v- Petit & Anor (also part reported in 3 IPR 449 or [1984] 2 NSWLR 196), which attributed the first legally accepted use of a split boom to an Australian boy, Richard Eastaugh. Between the ages of ten and thirteen, from 1946 to 1949, aided by his younger brothers, he built around 20 galvanized iron canoes and hill trolleys which he equipped with sails with split bamboo booms. He sailed these in a sitting position and not as a windsurfer standing up, near his home on the Swan River in Perth. The judge noted that, \"\"Mr Eastaugh greatly exaggerated the capacity of his galvanised iron canoes to sail to windward\"\" and that, \"\"There is no corroboration of Mr Eastaugh's experiences by any other witness. Neither of his brothers or his father was called\"\".\n\nIt is acknowledged in the courts that the separate Eastaugh (1946–1949), Darby (1965) and Chilvers (1958) inventions pre-dated the Schweitzer/Drake patent (1968).\n\nWindsurfing International claimed trademark rights with respect to the word \"windsurfer\". While this was registered in the United States for some years, it was not accepted for registration in many jurisdictions as the word was considered too descriptive. Registration was ultimately lost in the United States for the same reason.\n\nThe Schweitzers initially chose the word for its descriptive quality. Unfortunately they immediately set out diminishing its value by naming their company \"Windsurfing International\" and even referring to themselves and their own children as \"windsurfers\".\n\nAs the word was rejected as registrable in a number of countries, lawyers advised that to be successful the word would have to be used as a proper adjective. They realised that this required a number of generic nouns to which the adjective would apply: sailboard, boardsailing, planche a voile, segelbrett and so on. The rearguard action was ultimately unsuccessful and arguably created considerable confusion which hampered marketing efforts in later years.\n\nWhile the numerous patent and trademark disputes have left an unfortunate legacy, the fact is that these disputes did not occur until well after Windsurfing International, its licensees, class associations, retailers, schools and owners had built the sport to a successful commercial basis. That success brought imitation and then legal disputes.\n\nThe launch phase saw a comprehensive development of infrastructure for a new sport and dramatic sales growth.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, windsurfers were classified as either shortboards or longboards. Longboards were usually longer than 3 meters, with a retractable daggerboard, and were optimized for lighter winds or course racing. Shortboards were less than 3 meters long and were designed for planing conditions. However, this classification by length has become obsolete, as new techniques, designs, and materials have taken the sport in new directions.\n\nMost modern windsurfers (1990s and later) are derived from the shortboard design, and are intended to be used ideally in planing mode, where the board is mostly skipping over the surface of the water, rather than cutting through and displacing the water. Planing is faster and gives more maneuverability, but requires a different technique from the displacement mode (which is also referred to as slogging or schlogging). Generally smaller boards and smaller sails are used as the wind increases.\n\nWhile windsurfing is possible under a wide range of wind conditions, most recreational windsurfers prefer to sail in conditions that allow for consistent planing with multi-purpose, not overly specialized, free-ride equipment. Larger (100 to 140 liters) free-ride boards are capable of planing at wind speeds as low as 12 knots if rigged with an adequate, well-tuned sail in the six to eight square meter range. The pursuit of planing in lower winds has driven the popularity of wider and shorter boards, with which planing is possible in wind as low as 8 knots, if sails in the 10 to 12 square meter range are used.\n\nModern windsurfing boards can be classified into many categories:\nThere are many attempts to bridge the gap between any two of these categories, such as freestyle-wave, freeformula, and so on. These attempts are often successful in their own right, but every shape has its specific strong points and disadvantages. In short, a board with a lot of scoop, rocker or tailkick will turn more easily and respond to footsteering, but top speed and upwind performance will suffer. A board with a straight mid- and aft waterline will plane earlier, thus giving good upwind performance, but will not footsteer without the sailor actively shifting weight. In 2013 a Norwegian inventor Sundin Gjessing patented a prototype board which changes its tail shape with a footswitch - an attempt to combine speed and turning ability into one hull. The board has not been put into production.\nThe original \"Windsurfer\" board had a body made out of polyethylene filled with PVC foam. Later, hollow glass-reinforced epoxy designs were used. Most boards produced today have an expanded polystyrene foam core reinforced with a composite sandwich shell, that can include carbon fiber, kevlar, or fiberglass in a matrix of epoxy and sometimes plywood and thermoplastics. Racing and wave boards are usually very light (5 to 7 kg), and are made out of carbon sandwich. Such boards are very stiff, and veneer is sometimes used to make them more shock-resistant. Boards aimed at the beginners are heavier (8 to 15 kg) and more robust, containing more fiberglass.\n\nModern windsurfing sails are often made of monofilm (clear polyester film), dacron (woven polyester) and mylar. Areas under high load may be reinforced with kevlar.\n\nTwo designs of a sail are predominant: camber induced and rotational. Cambered sails have 1–5 camber inducers - plastic devices at the ends of battens which cup against the mast. They help create a rigid aerofoil shape for faster speed and stability, but at the cost of maneuverability and how light the sail feels. The trend is that racier sails have camber inducers while wave sails and most recreational sails do not. The rigidity of the sail is also determined by a number of \"battens\".\n\nBeginners' sails often do not have \"battens\", so they are lighter and easier to use in light winds. However, as the sailor improves, a battened sail will provide greater stability in stronger winds.\n\nRotational sails have \"battens\" which protrude beyond the back aspect of the mast. They flip or \"rotate\" to the other side of the mast when tacking or jibing, hence the rotation in the name. Rotational sails have an aerofoil shape on the leeward side when powered, but are nearly flat when sheeted out (unpowered). In comparison with cambered sails, rotational designs offer less power and stability when sailing straight, but are easier to handle when maneuvering. Rotational sails are usually lighter and easier to rig.\n\nA windsurfing sail is tensioned at two points: at the tack (by downhaul), and at the clew (by outhaul). There is a set of pulleys for downhauling at the tack, and a grommet at the clew. Most shape is given to the sail by applying a very strong downhaul, which by design bends the mast. The outhaul tension is relatively weak, mostly providing leverage for controlling the sail's angle of attack.\n\nThe sail is tuned by adjusting the downhaul and the outhaul tension. Generally, a sail is trimmed more (flatter shape) for stronger winds. More downhaul tension loosens the upper part of the leech, allowing the top of the sail to twist and \"spill\" wind during gusts, shifting the center of effort (strictly, the center of pressure) down. Releasing downhaul tension shifts the center of effort up. More outhaul lowers the camber/draft, making the sail flatter and easier to control, but less powerful; less outhaul results in more draft, providing more low-end power, but usually limiting speed by increasing aerodynamic resistance.\n\nThe disciplines of windsurfing (wave, freestyle, freeride) require different sails. Wave sails are reinforced to survive the surf, and are nearly flat when depowered to allow riding waves. Freestyle sails are also flat when depowered, and have high low-end power to allow quick acceleration. Freeride sails are all-rounders that are comfortable to use and are meant for recreational windsurfing. Race sails provide speed at the expense of qualities like comfort or maneuverability.\n\nThe size of the sail is measured in square meters and can be from 3 m to 5.5 m for wave sails and 6 m to 15 m for race sails, with ranges for freestyle and freeride sails spanning somewhere between these extremes. Learning sails for children can be as small as 0.7 m and race sails up to 15 m.\n\nA sailboard will move, depending on wind conditions and the skill or intentions of the rider, in two entirely different manners, with two different displacements; it will either sail or hydroplane (referred to as \"planing\"). A sensation likened to low-level flying may be experienced by the hydroplaning windsurfer.\n\nThe board moves through the water – much like a sailing boat does – using an extendable centreboard (if available) and fin or skeg for stability and lateral resistance. The centreboard is retracted at broad points of sail, again similarly to a sailing boat, to allow for jibing control. In these conditions windsurf boards also tack and jibe like a sailing boat.\n\nDirectional Control is achieved by moving the rig either forward (turning away from the wind) or aft (turning towards the wind). When jibing, the clew of the sail is let around and allowed to rotate out and around the mast.\n\nFall Recovery. The rider climbs onto the board, grabs the pulling rope (\"uphaul\"), makes sure the mast foot is between two feet, pulls the sail about one third out of the water, lets the wind turn the sail-board combination till he/she has the wind right in the back, pulls the sail all the way out, places the \"mast hand\" (hand closest to the mast) on the boom, pulls the mast over the center line of the board, places the \"sail hand\" (hand furthest from the mast) on the boom, then pulling on it to close the sail and power it.\n\nIn planing conditions a harness is typically worn to more efficiently use the rider's weight to counter the force in the sail. As the wind increases, the rider continues to sheet the sail, the fin generates more lift, and the board gains speed, transitioning onto a \"plane\". The volume of board in the water (\"displacement\") decreases, and the rider moves rearward, stepping into the footstraps for improved control. When planing, the board skims on the surface rather than displacing water as it moves. Planing can be achieved at different wind speeds depending on the rider's weight, sail and fin size, wave conditions, and rider ability. With modern equipment planing can normally be achieved at a wind speed of around 12 knots. The transition from displacement motion to planing requires a jump in energy, but once planing, water resistance decreases dramatically. This means that it is possible to continue to plane, although the wind has dropped below a level that would be required to transition to plane. A board in plane can be much smaller than a board moving by displacement (thereby gaining an advantage in gear weight and board control). Lateral resistance to the wind is provided by the fin alone (generating more lift at higher speeds) and a centreboard is no longer used (smaller boards do not have one). A fin generates lift, transferring a strong load to the board, and so is usually constructed of carbon fiber for accurate shape and strength. A low-pressure area develops on the windward side of the fin, which can lead to cavitation, leading to a sudden loss of lift, called \"spin-out\" (equivalent to \"stalling\" in flight terminology). Ideal planing conditions for most recreational riders is 15–25 knots of wind, but experts can windsurf in much windier conditions. Planing is considered one of the most exhilarating aspects of the sport.\n\nDirectional Control is mainly achieved by putting rider weight pressure on either the left or the right rail (edge) of the board. Jibing is done at full speed (a so-called \"carve jibe\", \"power jibe\" or \"planing jibe\"), whereby the rider continues to apply pressure on the inside rail of the turn, leaning into the turn much like a snowboarder making a toe-side turn. Pressure is released from the sail as the board speed turns downwind, allowing for the sail to be jibed. Tacking is still possible, but at these conditions has become an advanced maneuver, because it requires quick movements and good balance. A heel-side turn while planing (called a \"cut-back\") is usually only executed in wave riding.\n\nFall Recovery: In strong winds it is difficult to uphaul the sail (pulling it out of the water while standing on the board) so \"waterstarting\" is necessary. This is done (while water treading) by positioning the mast perpendicular to the wind, lifting the luff out of the water to allow the wind to catch the sail, and then having the sail pull the sailor onto the board. As the sail becomes powered, it is then trimmed to bring the rider, board, and sail back onto a plane. Occasionally a rider may be unable to waterstart if the wind has dropped. If this happens the rider can wait for a gust and \"\"pump\"\" the sail to get back on the board. If this becomes hopeless uphauling the sail will be necessary.\n\nLearning to windsurf used to present the biggest barrier to the sport's growth, but with the development of new, wider (80 to 100 cm), high volume (more than 200 liters) beginner boards the transition time from beginner to intermediate has been reduced. Beginners, starting off on a large board with a tiny triangular sail in less than 5 knots of wind on a shallow lake, often struggle to see the similarity between what they are doing and the images they see in magazines of advanced riders using a 2.25 m board to ride waves in 20–30 knots of wind. But with good instruction windsurfing can be picked up rather quickly, not unlike other extreme sports like Kitesurfing, or Snowboarding.\n\nBeginners must develop their balance and core stability, acquire a basic understanding of sailing theory, and learn a few techniques before they can progress from sailing to planing. These techniques involve a similar process to that required to learn to ride a bicycle – the development of muscle-memory automatic reactions:\n\n1. Standing on the board while holding the sail and balancing the weight of the sail leaning to one side with the sailor's weight leaning out on the other side.\n\n2. Leaning the sail towards the front and rear of the board and learning how this is used to turn the board by adjusting the relative positions of the centre of weight of the whole sail/board/sailor combination and the centre of pressure of the wind in the sail.\n\n3. Learning to adjust the amount of pressure in the sail while simultaneously counteracting that pressure by leaning the sailor's body in or out from the board.\n\nInitial lessons can be taken with a windsurfing school, which exist in reasonable numbers in most countries. With coaching and favorable conditions, the basic skills of sailing, steering, and turning can be learned within a few hours. Competence in the sport and mastery of more advanced maneuvers such as planing, carve gybing (turning downwind at speed), water starting, jumping, and more advanced moves can require more practice. Training DVDs exist which are useful in a sport where it is difficult for a coach to be close to a pupil particularly when learning the more advanced maneuvers.\n\nNevertheless, windsurfing is a sport which, once mastered, can be enjoyed, even at an advanced level, well into retirement and then at a more sedate level for considerably longer still. This is partly due to the fact that windsurfing crashes tend to cause less injury than those sports which take place on harder surfaces (although being reckless whilst windsurfing in advanced conditions can still cause serious injury or death due to the speeds and altitudes involved).\n\nIndoor windsurfing competitions are also held, especially in Europe, during winter.\n\nOne of the better known, the PWA/UKWA World Indoor Windsurfing Championships, are held during the annual London Boat Show at the ExCeL Exhibition Centre in London in January. Each year a massive indoor pool is constructed and housed in a marquee. Powerful fans propel the boards along the pool. The competitions held include slalom style races, jumping competitions and more.\n\n\nIn windsurfing competitions, there are the following disciplines:\nFreestyle and Wave are judged competitions, the sailor with best technique and diversity wins. Olympic Boardsailing, Formula windsurfing, Slalom and SuperX are races where many sailors compete on a course, and Speed Racing is a race where sailors compete on a straight 500 m course in turns.\n\nWindsurfing led to the development of scoring programs on early portable computers. Because windsurfing regattas were drawing a large number of competitors at remote locations, Windsurfing International sponsored the development of software running on portable computers to score regattas, starting with the 1976 World Championships in the Bahamas. The software, named OSCOR, was developed for the HP9825 (then a $20,000 computer) and later ported to the TRS-80. The OSCOR software was eventually donated to the United States Yacht Racing Union.\n\nSailboarding has been one of the Olympic sailing events at the Summer Olympics since 1984 for men and 1992 for women. Olympic Windsurfing uses 'One Design' boards, with all sailors using the same boards, daggerboards, fins and sails. The equipment is chosen to allow racing in a wide range of sailing conditions. This is important for the Olympic Games, as events have to take place regardless of whether there is enough wind for planing. The current Olympic class, the was used for the first time in the 2008 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Olympics. However, in May 2012 the International Sailing Federation voted windsurfing out of the list of the Olympic sailing disciplines for the 2016 Games in favour of kitesurfing.\nThe decision to replace windsurfing with kiteboarding was reversed by the ISAF general assembly in November 2012.\n\nFormula windsurfing has developed over the last 15 years in order to facilitate high-performance competition in light and moderate winds. Formula is now a class of windsurfing boards controlled by the International Sailing Federation that has the principal characteristic of a maximum 1m width. They have a single fin of maximum length 70 cm and carry sails up to 12.5 m². Class rules allow sailors to choose boards produced by multiple manufacturers, as long as they are certified as Formula boards and registered with ISAF, and use fins and sails of different sizes. With the sail, fin and board choices, the equipment is able to be tailored to suit sailors of all body shapes and formula windsurfing presents one of the fastest course-racing sailing craft on the water. Formula Windsurfing is popular in many locations around the globe with predominantly light winds and flat water.\n\nLarge sails in combination with the 'wide-style' design allow planing in very low wind conditions as well as control and usability in high winds and bigger sea conditions. Non-planing sailing is very difficult with this design and racing is only conducted with a strict 7 knot wind minimum in place. Formula boards are used on \"flat water\" as opposed to coastal surf, but racing is still held in windy conditions involving swell and chop. In 2008, a Formula Windsurfing Grand-Prix World Tour began, with events in Europe and South America complementing the single-event World Championships as a professional tour for the Formula class.\n\nFormula boards have excellent upwind and downwind ability, but are not as comfortable on a beam reach unless fin sizes are reduced. This explains why the course is usually a box with longer upwind and downwind legs, or just a simple upwind-downwind return course.\n\nRaceboards are longer windsurf boards with a daggerboard and movable mast rail allowing the sailor to be efficient on all points of sail. Excellent upwind ability is combined with good reaching and even downwind ability typically sailed in an Olympic triangle course. Whilst in decline in manufacture since the advent of shortboard course racing (which evolved into Formula) there remains some models in production and most notably the IMCO One Design remains popular amongst amateur racing clubs.\n\nSlalom is a high-speed race. Typically there are two sorts of slalom courses.\nSlalom boards are small and narrow, and require high winds. Funboard class racing rules require the wind of 9–35 knots for the slalom event to take place.\n\nCompetitors compete to see who can record the highest jump or maneuver. A 3D accelerometer is worn to measure and record heights of the jumps. Xensr is a manufacture of 3D accelerometers and promoter of the Big Air competition. It is a popular discipline in Hood river, USA.\n\nThis discipline is a cross between freestyle and slalom. Competitors race on a short downwind slalom course, must duck jibe on all turns, and are required to perform several tricks along the way. Competitors are required to wear protective equipment. The Super X discipline was short lived and is now largely unpracticed; it reached its peak in the early 2000s,\n\nSpeedsailing takes place in several forms. The ISWC (International Speed Windsurfing Class) organizes (under the umbrella of the ISAF) competitions in various locations around the world known for conditions suitable for good speeds. The events are made up of heats sailed on a 500m course. The average of each sailor's best 2 speeds on the 500m course, which is typically open for 2 hours per heat, is their speed for that heat. As such it is possible for the sailor with the outright fastest time not to win the heat if his second best time pulls his average down. Points are given for the placings in the heats and the overall event winner is the sailor with the best point score (again not necessarily the fastest sailor). Likewise points are given for places in the events and at the last event a World Speedsurfing Champion is crowned.\n\nOn record attempts controlled by the World Speed Sailing Record Council (WSSRC) competitors complete timed runs on a 500m or 1 nautical mile (1,852m) course. The current 500m record (for Windsurfers) is held by French windsurfer Antoine Albeau. The women's 500m Record is held By Zara Davis, from England, also in Luderitz. The Men's nautical mile record is held by Bjorn Dunkerbeck and the women's mile record is held by Zara Davis both set in Walvis Bay Namibia\n\nWith the advent of cheap and small GPS units and the website www.gps-speedsurfing.com, Speedsurfers have been able to organise impromptu competitions amongst themselves as well as more formal competitions such as the European Speed Meetings and Speedweeks/fortnights in Australia. With over 5000 sailors registered it is possible for windsurfers all over the world to compare speeds.\nFreestyle is a timed event which is judged. The competitor who has the greatest repertoire, or manages to complete most stunts, wins. Freestyle is about show and competitors are judged on their creativity. Both the difficulty and the number of tricks make up the final score. Sailors who perform tricks on both tacks (port and starboard), and perform the tricks fully planing score higher marks. High scoring moves include Shaka, Burner (funnel ponch), Double Forward Loops, the Funnell (invented by freestyle champion Ricardo Campello in memory of Andy Funnell), the Chachoo and the Clew First Puneta (switch stance Spock), Eslider, and Flaka. The latest freestyle windsurfing has been well documented in the film \"Four Dimensions\".\n\nFor novice windsurfers, low-wind freestyle tricks are an appropriate start, such as sailing backwards with the fin out of the water, or transitioning from a sailing stance to sitting on the board while continuing to sail.\n\nBearing some similarities to freestyle, wave sailing has been part of the sport for much longer. Indeed, modern freestyle started off, in essence, as wave sailing without waves. Wave sailing took off during the rapid development of windsurfing on the Hawaiian islands of Oahu and Maui. It can be seen as comprising two distinct (but related) parts, wave riding and wave jumping.\n\nWave jumping, as with freestyle, involves stunts of varying levels of difficulty which are performed after the rider has jumped from the peak of an unbroken wave (having sailed towards the wave, thus using it as a ramp). These are commonly referred to as aerial moves and include both forward rotation (forward loop, cheese roll) and backward rotations(back-loop, push-loop). The rider and his equipment rotate, doing single & double rotations and jumps where the sailor contorts his or her body and equipment (table top and Crazy Pete, Marwin, etc.).\n\nRecent innovations have included combining moves whilst airborne (i.e. the pushy-forward – a push loop followed by a forward loop) and one professional sailor, Ricardo Campello, has made attempts at a triple (three complete rotations) forward loop during a 2008 PWA competition.\n\nWave riding, by contrast, is much closer to surfing in style, and involves the rider performing a series of top turns and cutbacks whilst riding an unbroken wave back to the shore. Unlike surfing, the rider does not utilise any sections of the wave that have started to barrel – although top wave sailors are able to incorporate aerial moves into their wave riding and will use overhanging lips to launch themselves out in front of the wave as part of this.\n\nThese days most top wave sailors spend very little time competing as the type of conditions required (massive swells producing clean, well-spaced waves and strong winds blowing cross-offshore) are very hard to guarantee months in advance (when planning an event). Thus, aside from a few annual events held in locations with consistent wave-sailing conditions like Maui (Aloha Classic) and Cape Verde (which boasts an impressive track record in recent years). World-class wave sailing can also be seen in non-competitive freeriding sessions around the world.\n\nCompetition wave sailors thus have to be very adept at performing in sub-optimal conditions (often small, messy waves and onshore winds). A typical wave contest will score two jumps going out and two wave rides coming in. A good heat would consist of a clean forward rotating jump, a backward rotating jump, a long slashy wave ride and a trick on the face of the waves such as a goiter or wave 360.\n\nThe lack of a guarantee of top class action is often cited as a reason why wave sailing events fail to attract the same level of TV coverage (and accompanying corporate activity) as other extreme sports despite the stunning visual spectacle and obvious aspirational appeal to key demographics. Many windsurfers around the world are OK without this spotlight as it allows them to be a part of something free of the corporate pressures.\n\n\nWindsurfing is suitable for children as young as 5, with several board and sail brands producing \"Kids Rigs\" to accommodate these short and light weight windsurfers. In some countries, organisations exist to provide entry into the sport in a semi-formal or club-style environment (i.e. The RYA's Team 15 scheme). If children want to get more involved in racing, they can go to trials for the RYA 'zone squad'.\n\nIndeed, several teenagers have enjoyed success at a professional level in both wave and freestyle disciplines. Marcilio \"Brawzinho\" Browne\nand Jose \"Gollito\" Estredo\nare two windsurfers which both won PWA Champions before reaching the age of 18. Whereas most recently, Philip Köster has become one of the dominant sailors at the annual PWA Pozo \"wave\" event. He is widely regarded as one of the sport's leading exponents of the double forward loop.\n\nIn Maui, there is a growing band of young wave sailors, led by Kai Lenny, a multi-sport waterman, and Gustav Häggström (Sweden), who are beginning to gain access to the most extreme wave sailing spots, including the legendary Jaws break on the island's North Shore.\n\nSome more established riders, including Nik Baker and Levi Siver believe \"this new generation is set to push windsurfing to levels never before seen.\"\n\nRobert (Robby) Naish took up the fledgling sport of windsurfing at the age of 11, and in 1976 won his first overall World Championship title at the age of 13.\n\nSimilar sports:\n\n",
                "History of surfing\n\nThe riding of waves has likely existed since humans began swimming in the ocean. In this sense, bodysurfing is the oldest type of wave-catching. Standing up on what is now called a surfboard is a relatively recent innovation developed by the Polynesians.The influences for modern surfing can be directly traced to the surfers of pre-contact Hawaii.\n\nThe art of surfing, known as \"heʻe ʻana\" (\"heʻe\" means \"to surf\", and \"ʻana\" is the nominilizing particle) in the Hawaiian language, was first discovered by Joseph Banks on the HMS Endeavour during the first voyage of James Cook, during the ship's stay in Tahiti. Surfing was a central part of ancient Polynesian culture and predates European contact. The chief (Ali'i) was traditionally the most skilled wave rider in the community with the best board made from the best wood. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could gain prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their boards.\n\nIn Tahiti and Samoa surfing was a popular past time that was often used as part of warriors training. Warriors often paddled to surf breaks and were recorded by early European historians in print as spending many hours bravely paddling head on into large surf and riding waves. Canoes often accompanied\nsurfing parties and the men would often swap between canoeing, paddling boards and catch fish after their recreational activities. In Hawai'i Surfing became more of a spiritual pastime and became ingrained into the very fabric of Hawaii'an religion and culture.\n\nThe sport was also recorded in print by other European residents and visitors who wrote about and photographed Samoans surfing on planks and single canoe hulls; Samoans referred to surf riding as \"fa'ase'e\" or \"se'egalu.\" Edward Treager also confirmed Samoan terminology for surfing and surfboards in Samoa. Oral tradition confirms that surfing was also practiced in Tonga, where the late king Taufa'ahau Tupou IV was the foremost Tongan surfer of his time.\n\nThe practice of riding a vessel with a wave was practiced since the Pre-Incan civilization (Mochica/Moche culture) around 2000 years ago and continued in the Chimu culture. The vessels the Mochica people used were called\n\"Caballitos de Totora\", ('Straw SeaHorses'). Although the Mochica used the Caballitos de Totora for fishing purposes, it is also possible that they were used for fun, as their archaeology suggests. It is also likely that the Mochica people did in fact 'surf for fun' given that the longest rideable wave of world 'Chicama' was within their empire. Chicama is located in Puerto Malabrigo, La Libertad, close to the city of Trujillo, Peru. To this day Caballitos de Totora are still used by local fishermen and can be also be ridden by tourists for recreational purposes.\n\nIt is questioned whether this is the first observed form of surfing, given that the Mochica/Chimu also used a paddle/stick to displace themselves in the ocean, thus the Caballito de Totora has a closer resemblance to Stand-Up Paddle boarding than surfing.\n\nThe Ancient Hawaiian people did not consider surfing a mere recreational activity, hobby, extreme sport, or career as it is viewed today. Rather, the Hawaiian people integrated surfing into their culture and made surfing more of an art than anything else. They referred to this art as \"hee nalu\" which translates into English as “wave sliding.” The art began before entering the mysterious ocean as the Hawaiians prayed to the gods for protection and strength to undertake the powerful mystifying ocean. If the ocean was tamed, frustrated surfers would call upon the \"kahuna\" (priest), who would aid them in a surfing prayer asking the gods to deliver great surf. Prior to entering the ocean, the priest would also aid the surfers (mainly of the upper class) in undertaking the spiritual ceremony of constructing a surfboard.\n\nHawaiians would carefully select one of three types of trees. The trees included the \"koa\" (\"Acacia koa\"), \"ulu\" (\"Artocarpus altilis\"), and \"wiliwili\" (\"Erythrina sandwicensis\") trees. Once selected, the surfer would dig the tree out and place fish in the hole as an offering to the gods. Selected craftsmen of the community were then hired to shape, stain, and prepare the board for the surfer. There were three primary shapes: the \"olo\", \"kikoo\", and the \"alaia\". The \"olo\" is thick in the middle and gradually gets thinner towards the edges. The \"kikoo\" ranges in length from and requires great skill to maneuver. The \"alaia\" board is around long and requires great skill to ride and master. Aside from the preparatory stages prior to entering the water, the most skilled surfers were and pastors,[please clarify] including chiefs and warriors that surfed amongst the best waves on the island. These upper class Hawaiians gained respect through their enduring ability to master the waves and this art the Hawaiians referred to as surfing.\nSome ancient sites still popular today include Kahaluu Bay and Holualoa Bay.\n\nIn July 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes took a break from their boarding school, St. Mathew’s Hall in San Mateo, and came to cool off in Santa Cruz, California. There, David Kawananakoa, Edward Keliʻiahonui and Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana'ole surfed the mouth of the San Lorenzo River on custom-shaped redwood boards, according to surf historians Kim Stoner and Geoff Dunn.\nIn 1907 George Freeth was brought to California from Hawaii, to demonstrate surfboard riding as a publicity stunt to promote the opening of the Los Angeles-Redondo-Huntington railroad owned by Henry Huntington, who gave his name to Huntington Beach. Freeth surfed at the Huntington Beach pier and travelled up and down the coast demonstrating surfing and life guard skills.\n\nSurfing on the East Coast of the United States began in Wrightsville Beach, North Carolina in 1909 when Burke Haywood Bridgers and a colony of surfers introduced surfing to the East Coast. The State of North Carolina honored Burke Haywood Bridgers and the colony of surfers by placing a North Carolina Highway Marker for PIONEER EAST COAST SURFING on Wrightsville Beach and designated Wrightsville Beach as the birthplace of surfing in North Carolina in 2015. North Carolina has the greater weight of published verifiable accurate evidence and impacts a broader geographical area when compared to other east coast states. Burke Haywood Bridgers and the colony of surfers activities are among the earliest appearances of surfboards in the Atlantic Ocean. The early twentieth century surfers proved that surfing migrated from Hawaii to California and North Carolina about the same time, then Florida.\nThe Wrightsville Beach Museum Waterman Hall of Fame honors, recognizes, and inducts community members for their contributions to the island’s watersport culture.\n\nIn 1910, Tommy Walker returned to Manly Beach, Sydney, with a 10-foot surfboard \"bought at Waikiki Beach, Hawaii, for two dollars.\" Walker became an expert rider and in 1912 gave several exhibitions in Sydney.\n\nSurfboard riding received national exposure with the exhibitions by Hawaiian Duke Kahanamoku in the summer of 1914-1915 at several Sydney beaches. As a current Olympic sprint champion, Kahanamoku was invited to tour the Eastern states for an extensive series of swimming carnivals and at his first appearance in the Domain Pool, Sydney, smashed his previous world record for 100 yards by a full second.\nFollowing the first exhibition at Freshwater on 24 December 1914, in the New Year Kahanamoku demonstrated his skill at Freshwater and Manly, followed by appearances at Dee Why and Cronulla.\n\nDuke Kahanamoku's board is now on display in the Freshwater Surf Life Saving Club, Sydney, Australia.\n\nAround the start of the 20th century, Hawaiians living close to Waikiki began to revive surfing, and soon re-established surfing as a sport. The revival is linked to real estate development and efforts to boost tourism. Duke Kahanamoku, \"Ambassador of Aloha,\" Olympic medalist, and avid waterman, helped expose surfing to the world. Kahanamoku's role was later memorialized by a 2002 first class letter rate postage stamp of the United States Postal Service. Author Jack London wrote about the sport after having attempted surfing on his visit to the islands. Surfing progressed tremendously in the 20th century, through innovations in board design and ever increasing public exposure.\n\nSurfing's development and culture was centered primarily in three locations: Hawaii, Australia, and California, although the first footage of surfing in the UK was in 1929 by Louis Rosenberg and a number of friends after being fascinated by watching some Australian surfers. In 1959 the release of the film Gidget, based on the life of surfer Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman, boosted the sport's popularity immensely, moving surfing from an underground culture into a national fad and packing many surf breaks with sudden and previously unheard of crowds. B-movies and surf music such as the Beach Boys and Surfaris based on surfing and Southern California beach culture (Beach Party films) as it exploded, formed most of the world's first ideas of surfing and surfers. This conception was revised again in the 1980s, with newer mainstream portrayals of surfers represented by characters like Jeff Spicoli from \"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\".\nThe anonymous sleeve notes on the 1962 album \"Surfin' Safari\", the first album to be released on the Capitol label by The Beach Boys, include a rather tongue-in-cheek description of the sport of surfing thus:\"For those not familiar with the latest craze to invade the sun-drenched Pacific coast of Southern California, here is a definition of \"surfing\" - a water sport in which the participant stands on a floating slab of wood, resembling an ironing board in both size and shape, and attempts to remain perpendicular while being hurtled toward the shore at a rather frightening rate of speed on the crest of a huge wave (especially recommended for teen-agers and all others without the slightest regard for either life or limb).\"\n\nRegardless of its usually erroneous portrayal in the media, true surfing culture continued to evolve quietly by itself, changing decade by decade. From the 1960s fad years to the creation and evolution of the short board in the late 60s and early 70s to the performance hotdogging of the neon-drenched 1980s and the epic professional surfing of the 1990s (typified by Kelly Slater, the \"Michael Jordan of Surfing\"). In 1975, professional contests started. That year Margo Oberg became the first female professional surfer.\n\nSurfing documentaries have been one of the main ways in which surfing culture grows and replenishes itself, not just as a sport but as an art form, the style and quality of surf films have often tracked well the evolution of the sport.\n\n\n"

                "Tattoo\n\nA tattoo is a form of body modification where a design is made by inserting ink, dyes and pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment. Tattoos fall into three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning); symbolic (with a specific meaning pertinent to the wearer); pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item). Tattoos have historically been regarded in the West as 'uncivilised', and over the last 100 years the fashion has been associated mainly with sailors, working men and criminals. By the end of the 20th Century many Western stigmas of the tattoo culture had been dismissed and the practice has become more acceptable and accessible for people of all trades and levels of society.\n\nThe word \"tattoo\", or \"tattow\" in the 18th century, is a loanword from the Polynesian word \"tatau\", meaning \"to write\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" gives the etymology of tattoo as \"In 18th c. tattaow, tattow. From Polynesian (Samoan, Tahitian, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as painting, scarring, or staining.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat or performance — see \"military tattoo\". In this case, the English word \"tattoo\" is derived from the Dutch word \"taptoe\".\n\nThe first written reference to the word \"tattoo\" (or \"tatau\") appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard explorer Captain Cook's ship the \"HMS Endeavour\": \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humour or disposition\".\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by Cook, when he returned in 1769 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\".\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\nMainstream art galleries hold exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs such as \"Beyond Skin\", at the Museum of Croydon. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word \"irezumi\" means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using \"tebori\", the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is \"horimono\". Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing.\n\nAnthropologist Ling Roth in 1900 described four methods of skin marking and suggested they be differentiated under the names \"tatu\", \"moko\", \"cicatrix\", and \"keloid\".\n\nThe American Academy of Dermatology distinguishes five types of tattoos: traumatic tattoos, also called \"natural tattoos\", that result from injuries, especially asphalt from road injuries or pencil lead; amateur tattoos; professional tattoos, both via traditional methods and modern tattoo machines; cosmetic tattoos, also known as \"permanent makeup\"; and medical tattoos.\n\nAccording to George Orwell, coal miners could develop characteristic tattoos owing to coal dust getting into wounds. This can also occur with substances like gunpowder. Similarly, a traumatic tattoo occurs when a substance such as asphalt is rubbed into a wound as the result of some kind of accident or trauma. These are particularly difficult to remove as they tend to be spread across several layers of skin, and scarring or permanent discoloration is almost unavoidable depending on the location. An amalgam tattoo is when amalgam particles are implanted in to the soft tissues of the mouth, usually the gums, during dental filling placement or removal; another example of such accidental tattoos is the result of a deliberate or accidental stabbing with a pencil or pen, leaving graphite or ink beneath the skin.\n\nMany tattoos serve as rites of passage, marks of status and rank, symbols of religious and spiritual devotion, decorations for bravery, sexual lures and marks of fertility, pledges of love, amulets and talismans, protection, and as punishment, like the marks of outcasts, slaves and convicts. The symbolism and impact of tattoos varies in different places and cultures. Tattoos may show how a person feels about a relative (commonly mother/father or daughter/son) or about an unrelated person. Today, people choose to be tattooed for artistic, cosmetic, sentimental/memorial, religious, and magical reasons, and to symbolize their belonging to or identification with particular groups, including criminal gangs (see criminal tattoos) or a particular ethnic group or law-abiding subculture. Some Māori still choose to wear intricate moko on their faces. In Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, the yantra tattoo is used for protection against evil and to increase luck. Text-based tattoos including quotes, lyrics, personal mottos or scripture are popular in western culture. As an example some Christians might have a Psalm or verse from the Bible tattooed on their body. Popular verses include John 3:16, Philippians 4:13, and Psalms 23.\n\nExtensive decorative tattooing is common among members of traditional freak shows and by performance artists who follow in their tradition.\n\nPeople have also been forcibly tattooed.\n\nA well-known example is the Nazi practice of forcibly tattooing Nazi concentration camp inmates with identification numbers during The Holocaust as part of the Nazis' identification system, beginning in fall 1941. The Nazis' SS introduced the practice at Auschwitz concentration camp in order to identify the bodies of registered prisoners in the concentration camps. During registration, the Nazis would pierce the outlines of the serial-number digits onto the prisoners' arms. Of the Nazi concentration camps, only Auschwitz put tattoos on inmates. The tattoo was the prisoner's camp number, sometimes with a special symbol added: some Jews had a triangle, and Romani had the letter \"Z\" (from German \"Zigeuner\" for \"Gypsy\"). In May 1944, the Jewish men received the letters \"A\" or \"B\" to indicate particular series of numbers. For unknown reasons, this number series for women never began again with the \"B\" series after they had reached the number limit of 20,000 for the \"A\" series. The practice continued until the last days of Auschwitz.\n\nTattoos have also been used for identification in other ways. As early as the Zhou, Chinese authorities would employ facial tattoos as a punishment for certain crimes or to mark prisoners or slaves. During the Roman Empire, Roman soldiers were required by law to have identifying tattoos on their hands in order to make desertion difficult. Gladiators and slaves were likewise tattooed: exported slaves were tattooed with the words \"tax paid\", and it was a common practice to tattoo \"Stop me, I'm a runaway\" on their foreheads. Owing to the Biblical strictures against the practice, Emperor Constantine I banned tattooing the face around AD 330, and the Second Council of Nicaea banned all body markings as a pagan practice in AD 787.\n\nIn the period of early contact between the Māori and Europeans, the Maori people hunted and decapitated each other for their moko tattoos, which they traded for European items including axes and firearms. Moko tattoos were facial designs worn to indicate lineage, social position, and status within the tribe. The tattoo art was a sacred marker of identity among the Maori and also referred to as a vehicle for storing one's tapu, or spiritual being, in the afterlife.\nTattoos are sometimes used by forensic pathologists to help them identify burned, putrefied, or mutilated bodies. As tattoo pigment lies encapsulated deep in the skin, tattoos are not easily destroyed even when the skin is burned.\n\nTattoos are also placed on animals, though rarely for decorative reasons. Pets, show animals, thoroughbred horses, and livestock are sometimes tattooed with identification and other marks. Tattooing with a 'slap mark' on the shoulder or on the ear is the standard identification method in commercial pig farming. Branding is used for similar reasons and is often performed without anesthesia, but is different from tattooing as no ink or dye is inserted during the process, the mark instead being caused by permanent scarring of the skin. Pet dogs and cats are sometimes tattooed with a serial number (usually in the ear, or on the inner thigh) via which their owners can be identified. However, the use of a microchip has become an increasingly popular choice and since 2016 is a legal requirement for all 8.5 million pet dogs in the UK.\n\nThe cosmetic surgery industry continues to see a trend of increased popularity for both surgical and noninvasive procedures. When used as a form of cosmetics, tattooing includes permanent makeup and hiding or neutralizing skin discolorations. Permanent makeup is the use of tattoos to enhance eyebrows, lips (liner and/or lipstick), eyes (liner), and even moles, usually with natural colors, as the designs are intended to resemble makeup.\n\nA growing trend in the US and UK is to place artistic titoos over the surgical scars of a mastectomy. \"More women are choosing not to reconstruct after a mastectomy and tattoo over the scar tissue instead... The mastectomy tattoo will become just another option for post cancer patients and a truly personal way of regaining control over post cancer bodies and proving once and for all that breast cancer is not just a pink ribbon.\" The tattooing of nipples on reconstructed breasts remains in high demand, however.\n\nFunctional tattoos are used primarily for a purpose other than aesthetics. One such use is to tattoo Alzheimer patients with their name, so they may be easily identified if they go missing.\n\nMedical tattoos are used to ensure instruments are properly located for repeated application of radiotherapy and for the areola in some forms of breast reconstruction. Tattooing has also been used to convey medical information about the wearer (e.g., blood group, medical condition, etc.). Additionally, tattoos are used in skin tones to cover vitiligo, a skin pigmentation disorder.\n\nSS blood group tattoos (German: Blutgruppentätowierung) were worn by members of the Waffen-SS in Nazi Germany during World War II to identify the individual's blood type. After the war, the tattoo was taken to be prima facie, if not perfect, evidence of being part of the Waffen-SS, leading to potential arrest and prosecution. This led a number of Ex-Waffen-SS to shoot themselves through the arm with a gun, removing the tattoo and leaving scars like the ones resulting from pox inoculation, making the removal less obvious.\n\nTattoos were probably also used in ancient medicine as part of the treatment of the patient. In 1898, Daniel Fouquet, a medical doctor, wrote an article on “medical tattooing” practices in Ancient Egypt, in which he describes the tattooed markings on the female mummies found at the Deir el-Bahari site. He speculated that the tattoos and other scarifications observed on the bodies may have served a medicinal or therapeutic purpose: \"The examination of these scars, some white, others blue, leaves in no doubt that they are not, in essence, ornament, but an established treatment for a condition of the pelvis, very probably chronic pelvic peritonitis.\"\n\nPreserved tattoos on ancient mummified human remains reveal that tattooing has been practiced throughout the world for many centuries. The Ainu, an indigenous people of Japan, traditionally had facial tattoos, as did the Austroasians. Today, one can find Atayal, Seediq, Truku, and Saisiyat of Taiwan, Berbers of Tamazgha (North Africa), Yoruba, Fulani and Hausa people of Nigeria, and Māori of New Zealand with facial tattoos. Tattooing was popular among certain ethnic groups in southern China, Polynesia, Africa, Borneo, Cambodia, Europe, Japan, the Mentawai Islands, MesoAmerica, New Zealand, North America and South America, the Philippines, Iron Age Britain, and Taiwan. In 2015, scientific re-assessment of the age of the two oldest known tattooed mummies, identified Ötzi as the oldest currently known example. This body, with 61 tattoos, was found embedded in glacial ice in the Alps, and was dated to 3,250 BC.\nIt is a myth that the modern revival of tattooing stems from Captain James Cook's three voyages to the South Pacific in the late 18th century. Certainly, Cook's voyages and the dissemination of the texts and images from them brought more awareness about tattooing (and, as noted above, imported the word \"tattow\" into Western languages), but Europeans have been tattooed throughout history. On Cook's first voyage in 1768, his science officer and expedition botanist, Sir Joseph Banks, as well as artist Sydney Parkinson and many others of the crew, returned to England with tattoos, although many of these men would have had pre-existing tattoos. Banks was a highly regarded member of the English aristocracy that had acquired his position with Cook by co-financing the expedition with ten thousand pounds, a very large sum at the time. In turn, Cook brought back with him a tattooed Raiatean man, Omai, whom he presented to King George and the English Court. On subsequent voyages other crew members, from officers, such as American John Ledyard, to ordinary seamen, were tattooed. \n\nThe first documented professional tattooist in Britain was established in the port of Liverpool in the 1870s. In Britain tattooing was still largely associated with sailors and the lower or even criminal class, but by the 1870s had become fashionable among some members of the upper classes, including royalty, and in its upmarket form it could be an expensive and sometimes painful process. A marked class division on the acceptability of the practice continued for some time in Britain. Recently a trend has arisen marketed as 'Stick and Poke' tattooing; primitive figures are permanently inscribed by the user himself after he obtains a 'DIY' kit containing needles, ink and a collection of suggestions.\n\nAs most tattoos in the U.S. were done by Polynesian and Japanese amateurs, tattoo artists were in great demand in port cities all over the world, especially by European and American sailors. The first recorded professional tattoo artist in the United States was a German immigrant, Martin Hildebrandt. He opened a shop in New York City in 1846 and quickly became popular during the American Civil War among soldiers and sailors of both Union and Confederate militaries.\n\nHildebrandt began traveling from camp to camp to tattoo soldiers, making his popularity increase, and also giving birth to the tradition of getting tattoos while being an American serviceman. Soon after the Civil War, tattoos became fashionable among upper-class young adults. This trend lasted until the beginning of World War I. The invention of the electric tattoo machine caused popularity of tattoos among the wealthy to drop off. The machine made the tattooing procedure both much easier and cheaper, thus, eliminating the status symbol tattoos previously held, as they were now affordable for all socioeconomic classes. The status symbol of a tattoo shifted from a representation of wealth, to a mark typically seen on rebels and criminals. Despite this change, tattoos remained popular among military servicemen, and the tradition continues today.\n\nMany studies have been done of the tattooed population and society's view of tattoos. In June 2006, the \"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology\" published the results of a telephone survey of 2004. It found that 36% of Americans ages 18–29, 24% of those 30–40, and 15% of those 41–51 had a tattoo. In September 2006, the Pew Research Center conducted a telephone survey that found that 36% of Americans ages 18–25, 40% of those 26–40 and 10% of those 41–64 had a tattoo. They concluded that Generation X and Generation Y are not afraid to express themselves through their appearance, and tattoos are the most popular form of self-expression. In January 2008, a survey conducted online by Harris Interactive estimated that 14% of all adults in the United States have a tattoo, slightly down from 2003, when 16% had a tattoo. Among age groups, 9% of those ages 18–24, 32% of those 25–29, 25% of those 30–39 and 12% of those 40–49 have tattoos, as do 8% of those 50–64. Men are slightly more likely to have a tattoo than women.\n\nRichmond, Virginia, has been cited as one of the most tattooed cities in the United States. That distinction led the Valentine Richmond History Center to create an online exhibit titled \"History, Ink: The Tattoo Archive Project.\" The introduction to the exhibit notes, \"In the past, western culture associated tattoos with those individuals who lived on the edge of society; however, today they are recognized as a legitimate art form and widely accepted in mainstream culture.\"\n\nSince the 1970s, tattoos have become a mainstream part of Western fashion, common among all genders, to all economic classes, and to age groups from the later teen years to middle age. For many young Americans, the tattoo has taken on a decidedly different meaning than for previous generations. The tattoo has \"undergone dramatic redefinition\" and has shifted from a form of deviance to an acceptable form of expression.\n\nProtection papers were used by American sailors to prevent themselves from being taken off American ships and impressed into the Royal Navy. These were simple documents that described the sailor as being an American sailor. Many of the protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the Royal Navy paid no attention to them. \"In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'\" One way of making them more specific was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal, and thus use that description to identify the seaman. As a result, many of the later certificates carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as other specific information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen. \"Frequently their 'protection papers' made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos.\"\n\n\"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tattoos were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the protection papers issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-passports catalogued tattoos alongside birthmarks, scars, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as pigments, even gunpowder and urine. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols.\"\n\nBecause these protection papers were used to define freemen and citizenship, many black sailors and other men also used them to show that they were freemen if they were stopped by officials or slave catchers. They also called them \"free papers\" because they certified their non-slave status. Many of the freed blacks used descriptions of tattoos for identification purposes on their freedom papers.\n\nTattooing involves the placement of pigment into the skin's dermis, the layer of dermal tissue underlying the epidermis. After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a homogenized damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the immune system's phagocytes to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin granulation tissue forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by collagen growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within fibroblasts, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, but in the long term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.\nSome tribal cultures traditionally created tattoos by cutting designs into the skin and rubbing the resulting wound with ink, ashes or other agents; some cultures continue this practice, which may be an adjunct to scarification. Some cultures create tattooed marks by hand-tapping the ink into the skin using sharpened sticks or animal bones (made like needles) with clay formed disks or, in modern times, needles.\n\nThe most common method of tattooing in modern times is the electric tattoo machine, which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle or a group of needles that are soldered onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit. The unit rapidly and repeatedly drives the needles in and out of the skin, usually 80 to 150 times a second. The needles are single-use needles that come packaged individually.\n\nTattooing is regulated in many countries because of the associated health risks to client and practitioner, specifically local infections and virus transmission. Disposable plastic aprons and eye protection can be worn depending on the risk of blood or other secretions splashing into the eyes or clothing of the tattoist. Hand hygiene, assessment of risks and appropriate disposal of all sharp objects and materials contaminated with blood are crucial areas. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. All equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use. It is good practice to provide clients with a printed consent form that outlines risks and complications as well as instructions for after care.\n\nThe Government of Meiji Japan had outlawed tattoos in the 19th century, a prohibition that stood for 70 years before being repealed in 1948. As of 6 June 2012 all new tattoos are forbidden for employees of the city of Osaka. Existing tattoos are required to be covered with proper clothing. The regulations were added to Osaka's ethical codes, and employees with tattoos were encouraged to have them removed. This was done because of the strong connection of tattoos with the yakuza, or Japanese organized crime, after an Osaka official in February 2012 threatened a schoolchild by showing his tattoo.\n\nTattoos had negative connotations in historical China, where criminals often had been marked by tattooing. The association of tattoos with criminals was transmitted from China to influence Japan. Today, tattoos have remained a taboo in Chinese society.\n\nThe Romans tattooed criminals and slaves, and in the 19th century released US convicts, Australian convicts, and British army deserters were identified by tattoos. Prisoners in Nazi concentration camps were tattooed with an identification number. Today, many prison inmates still tattoo themselves as an indication of time spent in prison.\n\nNative Americans also used tattoos to represent their tribe. Catholic Croats of Bosnia used religious Christian tattooing, especially of children and women, for protection against conversion to Islam during the Ottoman rule in the Balkans.\n\nTattoos are strongly empirically associated with deviance, personality disorders, and criminality. Although the general acceptance of tattoos is on the rise in Western society, they still carry a heavy stigma among certain social groups. Tattoos are generally considered an important part of the culture of the Russian mafia.\n\nCurrent cultural understandings of tattoos in Europe and North America have been greatly influenced by long-standing stereotypes based on deviant social groups in the 19th and 20th centuries. Particularly in North America tattoos have been associated with stereotypes, folklore, and racism. Not until the 1960s and 1970s did people associate tattoos with such societal outcasts as bikers and prisoners. Today, in the United States many prisoners and criminal gangs use distinctive tattoos to indicate facts about their criminal behavior, prison sentences, and organizational affiliation. A teardrop tattoo, for example, can be symbolic of murder, or each tear represents the death of a friend. At the same time, members of the U.S. military have an equally well-established and longstanding history of tattooing to indicate military units, battles, kills, etc., an association that remains widespread among older Americans. In Japan tattoos are associated with yakuza criminal groups but there are non-yakuza groups such as Fukushi Masaichi's tattoo association that sought to preserve the skins of dead Japanese who have extensive tattoos. Tattooing is also common in the British Armed Forces. Depending on vocation tattoos are accepted in a number of professions in America. Companies across many fields are increasingly focused on diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn Britain, there is evidence of women with tattoos, concealed by their clothing, throughout the 20th century, and records of women tattoists such as Jessie Knight from the 1920s. A study of \"at-risk\" (as defined by school absenteeism and truancy) adolescent girls showed a positive correlation between body modification and negative feelings towards the body and low self-esteem; however, the study also demonstrated that a strong motive for body modification is the search for \"self and attempts to attain mastery and control over the body in an age of increasing alienation\". The prevalence of women in the tattoo industry in the 21st century, along with larger numbers of women bearing tattoos, appears to be changing negative perceptions.\n\nFormer sailor Rowland Hussey Macy, who formed Macy's department stores, used a red star tattoo that he had on his hand for the store's logo.\n\nTattoos have also been used in marketing and advertising with companies paying people to have logos of brands like HBO, Red Bull, ASOS.com, and Sailor Jerry's rum tattooed in their bodies. This practice is known as \"skinvertising\".\n\nB.T.'s Smokehouse, a barbecue restaurant located in Massachusetts, offered customers free meals for life if they had the logo of the establishment tattooed on a visible part of their bodies. Nine people took the business up on the offer.\n\nBecause it requires breaking the skin barrier, tattooing carries health risks including infection and allergic reactions. Tattooing can be uncomfortable to excruciating depending on the area and can result in the person fainting. Modern tattooists reduce risks by following universal precautions working with single-use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. Many jurisdictions require that tattooists have blood-borne pathogen training such as that provided through the Red Cross and OSHA. As of 2009 (in the United States) there have been no reported cases of HIV contracted from tattoos.\n\nIn amateur tattooing, such as that practiced in prisons, however, there is an elevated risk of infection. Infections that can theoretically be transmitted by the use of unsterilized tattoo equipment or contaminated ink include surface infections of the skin, fungal infections, some forms of hepatitis, herpes simplex virus, HIV, staph, tetanus, and tuberculosis.\n\nTattoo inks have been described as \"remarkably nonreactive histologically\". However, cases of allergic reactions to tattoo inks, particularly certain colors, have been medically documented. This is sometimes due to the presence of nickel in an ink pigment, which triggers a common metal allergy. Occasionally, when a blood vessel is punctured during the tattooing procedure, a bruise/hematoma may appear.\n\nCertain colours - red or similar colours such as purple, pink, and orange - tend to cause more problems and damage compared to other colours. Red ink has even caused skin and flesh damages so severe that the amputation of a leg or an arm has been necessary. If part of a tattoo (especially if red) begins to cause even minor troubles, like becoming itchy or worse, lumpy, then Danish experts strongly suggest to remove the red parts.\n\nIn 2017, researchers from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in France say the chemicals in tattoo ink can travel in the bloodstream and accumulate in the lymph nodes, obstructing their ability to fight infections. However, the authors noted in their paper that most tattooed individuals including the donors analyzed do not suffer from chronic inflammation.\n\nWhile tattoos are considered permanent, it is sometimes possible to remove them, fully or partially, with laser treatments. Typically, black and some colored inks can be removed more completely than inks of other colors. The expense and pain associated with removing tattoos are typically greater than the expense and pain associated with applying them. Pre-laser tattoo removal methods include dermabrasion, salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with salt), cryosurgery, and excision—which is sometimes still used along with skin grafts for larger tattoos. These older methods, however, have been nearly completely replaced by laser removal treatment options.\n\nA temporary tattoo is a non-permanent image on the skin resembling a permanent tattoo. Temporary tattoos can be drawn, painted, airbrushed or needled as a permanent tattoo with an ink which can be dissolved in blood within 6 months of art as a form of body painting.\n\nDecal (press-on) temporary tattoos are used to decorate any part of the body. They may last for a day or for more than a week.\n\nFoil temporary tattoos are a variation of decal-style temporary tattoos, printed using a foil stamping technique instead of using ink. The foil design is printed as a mirror image in order to be viewed in the right direction once it is applied to the skin. Each metallic tattoo is protected by a transparent protective film.\n\nAlthough they have become more popular and usually require a greater investment, airbrush temporary tattoos are less likely to achieve the look of a permanent tattoo, and may not last as long as press-on temporary tattoos. An artist sprays on airbrush tattoos using a stencil with alcohol-based, FDA-approved cosmetic inks. Like decal tattoos, airbrush temporary tattoos also are easily removed with rubbing alcohol or baby oil.\n\nAnother tattoo alternative is henna-based tattoos, which generally contain no additives. Henna is a plant-derived substance which is painted on the skin, staining it a reddish-orange-to-brown color. Because of the semi-permanent nature of henna, they lack the realistic colors typical of decal temporary tattoos. Due to the time-consuming application process, it is a relatively poor option for children. If you do choose henna temporary tattoos, ensure that they are pure henna. Dermatological publications report that allergic reactions to natural henna are very rare and the product is generally considered safe for skin application. Serious problems can occur, however, from the use of henna with certain additives. The FDA and medical journals report that painted black henna temporary tattoos are especially dangerous. Black Henna or Pre-Mixed Henna Temporary Tattoos May Be Harmful - see below for safety information.\n\nDecal temporary tattoos, when legally sold in the United States, have had their color additives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as cosmetics --- the FDA has determined these colorants are safe for “direct dermal contact.” While the FDA has received some accounts of minor skin irritation, including redness and swelling, from this type of temporary tattoo, the agency has found these symptoms to be “child specific” and not significant enough to support warnings to the public. Unapproved pigments, however, which are sometimes used by non-US manufacturers, can provoke allergic reactions in anyone. Understanding the types of temporary tattoos available to consumers, knowing where they are manufactured, and ensuring they come from a reliable source are keys to determining whether temporary tattoos are safe.\n\nThe types of airbrush paints manufactured for crafting, creating art or decorating clothing should never be used for tattooing. These paints are not approved for direct contact with skin, and can be allergenic or toxic. Always ask the airbrush tattoo artist what kind of ink he or she is using and whether it meets FDA approval.\n\nThe FDA regularly issues warnings to consumers about avoiding any temporary tattoos labeled as black henna or pre-mixed henna as these may contain potentially harmful ingredients including silver nitrate, carmine, pyrogallol, disperse orange dye and chromium. Black henna gets its color from paraphenylenediamine (PPD), a textile dye approved by the FDA for human use only in hair coloring. In Canada, the use of PPD on the skin, including hair dye, is banned. Research has linked these and other ingredients to a range of health problems including allergic reactions, chronic inflammatory reactions, and late-onset allergic reactions to related clothing and hairdressing dyes. They can cause these reactions long after application. Neither black henna nor pre-mixed henna are approved for cosmetic use by the FDA.\n\nJudaism generally prohibits tattoos among its adherents based on the commandments in Leviticus 19. Jews tend to believe this commandment only applies to Jews and not to gentiles.\nThere is no specific rule in the New Testament prohibiting tattoos and most Christian denominations believe the laws in Leviticus are outdated as well as believing the commandment only applied to the Israelites, not to the gentiles. While most Christian groups tolerate tattoos, some Evangelical and fundamentalist Protestant denominations do believe the commandment does apply today for Christians and believe it is a sin to get one.\n\nMany Coptic Christians in Egypt take a cross tattoo in their right wrist to differ from the Muslims.\n\nTattoos are considered to be haram in Sunni Islam, based on rulings from scholars and passages in the Hadith. Shia Islam does not entirely prohibit tattooing, although it may be looked down upon in Shia communities.\n\nAnthropological\n\nPopular and artistic\n\nMedical\n\n",
                "History of tattooing\n\nTattooing has been practiced across the globe since at least Neolithic times, as evidenced by mummified preserved skin, ancient art, and the archaeological record. Both ancient art and archaeological finds of possible tattoo tools suggest tattooing was practiced by the Upper Paleolithic period in Europe. However, direct evidence for tattooing on mummified human skin extends only to the 4th millennium BC. The oldest discovery of tattooed human skin to date is found on the body of Ötzi the Iceman, dating to between 3370 and 3100 BC. Other tattooed mummies have been recovered from at least 49 archaeological sites including locations in Greenland, Alaska, Siberia, Mongolia, western China, Egypt, Sudan, the Philippines, and the Andes. These include Amunet, Priestess of the Goddess Hathor from ancient Egypt (c. 2134–1991 BC), multiple mummies from Siberia including the Pazyryk culture of Russia, and from several cultures throughout pre-Columbian South America.\n\nCemeteries throughout the Tarim Basin (Xinjiang of western China) including the sites of Qäwrighul, Yanghai, Shengjindian, Zaghunluq, and Qizilchoqa have revealed several tattooed mummies with Western Asian/Indo-European physical traits and cultural materials. These date from between 2100 and 550 BC.\n\nIn ancient China, tattoos were considered a barbaric practice, and were often referred to in literature depicting bandits and folk heroes. As late as the Qing Dynasty, it was common practice to tattoo characters such as (\"Prisoner\") on convicted criminals' faces. Although relatively rare during most periods of Chinese history, slaves were also sometimes marked to display ownership.\n\nHowever, tattoos seem to have remained a part of southern culture. Marco Polo wrote of Quanzhou, \"Many come hither from Upper India to have their bodies painted with the needle in the way we have elsewhere described, there being many adepts at this craft in the city\". At least three of the main characters Lu Zhishen, Shi Jin (史進), and Yan Ching (燕青) in the classic novel \"Water Margin\" are described as having tattoos covering nearly all of their bodies. Wu Song was sentenced to a facial tattoo describing his crime after killing Xi Menqing (西门庆) to avenge his brother. In addition, Chinese legend claimed the mother of Yue Fei (a famous Song general) tattooed the words \"Repay the Country with Pure Loyalty\" (, \"jing zhong bao guo\") down her son's back before he left to join the army.\n\nGreek written records of tattooing date back to at least the 5th-century BCE. The ancient Greeks and Romans used tattooing to penalize slaves, criminals, and prisoners of war. While known, decorative tattooing was looked down upon and religious tattooing was mainly practiced in Egypt and Syria. According to Robert Graves in his book \"The Greek Myths\", tattooing was common amongst certain religious groups in the ancient Mediterranean world, which may have contributed to the prohibition of tattooing in Leviticus. The Romans of Late Antiquity also tattooed soldiers and arms manufacturers, a practice that continued into the ninth century.\n\nThe Greek verb \"stizein\" (στίζειν), meaning \"to prick,\" was used for tattooing. Its derivative \"stigma\" (στίγμα) was the common term for tattoo marks in both Greek and Latin. During the Byzantine period, the verb \"kentein\" (κεντεῖν) replaced \"stizein\", and a variety of new Latin terms replaced \"stigmata\" including \"signa\" \"signs,\" \"characteres\" \"stamps,\" and \"cicatrices\" \"scars.\"\n\nIn Southern India, permanent tattoos are called \"pachakutharathu\". It was very common in South India, especially Tamil Nadu, before 1980. In northern India, permanent tattoos are called \"godna\". Tattoos have been used as cultural symbols among many tribal populations, as well as the general Hindu population of India.\n\nIn India, tattoos have many names, including \"tarazwa\", \"gondan\", and \"ungkala\".\n\nSeveral Indonesian tribes have in their tattooing culture. One notable example is the Dayak people of Kalimantan in Borneo (Bornean traditional tattooing). Another ethnic group that practices tattooing are the Mentawai people, as well as Moi and Meyakh people in West Papua.\n\nTattooing for spiritual and decorative purposes in Japan is thought to extend back to at least the Jōmon or Paleolithic period and was widespread during various periods for both the Japanese and the native Ainu. Chinese texts from before 300 AD described social differences among Japanese people as being indicated through tattooing and other bodily marking. Chinese texts from the time also described Japanese men of all ages as decorating their faces and bodies with tattoos.\n\nBetween 1603 and 1868, Japanese tattooing was only practiced by the \"ukiyo\" (floating world) subculture. Generally firemen, manual workers and prostitutes wore tattoos to communicate their status. By the early 17th century, criminals were widely being tattooed as a visible mark of punishment. Criminals were marked with symbols typically including crosses, lines, double lines and circles on certain parts of the body, mostly the face and arms. These symbols sometimes designated the places where the crimes were committed. In one area, the character for \"dog\" was tattooed on the criminal's forehead.\n\nThe Government of Meiji Japan, formed in 1868, banned the art of tattooing altogether, viewing it as barbaric and lacking respectability. This subsequently created a subculture of criminals and outcasts. These people had no place in \"decent society\" and were frowned upon. They could not simply integrate into mainstream society because of their obvious visible tattoos, forcing many of them into criminal activities which ultimately formed the roots for the modern Japanese mafia, the Yakuza, with which tattoos have become almost synonymous in Japan.\n\nDespite a lack of direct textual references, tattooed human remains and iconographic evidence indicate that ancient Egyptians practiced tattooing from at least 2000 BCE. It is theorized that tattooing entered Egypt through Nubia, but this claim is complicated by the high mobility between Lower Nubia and Upper Egypt as well as Egypt's annexation of Lower Nubia during the Middle Kingdom. Archeologist Geoffrey J. Tassie argues that it may be more appropriate to classify tattoo in ancient Egypt and Nubia as part of a larger Nile Valley tradition.\n\nThe most famous tattooed mummies from this region are Amunet, a priestess of Hathor, and two Hathoric dancers from Dynasty XI that were found at Deir el-Bahari. In 1898, Daniel Fouquet, a medical doctor from Cairo, wrote an article on medical tattooing practices in ancient Egypt in which he describes the tattoos on these three mummies and speculates that they may have served a medicinal or therapeutic purpose: \"The examination of these scars, some white, others blue, leaves in no doubt that they are not, in essence, ornament, but an established treatment for a condition of the pelvis, very probably chronic pelvic peritonitis.\"\n\nAncient Egyptian tattooing appears to have been practiced on women exclusively; with the possible exception of one extremely worn Dynasty XII stele, there is no artistic or physical evidence that men were tattooed. However, by the Meroitic Period (300 BCE – 400 CE) it was practiced on Nubian men as well.\n\nAccounts of early travelers to ancient Egypt describe the tool used as an uneven number of metal needles attached to a wooden handle.\n\nCoptic tattoos often consist of three lines, three dots and two elements, reflecting the Trinity. The tools used had an odd the number of needles to bring luck and good fortune. Many Copts have the Coptic cross tattooed on the inside of their right arm. This may have been influenced by a similar practice tattooing religious symbols on the wrists and arms during the Ptolemaic Period.\n\nHerodotus' writings suggest that slaves and prisoners of war were tattooed in Persia during the classical era. This practice spread from Persia to Greece and then to Rome.\n\nThe most famous depiction of tattooing in Persian literature goes back 800 years to a tale by Rumi about a man who is proud to want a lion tattoo but changes his mind once he experiences the pain of the needle.\n\nIn the \"hamam\" (the baths), there were \"dallaks\" whose job was to help people wash themselves. This was a notable occupation because apart from helping the customers with washing, they were massage-therapists, dentists, barbers, and tattoo artists.\n\nTattooing has been a part of Filipino life since pre-Hispanic colonization of the Philippine Islands, tattooing in the Philippines to some were a form of rank and accomplishments, and some believed that tattoos had magical qualities. The more famous tattooed indigenous peoples of the Philippines resided in north Luzon, especially among the Bontoc Igorot, Kalinga, and Ifugao peoples. The Visayans of the southern islands were also heavily tattooed.\n\nFilipino tattooing was first documented by the European Spanish explorers as they landed among the Islands in the late 16th century, and called the natives \"Los Pintados\" (The Painted Ones) as they mistook the tattoos for paint. Before European exploration, tattooing was widespread, but conversion to Christianity greatly diminished the practice as heathen or low-class.\n\nAs Lane Wilcken's \"Filipino Tattoos Ancient to Modern\" denotes, there are many similarities between the tattooing traditions of the Philippines and indigenous Polynesian designs--not only with their societal function and similar designs, but in the tools used to hand-tap them on (generally a needle or thorn on a stick, with a hammer to pound it into the skin). While the most common modern term for indigenous tattoos is \"batok,\" an ancient Tagalog word for tattoos was \"tatak,\" extremely similar to the Samoan word \"tatau\".\n\nThe Māori people of New Zealand practised a form of tattooing known as Tā moko, traditionally created with chisels. In the colonial period Tā moko fell out of use, partly because of the European practice of collecting Mokomokai, or tattooed heads.\n\nHowever, from the late 20th century onward, there has been a resurgence of tā moko amongst Maori. There is also a related tattoo art, kirituhi, which has a similar aesthetic to tā moko but is worn by non-Maori.\n\nThe traditional male tattoo in Samoa is called the pe'a. The traditional female tattoo is called the malu. The word \"tattoo\" is believed to have originated from the Samoan word \"tatau.\" \n\nWhen the Samoan Islands were first seen by Europeans in 1722 three Dutch ships commanded by Jacob Roggeveen visited the eastern island known as Manua. A crew member of one of the ships described the natives in these words, \"They are friendly in their speech and courteous in their behavior, with no apparent trace of wildness or savagery. They do not paint themselves, as do the natives of some other islands, but on the lower part of the body they wear artfully woven silk tights or knee breeches. They are altogether the most charming and polite natives we have seen in all of the South Seas...\"\n\nThe ships lay at anchor off the islands for several days, but the crews did not venture ashore and did not even get close enough to the natives to realize that they were not wearing silk leggings, but their legs were completely covered in tattoos.\n\nIn Samoa, the tradition of applying tattoo, or tatau, by hand has been unbroken for over two thousand years. Tools and techniques have changed little. The skill is often passed from father to son, each tattoo artist, or tufuga, learning the craft over many years of serving as his father's apprentice. A young artist-in-training often spent hours, and sometimes days, tapping designs into sand or tree bark using a special tattooing comb, or au. Honoring their tradition, Samoan tattoo artists made this tool from sharpened boar's teeth fastened together with a portion of the turtle shell and to a wooden handle. \n\nTraditional Samoan tattooing of the \"pe'a\", body tattoo, is an ordeal that is not lightly undergone. It takes many weeks to complete. The process is very painful and used to be a necessary prerequisite to receiving a matai title; this however is no longer the case. Tattooing was also a very costly procedure.\n\nIt was not uncommon for half a dozen boys to be tattooed at the same time, requiring the services of four or more artists. It was not just the men who received tattoos, but the women too; their designs are of a much lighter nature rather than having the large areas of solid dye which are frequently seen in men’s tattoos. The tattooing of women was not nearly as ritualized like men’s were.\n\nSamoan society has long been defined by rank and title, with chiefs (ali'i) and their assistants, known as talking chiefs (tulafale). The tattooing ceremonies for young chiefs, typically conducted at the time of puberty, were part of their ascendance to a leadership role. The permanent marks left by the tattoo artists would forever celebrate their endurance and dedication to cultural traditions. The pain was extreme and the risk of death by infection was a concern; to back down from tattooing was to risk being labeled a \"pala'ai\" or coward. Those who could not endure the pain and abandoned their tattooing were left incomplete, would be forced to wear their mark of shame throughout their life. This would forever bring shame upon their family so it was avoided at all cost. \n\nThe Samoan tattooing process used a number of tools which remained almost unchanged since their first use. \"Autapulu\" is a wide tattooing comb used to fill in the large dark areas of the tattoo. \"Ausogi'aso tele\" is a comb used for making thick lines. \"Ausogi'aso laititi\" is a comb used for making thin lines. \"Aumogo\" small comb is used for making small marks. \"Sausau\" is the mallet is used for striking the combs. It is almost two feet in length and made from the central rib of a coconut palm leaf. \"Tuluma\" is the pot used for holding the tattooing combs. Ipulama is the cup used for holding the dye. The dye is made from the soot collected from burnt lama nuts. \"Tu'I\" used to grind up the dye. These tools were primarily made out of animal bones to ensure sharpness.\n\nThe tattooing process itself would be 5 sessions, in theory. These 5 sessions would be spread out over 10 days in order for the inflammation to subside.\n\nChristian missionaries from the west attempted to purge tattooing among the Samoans, thinking it barbaric and inhumane. Many young Samoans resisted mission schools since they forbade them to wear tattoos. But over time attitudes relaxed toward this cultural tradition and tattooing began to reemerge in Samoan culture.\n\nTattooed mummies dating to c. 500 BC were extracted from burial mounds on the Ukok plateau during the 1990s. Their tattooing involved animal designs carried out in a curvilinear style. The Man of Pazyryk, a Scythian chieftain, is tattooed with an extensive and detailed range of fish, monsters and a series of dots that lined up along the spinal column (lumbar region) and around the right ankle.\n\nSome artifacts dating back 3,000 years from the Solomon Islands may have been used for tattooing human skin. Obsidian pieces have been duplicated, then used to conduct tattoos on pig skin, then compared to the original artifacts. \"They conducted these experiments to observe the wear, such as chipping and scratches, and residues on the stones caused by tattooing, and then compared that use-wear with 3,000 year old artifacts. They found that the obsidian pieces, old and new, show similar patterns, suggesting that they hadn't been used for working hides, but were for adorning human skin.\"\n\nIn Taiwan, facial tattoos of the Atayal tribe are called \"ptasan\"; they are used to demonstrate that an adult man can protect his homeland, and that an adult woman is qualified to weave cloth and perform housekeeping.\nTaiwan is believed to be the homeland of all the Austronesian peoples which includes Filipinos, Indonesians, Polynesians and Malagasy peoples, all with strong tattoo traditions. This along with the striking correlation between Austronesian languages and the use of the so-called hand-tapping method suggests that Austronesian peoples inherited their tattooing traditions from their ancestors established in Taiwan or along the southern coast of the Chinese mainland.\n\nThai tattoos also known as Yantra tattooing was common since ancient times. Just as other native southeast Asian cultures, animistic tattooing was common in Tai tribes that were is southern China. Over time this animistic practice of tattooing for luck and protection assimilated Hindu and Buddhist ideas. The Sak Yant traditional tattoo is practiced today by many and are usually given either by a Buddhist monk or a Brahmin priest. The tattoos usually depict Hindu gods and use the Mon script or ancient Khmer script, which were the scripts of the classical civilizations of mainland southeast Asia.\n\nThe earliest possible evidence for tattooing in Europe appears on ancient art from the Upper Paleolithic period as incised designs on the bodies of humanoid figurines. The Löwenmensch figurine from the Aurignacian culture dates to approximately 40,000 years ago and features a series of parallel lines on its left shoulder. The ivory Venus of Hohle Fels, which dates to between 35,000 and 40,000 years ago also exhibits incised lines down both arms, as well as across the torso and chest.\n\nThe oldest and most famous direct proof of ancient European tattooing appears on the body of Ötzi the Iceman, who was found in the Ötz valley in the Alps and dates from the late 4th millennium BC. Studies have revealed that Ötzi had 61 carbon-ink tattoos consisting of 19 groups of lines simple dots and lines on his lower spine, left wrist, behind his right knee, and on his ankles. It has been argued that these tattoos were a form of healing because of their placement, though other explanations are plausible.\n\nPre-Christian Germanic, Celtic and other central and northern European tribes were often heavily tattooed, according to surviving accounts, but it may also have been normal paint. The Picts may have been tattooed (or scarified) with elaborate, war-inspired black or dark blue woad (or possibly copper for the blue tone) designs. Julius Caesar described these tattoos in Book V of his \"Gallic Wars\" (54 BC). Nevertheless, these may have been painted markings rather than tattoos.\n\nAhmad ibn Fadlan wrote of his encounter with the Scandinavian Rus' tribe in the early 10th century, describing them as tattooed from \"fingernails to neck\" with dark blue \"tree patterns\" and other \"figures.\" However, this may also have been paint, since the word used can mean both tattoo and painting. During the gradual process of Christianization in Europe, tattoos were often considered remaining elements of paganism and generally legally prohibited.\n\nThe significance of tattooing was long open to Eurocentric interpretations. In the mid-19th century, Baron Haussmann, while arguing against painting the interior of Parisian churches, said the practice \"reminds me of the tattoos used in place of clothes by barbarous peoples to conceal their nakedness\".\n\nBritish and other pilgrims to the Holy Lands throughout the 17th century were tattooed to commemorate their voyages, including William Lithgow in 1612. \n\nIn 1691 William Dampier brought to London a native of the western part of New Guinea (now part of Indonesia) who had a tattooed body and became known as the \"Painted Prince\".\n\nBetween 1766 and 1779, Captain James Cook made three voyages to the South Pacific, the last trip ending with Cook's death in Hawaii in February 1779. When Cook and his men returned home to Europe from their voyages to Polynesia, they told tales of the 'tattooed savages' they had seen. The word \"tattoo\" itself comes from the Tahitian \"tatau\", and was introduced into the English language by Cook's expedition (though the word 'tattoo' or 'tap-too', referring to a drumbeat, had existed in English since at least 1644)\n\nIt was in Tahiti aboard the Endeavour, in July 1769, that Cook first noted his observations about the indigenous body modification and is the first recorded use of the word tattoo to refer to the permanent marking of the skin. In the Ship's log book recorded this entry: \"Both sexes paint their Bodys, Tattow, as it is called in their Language. This is done by inlaying the Colour of Black under their skins, in such a manner as to be indelible.\" Cook went on to write, \"This method of Tattowing I shall now describe...As this is a painful operation, especially the Tattowing of their Buttocks, it is performed but once in their Lifetimes.\"\n\nCook's Science Officer and Expedition Botanist, Sir Joseph Banks, returned to England with a tattoo. Banks was a highly regarded member of the English aristocracy and had acquired his position with Cook by putting up what was at the time the princely sum of some ten thousand pounds in the expedition. In turn, Cook brought back with him a tattooed Raiatean man, Omai, whom he presented to King George and the English Court. Many of Cook's men, ordinary seamen and sailors, came back with tattoos, a tradition that would soon become associated with men of the sea in the public's mind and the press of the day. In the process sailors and seamen re-introduced the practice of tattooing in Europe and it spread rapidly to seaports around the globe.\n\nBy the 19th century tattooing had spread to British society but was still largely associated with sailors and the lower or even criminal class. Tattooing had however been practised in an amateur way by public schoolboys from at least the 1840s and by the 1870s had become fashionable among some members of the upper classes, including royalty. In its upmarket form it could be a lengthy, expensive and sometimes painful process.\n\nTattooing spread among the upper classes all over Europe in the 19th century, but particularly in Britain where it was estimated in Harmsworth Magazine in 1898 that as many as one in five members of the gentry were tattooed. Taking their lead from the British Court, where George V followed Edward VII's lead in getting tattooed; King Frederick IX of Denmark, the King of Romania, Kaiser Wilhelm II, King Alexander of Yugoslavia and even Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, all sported tattoos, many of them elaborate and ornate renditions of the Royal Coat of Arms or the Royal Family Crest. King Alfonso XIII of modern Spain also had a tattoo.\n\nThe perception that there is a marked class division on the acceptability of the practice has been a popular media theme in Britain, as successive generations of journalists described the practice as newly fashionable and no longer for a marginalised class. Examples of this cliché can be found in every decade since the 1870s. Despite this evidence, a myth persists that the upper and lower classes find tattooing attractive and the broader middle classes rejecting it. In 1969, the House of Lords debated a bill to ban the tattooing of minors, on grounds it had become \"trendy\" with the young in recent years but was associated with crime. It was noted that 40 per cent of young criminals had tattoos and that marking the skin in this way tended to encourage self-identification with criminal groups. Two peers, Lord Teynham and the Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair however rose to object that they had been tattooed as youngsters, with no ill effects. Since the 1970s tattoos have become more socially acceptable, and fashionable among celebrities. Tattoos are less prominent on figures of authority, and the practice of tattooing by the elderly is still considered remarkable.\n\nThe Jesuit Relations of 1652 describes tattooing among the Petun and the Neutrals:\nIn the period shortly after the American Revolution, to avoid impressment by British Navy ships, sailors used government issued protection papers to establish their American citizenship. However, many of the descriptions of the individual described in the seamen's protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the Royal Navy simply paid no attention to them. \"In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'\"\n\nOne way of making them more specific and more effective was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal as to subject and location, and thus use that description to precisely identify the seaman. As a result, many of the official certificates also carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as any other specific identifying information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen who wanted to avoid impressment. During this period, tattoos were not popular with the rest of the country. \"Frequently the \"protection papers\" made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos.\"\n\n\"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tattoos were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the protection papers issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-passports catalogued tattoos alongside birthmarks, scars, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as pigments, even gunpowder and urine. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols.\"\n\nSometimes, to protect themselves, the sailors requested not only that the tattoos be described, but that they would also be sketched out on the protection certificate as well. As one researched said, \"Clerks writing the documents often sketched the tattoos as well as describing them.\"\n\nSince the 1950s, a false belief has persisted that modern Western tattooing originated exclusively from Captain James Cook’s voyages to the South Pacific in the 1770s. Tattooing has been consistently present in Western society from the modern period stretching back to Ancient Greece. A long history of European tattoo predated these voyages, including among sailors and tradesmen, pilgrims visiting the Holy Land, and on Europeans living among Native Americans.\n\nTattoo historian Anna Felicity Friedman suggests a couple reasons for the \"Cook Myth.\" First, modern European words for the practice (e.g., “tattoo,” “tatuaje,” “tatouage,” “Tätowierung,” and “tatuagem”) derive from the Tahitian word “tatau,” which was introduced to European languages through Cook’s travels. However, prior European texts show that a variety of metaphorical terms were used for the practice, including “pricked,” “marked”, “engraved,” “decorated,” “punctured,” “stained,” and “embroidered.” Friedman also points out that the growing print culture at the time of Cook’s voyages may have increased the visibility of tattooing despite its prior existence in the West.\n\nThe first documented professional tattooer in the United States was Martin Hildebrandt, a German immigrant who arrived in Boston, Massachusetts in 1846. Between 1861 and 1865, he tattooed soldiers on both sides in the American Civil War. The first documented professional tattooist (with a permanent studio, working on members of the paying public) in Britain was Sutherland Macdonald in the early 1880s. Tattooing was an expensive and painful process, and by the late 1880s had become a mark of wealth for the crowned heads of Europe.\n\nIn 1891, New York tattooer Samuel O'Reilly patented the first electric tattoo machine, a modification of Thomas Edison's electric pen.\nThe earliest appearance of tattoos on women during this period were in the circus in the late 19th century. These \"Tattooed Ladies\" were covered — with the exception of their faces, hands, necks, and other readily visible areas — with various images inked into their skin. In order to lure the crowd, the earliest ladies, like Betty Broadbent and Nora Hildebrandt told tales of captivity; they usually claimed to have been taken hostage by Native Americans that tattooed them as a form of torture. However, by the late 1920s the sideshow industry was slowing and by the late 1990s the last tattooed lady was out of business.\n\nAlthough tattooing has steadily increased in popularity since the invention of the electric tattoo machine, it was not until the 1960s that the place of tattooing in popular culture radically shifted. The Tattoo Renaissance began in the late 1950s, and was greatly influenced by several artists in particular Lyle Tuttle, Cliff Raven, Don Nolan, Zeke Owens, Spider Webb, and Don Ed Hardy. A second generation of artists, trained by the first, continued these traditions into the 1970s, and included artists such as Bob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Jack Rudy.\n\nSince the 1970s, tattoos have become a mainstream part of global and Western fashion, common among both sexes, to all economic classes, and to age groups from the later teen years to middle age. The decoration of blues singer Janis Joplin with a wrist let and a small heart on her left breast, by the San Francisco tattoo artist Lyle Tuttle, has been called a seminal moment in the popular acceptance of tattoos as art. Formal interest in the art of the tattoo became prominent in the 1970s through the beginning of the 21st century. For many young Americans, the tattoo has taken on a decidedly different meaning than for previous generations. The tattoo has \"undergone dramatic redefinition\" and has shifted from a form of deviance to an acceptable form of expression.\n\nIn 1988, scholar Arnold Rubin created a collection of works regarding the history of tattoo cultures, publishing them as the \"Marks of Civilization\". In this, the term \"Tattoo Renaissance\" was coined, referring to a period marked by technological, artistic, and social change. Wearers of tattoos, as members of the counterculture began to display their body art as signs of resistance to the values of the white, heterosexual, middle-class. The clientele changed from sailors, bikers, and gang members to the middle and upper class. There was also a shift in iconography from the badge-like images based on repetitive pre-made designs known as flash to customized full-body tattoo influenced by Polynesian and Japanese tattoo art, known as sleeves, which are categorized under the relatively new and popular Avant-garde genre. Tattooers transformed into \"Tattoo Artists\": men and women with fine art backgrounds began to enter the profession alongside the older, traditional tattooists.\n\nTattoos have experienced a resurgence in popularity in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe, Japan, and North and South America. The growth in tattoo culture has seen an influx of new artists into the industry, many of whom have technical and fine arts training. Coupled with advancements in tattoo pigments and the ongoing refinement of the equipment used for tattooing, this has led to an improvement in the quality of tattoos being produced.\n\nJennifer LeRoy (Miss February 1993) was the first Playboy Playmate with a visible tattoo on her centerfold.\n\nDuring the 2000s, the presence of tattoos became evident within pop culture, inspiring television shows such as A&E's \"Inked\" and TLC's \"Miami Ink\" and \"LA Ink\". In addition, many celebrities have made tattoos more acceptable in recent years.\n\nContemporary art exhibitions and visual art institutions have featured tattoos as art through such means as displaying tattoo flash, examining the works of tattoo artists, or otherwise incorporating examples of body art into mainstream exhibits. One such 2009 Chicago exhibition, \"Freaks & Flash\", featured both examples of historic body art as well as the tattoo artists who produced it.\n\nIn 2010, 25% of Australians under age 30 had tattoos. Mattel released a tattooed Barbie doll in 2011, which was widely accepted, although it did attract some controversy.\n\nOver the past three decades Western tattooing has become a practice that has crossed social boundaries from \"low\" to \"high\" class along with reshaping the power dynamics regarding gender. It has its roots in \"exotic\" tribal practices of the Native Americans and Japanese, which are still seen in present times.\n\nAs various kinds of social movements progressed bodily inscription crossed class boundaries, and became common among the general public. Specifically, the tattoo is one access point for revolutionary aesthetics of women. Feminist theory has much to say on the subject. \"Bodies of Subversion: A Secret History of Women and Tattoo\", by Margot Mifflin, became the first history of women's tattoo art when it was released in 1997. In it, she documents women's involvement in tattooing coinciding to feminist successes, with surges in the 1880s, 1920s, and the 1970s. Today, women sometimes use tattoos as forms of bodily reclamation after traumatic experiences like abuse or breast cancer. In 2012, tattooed women outnumbered men for the first time in American history - according to a Harris poll, 23% of women in America had tattoos in that year, compared to 19% of men. In 2013, Miss Kansas, Theresa Vail, became the first Miss America contestant to show off tattoos during the swimsuit competition — the insignia of the U.S. Army Dental Corps on her left shoulder and one of the \"Serenity Prayer\" along the right side of her torso.\n\nIn August 2013, William Mullane of London was tattooed with a portrait of his late father which used ink mixed with a small portion of his father’s ashes.\n\nThe legal status of tattoos is still developing. In recent years, various lawsuits have arisen in the United States regarding the status of tattoos as a copyrightable art form. However, these cases have either been settled out of court or are currently being disputed, and therefore no legal precedent exists directly on point. The process of tattooing was held to be a purely expressive activity protected by the First Amendment by the Ninth Circuit in 2010.\n\nThroughout the world's different military branches, tattoos are either regulated under policies or strictly prohibited to fit dress code rules.\n\nThe United States Air Force regulates all kinds of body modification. Any tattoos which are deemed to be \"prejudicial to good order and discipline\", or \"of a nature that may bring discredit upon the Air Force\" are prohibited. Specifically, any tattoo which may be construed as \"obscene or advocate sexual, racial, ethnic or religious discrimination\" is disallowed. Tattoo removal may not be enough to qualify; resultant \"excessive scarring\" may be disqualifying. Further, Air Force members may not have tattoos on their neck, face, head, tongue, lips or scalp.\n\nTattoos in the Army are regulated under the new Sergeant Major of the Army Daniel A. Dailey. Under its new rules tattoos are strictly prohibited on the arms and legs and anywhere above the collar bone line, tattoos that are visible on other parts of the body cannot be any longer than two inches wide, and only one band tattoo is permitted in the body. Soldiers who are currently in the army, and are affected under the new policy are grandfathered to keep the current tattoos under the validation of their commanders.\n\nThe United States Coast Guard policy has changes over the years.Tattoos should not be visible over the collarbone or when wearing a V-neck shirt. Tattoos or military brands on the arms should not surpass the wrist. But only one hand tattoos of a form of ring are permitted when not exceeding ¼ inch width. Face tattoos are also permitted as permanent eyeliners for females as long as they are appropriately worn and not brightly colored to fit uniform dressing code. Disrespectful derogatory tattoos and sexually explicit are prohibited on the body.\n\nThe United States Marine Corps has disclosed a new policy meeting their new standards of professionalism in the military appearance, on the Marine Corps Bulletin 1020 released on 6 February 2016, substituting any previous policy from the past\".\"\n\nThe new policy in the Marine Corps unauthorized tattoo’s in different parts of the body such as the wrist, knee, elbow and above the collar bone. Wrist tattoos have to be two inches above the wrist, elbow tattoos two inches above and one inch below, and the knee two inches above and two below.\n\n[[File:Tattooed sailor aboard the USS New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Tattooed sailor aboard the \n[[Category:Art history by medium|Tattoo]]\n[[Category:Tattooing]]",
                "Maya society\n\nMaya society concerns the social organization of the Pre-Hispanic Mayas, its political structures and social classes.\n\nA Classic period Maya polity was a small kingdom (\"ajawil\", \"ajawlel\", \"ajawlil\") headed by a hereditary ruler – \"ajaw\", later \"k’uhul ajaw\". Both terms appear in early Colonial texts including \"Papeles de Paxbolón\" where they are used as synonyms for Aztec and Spanish terms for rulers and their domains. These are \"tlatoani\" and \"tlahtocayotl\" in Nahuatl, and the Spanish words \"rey\", \"majestad\", and \"reino\" and \"señor\" for ruler/leader/lord and \"señorío\" or \"dominio\" of realm. Such kingdoms were usually no more than a capital city with its neighborhood and several dependent towns (similar to a city-state). There were also larger polities that controlled larger territories and subjugated smaller polities; the extensive systems controlled by Tikal and Caracol serve as examples of these.\n\nEach kingdom had its name that did not necessarily correspond to any locality within its territory. Its identity was that of a political unit associated with a particular ruling dynasty. For instance, the archaeological site of Naranjo was the capital of the kingdom of Saal. The land (\"chan ch’e’n\") of the kingdom and its capital were called \"Wakab’nal\" or \"Maxam\" and were part of a larger geographical entity known as \"Huk Tsuk\". Despite constant warfare and eventual shifts in regional power, most kingdoms never disappeared from the political landscape until the collapse of the whole system in the 9th century. In this respect, Classic Maya kingdoms were similar to late Postclassic polities encountered by the Spanish in Yucatán and Central Mexico: some polities were subordinate to hegemonic centers or rulers through conquest and/or dynastic unions and yet even then they persisted as distinct entities.\nMayanists have been increasingly accepting the \"court paradigm\" of Classic Maya societies that puts the emphasis on the centrality of the royal household and especially the person of the king. This approach focuses on the totality of Maya monumental spaces as the embodiment of the diverse activities of the royal household. It considers the role of places and spaces (including dwellings of royalty and nobles, throne rooms, temples, halls and plazas for public ceremonies) in establishing and negotiating power and social hierarchy, but also in producing and projecting aesthetic and moral values that define the order of a wider social realm.\n\nSpanish sources invariably describe even the largest Maya settlements of Yucatán and Guatemala as dispersed agglomerations of dwellings grouped around the temples and palaces of the ruling dynasty and lesser nobles. Though there was economic specialization among Classic period Maya centers (see Chunchucmil, for example), it was not conducted at a scale similar to that of the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. Some argue that Maya cities were not urban centers but were, instead, structured according to and conceptualized as enormous royal households, the locales of the administrative and ritual activities of the royal court. Within the theoretical framework of this model, they were the places where privileged nobles could approach the holy ruler, where aesthetical values of the high culture were formulated and disseminated, and where aesthetic items were consumed. They were the self-proclaimed centers and the sources of social, moral, and cosmic, order. The fall of a royal court as in the well-documented cases of Piedras Negras or Copán would cause the inevitable ‘death’ of the associated settlement.\n\nScribes held a prominent position in Maya courts and had their own patron deities (see Howler monkey gods and Maya maize god). They are likely to have come from aristocratic families. It appears that some scribes were attached to the royal house, while others were serving at temples and were, perhaps, counted among the priests. It seems likely that they were organized hierarchically. Maya art often depicts rulers with trappings indicating they were scribes or at least able to write, such as having pen bundles in their headdresses. Additionally, many rulers have been found in conjunction with writing tools such as shell or clay ink pots.\n\nAncient Maya kinship and descent have alternatively been described as patrilineal, matrilineal, and bilateral. Maya political organization has been characterized as both segmentary (involving well-defined lineages and clan-like structures) and centralized.\n\nTo the Maya, body modification is a reflection of a cultural, and individual identity. Through different modifications, the body can be experienced individually, used as a symbol, or as a political statement. Beauty was also used to outwardly show and perform social and moral values.\n\nPhysical remains of the Maya help piece together the motivation and significance for enduring vast amounts of pain, and using huge amounts of wealth to make themselves beautiful. Ancient Maya placed a high value on certain extreme body modifications, often undergoing tedious and painful procedures as a rite of passage, an homage to their gods, and as a permanently visible status symbol of their place in society that would last a lifetime, and into their afterlife. Therefore, there was aesthetic, religious, and social reasoning behind the modification. \n\nThe origin of cranial modification for the Maya is unknown, however it was possibly inherited from the Olmecs, predecessors of the Maya, located near the Tuxtla Mountains. Cranial modification was one of the Olmecs most important practices. Individuals enduring cranial modification could be of any status, but many more elite individuals were depicted with cranial modifications. Intentional deformation practices were used as a way to differentiate between members of the society. All members of an elite family were expected to go through cranial modification shortly after birth. The procedure occurred while the skull of the child was not fully grown and had some plasticity making it easily malleable. \n\nThere are as many as 14 different cranial shapes caused by several different types of purposeful modification or deformation techniques used by members of the Maya society. Neonatal deformation was performed in two main ways: compression of the head with pads and adjusted bindings, or restraining the child on specially designed cradles. Often, a binding device was attached to the forehead so instead of growing naturally into a round or circular form, the child’s cranium grew into a long, and tapered form which indented above the brow line. These different modifications resulted in an abundant amount of stress on the new child’s body, and often led to death.\n\n The two main head shapes of cranial modification for the Maya were erect deformation and oblique deformation. Erect deformation was modification through the use of cradle boards, which often left the occipital flattening asymmetrical, and affected a child’s mobility. Oblique deformation was modification through the use of a paddle applied to the head and was sometimes in use with a frontal board and bandaging. This type of deformation did not cause problems with mobility. Practiced by all members of society, there were distinct differences of temporal and regional preferences. \n\nDuring the Preclassic period, 2000 B.C. – A.D. 250, Maya skull modification imitated the head form of Olmec gods depicted throughout Olmec artwork. With the use of new and different techniques emerging in the Classic period, A.D. 250-900, new cranial modification styles were endured, possibly as an indicator of membership within a kin group, or as a sign of a specific status. Additionally, in the Classic period, the general population used the erect deformation style of modification, while children expected to have high-status positions were given oblique deformation. Around A.D. 900, the modification style standardized, and most human remains were found with tall skulls and flattened foreheads, the same modifications documented by the Spaniards when they arrived in Mesoamerica. \n\nRegional differences in cranial modification styles were also evident. Within the Western Maya lowlands, the popular style of modification imitated the shape of the Maize God’s head, and therefore, more people were discovered to have slanted skulls. High-status Maya mothers would artificially induce cross-eyedness (strabismus) and would strap on boards to flatten the foreheads of high-born infants as a lifelong sign of noble status. The eye condition was used to honor Kinich Ahau, the cross-eyed sun god of the Maya. Across the Guatemala highlands, erect deformation shapes were more likely to be used, and sometimes a band was placed vertically down the head to separate the head into two distinct sections. Cranial modification was able to draw lines between different ethnic groups, as well as represent social status/hierarchy within an individual culture.\nMost evidence of cranial deformation is found through osteological remains discovered through archaeological excavation of Maya sites. Through analysis of the different forms of the skulls, osteologists are able to differentiate between little difference in deformation styles to help understand minute differences between styles, and what these differences may mean. Interpretation of these different cranium types has been debated, but it is clear the shapes are different dependent based on time and region. As stated previously, Spanish and other European records provided detailed descriptions of cranium modification within their historical records. Some of the information the Spaniards recorded included the different types of methods, and the popular materials used for cranium modification. Lastly, other archaeological remains including art depictions, or figurines exhibiting modified skull shape help to illuminate the importance of distinguishing one’s self through the various types of modification. \n\nDue to a lack of written records on the reasons or motivation for cranial modification, the reason the head was the center of this modification is still not clear. One reason is possibly the need for children to be protected when they are born. The Maya believed when children were born, they were vulnerable and thus needed to be protected from soul loss and evil winds. The soul was encased within the head, and therefore these newly souled infants needed to be guarded; cranium modification was one of the ways to protect the soul from being snatched from the newborn. The head was understood to be a portal into a person’s true essence or essential entity, which could be harmed, stolen, or manipulated. Performing cranial modification as soon as the child was born ensured the soul, or essence, of the child was fully protected.\n\nAdditionally, hair was seen as a way to preserve the essence of the soul, \"tonalli,\" from leaving the head of the body. Cutting the hair of a boy too soon was thought to diminish that individual’s knowledge and reason. Lastly, \"Tzompantli\", or skull racks, were associated with passage to the celestial world, and the heads on the rack were believed to contain the essence of the individual spirits. Therefore, by killing an enemy and removing their skull’s from their bodies, the essence of the individual was violated.\n\nMembers of the community were expected to go through cranium modification as a part of a child’s integration into the society. Maya men aspired to look like their ruler, Pakal, who was meant to represent incarnations of the deities. Pakal’s body was shaped to resemble motifs and images of what the Sun and Maize gods were expected to look like. Evidence of the social hierarchy of the Maya was shown in pottery, figurines, drawings, monuments, and architecture picturing high-status elites with the oblique cranium modification. The oblique style cranuml modification, the style endured by Pakal, may have also meant to shape the head like a jaguar, a figure extremely important to Maya religion, sacred to their culture, and a status of power. Additionally, Maya women standards of beauty were also based on the Maize God. Overall, cranial modifications are significant because of their relation with deities and power symbols of the Maya and the outwardly performative aspect displaying specific characteristics of a member within the Maya culture and society. \n\nThe modification of teeth was dependent on social status, as well as location. Dental modification may have been a way to identify with a lineage, polity, ruler, or region. The Maya practiced primarily two different types: filing and inlay. Filing was altering the tooth shape to create notches, grooves, or points. This type of dental modification appeared during the Early Preclassic period (1400-1000 B.C.) and was completed with stone abraders and water. Inlay was drilling holes to insert different materials, and was popular throughout the Middle Preclassic period (900-600 B.C.). In the remainder of the time periods the two were used simultaneously, but filing was much more common overall. \n\nMost likely teeth were modified as a part of ritual or for aesthetic purposes, and younger children usually did not have modified teeth. Once their permanent teeth had arrived, adolescent warriors had their teeth filed to sharp points to give them a fierce appearance, and as a further mark of status. Maya women filed their teeth, or had holes drilled into them where precious stones or luxury materials, such as jade, pyrite, hematite, or turquoise could be inlaid into the teeth. High-status women often had their teeth filed, in different patterns, and would have jadeite, hematite, pyrite, turquoise, or other decorations inset into holes drilled in their teeth. Depending on the material, the meaning of the inlay varied. For example, jade symbolized pure breath or the ability to express elegant speech.\n\nOverall, little evidence for the relationship between socioeconomic status and types of dental modification exists. Most evidence comes from documentation of Europeans in the 16 century who viewed the processes of dental modification. However, these accounts can be problematic as they are filled with bias, and much of the process may be recorded incorrectly, or emphasized in a way to villainize the Maya. More concrete evidence is found through archaeological of ceramics or iconography, and osteological remains of Maya people themselves. Iconographic or images of dental modification, including filling and inlay, are pictured on ceramics or within paintings found at Maya or other Mesoamerican sites. Additionally, teeth of Maya individuals have been excavated from Maya sites and analyzed by dendrologists and other dental specialists recognized dental disease associated with excess filling or drilling of the teeth. This means dental modification was occurring on living subjects. Dental diseases found on the remains of the teeth of Maya individuals shows evidence for excessive dental modifications. Additionally, some of the dental remains were inlaid with various stones, and were filed in a variety of ways. \n\nModification of the teeth was important as different teeth styles exhibited certain characteristics and motifs important to Maya religion, and social status. “Modified dentition conveyed ideas about wealth, threat, and the nature of speech.” Incisors were filed in “T” shape to represent “wind” motifs, as wind was especially important to the Maya embodying the “life force” and a way to honor the maize god. Pakal, the Maya King, had his teeth filed in the shape of a “T” as a way to change the structure of his facial features to make it look as though he were squinting, a direct reflection of the maize god. Teeth were an advertisement of status and as it was an abundant amount of pain, it was likely a rite of passage into adulthood, signifying the ability to tolerate pain. Overall, dental modification was meant to show a specific kind of status, despite being endured by both men and women of various classes. Enduring this type of pain exhibited traits about the overall character of an individual, and congratulated members for reaching a milestone of life. \n\nBody paint, tattoos, and scarification were all used in different ways by the Mayan to signify important events in ones life, as well as to symbolize differing class distinctions. As evidence of skin modification from human remains can not be studied, the evidence for tattooing, scarification, and body paint among the Maya comes from iconographic images such as pottery and murals, artifacts such as tools and vessels used for storing pigment, as well as ethnohistoric accounts.\n\nBody paint patterns were incredibly localized and color and design varied according to location. Two of the most widely used colors among the Maya were red, which was made of cinnabar or vermilion, with hematite and iron ore added. Another popular culture, and one that was possibly the most valued among the Mayans was a blue or green pigment made with indigo and a mineral called Palygorskite. This blue/green color was highly valued because it was associated not only with jade, but with sacrifice to the gods as well. Spanish explorer Diego de Landa states in one of his accounts:\n\n\"...they had the custom of painting their faces and bodies red... they thought it very pleasing...the victim...having smeared him with blue... they brought him up to the round alter...\" The evidence for body painting among the Mayan largely comes from various murals. One mural found in Bonampak, Chiapa shows a man being painted red from the neck down by a servant while a woman’s face is painted red. Another mural found at Calakmul depicts merchants and non-elites wearing face paint of various colors and designs, suggesting that paint may have been used to differentiate class and gender.\n\nWhile there is a physical difference between scarification and tattoos, the Mayans may not have differentiated between the two practices. Tattoos and scarification were used to mark significant events in a Mayan’s life. Diego de Landa says: \"A thief from the highest class is punished by having his face tattooed on both sides from the beard to the forehead. … the young men do not tattoo except to a slight degree until marriage.”Scholar Cara Tremain argues that some tattoos and scars may have been associated with the elite, as “killing” and “rebirth” of the skin through cutting creates an association with death and the rebirth of deities. Tremain also argues that some types of tattooing and scarification symbolized valor and bravery. This theory is supported by the accounts of Diego de Landa who said: “They tattooed their bodies, and the more they do this, the more brave and valiant are they considered, as tattooing is accompanied with great suffering, and is done in this way. Those who do the work first painted the part which they wish with color and afterwards they delicately cut in the paintings, and so with the blood and coloring matter the marks remained in the body. This work is done a little at a time on account of the extreme pain, an afterwards also they were quite sick with it, since the designs festered and matter formed. In spite of all this they made fun of those who were not tattooed.”\n\nThe practice of piercing one’s ears, lips, nose, or cheeks was shared by all Mayans, but it was the type of jewelry worn that was used to differentiate social status. Children would be pierced at a young age as well, with ear flares and spools getting increasingly bigger as the child aged, stretching the ear. The majority of evidence for Mayan piercings comes from archaeological remains of jewelry found in tombs, such as labrets and ear spools. Ethnohistorical accounts also provide us evidence for the amount and high quality of the piercings the Mayans wore. In an account of his travels the Spanish Bishop Diego Lopez de Cogolludiois stated:“The holes in the noses and ears [were filled with] nose and ear pieces of cuzas and other stones of varied colors.”\n\nThe Mayas employed warfare in each period of their development for the purposes of obtaining sacrificial victims, settling competitive rivalries, acquiring critical resources and gaining control of trade routes. Warfare was important to the Maya religion, because raids on surrounding areas provided the victims required for human sacrifice, as well as slaves for the construction of temples. Large-scale battles were also fought to determine and defend territories as well as secure economic power. The Mayas defended their cities with defensive structures such as palisades, gateways, and earthworks. Some cities had a wall within the outer wall, so advancing enemies would be trapped in a killing alley, where they could be slaughtered in great number. During the post-Classic period, the amount of internal warfare increased greatly as the region became more politically fragmented. Armies were enlarged, and in some cases mercenaries were hired. The resulting destruction of many urban centers contributed to the decline of the Maya.\n\nThe ruler of a Maya city was the supreme war captain. Some only dictated military activity, while others participated in the battle. There was a core of warriors that served year-round as guards and obtained sacrificial victims, but most large Maya cities and religious centers had militias. These men were paid to fight for the duration of the battle. Then they would return to their fields or crafts. The militia units were headed by nacoms, hereditary war chiefs, that employed ritual as well as strategic methods in warfare. Some nacoms were only chief strategists, and the troops were led into battle by batabs, or officers. In a large war, even commoners who did not have weapons would fight using hunting tools and by hurling rocks. “In the highlands, women occasionally fought in battles according to native chronicles” (Foster, 144).\n\nThe jungle terrain of Mesoamerica made it difficult for large armies to reach their destination. The warriors who were familiar with the battle landscape could strategically retreat into familiar wilderness. Other war tactics included the siege of cities and the formation of alliances with lesser enemies to defeat more prominent ones. There is evidence that canoes were used to attack cities, located on lakes and rivers. In the late Classic period, destructive warfare methods, such as burning, became more prevalent.\n\nWarfare was a ritual process, which was believed to be sanctioned by the gods. Military leaders, in many instances, also had religious authority. Before going into battle, the armies would call upon the gods with dances and music of drums, whistles, conch shell horns and singing. The drumming and war cries would signify the start of the battle. The armies also carried religious idols into battle to inspire the warriors. They fought fiercely because they believed that death on the battle field secured them eternal bliss, whereas capture by the enemy was regarded as worse than any death. When an enemy was defeated, the victorious army exploited the religious icons and sometimes humiliated the defeated leader with prolonged captivity. The treatment of prisoners by the victorious was brutal and often ended in decapitation. The Maya also had a ritual of giving blood. The reason that they gave blood was to show respect to their gods. They gave blood from their genitals and tongue. Afterwards, they would drip their blood onto a piece of paper and burn it into the sky to show respect to their gods.\n\nWeapons used by the Maya included spear-throwers known as atlatls, blowguns, obsidian spiked clubs, spears, axes, lances and knives tipped with flint or obsidian blades. Bow and arrows were also used, but not as extensively. Though there were few helmets, they used decorated shields made from woven mats, wood and animal skins for protection. The Maya war leaders dressed to inspire their warriors and terrify their enemies. They usually wore padded cotton armor, a mantle with religious insignia, and elaborate wooden and cloth headdresses, that represented the animal spirit or “way” of the warrior. Metal was not used in battle because of the limited supply.\n\n\n"

                "History of tattooing\n\nTattooing has been practiced across the globe since at least Neolithic times, as evidenced by mummified preserved skin, ancient art, and the archaeological record. Both ancient art and archaeological finds of possible tattoo tools suggest tattooing was practiced by the Upper Paleolithic period in Europe. However, direct evidence for tattooing on mummified human skin extends only to the 4th millennium BC. The oldest discovery of tattooed human skin to date is found on the body of Ötzi the Iceman, dating to between 3370 and 3100 BC. Other tattooed mummies have been recovered from at least 49 archaeological sites including locations in Greenland, Alaska, Siberia, Mongolia, western China, Egypt, Sudan, the Philippines, and the Andes. These include Amunet, Priestess of the Goddess Hathor from ancient Egypt (c. 2134–1991 BC), multiple mummies from Siberia including the Pazyryk culture of Russia, and from several cultures throughout pre-Columbian South America.\n\nCemeteries throughout the Tarim Basin (Xinjiang of western China) including the sites of Qäwrighul, Yanghai, Shengjindian, Zaghunluq, and Qizilchoqa have revealed several tattooed mummies with Western Asian/Indo-European physical traits and cultural materials. These date from between 2100 and 550 BC.\n\nIn ancient China, tattoos were considered a barbaric practice, and were often referred to in literature depicting bandits and folk heroes. As late as the Qing Dynasty, it was common practice to tattoo characters such as (\"Prisoner\") on convicted criminals' faces. Although relatively rare during most periods of Chinese history, slaves were also sometimes marked to display ownership.\n\nHowever, tattoos seem to have remained a part of southern culture. Marco Polo wrote of Quanzhou, \"Many come hither from Upper India to have their bodies painted with the needle in the way we have elsewhere described, there being many adepts at this craft in the city\". At least three of the main characters Lu Zhishen, Shi Jin (史進), and Yan Ching (燕青) in the classic novel \"Water Margin\" are described as having tattoos covering nearly all of their bodies. Wu Song was sentenced to a facial tattoo describing his crime after killing Xi Menqing (西门庆) to avenge his brother. In addition, Chinese legend claimed the mother of Yue Fei (a famous Song general) tattooed the words \"Repay the Country with Pure Loyalty\" (, \"jing zhong bao guo\") down her son's back before he left to join the army.\n\nGreek written records of tattooing date back to at least the 5th-century BCE. The ancient Greeks and Romans used tattooing to penalize slaves, criminals, and prisoners of war. While known, decorative tattooing was looked down upon and religious tattooing was mainly practiced in Egypt and Syria. According to Robert Graves in his book \"The Greek Myths\", tattooing was common amongst certain religious groups in the ancient Mediterranean world, which may have contributed to the prohibition of tattooing in Leviticus. The Romans of Late Antiquity also tattooed soldiers and arms manufacturers, a practice that continued into the ninth century.\n\nThe Greek verb \"stizein\" (στίζειν), meaning \"to prick,\" was used for tattooing. Its derivative \"stigma\" (στίγμα) was the common term for tattoo marks in both Greek and Latin. During the Byzantine period, the verb \"kentein\" (κεντεῖν) replaced \"stizein\", and a variety of new Latin terms replaced \"stigmata\" including \"signa\" \"signs,\" \"characteres\" \"stamps,\" and \"cicatrices\" \"scars.\"\n\nIn Southern India, permanent tattoos are called \"pachakutharathu\". It was very common in South India, especially Tamil Nadu, before 1980. In northern India, permanent tattoos are called \"godna\". Tattoos have been used as cultural symbols among many tribal populations, as well as the general Hindu population of India.\n\nIn India, tattoos have many names, including \"tarazwa\", \"gondan\", and \"ungkala\".\n\nSeveral Indonesian tribes have in their tattooing culture. One notable example is the Dayak people of Kalimantan in Borneo (Bornean traditional tattooing). Another ethnic group that practices tattooing are the Mentawai people, as well as Moi and Meyakh people in West Papua.\n\nTattooing for spiritual and decorative purposes in Japan is thought to extend back to at least the Jōmon or Paleolithic period and was widespread during various periods for both the Japanese and the native Ainu. Chinese texts from before 300 AD described social differences among Japanese people as being indicated through tattooing and other bodily marking. Chinese texts from the time also described Japanese men of all ages as decorating their faces and bodies with tattoos.\n\nBetween 1603 and 1868, Japanese tattooing was only practiced by the \"ukiyo\" (floating world) subculture. Generally firemen, manual workers and prostitutes wore tattoos to communicate their status. By the early 17th century, criminals were widely being tattooed as a visible mark of punishment. Criminals were marked with symbols typically including crosses, lines, double lines and circles on certain parts of the body, mostly the face and arms. These symbols sometimes designated the places where the crimes were committed. In one area, the character for \"dog\" was tattooed on the criminal's forehead.\n\nThe Government of Meiji Japan, formed in 1868, banned the art of tattooing altogether, viewing it as barbaric and lacking respectability. This subsequently created a subculture of criminals and outcasts. These people had no place in \"decent society\" and were frowned upon. They could not simply integrate into mainstream society because of their obvious visible tattoos, forcing many of them into criminal activities which ultimately formed the roots for the modern Japanese mafia, the Yakuza, with which tattoos have become almost synonymous in Japan.\n\nDespite a lack of direct textual references, tattooed human remains and iconographic evidence indicate that ancient Egyptians practiced tattooing from at least 2000 BCE. It is theorized that tattooing entered Egypt through Nubia, but this claim is complicated by the high mobility between Lower Nubia and Upper Egypt as well as Egypt's annexation of Lower Nubia during the Middle Kingdom. Archeologist Geoffrey J. Tassie argues that it may be more appropriate to classify tattoo in ancient Egypt and Nubia as part of a larger Nile Valley tradition.\n\nThe most famous tattooed mummies from this region are Amunet, a priestess of Hathor, and two Hathoric dancers from Dynasty XI that were found at Deir el-Bahari. In 1898, Daniel Fouquet, a medical doctor from Cairo, wrote an article on medical tattooing practices in ancient Egypt in which he describes the tattoos on these three mummies and speculates that they may have served a medicinal or therapeutic purpose: \"The examination of these scars, some white, others blue, leaves in no doubt that they are not, in essence, ornament, but an established treatment for a condition of the pelvis, very probably chronic pelvic peritonitis.\"\n\nAncient Egyptian tattooing appears to have been practiced on women exclusively; with the possible exception of one extremely worn Dynasty XII stele, there is no artistic or physical evidence that men were tattooed. However, by the Meroitic Period (300 BCE – 400 CE) it was practiced on Nubian men as well.\n\nAccounts of early travelers to ancient Egypt describe the tool used as an uneven number of metal needles attached to a wooden handle.\n\nCoptic tattoos often consist of three lines, three dots and two elements, reflecting the Trinity. The tools used had an odd the number of needles to bring luck and good fortune. Many Copts have the Coptic cross tattooed on the inside of their right arm. This may have been influenced by a similar practice tattooing religious symbols on the wrists and arms during the Ptolemaic Period.\n\nHerodotus' writings suggest that slaves and prisoners of war were tattooed in Persia during the classical era. This practice spread from Persia to Greece and then to Rome.\n\nThe most famous depiction of tattooing in Persian literature goes back 800 years to a tale by Rumi about a man who is proud to want a lion tattoo but changes his mind once he experiences the pain of the needle.\n\nIn the \"hamam\" (the baths), there were \"dallaks\" whose job was to help people wash themselves. This was a notable occupation because apart from helping the customers with washing, they were massage-therapists, dentists, barbers, and tattoo artists.\n\nTattooing has been a part of Filipino life since pre-Hispanic colonization of the Philippine Islands, tattooing in the Philippines to some were a form of rank and accomplishments, and some believed that tattoos had magical qualities. The more famous tattooed indigenous peoples of the Philippines resided in north Luzon, especially among the Bontoc Igorot, Kalinga, and Ifugao peoples. The Visayans of the southern islands were also heavily tattooed.\n\nFilipino tattooing was first documented by the European Spanish explorers as they landed among the Islands in the late 16th century, and called the natives \"Los Pintados\" (The Painted Ones) as they mistook the tattoos for paint. Before European exploration, tattooing was widespread, but conversion to Christianity greatly diminished the practice as heathen or low-class.\n\nAs Lane Wilcken's \"Filipino Tattoos Ancient to Modern\" denotes, there are many similarities between the tattooing traditions of the Philippines and indigenous Polynesian designs--not only with their societal function and similar designs, but in the tools used to hand-tap them on (generally a needle or thorn on a stick, with a hammer to pound it into the skin). While the most common modern term for indigenous tattoos is \"batok,\" an ancient Tagalog word for tattoos was \"tatak,\" extremely similar to the Samoan word \"tatau\".\n\nThe Māori people of New Zealand practised a form of tattooing known as Tā moko, traditionally created with chisels. In the colonial period Tā moko fell out of use, partly because of the European practice of collecting Mokomokai, or tattooed heads.\n\nHowever, from the late 20th century onward, there has been a resurgence of tā moko amongst Maori. There is also a related tattoo art, kirituhi, which has a similar aesthetic to tā moko but is worn by non-Maori.\n\nThe traditional male tattoo in Samoa is called the pe'a. The traditional female tattoo is called the malu. The word \"tattoo\" is believed to have originated from the Samoan word \"tatau.\" \n\nWhen the Samoan Islands were first seen by Europeans in 1722 three Dutch ships commanded by Jacob Roggeveen visited the eastern island known as Manua. A crew member of one of the ships described the natives in these words, \"They are friendly in their speech and courteous in their behavior, with no apparent trace of wildness or savagery. They do not paint themselves, as do the natives of some other islands, but on the lower part of the body they wear artfully woven silk tights or knee breeches. They are altogether the most charming and polite natives we have seen in all of the South Seas...\"\n\nThe ships lay at anchor off the islands for several days, but the crews did not venture ashore and did not even get close enough to the natives to realize that they were not wearing silk leggings, but their legs were completely covered in tattoos.\n\nIn Samoa, the tradition of applying tattoo, or tatau, by hand has been unbroken for over two thousand years. Tools and techniques have changed little. The skill is often passed from father to son, each tattoo artist, or tufuga, learning the craft over many years of serving as his father's apprentice. A young artist-in-training often spent hours, and sometimes days, tapping designs into sand or tree bark using a special tattooing comb, or au. Honoring their tradition, Samoan tattoo artists made this tool from sharpened boar's teeth fastened together with a portion of the turtle shell and to a wooden handle. \n\nTraditional Samoan tattooing of the \"pe'a\", body tattoo, is an ordeal that is not lightly undergone. It takes many weeks to complete. The process is very painful and used to be a necessary prerequisite to receiving a matai title; this however is no longer the case. Tattooing was also a very costly procedure.\n\nIt was not uncommon for half a dozen boys to be tattooed at the same time, requiring the services of four or more artists. It was not just the men who received tattoos, but the women too; their designs are of a much lighter nature rather than having the large areas of solid dye which are frequently seen in men’s tattoos. The tattooing of women was not nearly as ritualized like men’s were.\n\nSamoan society has long been defined by rank and title, with chiefs (ali'i) and their assistants, known as talking chiefs (tulafale). The tattooing ceremonies for young chiefs, typically conducted at the time of puberty, were part of their ascendance to a leadership role. The permanent marks left by the tattoo artists would forever celebrate their endurance and dedication to cultural traditions. The pain was extreme and the risk of death by infection was a concern; to back down from tattooing was to risk being labeled a \"pala'ai\" or coward. Those who could not endure the pain and abandoned their tattooing were left incomplete, would be forced to wear their mark of shame throughout their life. This would forever bring shame upon their family so it was avoided at all cost. \n\nThe Samoan tattooing process used a number of tools which remained almost unchanged since their first use. \"Autapulu\" is a wide tattooing comb used to fill in the large dark areas of the tattoo. \"Ausogi'aso tele\" is a comb used for making thick lines. \"Ausogi'aso laititi\" is a comb used for making thin lines. \"Aumogo\" small comb is used for making small marks. \"Sausau\" is the mallet is used for striking the combs. It is almost two feet in length and made from the central rib of a coconut palm leaf. \"Tuluma\" is the pot used for holding the tattooing combs. Ipulama is the cup used for holding the dye. The dye is made from the soot collected from burnt lama nuts. \"Tu'I\" used to grind up the dye. These tools were primarily made out of animal bones to ensure sharpness.\n\nThe tattooing process itself would be 5 sessions, in theory. These 5 sessions would be spread out over 10 days in order for the inflammation to subside.\n\nChristian missionaries from the west attempted to purge tattooing among the Samoans, thinking it barbaric and inhumane. Many young Samoans resisted mission schools since they forbade them to wear tattoos. But over time attitudes relaxed toward this cultural tradition and tattooing began to reemerge in Samoan culture.\n\nTattooed mummies dating to c. 500 BC were extracted from burial mounds on the Ukok plateau during the 1990s. Their tattooing involved animal designs carried out in a curvilinear style. The Man of Pazyryk, a Scythian chieftain, is tattooed with an extensive and detailed range of fish, monsters and a series of dots that lined up along the spinal column (lumbar region) and around the right ankle.\n\nSome artifacts dating back 3,000 years from the Solomon Islands may have been used for tattooing human skin. Obsidian pieces have been duplicated, then used to conduct tattoos on pig skin, then compared to the original artifacts. \"They conducted these experiments to observe the wear, such as chipping and scratches, and residues on the stones caused by tattooing, and then compared that use-wear with 3,000 year old artifacts. They found that the obsidian pieces, old and new, show similar patterns, suggesting that they hadn't been used for working hides, but were for adorning human skin.\"\n\nIn Taiwan, facial tattoos of the Atayal tribe are called \"ptasan\"; they are used to demonstrate that an adult man can protect his homeland, and that an adult woman is qualified to weave cloth and perform housekeeping.\nTaiwan is believed to be the homeland of all the Austronesian peoples which includes Filipinos, Indonesians, Polynesians and Malagasy peoples, all with strong tattoo traditions. This along with the striking correlation between Austronesian languages and the use of the so-called hand-tapping method suggests that Austronesian peoples inherited their tattooing traditions from their ancestors established in Taiwan or along the southern coast of the Chinese mainland.\n\nThai tattoos also known as Yantra tattooing was common since ancient times. Just as other native southeast Asian cultures, animistic tattooing was common in Tai tribes that were is southern China. Over time this animistic practice of tattooing for luck and protection assimilated Hindu and Buddhist ideas. The Sak Yant traditional tattoo is practiced today by many and are usually given either by a Buddhist monk or a Brahmin priest. The tattoos usually depict Hindu gods and use the Mon script or ancient Khmer script, which were the scripts of the classical civilizations of mainland southeast Asia.\n\nThe earliest possible evidence for tattooing in Europe appears on ancient art from the Upper Paleolithic period as incised designs on the bodies of humanoid figurines. The Löwenmensch figurine from the Aurignacian culture dates to approximately 40,000 years ago and features a series of parallel lines on its left shoulder. The ivory Venus of Hohle Fels, which dates to between 35,000 and 40,000 years ago also exhibits incised lines down both arms, as well as across the torso and chest.\n\nThe oldest and most famous direct proof of ancient European tattooing appears on the body of Ötzi the Iceman, who was found in the Ötz valley in the Alps and dates from the late 4th millennium BC. Studies have revealed that Ötzi had 61 carbon-ink tattoos consisting of 19 groups of lines simple dots and lines on his lower spine, left wrist, behind his right knee, and on his ankles. It has been argued that these tattoos were a form of healing because of their placement, though other explanations are plausible.\n\nPre-Christian Germanic, Celtic and other central and northern European tribes were often heavily tattooed, according to surviving accounts, but it may also have been normal paint. The Picts may have been tattooed (or scarified) with elaborate, war-inspired black or dark blue woad (or possibly copper for the blue tone) designs. Julius Caesar described these tattoos in Book V of his \"Gallic Wars\" (54 BC). Nevertheless, these may have been painted markings rather than tattoos.\n\nAhmad ibn Fadlan wrote of his encounter with the Scandinavian Rus' tribe in the early 10th century, describing them as tattooed from \"fingernails to neck\" with dark blue \"tree patterns\" and other \"figures.\" However, this may also have been paint, since the word used can mean both tattoo and painting. During the gradual process of Christianization in Europe, tattoos were often considered remaining elements of paganism and generally legally prohibited.\n\nThe significance of tattooing was long open to Eurocentric interpretations. In the mid-19th century, Baron Haussmann, while arguing against painting the interior of Parisian churches, said the practice \"reminds me of the tattoos used in place of clothes by barbarous peoples to conceal their nakedness\".\n\nBritish and other pilgrims to the Holy Lands throughout the 17th century were tattooed to commemorate their voyages, including William Lithgow in 1612. \n\nIn 1691 William Dampier brought to London a native of the western part of New Guinea (now part of Indonesia) who had a tattooed body and became known as the \"Painted Prince\".\n\nBetween 1766 and 1779, Captain James Cook made three voyages to the South Pacific, the last trip ending with Cook's death in Hawaii in February 1779. When Cook and his men returned home to Europe from their voyages to Polynesia, they told tales of the 'tattooed savages' they had seen. The word \"tattoo\" itself comes from the Tahitian \"tatau\", and was introduced into the English language by Cook's expedition (though the word 'tattoo' or 'tap-too', referring to a drumbeat, had existed in English since at least 1644)\n\nIt was in Tahiti aboard the Endeavour, in July 1769, that Cook first noted his observations about the indigenous body modification and is the first recorded use of the word tattoo to refer to the permanent marking of the skin. In the Ship's log book recorded this entry: \"Both sexes paint their Bodys, Tattow, as it is called in their Language. This is done by inlaying the Colour of Black under their skins, in such a manner as to be indelible.\" Cook went on to write, \"This method of Tattowing I shall now describe...As this is a painful operation, especially the Tattowing of their Buttocks, it is performed but once in their Lifetimes.\"\n\nCook's Science Officer and Expedition Botanist, Sir Joseph Banks, returned to England with a tattoo. Banks was a highly regarded member of the English aristocracy and had acquired his position with Cook by putting up what was at the time the princely sum of some ten thousand pounds in the expedition. In turn, Cook brought back with him a tattooed Raiatean man, Omai, whom he presented to King George and the English Court. Many of Cook's men, ordinary seamen and sailors, came back with tattoos, a tradition that would soon become associated with men of the sea in the public's mind and the press of the day. In the process sailors and seamen re-introduced the practice of tattooing in Europe and it spread rapidly to seaports around the globe.\n\nBy the 19th century tattooing had spread to British society but was still largely associated with sailors and the lower or even criminal class. Tattooing had however been practised in an amateur way by public schoolboys from at least the 1840s and by the 1870s had become fashionable among some members of the upper classes, including royalty. In its upmarket form it could be a lengthy, expensive and sometimes painful process.\n\nTattooing spread among the upper classes all over Europe in the 19th century, but particularly in Britain where it was estimated in Harmsworth Magazine in 1898 that as many as one in five members of the gentry were tattooed. Taking their lead from the British Court, where George V followed Edward VII's lead in getting tattooed; King Frederick IX of Denmark, the King of Romania, Kaiser Wilhelm II, King Alexander of Yugoslavia and even Tsar Nicholas II of Russia, all sported tattoos, many of them elaborate and ornate renditions of the Royal Coat of Arms or the Royal Family Crest. King Alfonso XIII of modern Spain also had a tattoo.\n\nThe perception that there is a marked class division on the acceptability of the practice has been a popular media theme in Britain, as successive generations of journalists described the practice as newly fashionable and no longer for a marginalised class. Examples of this cliché can be found in every decade since the 1870s. Despite this evidence, a myth persists that the upper and lower classes find tattooing attractive and the broader middle classes rejecting it. In 1969, the House of Lords debated a bill to ban the tattooing of minors, on grounds it had become \"trendy\" with the young in recent years but was associated with crime. It was noted that 40 per cent of young criminals had tattoos and that marking the skin in this way tended to encourage self-identification with criminal groups. Two peers, Lord Teynham and the Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair however rose to object that they had been tattooed as youngsters, with no ill effects. Since the 1970s tattoos have become more socially acceptable, and fashionable among celebrities. Tattoos are less prominent on figures of authority, and the practice of tattooing by the elderly is still considered remarkable.\n\nThe Jesuit Relations of 1652 describes tattooing among the Petun and the Neutrals:\nIn the period shortly after the American Revolution, to avoid impressment by British Navy ships, sailors used government issued protection papers to establish their American citizenship. However, many of the descriptions of the individual described in the seamen's protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the Royal Navy simply paid no attention to them. \"In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'\"\n\nOne way of making them more specific and more effective was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal as to subject and location, and thus use that description to precisely identify the seaman. As a result, many of the official certificates also carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as any other specific identifying information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen who wanted to avoid impressment. During this period, tattoos were not popular with the rest of the country. \"Frequently the \"protection papers\" made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos.\"\n\n\"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tattoos were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the protection papers issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-passports catalogued tattoos alongside birthmarks, scars, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as pigments, even gunpowder and urine. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols.\"\n\nSometimes, to protect themselves, the sailors requested not only that the tattoos be described, but that they would also be sketched out on the protection certificate as well. As one researched said, \"Clerks writing the documents often sketched the tattoos as well as describing them.\"\n\nSince the 1950s, a false belief has persisted that modern Western tattooing originated exclusively from Captain James Cook’s voyages to the South Pacific in the 1770s. Tattooing has been consistently present in Western society from the modern period stretching back to Ancient Greece. A long history of European tattoo predated these voyages, including among sailors and tradesmen, pilgrims visiting the Holy Land, and on Europeans living among Native Americans.\n\nTattoo historian Anna Felicity Friedman suggests a couple reasons for the \"Cook Myth.\" First, modern European words for the practice (e.g., “tattoo,” “tatuaje,” “tatouage,” “Tätowierung,” and “tatuagem”) derive from the Tahitian word “tatau,” which was introduced to European languages through Cook’s travels. However, prior European texts show that a variety of metaphorical terms were used for the practice, including “pricked,” “marked”, “engraved,” “decorated,” “punctured,” “stained,” and “embroidered.” Friedman also points out that the growing print culture at the time of Cook’s voyages may have increased the visibility of tattooing despite its prior existence in the West.\n\nThe first documented professional tattooer in the United States was Martin Hildebrandt, a German immigrant who arrived in Boston, Massachusetts in 1846. Between 1861 and 1865, he tattooed soldiers on both sides in the American Civil War. The first documented professional tattooist (with a permanent studio, working on members of the paying public) in Britain was Sutherland Macdonald in the early 1880s. Tattooing was an expensive and painful process, and by the late 1880s had become a mark of wealth for the crowned heads of Europe.\n\nIn 1891, New York tattooer Samuel O'Reilly patented the first electric tattoo machine, a modification of Thomas Edison's electric pen.\nThe earliest appearance of tattoos on women during this period were in the circus in the late 19th century. These \"Tattooed Ladies\" were covered — with the exception of their faces, hands, necks, and other readily visible areas — with various images inked into their skin. In order to lure the crowd, the earliest ladies, like Betty Broadbent and Nora Hildebrandt told tales of captivity; they usually claimed to have been taken hostage by Native Americans that tattooed them as a form of torture. However, by the late 1920s the sideshow industry was slowing and by the late 1990s the last tattooed lady was out of business.\n\nAlthough tattooing has steadily increased in popularity since the invention of the electric tattoo machine, it was not until the 1960s that the place of tattooing in popular culture radically shifted. The Tattoo Renaissance began in the late 1950s, and was greatly influenced by several artists in particular Lyle Tuttle, Cliff Raven, Don Nolan, Zeke Owens, Spider Webb, and Don Ed Hardy. A second generation of artists, trained by the first, continued these traditions into the 1970s, and included artists such as Bob Roberts, Jamie Summers, and Jack Rudy.\n\nSince the 1970s, tattoos have become a mainstream part of global and Western fashion, common among both sexes, to all economic classes, and to age groups from the later teen years to middle age. The decoration of blues singer Janis Joplin with a wrist let and a small heart on her left breast, by the San Francisco tattoo artist Lyle Tuttle, has been called a seminal moment in the popular acceptance of tattoos as art. Formal interest in the art of the tattoo became prominent in the 1970s through the beginning of the 21st century. For many young Americans, the tattoo has taken on a decidedly different meaning than for previous generations. The tattoo has \"undergone dramatic redefinition\" and has shifted from a form of deviance to an acceptable form of expression.\n\nIn 1988, scholar Arnold Rubin created a collection of works regarding the history of tattoo cultures, publishing them as the \"Marks of Civilization\". In this, the term \"Tattoo Renaissance\" was coined, referring to a period marked by technological, artistic, and social change. Wearers of tattoos, as members of the counterculture began to display their body art as signs of resistance to the values of the white, heterosexual, middle-class. The clientele changed from sailors, bikers, and gang members to the middle and upper class. There was also a shift in iconography from the badge-like images based on repetitive pre-made designs known as flash to customized full-body tattoo influenced by Polynesian and Japanese tattoo art, known as sleeves, which are categorized under the relatively new and popular Avant-garde genre. Tattooers transformed into \"Tattoo Artists\": men and women with fine art backgrounds began to enter the profession alongside the older, traditional tattooists.\n\nTattoos have experienced a resurgence in popularity in many parts of the world, particularly in Europe, Japan, and North and South America. The growth in tattoo culture has seen an influx of new artists into the industry, many of whom have technical and fine arts training. Coupled with advancements in tattoo pigments and the ongoing refinement of the equipment used for tattooing, this has led to an improvement in the quality of tattoos being produced.\n\nJennifer LeRoy (Miss February 1993) was the first Playboy Playmate with a visible tattoo on her centerfold.\n\nDuring the 2000s, the presence of tattoos became evident within pop culture, inspiring television shows such as A&E's \"Inked\" and TLC's \"Miami Ink\" and \"LA Ink\". In addition, many celebrities have made tattoos more acceptable in recent years.\n\nContemporary art exhibitions and visual art institutions have featured tattoos as art through such means as displaying tattoo flash, examining the works of tattoo artists, or otherwise incorporating examples of body art into mainstream exhibits. One such 2009 Chicago exhibition, \"Freaks & Flash\", featured both examples of historic body art as well as the tattoo artists who produced it.\n\nIn 2010, 25% of Australians under age 30 had tattoos. Mattel released a tattooed Barbie doll in 2011, which was widely accepted, although it did attract some controversy.\n\nOver the past three decades Western tattooing has become a practice that has crossed social boundaries from \"low\" to \"high\" class along with reshaping the power dynamics regarding gender. It has its roots in \"exotic\" tribal practices of the Native Americans and Japanese, which are still seen in present times.\n\nAs various kinds of social movements progressed bodily inscription crossed class boundaries, and became common among the general public. Specifically, the tattoo is one access point for revolutionary aesthetics of women. Feminist theory has much to say on the subject. \"Bodies of Subversion: A Secret History of Women and Tattoo\", by Margot Mifflin, became the first history of women's tattoo art when it was released in 1997. In it, she documents women's involvement in tattooing coinciding to feminist successes, with surges in the 1880s, 1920s, and the 1970s. Today, women sometimes use tattoos as forms of bodily reclamation after traumatic experiences like abuse or breast cancer. In 2012, tattooed women outnumbered men for the first time in American history - according to a Harris poll, 23% of women in America had tattoos in that year, compared to 19% of men. In 2013, Miss Kansas, Theresa Vail, became the first Miss America contestant to show off tattoos during the swimsuit competition — the insignia of the U.S. Army Dental Corps on her left shoulder and one of the \"Serenity Prayer\" along the right side of her torso.\n\nIn August 2013, William Mullane of London was tattooed with a portrait of his late father which used ink mixed with a small portion of his father’s ashes.\n\nThe legal status of tattoos is still developing. In recent years, various lawsuits have arisen in the United States regarding the status of tattoos as a copyrightable art form. However, these cases have either been settled out of court or are currently being disputed, and therefore no legal precedent exists directly on point. The process of tattooing was held to be a purely expressive activity protected by the First Amendment by the Ninth Circuit in 2010.\n\nThroughout the world's different military branches, tattoos are either regulated under policies or strictly prohibited to fit dress code rules.\n\nThe United States Air Force regulates all kinds of body modification. Any tattoos which are deemed to be \"prejudicial to good order and discipline\", or \"of a nature that may bring discredit upon the Air Force\" are prohibited. Specifically, any tattoo which may be construed as \"obscene or advocate sexual, racial, ethnic or religious discrimination\" is disallowed. Tattoo removal may not be enough to qualify; resultant \"excessive scarring\" may be disqualifying. Further, Air Force members may not have tattoos on their neck, face, head, tongue, lips or scalp.\n\nTattoos in the Army are regulated under the new Sergeant Major of the Army Daniel A. Dailey. Under its new rules tattoos are strictly prohibited on the arms and legs and anywhere above the collar bone line, tattoos that are visible on other parts of the body cannot be any longer than two inches wide, and only one band tattoo is permitted in the body. Soldiers who are currently in the army, and are affected under the new policy are grandfathered to keep the current tattoos under the validation of their commanders.\n\nThe United States Coast Guard policy has changes over the years.Tattoos should not be visible over the collarbone or when wearing a V-neck shirt. Tattoos or military brands on the arms should not surpass the wrist. But only one hand tattoos of a form of ring are permitted when not exceeding ¼ inch width. Face tattoos are also permitted as permanent eyeliners for females as long as they are appropriately worn and not brightly colored to fit uniform dressing code. Disrespectful derogatory tattoos and sexually explicit are prohibited on the body.\n\nThe United States Marine Corps has disclosed a new policy meeting their new standards of professionalism in the military appearance, on the Marine Corps Bulletin 1020 released on 6 February 2016, substituting any previous policy from the past\".\"\n\nThe new policy in the Marine Corps unauthorized tattoo’s in different parts of the body such as the wrist, knee, elbow and above the collar bone. Wrist tattoos have to be two inches above the wrist, elbow tattoos two inches above and one inch below, and the knee two inches above and two below.\n\n[[File:Tattooed sailor aboard the USS New Jersey.jpg|thumb|Tattooed sailor aboard the \n[[Category:Art history by medium|Tattoo]]\n[[Category:Tattooing]]",
                "Tattoo\n\nA tattoo is a form of body modification where a design is made by inserting ink, dyes and pigments, either indelible or temporary, into the dermis layer of the skin to change the pigment. Tattoos fall into three broad categories: purely decorative (with no specific meaning); symbolic (with a specific meaning pertinent to the wearer); pictorial (a depiction of a specific person or item). Tattoos have historically been regarded in the West as 'uncivilised', and over the last 100 years the fashion has been associated mainly with sailors, working men and criminals. By the end of the 20th Century many Western stigmas of the tattoo culture had been dismissed and the practice has become more acceptable and accessible for people of all trades and levels of society.\n\nThe word \"tattoo\", or \"tattow\" in the 18th century, is a loanword from the Polynesian word \"tatau\", meaning \"to write\". The \"Oxford English Dictionary\" gives the etymology of tattoo as \"In 18th c. tattaow, tattow. From Polynesian (Samoan, Tahitian, Tongan, etc.) tatau. In Marquesan, tatu.\" Before the importation of the Polynesian word, the practice of tattooing had been described in the West as painting, scarring, or staining.\n\nThis is not to be confused with the origins of the word for the military drumbeat or performance — see \"military tattoo\". In this case, the English word \"tattoo\" is derived from the Dutch word \"taptoe\".\n\nThe first written reference to the word \"tattoo\" (or \"tatau\") appears in the journal of Joseph Banks (24 February 1743 – 19 June 1820), the naturalist aboard explorer Captain Cook's ship the \"HMS Endeavour\": \"I shall now mention the way they mark themselves indelibly, each of them is so marked by their humour or disposition\".\nThe word \"tattoo\" was brought to Europe by Cook, when he returned in 1769 from his first voyage to Tahiti and New Zealand. In his narrative of the voyage, he refers to an operation called \"tattaw\".\n\nTattoo enthusiasts may refer to tattoos as \"ink\", \"pieces\", \"skin art\", \"tattoo art\", \"tats\", or \"work\"; to the creators as \"tattoo artists\", \"tattooers\", or \"tattooists\"; and to places where they work as \"tattoo shops\", \"tattoo studios\", or \"tattoo parlors\".\nMainstream art galleries hold exhibitions of both conventional and custom tattoo designs such as \"Beyond Skin\", at the Museum of Croydon. Copyrighted tattoo designs that are mass-produced and sent to tattoo artists are known as \"flash\", a notable instance of industrial design. Flash sheets are prominently displayed in many tattoo parlors for the purpose of providing both inspiration and ready-made tattoo images to customers.\n\nThe Japanese word \"irezumi\" means \"insertion of ink\" and can mean tattoos using \"tebori\", the traditional Japanese hand method, a Western-style machine, or any method of tattooing using insertion of ink. The most common word used for traditional Japanese tattoo designs is \"horimono\". Japanese may use the word \"tattoo\" to mean non-Japanese styles of tattooing.\n\nAnthropologist Ling Roth in 1900 described four methods of skin marking and suggested they be differentiated under the names \"tatu\", \"moko\", \"cicatrix\", and \"keloid\".\n\nThe American Academy of Dermatology distinguishes five types of tattoos: traumatic tattoos, also called \"natural tattoos\", that result from injuries, especially asphalt from road injuries or pencil lead; amateur tattoos; professional tattoos, both via traditional methods and modern tattoo machines; cosmetic tattoos, also known as \"permanent makeup\"; and medical tattoos.\n\nAccording to George Orwell, coal miners could develop characteristic tattoos owing to coal dust getting into wounds. This can also occur with substances like gunpowder. Similarly, a traumatic tattoo occurs when a substance such as asphalt is rubbed into a wound as the result of some kind of accident or trauma. These are particularly difficult to remove as they tend to be spread across several layers of skin, and scarring or permanent discoloration is almost unavoidable depending on the location. An amalgam tattoo is when amalgam particles are implanted in to the soft tissues of the mouth, usually the gums, during dental filling placement or removal; another example of such accidental tattoos is the result of a deliberate or accidental stabbing with a pencil or pen, leaving graphite or ink beneath the skin.\n\nMany tattoos serve as rites of passage, marks of status and rank, symbols of religious and spiritual devotion, decorations for bravery, sexual lures and marks of fertility, pledges of love, amulets and talismans, protection, and as punishment, like the marks of outcasts, slaves and convicts. The symbolism and impact of tattoos varies in different places and cultures. Tattoos may show how a person feels about a relative (commonly mother/father or daughter/son) or about an unrelated person. Today, people choose to be tattooed for artistic, cosmetic, sentimental/memorial, religious, and magical reasons, and to symbolize their belonging to or identification with particular groups, including criminal gangs (see criminal tattoos) or a particular ethnic group or law-abiding subculture. Some Māori still choose to wear intricate moko on their faces. In Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand, the yantra tattoo is used for protection against evil and to increase luck. Text-based tattoos including quotes, lyrics, personal mottos or scripture are popular in western culture. As an example some Christians might have a Psalm or verse from the Bible tattooed on their body. Popular verses include John 3:16, Philippians 4:13, and Psalms 23.\n\nExtensive decorative tattooing is common among members of traditional freak shows and by performance artists who follow in their tradition.\n\nPeople have also been forcibly tattooed.\n\nA well-known example is the Nazi practice of forcibly tattooing Nazi concentration camp inmates with identification numbers during The Holocaust as part of the Nazis' identification system, beginning in fall 1941. The Nazis' SS introduced the practice at Auschwitz concentration camp in order to identify the bodies of registered prisoners in the concentration camps. During registration, the Nazis would pierce the outlines of the serial-number digits onto the prisoners' arms. Of the Nazi concentration camps, only Auschwitz put tattoos on inmates. The tattoo was the prisoner's camp number, sometimes with a special symbol added: some Jews had a triangle, and Romani had the letter \"Z\" (from German \"Zigeuner\" for \"Gypsy\"). In May 1944, the Jewish men received the letters \"A\" or \"B\" to indicate particular series of numbers. For unknown reasons, this number series for women never began again with the \"B\" series after they had reached the number limit of 20,000 for the \"A\" series. The practice continued until the last days of Auschwitz.\n\nTattoos have also been used for identification in other ways. As early as the Zhou, Chinese authorities would employ facial tattoos as a punishment for certain crimes or to mark prisoners or slaves. During the Roman Empire, Roman soldiers were required by law to have identifying tattoos on their hands in order to make desertion difficult. Gladiators and slaves were likewise tattooed: exported slaves were tattooed with the words \"tax paid\", and it was a common practice to tattoo \"Stop me, I'm a runaway\" on their foreheads. Owing to the Biblical strictures against the practice, Emperor Constantine I banned tattooing the face around AD 330, and the Second Council of Nicaea banned all body markings as a pagan practice in AD 787.\n\nIn the period of early contact between the Māori and Europeans, the Maori people hunted and decapitated each other for their moko tattoos, which they traded for European items including axes and firearms. Moko tattoos were facial designs worn to indicate lineage, social position, and status within the tribe. The tattoo art was a sacred marker of identity among the Maori and also referred to as a vehicle for storing one's tapu, or spiritual being, in the afterlife.\nTattoos are sometimes used by forensic pathologists to help them identify burned, putrefied, or mutilated bodies. As tattoo pigment lies encapsulated deep in the skin, tattoos are not easily destroyed even when the skin is burned.\n\nTattoos are also placed on animals, though rarely for decorative reasons. Pets, show animals, thoroughbred horses, and livestock are sometimes tattooed with identification and other marks. Tattooing with a 'slap mark' on the shoulder or on the ear is the standard identification method in commercial pig farming. Branding is used for similar reasons and is often performed without anesthesia, but is different from tattooing as no ink or dye is inserted during the process, the mark instead being caused by permanent scarring of the skin. Pet dogs and cats are sometimes tattooed with a serial number (usually in the ear, or on the inner thigh) via which their owners can be identified. However, the use of a microchip has become an increasingly popular choice and since 2016 is a legal requirement for all 8.5 million pet dogs in the UK.\n\nThe cosmetic surgery industry continues to see a trend of increased popularity for both surgical and noninvasive procedures. When used as a form of cosmetics, tattooing includes permanent makeup and hiding or neutralizing skin discolorations. Permanent makeup is the use of tattoos to enhance eyebrows, lips (liner and/or lipstick), eyes (liner), and even moles, usually with natural colors, as the designs are intended to resemble makeup.\n\nA growing trend in the US and UK is to place artistic titoos over the surgical scars of a mastectomy. \"More women are choosing not to reconstruct after a mastectomy and tattoo over the scar tissue instead... The mastectomy tattoo will become just another option for post cancer patients and a truly personal way of regaining control over post cancer bodies and proving once and for all that breast cancer is not just a pink ribbon.\" The tattooing of nipples on reconstructed breasts remains in high demand, however.\n\nFunctional tattoos are used primarily for a purpose other than aesthetics. One such use is to tattoo Alzheimer patients with their name, so they may be easily identified if they go missing.\n\nMedical tattoos are used to ensure instruments are properly located for repeated application of radiotherapy and for the areola in some forms of breast reconstruction. Tattooing has also been used to convey medical information about the wearer (e.g., blood group, medical condition, etc.). Additionally, tattoos are used in skin tones to cover vitiligo, a skin pigmentation disorder.\n\nSS blood group tattoos (German: Blutgruppentätowierung) were worn by members of the Waffen-SS in Nazi Germany during World War II to identify the individual's blood type. After the war, the tattoo was taken to be prima facie, if not perfect, evidence of being part of the Waffen-SS, leading to potential arrest and prosecution. This led a number of Ex-Waffen-SS to shoot themselves through the arm with a gun, removing the tattoo and leaving scars like the ones resulting from pox inoculation, making the removal less obvious.\n\nTattoos were probably also used in ancient medicine as part of the treatment of the patient. In 1898, Daniel Fouquet, a medical doctor, wrote an article on “medical tattooing” practices in Ancient Egypt, in which he describes the tattooed markings on the female mummies found at the Deir el-Bahari site. He speculated that the tattoos and other scarifications observed on the bodies may have served a medicinal or therapeutic purpose: \"The examination of these scars, some white, others blue, leaves in no doubt that they are not, in essence, ornament, but an established treatment for a condition of the pelvis, very probably chronic pelvic peritonitis.\"\n\nPreserved tattoos on ancient mummified human remains reveal that tattooing has been practiced throughout the world for many centuries. The Ainu, an indigenous people of Japan, traditionally had facial tattoos, as did the Austroasians. Today, one can find Atayal, Seediq, Truku, and Saisiyat of Taiwan, Berbers of Tamazgha (North Africa), Yoruba, Fulani and Hausa people of Nigeria, and Māori of New Zealand with facial tattoos. Tattooing was popular among certain ethnic groups in southern China, Polynesia, Africa, Borneo, Cambodia, Europe, Japan, the Mentawai Islands, MesoAmerica, New Zealand, North America and South America, the Philippines, Iron Age Britain, and Taiwan. In 2015, scientific re-assessment of the age of the two oldest known tattooed mummies, identified Ötzi as the oldest currently known example. This body, with 61 tattoos, was found embedded in glacial ice in the Alps, and was dated to 3,250 BC.\nIt is a myth that the modern revival of tattooing stems from Captain James Cook's three voyages to the South Pacific in the late 18th century. Certainly, Cook's voyages and the dissemination of the texts and images from them brought more awareness about tattooing (and, as noted above, imported the word \"tattow\" into Western languages), but Europeans have been tattooed throughout history. On Cook's first voyage in 1768, his science officer and expedition botanist, Sir Joseph Banks, as well as artist Sydney Parkinson and many others of the crew, returned to England with tattoos, although many of these men would have had pre-existing tattoos. Banks was a highly regarded member of the English aristocracy that had acquired his position with Cook by co-financing the expedition with ten thousand pounds, a very large sum at the time. In turn, Cook brought back with him a tattooed Raiatean man, Omai, whom he presented to King George and the English Court. On subsequent voyages other crew members, from officers, such as American John Ledyard, to ordinary seamen, were tattooed. \n\nThe first documented professional tattooist in Britain was established in the port of Liverpool in the 1870s. In Britain tattooing was still largely associated with sailors and the lower or even criminal class, but by the 1870s had become fashionable among some members of the upper classes, including royalty, and in its upmarket form it could be an expensive and sometimes painful process. A marked class division on the acceptability of the practice continued for some time in Britain. Recently a trend has arisen marketed as 'Stick and Poke' tattooing; primitive figures are permanently inscribed by the user himself after he obtains a 'DIY' kit containing needles, ink and a collection of suggestions.\n\nAs most tattoos in the U.S. were done by Polynesian and Japanese amateurs, tattoo artists were in great demand in port cities all over the world, especially by European and American sailors. The first recorded professional tattoo artist in the United States was a German immigrant, Martin Hildebrandt. He opened a shop in New York City in 1846 and quickly became popular during the American Civil War among soldiers and sailors of both Union and Confederate militaries.\n\nHildebrandt began traveling from camp to camp to tattoo soldiers, making his popularity increase, and also giving birth to the tradition of getting tattoos while being an American serviceman. Soon after the Civil War, tattoos became fashionable among upper-class young adults. This trend lasted until the beginning of World War I. The invention of the electric tattoo machine caused popularity of tattoos among the wealthy to drop off. The machine made the tattooing procedure both much easier and cheaper, thus, eliminating the status symbol tattoos previously held, as they were now affordable for all socioeconomic classes. The status symbol of a tattoo shifted from a representation of wealth, to a mark typically seen on rebels and criminals. Despite this change, tattoos remained popular among military servicemen, and the tradition continues today.\n\nMany studies have been done of the tattooed population and society's view of tattoos. In June 2006, the \"Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology\" published the results of a telephone survey of 2004. It found that 36% of Americans ages 18–29, 24% of those 30–40, and 15% of those 41–51 had a tattoo. In September 2006, the Pew Research Center conducted a telephone survey that found that 36% of Americans ages 18–25, 40% of those 26–40 and 10% of those 41–64 had a tattoo. They concluded that Generation X and Generation Y are not afraid to express themselves through their appearance, and tattoos are the most popular form of self-expression. In January 2008, a survey conducted online by Harris Interactive estimated that 14% of all adults in the United States have a tattoo, slightly down from 2003, when 16% had a tattoo. Among age groups, 9% of those ages 18–24, 32% of those 25–29, 25% of those 30–39 and 12% of those 40–49 have tattoos, as do 8% of those 50–64. Men are slightly more likely to have a tattoo than women.\n\nRichmond, Virginia, has been cited as one of the most tattooed cities in the United States. That distinction led the Valentine Richmond History Center to create an online exhibit titled \"History, Ink: The Tattoo Archive Project.\" The introduction to the exhibit notes, \"In the past, western culture associated tattoos with those individuals who lived on the edge of society; however, today they are recognized as a legitimate art form and widely accepted in mainstream culture.\"\n\nSince the 1970s, tattoos have become a mainstream part of Western fashion, common among all genders, to all economic classes, and to age groups from the later teen years to middle age. For many young Americans, the tattoo has taken on a decidedly different meaning than for previous generations. The tattoo has \"undergone dramatic redefinition\" and has shifted from a form of deviance to an acceptable form of expression.\n\nProtection papers were used by American sailors to prevent themselves from being taken off American ships and impressed into the Royal Navy. These were simple documents that described the sailor as being an American sailor. Many of the protection certificates were so general, and it was so easy to abuse the system, that many impressment officers of the Royal Navy paid no attention to them. \"In applying for a duplicate Seaman's Protection Certificate in 1817, James Francis stated that he 'had a protection granted him by the Collector of this Port on or about 12 March 1806 which was torn up and destroyed by a British Captain when at sea.'\" One way of making them more specific was to describe a tattoo, which is highly personal, and thus use that description to identify the seaman. As a result, many of the later certificates carried information about tattoos and scars, as well as other specific information. This also perhaps led to an increase and proliferation of tattoos among American seamen. \"Frequently their 'protection papers' made reference to tattoos, clear evidence that individual was a seafaring man; rarely did members of the general public adorn themselves with tattoos.\"\n\n\"In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, tattoos were as much about self-expression as they were about having a unique way to identify a sailor's body should he be lost at sea or impressed by the British navy. The best source for early American tattoos is the protection papers issued following a 1796 congressional act to safeguard American seamen from impressment. These proto-passports catalogued tattoos alongside birthmarks, scars, race, and height. Using simple techniques and tools, tattoo artists in the early republic typically worked on board ships using anything available as pigments, even gunpowder and urine. Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols.\"\n\nBecause these protection papers were used to define freemen and citizenship, many black sailors and other men also used them to show that they were freemen if they were stopped by officials or slave catchers. They also called them \"free papers\" because they certified their non-slave status. Many of the freed blacks used descriptions of tattoos for identification purposes on their freedom papers.\n\nTattooing involves the placement of pigment into the skin's dermis, the layer of dermal tissue underlying the epidermis. After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a homogenized damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the immune system's phagocytes to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin granulation tissue forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by collagen growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within fibroblasts, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, but in the long term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.\nSome tribal cultures traditionally created tattoos by cutting designs into the skin and rubbing the resulting wound with ink, ashes or other agents; some cultures continue this practice, which may be an adjunct to scarification. Some cultures create tattooed marks by hand-tapping the ink into the skin using sharpened sticks or animal bones (made like needles) with clay formed disks or, in modern times, needles.\n\nThe most common method of tattooing in modern times is the electric tattoo machine, which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle or a group of needles that are soldered onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit. The unit rapidly and repeatedly drives the needles in and out of the skin, usually 80 to 150 times a second. The needles are single-use needles that come packaged individually.\n\nTattooing is regulated in many countries because of the associated health risks to client and practitioner, specifically local infections and virus transmission. Disposable plastic aprons and eye protection can be worn depending on the risk of blood or other secretions splashing into the eyes or clothing of the tattoist. Hand hygiene, assessment of risks and appropriate disposal of all sharp objects and materials contaminated with blood are crucial areas. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. All equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use. It is good practice to provide clients with a printed consent form that outlines risks and complications as well as instructions for after care.\n\nThe Government of Meiji Japan had outlawed tattoos in the 19th century, a prohibition that stood for 70 years before being repealed in 1948. As of 6 June 2012 all new tattoos are forbidden for employees of the city of Osaka. Existing tattoos are required to be covered with proper clothing. The regulations were added to Osaka's ethical codes, and employees with tattoos were encouraged to have them removed. This was done because of the strong connection of tattoos with the yakuza, or Japanese organized crime, after an Osaka official in February 2012 threatened a schoolchild by showing his tattoo.\n\nTattoos had negative connotations in historical China, where criminals often had been marked by tattooing. The association of tattoos with criminals was transmitted from China to influence Japan. Today, tattoos have remained a taboo in Chinese society.\n\nThe Romans tattooed criminals and slaves, and in the 19th century released US convicts, Australian convicts, and British army deserters were identified by tattoos. Prisoners in Nazi concentration camps were tattooed with an identification number. Today, many prison inmates still tattoo themselves as an indication of time spent in prison.\n\nNative Americans also used tattoos to represent their tribe. Catholic Croats of Bosnia used religious Christian tattooing, especially of children and women, for protection against conversion to Islam during the Ottoman rule in the Balkans.\n\nTattoos are strongly empirically associated with deviance, personality disorders, and criminality. Although the general acceptance of tattoos is on the rise in Western society, they still carry a heavy stigma among certain social groups. Tattoos are generally considered an important part of the culture of the Russian mafia.\n\nCurrent cultural understandings of tattoos in Europe and North America have been greatly influenced by long-standing stereotypes based on deviant social groups in the 19th and 20th centuries. Particularly in North America tattoos have been associated with stereotypes, folklore, and racism. Not until the 1960s and 1970s did people associate tattoos with such societal outcasts as bikers and prisoners. Today, in the United States many prisoners and criminal gangs use distinctive tattoos to indicate facts about their criminal behavior, prison sentences, and organizational affiliation. A teardrop tattoo, for example, can be symbolic of murder, or each tear represents the death of a friend. At the same time, members of the U.S. military have an equally well-established and longstanding history of tattooing to indicate military units, battles, kills, etc., an association that remains widespread among older Americans. In Japan tattoos are associated with yakuza criminal groups but there are non-yakuza groups such as Fukushi Masaichi's tattoo association that sought to preserve the skins of dead Japanese who have extensive tattoos. Tattooing is also common in the British Armed Forces. Depending on vocation tattoos are accepted in a number of professions in America. Companies across many fields are increasingly focused on diversity and inclusion.\n\nIn Britain, there is evidence of women with tattoos, concealed by their clothing, throughout the 20th century, and records of women tattoists such as Jessie Knight from the 1920s. A study of \"at-risk\" (as defined by school absenteeism and truancy) adolescent girls showed a positive correlation between body modification and negative feelings towards the body and low self-esteem; however, the study also demonstrated that a strong motive for body modification is the search for \"self and attempts to attain mastery and control over the body in an age of increasing alienation\". The prevalence of women in the tattoo industry in the 21st century, along with larger numbers of women bearing tattoos, appears to be changing negative perceptions.\n\nFormer sailor Rowland Hussey Macy, who formed Macy's department stores, used a red star tattoo that he had on his hand for the store's logo.\n\nTattoos have also been used in marketing and advertising with companies paying people to have logos of brands like HBO, Red Bull, ASOS.com, and Sailor Jerry's rum tattooed in their bodies. This practice is known as \"skinvertising\".\n\nB.T.'s Smokehouse, a barbecue restaurant located in Massachusetts, offered customers free meals for life if they had the logo of the establishment tattooed on a visible part of their bodies. Nine people took the business up on the offer.\n\nBecause it requires breaking the skin barrier, tattooing carries health risks including infection and allergic reactions. Tattooing can be uncomfortable to excruciating depending on the area and can result in the person fainting. Modern tattooists reduce risks by following universal precautions working with single-use items and sterilizing their equipment after each use. Many jurisdictions require that tattooists have blood-borne pathogen training such as that provided through the Red Cross and OSHA. As of 2009 (in the United States) there have been no reported cases of HIV contracted from tattoos.\n\nIn amateur tattooing, such as that practiced in prisons, however, there is an elevated risk of infection. Infections that can theoretically be transmitted by the use of unsterilized tattoo equipment or contaminated ink include surface infections of the skin, fungal infections, some forms of hepatitis, herpes simplex virus, HIV, staph, tetanus, and tuberculosis.\n\nTattoo inks have been described as \"remarkably nonreactive histologically\". However, cases of allergic reactions to tattoo inks, particularly certain colors, have been medically documented. This is sometimes due to the presence of nickel in an ink pigment, which triggers a common metal allergy. Occasionally, when a blood vessel is punctured during the tattooing procedure, a bruise/hematoma may appear.\n\nCertain colours - red or similar colours such as purple, pink, and orange - tend to cause more problems and damage compared to other colours. Red ink has even caused skin and flesh damages so severe that the amputation of a leg or an arm has been necessary. If part of a tattoo (especially if red) begins to cause even minor troubles, like becoming itchy or worse, lumpy, then Danish experts strongly suggest to remove the red parts.\n\nIn 2017, researchers from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in France say the chemicals in tattoo ink can travel in the bloodstream and accumulate in the lymph nodes, obstructing their ability to fight infections. However, the authors noted in their paper that most tattooed individuals including the donors analyzed do not suffer from chronic inflammation.\n\nWhile tattoos are considered permanent, it is sometimes possible to remove them, fully or partially, with laser treatments. Typically, black and some colored inks can be removed more completely than inks of other colors. The expense and pain associated with removing tattoos are typically greater than the expense and pain associated with applying them. Pre-laser tattoo removal methods include dermabrasion, salabrasion (scrubbing the skin with salt), cryosurgery, and excision—which is sometimes still used along with skin grafts for larger tattoos. These older methods, however, have been nearly completely replaced by laser removal treatment options.\n\nA temporary tattoo is a non-permanent image on the skin resembling a permanent tattoo. Temporary tattoos can be drawn, painted, airbrushed or needled as a permanent tattoo with an ink which can be dissolved in blood within 6 months of art as a form of body painting.\n\nDecal (press-on) temporary tattoos are used to decorate any part of the body. They may last for a day or for more than a week.\n\nFoil temporary tattoos are a variation of decal-style temporary tattoos, printed using a foil stamping technique instead of using ink. The foil design is printed as a mirror image in order to be viewed in the right direction once it is applied to the skin. Each metallic tattoo is protected by a transparent protective film.\n\nAlthough they have become more popular and usually require a greater investment, airbrush temporary tattoos are less likely to achieve the look of a permanent tattoo, and may not last as long as press-on temporary tattoos. An artist sprays on airbrush tattoos using a stencil with alcohol-based, FDA-approved cosmetic inks. Like decal tattoos, airbrush temporary tattoos also are easily removed with rubbing alcohol or baby oil.\n\nAnother tattoo alternative is henna-based tattoos, which generally contain no additives. Henna is a plant-derived substance which is painted on the skin, staining it a reddish-orange-to-brown color. Because of the semi-permanent nature of henna, they lack the realistic colors typical of decal temporary tattoos. Due to the time-consuming application process, it is a relatively poor option for children. If you do choose henna temporary tattoos, ensure that they are pure henna. Dermatological publications report that allergic reactions to natural henna are very rare and the product is generally considered safe for skin application. Serious problems can occur, however, from the use of henna with certain additives. The FDA and medical journals report that painted black henna temporary tattoos are especially dangerous. Black Henna or Pre-Mixed Henna Temporary Tattoos May Be Harmful - see below for safety information.\n\nDecal temporary tattoos, when legally sold in the United States, have had their color additives approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as cosmetics --- the FDA has determined these colorants are safe for “direct dermal contact.” While the FDA has received some accounts of minor skin irritation, including redness and swelling, from this type of temporary tattoo, the agency has found these symptoms to be “child specific” and not significant enough to support warnings to the public. Unapproved pigments, however, which are sometimes used by non-US manufacturers, can provoke allergic reactions in anyone. Understanding the types of temporary tattoos available to consumers, knowing where they are manufactured, and ensuring they come from a reliable source are keys to determining whether temporary tattoos are safe.\n\nThe types of airbrush paints manufactured for crafting, creating art or decorating clothing should never be used for tattooing. These paints are not approved for direct contact with skin, and can be allergenic or toxic. Always ask the airbrush tattoo artist what kind of ink he or she is using and whether it meets FDA approval.\n\nThe FDA regularly issues warnings to consumers about avoiding any temporary tattoos labeled as black henna or pre-mixed henna as these may contain potentially harmful ingredients including silver nitrate, carmine, pyrogallol, disperse orange dye and chromium. Black henna gets its color from paraphenylenediamine (PPD), a textile dye approved by the FDA for human use only in hair coloring. In Canada, the use of PPD on the skin, including hair dye, is banned. Research has linked these and other ingredients to a range of health problems including allergic reactions, chronic inflammatory reactions, and late-onset allergic reactions to related clothing and hairdressing dyes. They can cause these reactions long after application. Neither black henna nor pre-mixed henna are approved for cosmetic use by the FDA.\n\nJudaism generally prohibits tattoos among its adherents based on the commandments in Leviticus 19. Jews tend to believe this commandment only applies to Jews and not to gentiles.\nThere is no specific rule in the New Testament prohibiting tattoos and most Christian denominations believe the laws in Leviticus are outdated as well as believing the commandment only applied to the Israelites, not to the gentiles. While most Christian groups tolerate tattoos, some Evangelical and fundamentalist Protestant denominations do believe the commandment does apply today for Christians and believe it is a sin to get one.\n\nMany Coptic Christians in Egypt take a cross tattoo in their right wrist to differ from the Muslims.\n\nTattoos are considered to be haram in Sunni Islam, based on rulings from scholars and passages in the Hadith. Shia Islam does not entirely prohibit tattooing, although it may be looked down upon in Shia communities.\n\nAnthropological\n\nPopular and artistic\n\nMedical\n\n",
                "Process of tattooing\n\nThe process of tattooing involves the insertion of pigment into the skin's dermis. Traditionally, tattooing often involved rubbing pigment into cuts. Modern tattooing almost always requires the use of a tattoo machine and often procedures and accessories to reduce the risk to human health.\n\nTattooing involves the placement of pigment into the skin's dermis, the layer of dermal tissue underlying the epidermis. After initial injection, pigment is dispersed throughout a homogenized damaged layer down through the epidermis and upper dermis, in both of which the presence of foreign material activates the immune system's phagocytes to engulf the pigment particles. As healing proceeds, the damaged epidermis flakes away (eliminating surface pigment) while deeper in the skin granulation tissue forms, which is later converted to connective tissue by collagen growth. This mends the upper dermis, where pigment remains trapped within fibroblasts, ultimately concentrating in a layer just below the dermis/epidermis boundary. Its presence there is stable, but in the long term (decades) the pigment tends to migrate deeper into the dermis, accounting for the degraded detail of old tattoos.\n\nSome tribal cultures traditionally created tattoos by cutting designs into the skin and rubbing the resulting wound with ink, ashes or other agents; some cultures continue this practice, which may be an adjunct to scarification. Some cultures create tattooed marks by hand-tapping the ink into the skin using sharpened sticks or animal bones (made like needles) with clay formed disks or, in modern times, needles. Traditional Japanese tattoos (\"irezumi\") are still \"hand-poked,\" that is, the ink is inserted beneath the skin using non-electrical, hand-made and hand held tools with needles of sharpened bamboo or steel. This method is known as \"tebori\".\n\nTraditional Hawaiian hand-tapped tattoos are experiencing a renaissance, after the practice was nearly extinguished in the years following Western contact. The process involves lengthy protocols and prayers and is considered a sacred rite more than an application of artwork. The tattooist chooses the design, rather than the wearer, based on genealogical information. Each design is symbolic of the wearer's personal responsibility and role in the community. Tools are hand-carved from bone or tusk without the use of metal.\n\nThe most common method of tattooing in modern times is the electric tattoo machine, which inserts ink into the skin via a single needle or a group of needles that are soldered onto a bar, which is attached to an oscillating unit. The unit rapidly and repeatedly drives the needles in and out of the skin, usually 80 to 150 times a second. This modern procedure is ordinarily sanitary. The needles are single-use needles that come packaged individually. The tattoo artist must wash his or her hands and must also wash the area that will be tattooed. Gloves must be worn at all times and the wound must be wiped frequently with a wet disposable towel of some kind. The equipment must be sterilized in a certified autoclave before and after every use.\n\nPrices for this service vary widely globally and locally, depending on the complexity of the tattoo, the skill and expertise of the artist, the attitude of the customer, the costs of running a business, the economics of supply and demand, etc. The time it takes to get a tattoo is in proportion with its size and complexity. A small one of simple design might take 15 minutes, whereas an elaborate sleeve tattoo or back piece requires multiple sessions that may consist of several hours at a time ranging over months or even years.\n\nIn 1891 the first electric tattoo needle was invented in New York City by modifying Thomas Edison's electric engraving pen. This made the process cheaper and faster; it was taken up by the poor and abandoned by the rich. O'Reilly's machine was based on the rotary technology of the electric engraving device invented by Thomas Edison. Modern tattoo machines use electromagnetic coils. The first coil machine was patented by Thomas Riley in London in 1891, using a single coil. The first twin-coil machine, the predecessor of the modern configuration, was invented by another Englishman, Alfred Charles South of London, in 1899.\n\nAnother tattoo machine was developed 1970-1978 by the German tattoo artists Horst Heinrich Streckenbach (1929–2001) and Manfred Kohrs.\n\nEarly tattoo inks were obtained directly from nature and were extremely limited in pigment variety. In ancient Hawaii, for example, kukui nut ash was blended with coconut oil to produce an ebony ink. Today, an almost unlimited number of colors and shades of tattoo ink are mass-produced and sold to parlors worldwide. Tattoo artists commonly mix these inks to create their own unique pigments.\n\nA wide range of dyes and pigments can be used in tattoos, from inorganic materials like titanium dioxide and iron oxides to carbon black, azo dyes, and acridine, quinoline, phthalocyanine and naphthol derivatives, dyes made from ash, and other mixtures. Iron oxide pigments are used in greater extent in cosmetic tattooing.\n\nModern tattooing inks are carbon-based pigments that have uses outside of commercial tattoo applications.\n\nConcern has been expressed over the interaction between magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedures and tattoo pigments, some of which contain trace metals. The magnetic fields produced by MRI machines interact with these metals, including nonferrous metal particles, and while rare, are capable of causing first-degree or second-degree burns or distortions in the image. The type and density of the ink as well as shape of the tattoo may increase the risk, particularly if the shape approximates an RF pick-up loop. The television show \"MythBusters\" tested the hypothesis, and found a slight interaction between commonly used tattoo inks and MRI. The interaction was stronger with inks containing high levels of iron oxide.\n\nThe properly equipped tattoo studio will use biohazard containers for objects that have come into contact with blood or bodily fluids, sharps containers for old needles, and an autoclave for sterilizing tools. Certain jurisdictions also require studios by law to have a sink in the work area supplied with both hot and cold water.\n\nProper hygiene requires a body modification artist to wash his or her hands before starting to prepare a client for the stencil, between clients, and at any other time when cross contamination can occur. The use of single use gloves is also mandatory and disposed after each stage of tattooing. The same gloves should not be used to clean the tattoo station, tattoo the client, and clean the tattoo.\n\nIn some states and countries it is illegal to tattoo a minor even with parental consent, and (except in the case of medical tattoos) it is forbidden to tattoo impaired persons, people with contraindicated skin conditions, those who are pregnant or nursing, those incapable of consent due to mental incapacity, or those under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.\n\nBefore the tattooing begins the client is asked to approve the final position of the applied stencil. After approval is given the artist will open new, sterile needle packages in front of the client, and always use new, sterile, or sterile disposable instruments and supplies, and fresh ink for each session (loaded into disposable ink caps which are discarded after each client). Also, all areas which may be touched with contaminated gloves will be wrapped in clear plastic to prevent cross-contamination. Equipment that cannot be autoclaved (such as counter tops, machines, and furniture) will be wiped with an approved disinfectant.\n\nMembership in professional organizations or certificates of appreciation/achievement generally help artists to be aware of the latest trends. Most tattooists do not belong to any association.\n\nWhile specific requirements to become a tattooist vary between jurisdictions, many mandate only formal training in blood borne pathogens and cross contamination. The local department of health regulates tattoo studios in many jurisdictions. For example, according to the health departments in Oregon and Hawaii, tattoo artists in these states are required to take and pass a test ascertaining their knowledge of health and safety precautions as well as the current state regulations. Performing a tattoo in Oregon without a proper and current license or in an unlicensed facility is a felony offense. Tattooing was legalized in New York City in 1997, in Massachusetts in 2000 and Oklahoma between 2002 and 2006.\n\nTattoo artists and people with tattoos vary widely in their preferred methods of caring for new tattoos. Some artists recommend keeping a new tattoo wrapped for the first 24 hours while others suggest removing temporary bandaging after two hours or less to allow the skin to breathe. Many tattooists advise against allowing too much contact with hot tub, pool water or soaking in a tub for the first two weeks to prevent the tattoo ink from washing out. In contrast other artists suggest that a new tattoo be bathed in very hot water early.\n\nGeneral consensus for care advises against removing the flakes or scab that may form on a new tattoo, and avoiding exposing one's tattoo to the sun for extended periods for at least 3 weeks; both of these can contribute to fading of the image. It is agreed that a new tattoo needs to be kept clean. Various products may be recommended for application to the skin, ranging from those intended for the treatment of cuts, burns and scrapes, to panthenol, cocoa butter, A&D, hemp, lanolin, or salves. Oil based ointments are almost always recommended for use on very thin layers due to their inability to evaporate and therefore over-hydrate the already perforated skin. Recent scientific studies have demonstrated that wounds that are kept moist heal faster than wounds healing under dry conditions. In recent years specific commercial products have been developed for tattoo aftercare. Although opinions about these products vary, soap and warm water work well to keep a tattoo clean and free from infection.\n\nThe amount of ink that remains in the skin throughout the healing process determines how the final tattoo will look. If a tattoo becomes infected or the flakes fall off too soon (e.g., if it absorbs too much water and sloughs off early or is picked or scraped off) then the ink will not be properly fixed in the skin and the final image will be negatively affected.\n"

                "The Walking Dead (comic book)\n\nThe Walking Dead is an ongoing black-and-white comic book series created by writer Robert Kirkman and artist Tony Moore. It focuses on Rick Grimes, a Kentucky deputy who is shot in the line of duty and awakens from a coma in a zombie apocalypse that has resulted in a state-wide quarantine. After joining with other survivors, including his loved ones, he gradually takes on the role of leader of a community as it struggles to survive the zombie apocalypse.\n\nFirst issued in 2003 by publisher Image Comics, the comic is written by Kirkman with art by Moore (issues No. 1–6) and Charlie Adlard (issue No. 7 onward). Moore continued to do the covers through issue No. 24.\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" received the 2007 and 2010 Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series at San Diego Comic-Con International. The series was adapted into the AMC television series \"The Walking Dead\", which premiered in 2010. The television program loosely follows the storyline of the comic book. The franchise has also spawned multiple additional media properties, including video games (such as \"The Walking Dead\" video game), a companion television series (\"Fear the Walking Dead\"), webisode series (\"\", \"\", and \"\"), and various additional publications, including novels (\"\").\n\nThe original pitch by Kirkman and Moore was for a followup to George A. Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\", with the series taking place in the 1960s. Image Comics co-founder Jim Valentino suggested using an original concept instead so the creators would own the property outright. The revised pitch became \"The Walking Dead.\"\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" debuted in 2003, published by Image Comics, with art by Tony Moore for the first six issues and Cliff Rathburn shading the art after issue five. Charlie Adlard took over as artist on issue #7, after he was approached by Kirkman. Moore also did the cover art for the first twenty-four issues and the first four trade paperbacks. The remainder were done by Adlard.\n\nWhen the television series premiered in October 2010, Image Comics announced \"The Walking Dead Weekly\". The first 52 issues of the series began to be reprinted on January 5, 2011, with one issue per week for a year.\n\nThe series is periodically re-published in trade paperbacks which contain six issues each, hardcover books with twelve issues and occasional bonus material, omnibus editions of twenty-four issues, and compendium editions of forty-eight issues.\n\nVolume 1: Days Gone Bye (Issues 1–6)\nVolume 2: Miles Behind Us (Issues 7–12)\nVolume 3: Safety Behind Bars (Issues 13–18)\nVolume 4: The Heart's Desire (Issues 19–24)\nVolume 5: The Best Defense (Issues 25–30)\nVolume 6: This Sorrowful Life (Issues 31–36)\nVolume 7: The Calm Before (Issues 37–42)\nVolume 8: Made To Suffer (Issues 43–48)\nVolume 9: Here We Remain (Issues 49–54)\nVolume 10: What We Become (Issues 55–60)\nVolume 11: Fear The Hunters (Issues 61–66)\nVolume 12: Life Among Them (Issues 67–72)\nVolume 13: Too Far Gone (Issues 73–78)\nVolume 14: No Way Out (Issues 79–84)\nVolume 15: We Find Ourselves (Issues 85–90)\nVolume 16: A Larger World (Issues 91–96)\nVolume 17: Something To Fear (Issues 97–102)\nVolume 18: What Comes After (Issues 103–108)\nVolume 19: March To War (Issues 109–114)\nVolume 20: All Out War – Part One (Issues 115–120)\nVolume 21: All Out War – Part Two (Issues 121–126)\nVolume 22: A New Beginning (Issues 127–132)\nVolume 23: Whispers Into Screams (Issues 133–138)\nVolume 24: Life And Death (Issues 139–144)\nVolume 25: No Turning Back (Issues 145–150)\nVolume 26: Call To Arms (Issues 151–156)\nVolume 27: The Whisperer War (Issues 157–162)\nVolume 28: A Certain Doom (Issues 163–168)\nVolume 29: Lines We Cross (Issues 169–174)\nVolume 30: New World Order (Issues 175-180)\n\nRick Grimes is the main character, a deputy who is comatose when the zombie apocalypse begins. With his wife Lori and son Carl, he joins with groups other survivors. He is joined by former best friend Shane, who secretly has a sexual relationship with Lori. The group consists of firm clerk and college graduate Andrea and her sister Amy, a mechanic named Jim, car salesman Dale, shoe salesman Allen and his wife, Donna as well as their children, Ben and Billy. Lori and Carl form friendships with other survivors such as Carol and Sophia.\n\nAfter leaving the camp, Rick gains a right-hand man and close friendship in Tyreese, who is accompanied by his daughter and her boyfriend. They soon find a farm run by Hershel Greene. Among Hershel's seven children is Maggie Greene, who forms a relationship with Glenn. As the group settle at a prison, they become conflicted with a group of surviving prisoners. Otis meets a katana-wielding survivor named Michonne, who is brought into the group, but struggles to acclimate, facing her own demons. Michonne, Rick and Glenn are later held in captivity by The Governor, a leader of a town called Woodbury who plan to take over the prison. Other Woodbury residents include Alice Warren, who changes sides to Rick's group and delivers Lori's baby, Bob Stookey, an army medic responsible for saving The Governor's life and Lilly, one of The Governor's soldiers.\n\nAfter the prison assault, the remaining group survivors regroup at Hershel's farm, and meet Abraham Ford, Eugene Porter and Rosita Espinosa. The group travel to Washington DC where they are hunted by Chris, encounter Gabriel Stokes, a priest, and are then recruited by Aaron and his boyfriend, Eric to join the Alexandria Safe-Zone, run by congressman, Douglas Monroe. Among the residents are Heath and Dr. Denise Cloyd, who quickly become close allies to the core group, and eventually the conflicted Nicholas. Douglas' son, Spencer tries to form a relationship with Andrea. Rick falls in love with Jessie Anderson, an abused wife. Abraham forms a relationship with Holly, a member of the construction crew. A group of men, known as The Scavengers, tries to conquer Alexandria; the fight attracts a pack of walkers that invades the safe zone, leading to the death of a lot of Alexandrians. Later, the safe zone starts a trading network with the Hilltop Colony, with help from its scout Paul \"Jesus\" Monroe. However, their safety is again threatened by the psychopathic Negan and his group known as The Saviors who reside in a factory. One of the Saviors, Dwight becomes an ally with the communities. The Hilltop and Alexandria join with The Kingdom run by King Ezekiel in a war against the Saviors.\n\nAfter the war, newcomers such as Magna and Dante are introduced into the series. Another community out at sea is established, as well as safety perimeters across the DC area, which is violated by the presence of the Whisperers, a tribe of people disguised as the dead who have rejected the notion of re-establishing civilization. The leader, Alpha, antagonizes Rick as her daughter, Lydia, forms a sexual relationship with Carl. When Alpha's second in command, Beta, takes leadership of the group, he declares war against the communities.\n\nThe \"zombie idea\" developed by George Romero does not exist in The Walking Dead alternate universe; hence, of all the myriad terms used to describe the undead by different communities throughout the show, the word \"zombie\" has been deliberately avoided. While it has been used extremely rarely in the comics, it has never been used in the show.\n\nRick's group classifies the undead as either walkers, roamers or lurkers, the former being more likely to venture toward a loud noise in search of human prey. Other names have been used by characters in the series, including biters and stinkers. The undead follow and mimic each other, which can result in enormous hordes travelling together, \"walking nonstop, following a sound they've all forgotten,\" as Abraham puts it.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim, winning the Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series in 2010 and prompting Eric Sunde of IGN comics to call it \"one of the best monthly comics available\". Among its fans are author Max Brooks. Because of the popularity of the series, which increased considerably when it was adapted into a television series of the same name, artist Tony Moore's original artwork for the series' early issues has gone up in value; on the March 28, 2013 episode of the VH1 reality television series \"For What It's Worth\", Moore's original artwork for Page 7 of issue #1 was professionally appraised to be worth $20,000.\n\nAMC picked up the rights to produce a show based on the comic in 2009. It ordered a pilot episode on January 21, 2010 and began filming on May 15, 2010. The series premiered on October 31, 2010 with high ratings. On November 8, 2010, after broadcasting two episodes, AMC renewed \"The Walking Dead\" for a second season of 13 episodes, which began on October 16, 2011. The TV show is loosely inspired by the comic, introducing new characters and deviating from the comic in certain plot points.\n\nThe fifth season premiered on October 12, 2014, with Scott M. Gimple as the show's third showrunner. Gimple has said that he would stay closer in line to the comic book series events \"as much as possible\", but ultimately remix stories with certain characters, referencing original characters introduced to the show and deceased characters alive in the comic book as a reason for this. Robert Kirkman himself has mentioned that the series will follow much closer to the comic series with Gimple's run.\n\nA companion television series, titled \"Fear The Walking Dead\", debuted on AMC on August 23, 2015. The series features new original characters, and it is set in the city of Los Angeles, California starting prior to the zombie apocalypse. It explores these new characters as the apocalypse begins. The series was created by Robert Kirkman and Dave Erickson, with Erickson serving as showrunner for the series. AMC ordered the series for a two-season commitment, with the first season consisting of six episodes.\n\nAMC released an animated film of the first part of Issue No. 1 of the comic with animation by Juice Films, voice acting by Phil LaMarr and art by Tony Moore.\n\nOn February 18, 2011, Telltale Games announced plans to create an episodic video game based on the series, which was scheduled to debut in fall 2011 and was released worldwide in April 2012. \"\" consists of five episodes, released between April and November 2012. Additional downloadable content, \"400 Days\", was released in July 2013. Kirkman has said that, unlike typical zombie games such as \"Left 4 Dead\", \"it [focuses] more on characterization and emotion than action\".\n\nThe first episode of the sequel, \"\", was released in December 2013 with episode 2 being released in March 2014, episode 3 in May 2014, episode 4 in July 2014, and episode 5 in August 2014.\n\n\"The Walking Dead: The Game\" received widespread critical acclaim, with reviews giving praise for the emotion and characters of the plot. It received many awards, including over 5000 Game of the year awards\n\nIn January 2016, the Kings of War creator Mantic Games announced plans to release a tabletop miniature wargame based on The Walking Dead, named \"The Walking Dead: All Out War\". The miniatures game was funded through the popular crowdfunding site Kickstarter. This product is available for order and first began shipping to backers on 7 November 2016.\n\nA series of novels based on the comics, written by Robert Kirkman and Jay Bonansinga, were released between 2011 and 2014 focusing on the antagonist \"The Governor\". Taking place in the initial outbreak, the books chronicle his experiences from surviving in the newly ravaged world, to the establishment of himself as leader of Woodbury, and finally tying up the conclusion to the prison arc storyline in the comics.\n\nFollowing the , Bonansinga continued the \"Walking Dead\" novels in \"Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead: Descent\".\n\nThe series has so far been assembled into the following collections:\n\nThe trade paperbacks collect six issues each, but contain only the story and none of the original cover art from the comics. Each paperback follows the convention of having a three-word title. The zombies in the cover art for each paperback form part of a larger image if placed end to end.\n\nAll hardcovers contain the contents of the comics, including the covers, and in some cases bonus material. The books' trim size is larger than the paperbacks. Each hardcover contains two story arcs from the series. Signed versions of the books are available, each limited to 310 pieces.\n\nLimited omnibus editions collect 24 issues in a slipcase with several extras. The first volume is autographed by Kirkman and Adlard, with 300 copies available.

                "Robert Kirkman\n\nRobert Kirkman (born November 30, 1978) is an American comic book writer best known for creating \"The Walking Dead\" and \"Invincible\" for Image Comics, in addition to writing \"Ultimate X-Men\" and \"Marvel Zombies\" for Marvel Comics. He has also collaborated with Image Comics co-founder Todd McFarlane on the series \"Haunt\". He is one of the five partners of Image Comics, and the only one of the five who was not one of its co-founders.\n\nRobert Kirkman was born November 30, 1978, in Lexington, Kentucky, and was raised in Cynthiana, Kentucky.\n\nRobert Kirkman's first comic book work was the 2000 superhero parody \"Battle Pope\", which he co-created with artist Tony Moore, self-published under the Funk-O-Tron label, and was adapted into a season of 8 animated webisodes that appeared on Spike TV's website in 2008. Later, while pitching a new series, \"Science Dog\", Kirkman and artist Cory Walker were hired to do a SuperPatriot miniseries for Image Comics. While working on that book, Kirkman and E. J. Su created the 2002 Image series \"Tech Jacket\", which ran six issues, and the one-shot title, \"Cloudfall\".\n\nIn 2003, Kirkman and Walker created \"Invincible\" for Image's new superhero line. The story surrounded the adolescent son of the world's most powerful superhero, who develops powers and starts his own superhero career. Walker later failed to meet the monthly title's deadlines and was replaced by Ryan Ottley. In 2005, Paramount Pictures announced it had bought the rights to produce an \"Invincible\" feature film, and hired Kirkman to write the screenplay.\n\nShortly after the launch of \"Invincible\", Kirkman began \"The Walking Dead\" (2003). Kirkman said in 2012 that Image had balked at publishing a comics series featuring what it felt was simply another zombie story, prompting him to say the zombies were part of an alien plot—a notion he had no intention of using except as a means of selling the project. Artist Charlie Adlard replaced Tony Moore with issue #7. Moore continued to draw covers until issue 24 as well as the first four volumes of the trade paperbacks for the series.\nKirkman was first hired by Marvel Comics to pen a revival of the 1990s \"Sleepwalker\" series, but it was canceled before being published; the contents of its first issue were included in \"Epic Anthology\" No. 1 (2004). He soon became a mainstay at Marvel, writing the \"Avengers Disassembled\" issues of \"Captain America\" vol. 4, 2004's \"Marvel Knights 2099\" one-shots event, \"Jubilee\" #1–6 and \"Fantastic Four: Foes\" #1–6, a two-year run on \"Ultimate X-Men\" and the entire \"Marvel Team-Up\" vol. 3 and the \"Irredeemable Ant-Man\" miniseries.\n\nAt Image, Kirkman and artist Jason Howard created the ongoing series \"The Astounding Wolf-Man\", launching it on May 5, 2007, as part of Free Comic Book Day. Kirkman edited the monthly series \"Brit\", based on the character he created for the series of one-shots, illustrated by Moore and Cliff Rathburn. It ran 12 issues.\n\nKirkman announced in 2007 that he and artist Rob Liefeld would team on a revival of \"Killraven\" for Marvel Comics. Kirkman that year also said he and Todd McFarlane would collaborate on \"Haunt\" for Image Comics.\n\nIn late July 2008, Kirkman was made a partner at Image Comics, thereby ending his freelance association with Marvel. Nonetheless, later in 2009, he and Walker produced the five-issue miniseries \"The Destroyer\" vol. 4 for Marvel's MAX imprint.\n\nIn 2009, Kirkman and Marc Silvestri took over the 2009–2010 Pilot Season for Top Cow Comics. The 2009/2010 Pilot Season contains a series of five one-shot pilot comics that readers will be able to vote on which becomes an ongoing series. Each series is co-created by Silvestri who also provides cover art.\n\nIn 2010, he also began producing the television adaption of his comic book series \"The Walking Dead\", the pilot of which was directed by Frank Darabont. Kirkman has written or co-written seven episodes of the series. Kirkman also created and serves as an executive producer on the show's spinoff series, \"Fear the Walking Dead\".\n\nIn July 2010, Kirkman announced he would launch and run a new Image Comics imprint called Skybound Entertainment.\n\nOn February 9, 2012, Tony Moore filed a lawsuit alleging that Kirkman, in 2005, had deceitfully engineered him into surrendering his rights to \"The Walking Dead\" comic book and eventual TV series in exchange for payments that never materialized. Kirkman said in a statement the following day that he and Moore \"each had legal representation seven years ago and now he is violating the same contract he initiated and approved and he wants to misrepresent the fees he was paid and continues to be paid for the work he was hired to do.\" Kirkman in turn sued Moore. On September 24, 2012, the two released a joint statement saying they had reached a settlement \"to everyone's mutual satisfaction.\"\n\nKirkman made an appearance in a 2012 episode of Adult Swim's \"Robot Chicken\" as himself where he tries to tell The Nerd and Daniel a hint, but gets eaten by the zombies.\n\nIn November 2013, Cinemax purchased a TV pilot based on Kirkman and artist Paul Azaceta's then-upcoming six-issue exorcism comics miniseries, \"Outcast\". The first issue of the comic was released in June 2014 to positive reviews.\n\nKirkman was a producer of the science fiction thriller \"Air\", which starred \"The Walking Dead\"s Norman Reedus, and Djimon Hounsou. The movie was released in 2015. It was the first feature film to be produced by Skybound Entertainment.\n\nKirkman's latest television project known as \"Five Year\" will be a joint venture between Skybound and Viki.com. It will be filmed for TV in Korea and available everywhere on Viki.com. The pre-apocalyptic story centres on a family dealing with an impending meteor strike. It was picked up for an initial 1 season run of 16 episodes with a plan for 5 seasons. Filming begins in late 2016.\n\nAs of November 7, 2016, Kirkman's production company Skybound Entertainment was set to produce a remake of the film \"An American Werewolf in London\". The remake will be written and directed by Max Landis, son of the original director John Landis. Kirkman and David Alpert would be executive producers on the film.\n\nKirkman and his wife live in Kentucky. Their son Peter Parker Kirkman was born April 25, 2006.\n\nIn 2011, \"The Walking Dead\" TV series was nominated for A Writers Guide of America Award for Best New Series.\n\nIn 2013 he was nominated for the OTFA Television Award for Best Writing in a Drama Series.\n\n\n\n\n\nKirkman has also written a series of non-graphic \"The Walking Dead\" novels:\n\nKirkman has written a number of \"The Walking Dead\" TV episodes.\n\n\n\"Fear the Walking Dead\" is a companion series to \"The Walking Dead\", set in Los Angeles, California and starting prior to the apocalypse. Robert Kirkman is co-creator of the series alongside Dave Erickson. He is also an executive producer and has co-written episodes of the series.\n\n\n\"Outcast\" is a horror series on Cinemax.\n\n\n",
                "The Walking Dead (season 1)\n\nThe first season of \"The Walking Dead\", an American post-apocalyptic horror television series on AMC, premiered on October 31, 2010, and concluded on December 5, 2010, consisting of 6 episodes. Developed for television by Frank Darabont, who wrote or co-wrote four of the season's six episodes and directed the pilot episode, \"Days Gone Bye\", the series is based on the eponymous series of comic books by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. It was executive produced by Darabont, Kirkman, David Alpert, Charles H. Eglee, and Gale Anne Hurd, with Darabont assuming the role of showrunner.\n\nThe season received very positive reviews by critics. It was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama at the 68th Golden Globe Awards and received nominations for the 63rd Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards in several categories, winning Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie, or Special. The pilot episode received 5.35 million viewers, and the finale garnered six million viewers, including four million viewers among adults ages 18–49, making it the most viewed basic cable drama series at that time. Based on its reception, AMC renewed the series for a second season consisting of 13 episodes, which premiered on October 16, 2011.\n\nThis season adapts material from issues #1–6 of the comic book series and introduces notable comic character Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), who awakens from his coma in a post-apocalyptic world filled with flesh-eating zombies, dubbed \"walkers\". After befriending Morgan Jones (Lennie James), Rick sets outs to find his family and discover the origins of the walker virus.\n\nThe first season features seven actors receiving opening credits billing:\n\n\n\n\nThe series features several actors \"Walking Dead\" developer Frank Darabont has worked with previously, including Laurie Holden, Jeffrey DeMunn, Melissa McBride and Juan Pareja. All four appeared in his 2007 film \"The Mist\", along with Thomas Jane, who originally was set to star in the series when it was pitched to HBO. He is also in talks with Darabont to possibly guest star on the series. Laurie Holden also appeared in the 2001 film \"The Majestic\" (she played Adele Stanton, Jim Carrey's love interest), which Darabont directed. DeMunn has additionally appeared in several of Darabont's films, in addition to \"The Mist\" and \"The Majestic\": \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994) and \"The Green Mile\" (1999).\n\nRobert Kirkman, who created the comic book series in 2003, says he had considered the idea of a \"Walking Dead\" television series, but never actively pursued it. \"I certainly wanted it to happen, just because I knew it would be good for the book... I'm certainly not against adaptations, like some creators.\" When Frank Darabont became interested in adapting the comic books for television, Kirkman said it was \"extremely flattering\" and went on to say that, \"He definitely cares about the original source material, and you can tell that in the way he's adapting it. It's an extreme validation of the work... Never in a million years could I have thought that if \"Walking Dead\" were to ever be adapted that everything would be going this well. I think that that's all because of Frank.\"\n\nDarabont himself had been a fan of the zombie genre since seeing George A. Romero's 1968 film \"Night of the Living Dead\" when he was fourteen years old. \"\"Night of the Living Dead\" had this weird vibe that was almost - it was like pornography... It had this marvelously attractive, disreputable draw... I loved it immediately.\" Darabont recalls walking into a comic book store in Burbank, California and seeing \"The Walking Dead\" on the shelf in 2005. \"Being that I've always had \"the love of zombies genre,\" I of course grabbed it, took it home and read it, and immediately started pursuing the rights to it. I thought it would make a great TV show... I loved the idea of an extended, ongoing, serialized dramatic presentation set in the zombie apocalypse.\" He described the process of developing the series and getting it set up at a network as \"four years of frustration,\" and credits executive producer Gale Anne Hurd with finally getting the series on AMC. \"I can't remember what the hell prompted her to read it [the script], but she said, \"Wow, I really love this pilot you wrote. What are you doing with it?\" I said I'd been trying to set it up forever... She said \"I think AMC might be the place to take this.\" She did, and then bam! They were immediately interested. I had to credit Gale, her insight into marrying the material and the buyer.\"\n\nDarabont's original pilot script was split in half and embellished, making the first two episodes instead of one, \"...just to slow the narrative down and dig into the characters more deeply, so it's not just plot-driven, event-driven stuff. You really want to drag these characters into the equation.\" To write the remaining episodes of the season, Darabont recruited Charles H. Eglee, Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara, all of whom he had worked with while directing an episode of \"The Shield\". Jack LoGiudice also joined the writing team, along with Robert Kirkman, also an executive producer. \"I have the best of both worlds,\" says Kirkman. \"It was a lot of fun writing Episode 104, and I'm hoping if it continues into Season 2, I'll be able to write more episodes.\"\n\nPrincipal photography for the pilot episode, \"Days Gone Bye\", began on May 15, 2010 with the subsequent five episodes beginning filming a few weeks later on June 2. The first season was filmed in and around Atlanta, Georgia where the episodes were primarily set.\n\nThe show's official website released a motion comic based on the first issue of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr. The site also posted a making-of documentary primarily about the first episode, as well as a number of other behind-the-scenes videos and interviews. In the documentary, comic series creator and show executive producer Robert Kirkman as well as artist Charlie Adlard expressed that they were pleased with how faithful the show is to the comic and remark on the similarities between the actors and the comic's original character drawings. Several scenes from \"Days Gone Bye\" were screened July 23, 2010 as part of the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. Hurd asserted that \"[they] really are doing six one-hour movie\", and Darabont insisted that the series would closely reflect the development in the comics. \"The path is a very strong template. But we're going to take every interesting detour we feel like taking. As long as were staying on the path of what Robert has done, I don't see any reason not to. If they have patience we'll eventually catch up to what Robert is doing.\"\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" debuted during the same week in 120 countries. \"Days Gone Bye\" premiered in Hong Kong on TVB Pearl on August 30, 2011, while it expanded in international markets during the first week of November. Two weeks prior to its official premiere in the United States, the contents of the episode leaked online. As part of an expansive campaign to advertise and heighten anticipation for the premiere, international broadcasting affiliates of AMC and Fox coordinated a worldwide zombie invasion event proceeding days prior to premiere of the episode in the United States. The event occurred in twenty six cities worldwide, and were hosted in select locations including the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., Palace of Westminster in London, Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul, Acropolis of Athens in Athens, and the Museo del Prado in Madrid. The campaign events commenced in Hong Kong and Taipei, and culminated in Los Angeles.\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" was included on the cover of the December 2010 edition of \"Entertainment Weekly\", which featured Rick Grimes pointing a gun at a horde of walkers. According to the journalist of the magazine, it \"examines the past, present, and future\" of the television franchise; \"from the comic book's humble beginnings, to unlikely path to the small screen, to even more unlikely path as a bona fide hit.\" Kirkman was ecstatic upon hearing of the news. \"I've got to say—not to kiss your magazine's a– or anything—but when they called me and said Frank [Darabont] wanted to do the show, I was like, 'Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.' And then when AMC was like, 'We're picking up the show,' I was like, 'Yeah, alright, whatever.' When they actually started shooting the pilot I was like, 'Well, this is kind of real, this is neat.' But when they called me and said, 'Your show's on the cover of \"Entertainment Weekly\",' I think that was the first time I was like, 'Oh my god, I can't believe this is happening to me!'\"\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nThe first season of \"The Walking Dead\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the season holds a score of 82 out of 100, indicating \"universal acclaim\", based on 25 critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds an 89% with an average rating of 7.49 out of 10, based on 24 reviews, and an average episode score of 87%. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Blood-spattered, emotionally resonant, and white-knuckle intense, \"The Walking Dead\" puts an intelligent spin on the overcrowded zombie subgenre.\" Following the pilot episode's debut, \"TV Guide\"s Matt Roush called the show \"a stark and harrowing survival parable ... visually stunning ... and daring in its artful use of silence.\" Following the second episode, Simon Abrams from \"Slant Magazine\" awarded the show three and a half stars out of a possible four; \"To say that Darabont has kicked his series off with a bang would be a serious understatement ... [he] has fashioned a fully realized alternate reality and it's a thrilling thing to experience.\"\n\nIn response to the season finale, James Poniewozik of \"TIME\" magazine gave the first season of \"The Walking Dead\" a glowing review stating, \"the show has an urgency and bravery that make it something special\". Josh Jackson of \"Paste\" magazine also praised the season by writing, \"the characters are worth caring about\" despite \"occasional stilted monologues, quick tempers and unfortunate stereotypes\". Some reviews were mixed, including one from Kofi Outlaw of \"Screen Rant\" who concluded, \"The Walking Dead still hasn't really defined itself as anything more than a vague survival story about the human condition\" but added, \"you can be sure I'm one of those Dead-heads already chomping at the bit for season 2\". Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic also offered mixed criticism saying the first season \"had its ups and downs\" noting that the second season should focus on \"a more specific story arc and strengthening of the character development\". Logan Hill of \"New York\" magazine was more critical, claiming the episodes contained \"atrocious dialogue\" and \"a lot of plot machinery that has been contrived to create action suspense but ... hasn't really moved the story itself anywhere in particular\", though he admits the fifth episode showed \"flashes of promise\".\n\nThe first season of \"The Walking Dead\" was named one of the Top 10 Television Programs in 2010 by the American Film Institute. The season was also nominated for Outstanding New Program at the 27th TCA Awards and at the 63rd Writers Guild of America Awards.

                "The Walking Dead (TV series)\n\nThe Walking Dead is an American post-apocalyptic horror television series developed by Frank Darabont for AMC that is based on the comic book series of the same name by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. Andrew Lincoln plays the show's lead character, sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes, who awakens from a coma discovering a world overrun by zombies, commonly referred to as \"walkers\". Grimes reunites with his family and becomes the leader of a group he forms with other survivors. Together they struggle to survive and adapt in a post-apocalyptic world filled with walkers and opposing groups of survivors, who are often more dangerous than the walkers themselves. Much of the series takes place in and around Atlanta, Georgia, and later Alexandria, Virginia.\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" premiered in the United States on October 31, 2010, exclusively shown on cable television channel AMC and internationally on Fox International Channels. As a result of very favorable Nielsen ratings that rank the show unprecedentedly high for a cable series, AMC has renewed the series each year. Beginning with its third season, \"The Walking Dead\" has attracted the most 18- to 49-year-old viewers of any cable or broadcast television series. Its eighth season debuted on October 22, 2017, and it has been renewed for a ninth season to debut in late 2018. The series has been well received by critics and nominated for several awards, including the Writers Guild of America Award for and the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama. An AMC spin-off series, \"Fear the Walking Dead\", debuted on August 23, 2015.\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" takes place after the onset of a worldwide zombie apocalypse. The zombies, colloquially referred to as \"walkers\", shamble towards living humans and other creatures to eat them; they are attracted to noise, such as gunshots, and to different scents, e.g. humans. Humans that they bite or scratch become infected and slowly turn into walkers as well. It is revealed early in the series that all living humans carry this pathogen, so that if they die from any other cause, they will also turn into walkers. The only way to permanently kill a walker is to damage its brain or otherwise fully destroy the body, such as by cremating it.\n\nThe series centers on sheriff's deputy Rick Grimes, who wakes up from a coma to discover this apocalypse. He becomes the leader of a group of survivors from the Atlanta, Georgia region as they attempt to sustain themselves and protect themselves not only against attacks by walkers but by other groups of survivors willing to assure their longevity by any means necessary.\n\nSheriff's deputy Rick Grimes wakes from a coma discovering a world overrun by zombies. After befriending Morgan Jones, Rick travels alone to Atlanta to find his wife Lori, his son, Carl, and his police partner, Shane Walsh, encountering other survivors. The group travels to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), but find from the sole remaining CDC member that no cure exists for the epidemic.\n\nTraveling from Atlanta, Rick's group takes shelter at Hershel Greene's farm while they search for Carol's missing daughter, Sophia. Tensions between Rick's group and Hershel's family worsen after it is discovered that Hershel has kept friends and family turned into zombies, including Sophia, in his barn. Shane and Rick's friendship becomes increasingly unhinged when Lori reveals that she is pregnant, and Rick is forced to kill Shane in self-defense. Carl then shoots Shane in the head after he reanimates. The noise draws zombies, forcing Rick's group and Hershel's surviving family to evacuate the farm.\n\nEight months after fleeing Hershel's farm, Rick's group finds a prison, which they clear of zombies to make their new home. Lori dies in childbirth, and Rick becomes withdrawn. Meanwhile, Andrea is rescued by Michonne and the two discover Woodbury, a fortified town led by a man known as the Governor. He learns of Rick's group at the prison, leading to conflict between them. Rick's group eventually raids and destroys Woodbury, but the Governor has Andrea ultimately killed and escapes. Woodbury's citizens live with Rick’s group at the prison.\n\nSeveral months after the Governor's attack, a deadly flu kills many of the population at the prison. The Governor finds his former right-hand men and kills them, taking over their group and destroys the prison. Rick's group are forced to separate and flee, but not before Hershel and the Governor are killed. The survivors divide, face their own trials and meet new faces before finding signs pointing to a safe haven called Terminus. One by one, they reunite at Terminus, but all the group are captured for some unknown purpose.\n\nRick discovers the residents of Terminus engage in cannibalism, but the group manage to destroy Terminus and reunite. Some are injured and kidnapped to Grady, a hospital run by corrupt cops and doctors. When the remaining survivors regroup, they are approached by Aaron, inviting them to join a fortified community called Alexandria. They are initially welcomed, but Rick's group realize the residents have not faced the zombie threat directly. Morgan, who has been searching for Rick, arrives and is shocked to see Rick killing an Alexandrian, who has been abusing his wife, in anger.\n\nThe residents of Alexandria put more trust in Rick's group to protect the town better. A group known as the Wolves use a zombie horde to attack Alexandria, and many lives are lost before the living regain control. While recovering, they learn of a community called the Hilltop, who offer to help trade supplies if they can end the threat of the extortionist Saviors led by a man named Negan. Although Rick's group decimate one Savior outpost, they are later caught by Negan, and forced to swear loyalty to him.\n\nNegan murders Glenn and Abraham to coerce Rick's loyalty. Rick initially submits, but Michonne persuades him to fight back, and recruits a community called the Scavengers for help. Meanwhile, Rosita and Eugene make a bullet to kill Negan. When this fails, Negan forcibly recruits Eugene as a Savior. Separately, Carol and Morgan befriend Ezekiel of the Kingdom, another community, while Maggie and Rosita rally the Hilltop. Alexandria is attacked by the Saviors, aided by the turncoat Scavengers, but the Kingdom and Hilltop defend Alexandria. The three communities declare war on the Saviors.\n\nRick, Maggie, and Ezekiel rally their communities to flood the Sanctuary with walkers, trapping Negan. During the war, key Savior members grow suspicious of each other while the Hilltop and Kingdom are overwhelmed by the Saviors. Alexandria is attacked after Negan is freed. As Carl retreats the residents to the sewers, they are horrified to discover Carl has been bitten.\n\nIn January 2018, the series was renewed for a ninth season, which is planned to premiere in late 2018. It was announced that showrunner Scott Gimple would be promoted to Chief Content Officer for both \"The Walking Dead\" and \"Fear the Walking Dead\", while current writer and co-executive producer Angela Kang would take Gimple's role for \"The Walking Dead\".\n\nExecutive producer David Alpert said in 2014 that the original comics have given them enough ideas for Rick Grimes and company over the next seven years. \"I happen to love working from source material, specifically because we have a pretty good idea of what Season 10 is gonna be\", Alpert said. \"We know where seasons 11 and 12 [will be]... we have benchmarks and milestones for those seasons if we're lucky enough to get there.\"\n\nThe list below contains those that have been credited within the show's title sequence and those who are credited as \"also starring\". Recurring and guest stars are listed on the individual season pages.\n\n\nThe series features several actors whom \"Walking Dead\" developer Frank Darabont has worked with previously, including Laurie Holden (Andrea), Jeffrey DeMunn (Dale Horvath), Melissa McBride (Carol Peletier), Sam Witwer (the dead soldier in the tank where Rick hides in \"Days Gone Bye\"), and Juan Gabriel Pareja (Morales). All five appeared in his 2007 film \"The Mist\", along with Thomas Jane, who originally was set to star in the series when it was pitched to HBO. Jane was later in talks with Darabont to possibly guest star on the series as of fall 2010, but with Darabont's departure, it is unknown whether the guest spot will happen or not. Laurie Holden also appeared in the 2001 film \"The Majestic\" (as Adele Stanton, Jim Carrey's character's love interest), which Darabont directed. DeMunn has also appeared in several of Darabont's films; in addition to \"The Mist\" and \"The Majestic\", he appeared in \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994) and \"The Green Mile\" (1999). It was planned that Witwer (Private Jessup in Darabont's \"The Mist\") would reprise his \"Days Gone Bye\" role in the original conception of \"The Walking Dead\"s season two premiere and in a webisode, but both plans were discarded.\n\nOn January 20, 2010, AMC officially announced that it had ordered a pilot for a possible series adapted from \"The Walking Dead\" comic book series, with Frank Darabont and Gale Anne Hurd acting as executive producers and Darabont writing and directing. The entire series was pre-ordered based just on the strength of the source material, the television scripts, and Darabont's involvement. In January 2010 a review of the pilot episode's script attracted further attention. The pilot began filming in Atlanta, Georgia on May 15, 2010 after AMC had officially ordered a six episode first season. The series' remaining episodes began filming on June 2, 2010 with Darabont serving as showrunner. On August 31, 2010, Darabont reported that \"The Walking Dead\" had been picked up for a second season, with production to begin in February 2011. On November 8, 2010, AMC confirmed that there would be a second season consisting of 13 episodes. He would also like to include some of the \"environmental elements\" that take place during Volume 2 of Kirkman's book.\n\nThe first season writing staff consisted of series developer and executive producer Frank Darabont (who wrote/co-wrote four of the six episodes), executive producer Charles H. Eglee, executive producer and creator of the comic book Robert Kirkman, co-executive producer Jack LoGiudice, consulting producer Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara, all of whom contributed to one episode each. Along with Darabont, who directed the pilot episode, the remaining five were directed by Michelle MacLaren, Gwyneth Horder-Payton, Johan Renck, Ernest Dickerson and Guy Ferland.\n\nOn December 1, 2010, Deadline.com reported that Darabont had fired his writing staff, including executive producer Charles \"Chic\" Eglee, and planned to use freelance writers for the second season. Kirkman called the announcement \"premature\" and clarified that Eglee left to pursue other projects when Darabont decided to stay on as showrunner, and no definitive plans had been made regarding the writing staff for season two.\n\nOn December 3, 2010, in an interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\", executive producer Gale Anne Hurd commented: \"It's completely inaccurate. [In] the writers' room, there are people that have set up other projects that will be their first priority if their own series is picked up as a pilot or if it's a series. I think [Eglee] just decided that he wants to run his own show.\" She revealed that it would be likely for the show to return in October 2011, as Darabont and Kirkman planned on mapping out the next season early in 2011. She also confirmed that, \"every one of the principal cast is signed up for multiple seasons.\" In July 2011, series developer and showrunner Frank Darabont stepped down from his position as showrunner for the series, over unclear circumstances (see Lawsuit below).\n\nExecutive producer Glen Mazzara was appointed the new showrunner in Darabont's place. New writers joined the writing staff in the second season, including co-executive producer Evan Reilly, producer Scott M. Gimple, story editor Angela Kang, and David Leslie Johnson. New writers in the third season included producers Nichole Beattie and Sang Kyu Kim, with Frank Renzulli contributing a freelance script.\n\nAfter the conclusion of the third season, Glen Mazzara stepped down from his position as showrunner and executive producer for the series, per a mutual agreement between Mazzara and AMC. The press release read, \"Both parties acknowledge that there is a difference of opinion about where the show should go moving forward, and conclude that it is best to part ways.\" Scott M. Gimple succeeded Mazzara as showrunner for season four, with new writers joining the writing staff, such as Curtis Gwinn, Channing Powell, and Matt Negrete. In January 2018, it was announced that, upon Gimple's promotion to the newly-created position of Chief Content Officer of the entire \"Walking Dead\" franchise, that Angela Kang would replace him as showrunner beginning with the forthcoming ninth season.\n\nThe television series generally tends to follow Kirkman's comic series across major characters and plots; for instance, events of the premiere episode of season 7 correlate to events in issue #100 of the comics. The show does not attempt to go step-by-step with the comics, and has leeway in the narrative. In particular, the show's writers, along with Kirkman, often \"transfer\" how a character has died in the comics to a different character in the show. For example, in season 4, where Hershel Greene is beheaded by The Governor in the standoff with Rick's group at the prison; in the comic, Tyreese is the one who receives this fate. Some of the television characters, like Carol, have far outlived their comic counterpart, while others that have already been killed off, like Sophia and Andrea, remained alive for some time in the ongoing comic series. In addition, the writers have included characters wholly novel to the series such as Daryl Dixon, which producer Gale Anne Hurd says helps to create a new dynamic for the show, and keeps the audience guessing from what had already been established in the comic series.\n\nBear McCreary was hired to compose the score for the series. McCreary stated that the main theme was based on his viewing of production designs for the opening title sequence. Instead of doing a full theme song as with his earlier works, McCreary chose to use a simple, repeating motif from the strings section.\nFour soundtracks for \"The Walking Dead\" have been released to date. \"\" was released on March 17, 2013. The second volume was released on March 25, 2014. \"Songs of Survival\" is a soundtrack for the third season and it was released on August 27, 2013, by Republic Records as a Walmart exclusive for the special edition release of the third season. \"Songs of Survival, Vol. 2\" is a soundtrack for the fourth season and it was released on August 26, 2014, by Republic Records as a Walmart exclusive of the fourth season release.\n\nGreg Nicotero is an executive producer and the key special effects makeup artist on the series. Each walker is put through \"zombie school\" and is taught how to move like zombies. There are three levels of zombie makeup: Hero, Midground, and Deep Background. Hero zombies are featured walkers and are completely made over from head to toe. Midground zombies get highlights and shadows on the face, but do not get close enough to the camera to require full makeup. Deep background zombies often wear masks and are only meant to be used as a backdrop.\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" is mostly filmed in Georgia. Since 2002, the state has offered a tax incentive for large film productions to drive producers to the state and bolster its economy.\n\nThe first season was filmed primary in Atlanta, though required a great deal of coordination with the city to shut down streets and parks for film. Production for subsequent seasons moved mainly to Riverwood Studios (doing business as Raleigh Studios Atlanta), a plot of land approximately outside of Senoia, Georgia. Some existing buildings were used here, such as a subdivision that is used by several families that serves as the Alexandria Safe-Zone, while other buildings are constructed as sets, such as the exterior shots of the main Hilltop mansion, the trash heaps used by the Scavengers, or Father Gabriel's church. Sets are torn down when no longer needed; the church, after its use in Season 5, was removed and its spot used for the iconic setting for the first meeting between Rick's group and Negan in Season 7. The property includes sound stages constructed for interior shots, which then may be reused; the interior sets for the prison during Season 3 were reused to serve as the buildings and sets for the Savior's Sanctuary in Season 7. In July 2017, AMC purchased the studio lot from Riverwood for $8.25 million.\n\nSome scenes are shot outside of the studio. Woodbury, during Season 3, was filmed in downtown Senoia. Other exceptions include the Kingdom, which is filmed at the former military base Fort McPherson, now converted to studios for Tyler Perry.\n\nThe series is completely shot on 16 mm film. David Tattersall was the director of photography for the pilot episode with David Boyd as the director of photography on the remainder of the episodes. Production design is done by Greg Melton and Alex Hajdu. The effects team includes veteran special effects makeup designers Greg Nicotero and Toby Sells, special effects coordinator Darrell Pritchett, and visual effects supervisors Sam Nicholson and Jason Sperling.\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" debuted during the same week in 120 countries. As part of an expansive campaign to advertise and heighten anticipation for the premiere, AMC and Fox International Channels coordinated a worldwide zombie invasion event on October 26, 2010. The stunt involved invading 26 major cities within a 24-hour period, starting with Taipei and Hong Kong, and ending in Los Angeles for the U.S. premiere.\n\nThe show's official website released, just prior to the San Diego Comic-Con in 2010, a motion comic based on Issue No. 1 of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr. The site also posted a making-of documentary primarily about the first episode, as well as a number of other behind-the-scenes videos and interviews. In the documentary, comic series creator and show executive producer Robert Kirkman as well as artist Charlie Adlard say they are pleased with how faithful the show is to the comic and remark on the similarities between the actors and the comic's original character drawings.\n\nAction figures of characters from the series were created for release in November 2011 and have continued throughout the years with eight line-ups. The figures, which are manufactured by McFarlane Toys, are designed to resemble the actors on the series. Figures created to resemble the characters as drawn in the comic book were released in September 2011.\n\nWith a primary objective of reducing the environmental impacts of film and television productions, including \"The Walking Dead\", producer Gale Anne Hurd has directed the cast, crew, production team, suppliers, and bloggers about her shows to adopt the Doddle app to make the production almost paper-free; this works by digitally transmitting interactive call sheets and other intra-team and team-supplier communications (such as directions, images, menus, and updates) to people's cell phones and tablets. Hurd said of using Doddle: in addition to conserving paper, \"It's also easier, and it's better for security. People are less likely to leave their smartphone or tablet lying around for someone else to pick up.\"\n\nHurd describes additional steps taken to increase efficiency and cut production costs: \"If you use vehicles that get better gas mileage, that are electric or hybrids, you're going to pay a lot less in fuel. If you use compact fluorescent bulbs, you're going to save a lot of money in utilities. If you recycle even your own sets, and use them again, that's going to save money. You don't have to buy new lumber. So there are cost savings, absolutely.\" Additionally, the production team aims to reduce vehicle idling, which decreases carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nHurd also cuts down on plastic waste by personally using a refillable, stainless steel EcoUsable water bottle and promoting its use among her colleagues. She shared: \"on a lot of my projects I give them as crew gifts before we start production, and have water stations available, but you can't force people to use them.\"\n\nTo date, four web series based on \"The Walking Dead\" have been released via AMC's website–\"\" (2011), \"\" (2012), \"\" (2013) and \"\" (2017).\n\nIn 2011, AMC debuted an animated comic book version of \"The Walking Dead\" novel's beginning, featuring the voice of actor Phil LaMarr.\n\nA live after-show titled \"Talking Dead\" premiered on AMC on October 16, 2011, following the encore presentation of \"The Walking Dead\" season two premiere. \"Talking Dead\" features host Chris Hardwick discussing the latest episode with fans, actors, and producers of \"The Walking Dead\".\n\n\"Fear the Walking Dead\" is a companion series to \"The Walking Dead\", developed by AMC. AMC started development of the show around September 2013 and committed to a two-season broadcast by March 2015. \"Fear the Walking Dead\" was first broadcast on August 23, 2015, and is renewed for a fourth season.\n\n\"Fear the Walking Dead\" features a different set of characters, developed by Kirkman. The series starts at the onset of the zombie apocalypse, and follows several people that escape Los Angeles as the military attempts to quarantine the city, and seek refuge along the west coast of the United States and Mexico. The fourth season of \"Fear the Walking Dead\" will feature a crossover with \"The Walking Dead\", specifically through the character Morgan Jones (played by Lennie James) during events between the first and second second of \"The Walking Dead\".\n\nDue to its popularity, \"The Walking Dead\" has inspired dozens of parodies and spoofs featured on YouTube channels like Bad Lip Reading and TV shows such as \"Saturday Night Live\" and \"Mad TV\". Bad Lip Reading made a widely viewed parody involving Rick and the Governor, entitled \"La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum\". The series' cast was shown the parody at the San Diego Comic-Con in 2013, and David Morrisseywho portrays the Governor reacted by saying he now understood why so many people would walk up to him on the street and blurt, \"Hey, La-Bibbida-Bibba-Dum!\". Until seeing the video, he had wondered, \"what's wrong with these people?\" \"The Walking Dead\" has also been represented as a live comedy performance by English comedian Dan Willis at the Edinburgh Festival.\n\nScenes from the pilot were screened July 23, 2010, as part of the San Diego Comic-Con in 2010. It premiered on AMC on October 31, 2010, and premiered internationally on Fox International Channels during the first week of November. Almost two weeks before the official premiere on AMC, the pilot episode leaked online.\n\nInternational broadcast rights for the show were sold and announced on June 14, 2010. The show airs on Fox International Channels in 126 countries in 33 languages. The fifth season debuted its first part on October 13, 2014. The second part premiered on February 9, 2015.\n\nThe season 1 DVD and Blu-ray was released on March 8, 2011. A three-disc special edition of the first season—featuring new featurettes and audio commentaries—was released on DVD and Blu-ray on October 4, 2011. The European versions of the first season DVD and Blu-ray are edited for gore, with cuts to episode two (\"Guts\"), episode three (\"Tell It to the Frogs\"), episode four (\"Vatos\") and episode five (\"Wildfire\"). Until eOne/WVG re-released the first season in D-A-CH in a \"Special Uncut Version\" on DVD and Blu-ray on May 31, 2013.\n\nThe season 2 DVD and Blu-ray was released on August 28, 2012. It was also released as a limited edition Blu-ray, packaged as a miniature zombie head designed by McFarlane Toys. Special features include audio commentaries, deleted scenes, webisodes, and several featurettes.\n\nThe season 3 DVD and Blu-ray was released on August 27, 2013. It was also released as a limited edition Blu-ray, packaged as a miniature version of the Governor's zombie head aquarium tank designed by Greg Nicotero and sculpted by McFarlane Toys.

The version that airs on MyNetworkTV is edited to meet broadcast television standards.\n\nAll seasons of \"The Walking Dead\" have been well reviewed by recognized critics, with an 89% approval rating for the series to date on Rotten Tomatoes. For the first season, 24 Rotten Tomatoes critics gave it a positive review, with an average score of 7.49/10. That site's consensus states, \"Blood-spattered, emotionally resonant, and white-knuckle intense, \"The Walking Dead\" puts an intelligent spin on the overcrowded zombie subgenre.\" Metacritic scored the first season 82/100 based on 25 critic reviews, 23 of which were positive, two mixed, and none negative. Heather Havrilesky of Salon.com included the show on their list of 9 new TV shows not to miss, giving it a grade of \"A\", with the author saying, \"A film-quality drama series about zombies? Somebody pinch me!\"\n\nFor the second season, 83% of 22 critic reviews on Rotten Tomatoes were positive, with an average score of 8.09/10. The site's consensus states, \"The second season of The Walking Dead fleshes out the characters while maintaining the grueling tension and gore that made the show a hit.\" Of 22 Metacritic critic reviews, 18 were positive, four were mixed, and none were negative; their average score was 80/100. Early criticism of the show focused on the slow pace of the second season, particularly the first half. Ken Tucker of \"Entertainment Weekly\", described the series as \"a nighttime soap\", comparing it to \"a parody of a Samuel Beckett play\" that had very little sense of direction and few appearances of walkers. Nate Rawlings of \"Time\"s online entertainment section noted that \"the pace during the first half of this season has been brutally slow. [...] They've tried to develop individual characters, but each subplot meant to add a layer to a character has been quickly resolved.\" Later reviews from other critics, such as Scott Wampler of Collider.com, recognized the increased quality of the second half, stating it \"seemed far more intense, more interesting, better written\". Recognizing the overall season, Kevin Yeoman of \"Screen Rant\" offered praise saying \"the writers succeeded in unshackling themselves from the intermittent monotony brought about by the serial nature of the show\".\n\nThe third season had 89% of Rotten Tomatoes' 32 critics giving it a positive review, with an average score of 8.12/10. The site's consensus states, \"The palpable terror and visceral thrills continue in the third season of \"The Walking Dead\", along with a deeper sense of the people who inhabit its apocalyptic landscape.\" Metacritic's 19 critics rated the season 82/100, all of whom gave a positive review. Verne Gay of \"Newsday\" claimed that the season 3 premiere \"doesn't disappoint\" going on to say that there are \"spots where you will yell out at the screen, 'Oh, my God, that just didn't happen.'

In 2016, a \"New York Times\" study of the 50 TV shows with the most Facebook Likes found that like most other zombie shows, \"The Walking Dead\" \"is most popular in rural areas, particularly southern Texas and eastern Kentucky\".\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" was nominated for Best New Series by the Writers Guild of America Awards 2011 and Best Television Series Drama by the 68th Golden Globe Awards. The show was named one of the top 10 television programs of 2010 by the American Film Institute Awards 2010.

West for Best Guest Star on Television, and Chandler Riggs for Best Young Performer on Television.\n\nDarabont's departure as showrunner in July 2011 during the second season came as surprise to many, as it came shortly after the season's premiere and a few days after that year's Comic-Con, where Darabont helped to promote the show. It was speculated that he was unable to adjust to the schedule of running a television series. However, \"The Hollywood Reporter\" reported that AMC had fired him. There had been reported difficulties in the production of the second season, including disputes over planned budget cuts and executive meddling, and it was known that Darabont and AMC had several discussions relating to these factors. However, neither Darabont, AMC, nor the cast nor crew of \"The Walking Dead\" spoke about the reasons for his firing.\n\nIn December 2013, Darabont and his agents from Creative Artists Agency (CAA) filed a lawsuit against AMC in a New York court, citing breach of contract. A central part of Darabont's lawsuit accuses AMC of denying him and the CAA the promised profits from the success of the series, based on how AMC had used vertical integration in producing and distributing \"The Walking Dead\". As stated in Darabont's filing, he had initially entered into a contract with AMC to have a third-party studio produce the show, from which he would have obtained 12.5% of that entity's profits, after standard deductions. AMC wanted to produce the show in-house, and for the first season, Darabont's lawyers had been assured that Darabont would be protected from self-dealing fees by having AMC commit to imputed license fees equivalent to those of other independent studios, with Darabont earning profit from that. Darabont's suit contends that when the show's popularity took off, AMC presented a license fee deal to Darabont around February 2011 that used \"an unconscionably low license fee formula\" such that AMC could report the show running at a loss and ensuring that Darabont would never see any profit from the show; as an example, the suit references statements in 2012, following Season 2, that AMC claimed the show was running at a $49 million deficit, despite being one of the most popular shows in broadcast. Darabont's suit contends he was fired just at the start of the Season 2 so that AMC would avoid having to pay him.\n\nInitial discovery phase hearings were held in 2014. Darabont's lawyers sought to gain information from AMC on their other shows, specifically \"Breaking Bad\" and \"Mad Men\", to obtain a \"fair market value\" for \"The Walking Dead\". AMC asserted it had done no wrongdoing, had already paid Darabont $3 million upfront for two seasons, and was able to properly set the imputed license fee that worked into the profit formula for Darabont. The network resisted the request to provide otherwise confidential information on the other shows. The court granted Darabont's lawyers access to the requested information as part of the discovery phase. Darabont described \"crisis-level problems\" during the show's production while under deposition, claiming that AMC had cut the per-episode budget from $3.4 million to $3 million while keeping the tax credit offered by the state of Georgia for filming there, effectively reducing the production budget by 25%.\n\nIn August 2015, Darabont requested to amend his original complaint that AMC further reduced his profits from Season 2 as his firing mid-season meant he was not fully vested in the season, allowing AMC to reduce the profits paid him. Darabont's amended request points out that he had written and produced all the episodes in that season already and was entitled to the proper profit share. The judge granted this amendment in February 2016, partially influenced by concerns raised in Darabont's deposition.\n\nAt the end of the discovery phase in September 2016, Darabont's lawyers stated they are seeking damages of over $280 million; AMC stated they will \"vigorously\" defend against the lawsuit. If the case does go to trial, it is expected to occur during 2018. Summary judgement statements were completed in July 2017, with the judge expected to rule in August.\n\nIn August 2017, Robert Kirkman, Gale Anne Hurd, Charles Eglee, Glen Mazzara and David Alpert filed similar lawsuits against AMC, citing breach of contract over profits owed to them as a result of AMC's vertical integration. As with Darabont, each had been given a certain percentage of the show's profits based on if the show was produced by a third-party, but when it was transitioned to AMC Studios, their share was dramatically reduced. \"The Hollywood Reporter\" estimated that if the four seek similar damages as Darabont, the lawsuit could be as high as $1 billion. The suits, filed separately in Los Angeles and New York City, will be consolidated into a single case to be heard in a California court. Kirkman and the others said that despite the lawsuit, they will continue to work as \"partners\" with AMC to assure continued success of \"The Walking Dead\" and its spinoff series \"Fear the Walking Dead\".\n\n",
                "The Walking Dead (comic book)\n\nThe Walking Dead is an ongoing black-and-white comic book series created by writer Robert Kirkman and artist Tony Moore. It focuses on Rick Grimes, a Kentucky deputy who is shot in the line of duty and awakens from a coma in a zombie apocalypse that has resulted in a state-wide quarantine. After joining with other survivors, including his loved ones, he gradually takes on the role of leader of a community as it struggles to survive the zombie apocalypse.\n\nFirst issued in 2003 by publisher Image Comics, the comic is written by Kirkman with art by Moore (issues No. 1–6) and Charlie Adlard (issue No. 7 onward). Moore continued to do the covers through issue No. 24.\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" received the 2007 and 2010 Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series at San Diego Comic-Con International. The series was adapted into the AMC television series \"The Walking Dead\", which premiered in 2010. The television program loosely follows the storyline of the comic book. The franchise has also spawned multiple additional media properties, including video games (such as \"The Walking Dead\" video game), a companion television series (\"Fear the Walking Dead\"), webisode series (\"\", \"\", and \"\"), and various additional publications, including novels (\"\").\n\nThe original pitch by Kirkman and Moore was for a followup to George A. Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\", with the series taking place in the 1960s. Image Comics co-founder Jim Valentino suggested using an original concept instead so the creators would own the property outright. The revised pitch became \"The Walking Dead.\"\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" debuted in 2003, published by Image Comics, with art by Tony Moore for the first six issues and Cliff Rathburn shading the art after issue five. Charlie Adlard took over as artist on issue #7, after he was approached by Kirkman. Moore also did the cover art for the first twenty-four issues and the first four trade paperbacks. The remainder were done by Adlard.\n\nWhen the television series premiered in October 2010, Image Comics announced \"The Walking Dead Weekly\". The first 52 issues of the series began to be reprinted on January 5, 2011, with one issue per week for a year.\n\nThe series is periodically re-published in trade paperbacks which contain six issues each, hardcover books with twelve issues and occasional bonus material, omnibus editions of twenty-four issues, and compendium editions of forty-eight issues.\n\nVolume 1: Days Gone Bye (Issues 1–6)\nVolume 2: Miles Behind Us (Issues 7–12)\nVolume 3: Safety Behind Bars (Issues 13–18)\nVolume 4: The Heart's Desire (Issues 19–24)\nVolume 5: The Best Defense (Issues 25–30)\nVolume 6: This Sorrowful Life (Issues 31–36)\nVolume 7: The Calm Before (Issues 37–42)\nVolume 8: Made To Suffer (Issues 43–48)\nVolume 9: Here We Remain (Issues 49–54)\nVolume 10: What We Become (Issues 55–60)\nVolume 11: Fear The Hunters (Issues 61–66)\nVolume 12: Life Among Them (Issues 67–72)\nVolume 13: Too Far Gone (Issues 73–78)\nVolume 14: No Way Out (Issues 79–84)\nVolume 15: We Find Ourselves (Issues 85–90)\nVolume 16: A Larger World (Issues 91–96)\nVolume 17: Something To Fear (Issues 97–102)\nVolume 18: What Comes After (Issues 103–108)\nVolume 19: March To War (Issues 109–114)\nVolume 20: All Out War – Part One (Issues 115–120)\nVolume 21: All Out War – Part Two (Issues 121–126)\nVolume 22: A New Beginning (Issues 127–132)\nVolume 23: Whispers Into Screams (Issues 133–138)\nVolume 24: Life And Death (Issues 139–144)\nVolume 25: No Turning Back (Issues 145–150)\nVolume 26: Call To Arms (Issues 151–156)\nVolume 27: The Whisperer War (Issues 157–162)\nVolume 28: A Certain Doom (Issues 163–168)\nVolume 29: Lines We Cross (Issues 169–174)\nVolume 30: New World Order (Issues 175-180)\n\nRick Grimes is the main character, a deputy who is comatose when the zombie apocalypse begins. With his wife Lori and son Carl, he joins with groups other survivors. He is joined by former best friend Shane, who secretly has a sexual relationship with Lori. The group consists of firm clerk and college graduate Andrea and her sister Amy, a mechanic named Jim, car salesman Dale, shoe salesman Allen and his wife, Donna as well as their children, Ben and Billy. Lori and Carl form friendships with other survivors such as Carol and Sophia.\n\nAfter leaving the camp, Rick gains a right-hand man and close friendship in Tyreese, who is accompanied by his daughter and her boyfriend. They soon find a farm run by Hershel Greene. Among Hershel's seven children is Maggie Greene, who forms a relationship with Glenn. As the group settle at a prison, they become conflicted with a group of surviving prisoners. Otis meets a katana-wielding survivor named Michonne, who is brought into the group, but struggles to acclimate, facing her own demons. Michonne, Rick and Glenn are later held in captivity by The Governor, a leader of a town called Woodbury who plan to take over the prison. Other Woodbury residents include Alice Warren, who changes sides to Rick's group and delivers Lori's baby, Bob Stookey, an army medic responsible for saving The Governor's life and Lilly, one of The Governor's soldiers.\n\nAfter the prison assault, the remaining group survivors regroup at Hershel's farm, and meet Abraham Ford, Eugene Porter and Rosita Espinosa. The group travel to Washington DC where they are hunted by Chris, encounter Gabriel Stokes, a priest, and are then recruited by Aaron and his boyfriend, Eric to join the Alexandria Safe-Zone, run by congressman, Douglas Monroe. Among the residents are Heath and Dr. Denise Cloyd, who quickly become close allies to the core group, and eventually the conflicted Nicholas. Douglas' son, Spencer tries to form a relationship with Andrea. Rick falls in love with Jessie Anderson, an abused wife. Abraham forms a relationship with Holly, a member of the construction crew. A group of men, known as The Scavengers, tries to conquer Alexandria; the fight attracts a pack of walkers that invades the safe zone, leading to the death of a lot of Alexandrians. Later, the safe zone starts a trading network with the Hilltop Colony, with help from its scout Paul \"Jesus\" Monroe. However, their safety is again threatened by the psychopathic Negan and his group known as The Saviors who reside in a factory. One of the Saviors, Dwight becomes an ally with the communities. The Hilltop and Alexandria join with The Kingdom run by King Ezekiel in a war against the Saviors.\n\nAfter the war, newcomers such as Magna and Dante are introduced into the series. Another community out at sea is established, as well as safety perimeters across the DC area, which is violated by the presence of the Whisperers, a tribe of people disguised as the dead who have rejected the notion of re-establishing civilization. The leader, Alpha, antagonizes Rick as her daughter, Lydia, forms a sexual relationship with Carl. When Alpha's second in command, Beta, takes leadership of the group, he declares war against the communities.\n\nThe \"zombie idea\" developed by George Romero does not exist in The Walking Dead alternate universe; hence, of all the myriad terms used to describe the undead by different communities throughout the show, the word \"zombie\" has been deliberately avoided. While it has been used extremely rarely in the comics, it has never been used in the show.\n\nRick's group classifies the undead as either walkers, roamers or lurkers, the former being more likely to venture toward a loud noise in search of human prey. Other names have been used by characters in the series, including biters and stinkers. The undead follow and mimic each other, which can result in enormous hordes travelling together, \"walking nonstop, following a sound they've all forgotten,\" as Abraham puts it.\n\nThe series received critical acclaim, winning the Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series in 2010 and prompting Eric Sunde of IGN comics to call it \"one of the best monthly comics available\". Among its fans are author Max Brooks. Because of the popularity of the series, which increased considerably when it was adapted into a television series of the same name, artist Tony Moore's original artwork for the series' early issues has gone up in value; on the March 28, 2013 episode of the VH1 reality television series \"For What It's Worth\", Moore's original artwork for Page 7 of issue #1 was professionally appraised to be worth $20,000.\n\nAMC picked up the rights to produce a show based on the comic in 2009. It ordered a pilot episode on January 21, 2010 and began filming on May 15, 2010. The series premiered on October 31, 2010 with high ratings. On November 8, 2010, after broadcasting two episodes, AMC renewed \"The Walking Dead\" for a second season of 13 episodes, which began on October 16, 2011. The TV show is loosely inspired by the comic, introducing new characters and deviating from the comic in certain plot points.\n\nThe fifth season premiered on October 12, 2014, with Scott M. Gimple as the show's third showrunner. Gimple has said that he would stay closer in line to the comic book series events \"as much as possible\", but ultimately remix stories with certain characters, referencing original characters introduced to the show and deceased characters alive in the comic book as a reason for this. Robert Kirkman himself has mentioned that the series will follow much closer to the comic series with Gimple's run.\n\nA companion television series, titled \"Fear The Walking Dead\", debuted on AMC on August 23, 2015. The series features new original characters, and it is set in the city of Los Angeles, California starting prior to the zombie apocalypse. It explores these new characters as the apocalypse begins. The series was created by Robert Kirkman and Dave Erickson, with Erickson serving as showrunner for the series. AMC ordered the series for a two-season commitment, with the first season consisting of six episodes.\n\nAMC released an animated film of the first part of Issue No. 1 of the comic with animation by Juice Films, voice acting by Phil LaMarr and art by Tony Moore.\n\nOn February 18, 2011, Telltale Games announced plans to create an episodic video game based on the series, which was scheduled to debut in fall 2011 and was released worldwide in April 2012. \"\" consists of five episodes, released between April and November 2012. Additional downloadable content, \"400 Days\", was released in July 2013. Kirkman has said that, unlike typical zombie games such as \"Left 4 Dead\", \"it [focuses] more on characterization and emotion than action\".\n\nThe first episode of the sequel, \"\", was released in December 2013 with episode 2 being released in March 2014, episode 3 in May 2014, episode 4 in July 2014, and episode 5 in August 2014.\n\n\"The Walking Dead: The Game\" received widespread critical acclaim, with reviews giving praise for the emotion and characters of the plot. It received many awards, including over 5000 Game of the year awards\n\nIn January 2016, the Kings of War creator Mantic Games announced plans to release a tabletop miniature wargame based on The Walking Dead, named \"The Walking Dead: All Out War\". The miniatures game was funded through the popular crowdfunding site Kickstarter. This product is available for order and first began shipping to backers on 7 November 2016.\n\nA series of novels based on the comics, written by Robert Kirkman and Jay Bonansinga, were released between 2011 and 2014 focusing on the antagonist \"The Governor\". Taking place in the initial outbreak, the books chronicle his experiences from surviving in the newly ravaged world, to the establishment of himself as leader of Woodbury, and finally tying up the conclusion to the prison arc storyline in the comics.\n\nFollowing the , Bonansinga continued the \"Walking Dead\" novels in \"Robert Kirkman's The Walking Dead: Descent\".\n\nThe series has so far been assembled into the following collections:\n\nThe trade paperbacks collect six issues each, but contain only the story and none of the original cover art from the comics. Each paperback follows the convention of having a three-word title. The zombies in the cover art for each paperback form part of a larger image if placed end to end.\n\nAll hardcovers contain the contents of the comics, including the covers, and in some cases bonus material. The books' trim size is larger than the paperbacks. Each hardcover contains two story arcs from the series. Signed versions of the books are available, each limited to 310 pieces.\n\nLimited omnibus editions collect 24 issues in a slipcase with several extras. The first volume is autographed by Kirkman and Adlard, with 300 copies available. Subsequent volumes had print runs of 3000 each, along with deluxe limited editions (signed by Kirkman/Adlard) of 300 copies.\n\nSoftcover compendium editions collect 48 comic issues each. They are also available as limited hardcover editions (Red Foil Version for Compendium 1, Gold Foil Version for Compendium 2, and Gold Foil Version for Compendium 3).\n\nSeveral ancillary books and a special edition have also been published:\n\n",
                "The Walking Dead (season 1)\n\nThe first season of \"The Walking Dead\", an American post-apocalyptic horror television series on AMC, premiered on October 31, 2010, and concluded on December 5, 2010, consisting of 6 episodes. Developed for television by Frank Darabont, who wrote or co-wrote four of the season's six episodes and directed the pilot episode, \"Days Gone Bye\", the series is based on the eponymous series of comic books by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard. It was executive produced by Darabont, Kirkman, David Alpert, Charles H. Eglee, and Gale Anne Hurd, with Darabont assuming the role of showrunner.\n\nThe season received very positive reviews by critics. It was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series – Drama at the 68th Golden Globe Awards and received nominations for the 63rd Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards in several categories, winning Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie, or Special. The pilot episode received 5.35 million viewers, and the finale garnered six million viewers, including four million viewers among adults ages 18–49, making it the most viewed basic cable drama series at that time. Based on its reception, AMC renewed the series for a second season consisting of 13 episodes, which premiered on October 16, 2011.\n\nThis season adapts material from issues #1–6 of the comic book series and introduces notable comic character Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln), who awakens from his coma in a post-apocalyptic world filled with flesh-eating zombies, dubbed \"walkers\". After befriending Morgan Jones (Lennie James), Rick sets outs to find his family and discover the origins of the walker virus.\n\nThe first season features seven actors receiving opening credits billing:\n\n\n\n\nThe series features several actors \"Walking Dead\" developer Frank Darabont has worked with previously, including Laurie Holden, Jeffrey DeMunn, Melissa McBride and Juan Pareja. All four appeared in his 2007 film \"The Mist\", along with Thomas Jane, who originally was set to star in the series when it was pitched to HBO. He is also in talks with Darabont to possibly guest star on the series. Laurie Holden also appeared in the 2001 film \"The Majestic\" (she played Adele Stanton, Jim Carrey's love interest), which Darabont directed. DeMunn has additionally appeared in several of Darabont's films, in addition to \"The Mist\" and \"The Majestic\": \"The Shawshank Redemption\" (1994) and \"The Green Mile\" (1999).\n\nRobert Kirkman, who created the comic book series in 2003, says he had considered the idea of a \"Walking Dead\" television series, but never actively pursued it. \"I certainly wanted it to happen, just because I knew it would be good for the book... I'm certainly not against adaptations, like some creators.\" When Frank Darabont became interested in adapting the comic books for television, Kirkman said it was \"extremely flattering\" and went on to say that, \"He definitely cares about the original source material, and you can tell that in the way he's adapting it. It's an extreme validation of the work... Never in a million years could I have thought that if \"Walking Dead\" were to ever be adapted that everything would be going this well. I think that that's all because of Frank.\"\n\nDarabont himself had been a fan of the zombie genre since seeing George A. Romero's 1968 film \"Night of the Living Dead\" when he was fourteen years old. \"\"Night of the Living Dead\" had this weird vibe that was almost - it was like pornography... It had this marvelously attractive, disreputable draw... I loved it immediately.\" Darabont recalls walking into a comic book store in Burbank, California and seeing \"The Walking Dead\" on the shelf in 2005. \"Being that I've always had \"the love of zombies genre,\" I of course grabbed it, took it home and read it, and immediately started pursuing the rights to it. I thought it would make a great TV show... I loved the idea of an extended, ongoing, serialized dramatic presentation set in the zombie apocalypse.\" He described the process of developing the series and getting it set up at a network as \"four years of frustration,\" and credits executive producer Gale Anne Hurd with finally getting the series on AMC. \"I can't remember what the hell prompted her to read it [the script], but she said, \"Wow, I really love this pilot you wrote. What are you doing with it?\" I said I'd been trying to set it up forever... She said \"I think AMC might be the place to take this.\" She did, and then bam! They were immediately interested. I had to credit Gale, her insight into marrying the material and the buyer.\"\n\nDarabont's original pilot script was split in half and embellished, making the first two episodes instead of one, \"...just to slow the narrative down and dig into the characters more deeply, so it's not just plot-driven, event-driven stuff. You really want to drag these characters into the equation.\" To write the remaining episodes of the season, Darabont recruited Charles H. Eglee, Adam Fierro and Glen Mazzara, all of whom he had worked with while directing an episode of \"The Shield\". Jack LoGiudice also joined the writing team, along with Robert Kirkman, also an executive producer. \"I have the best of both worlds,\" says Kirkman. \"It was a lot of fun writing Episode 104, and I'm hoping if it continues into Season 2, I'll be able to write more episodes.\"\n\nPrincipal photography for the pilot episode, \"Days Gone Bye\", began on May 15, 2010 with the subsequent five episodes beginning filming a few weeks later on June 2. The first season was filmed in and around Atlanta, Georgia where the episodes were primarily set.\n\nThe show's official website released a motion comic based on the first issue of the original comic and voiced by Phil LaMarr. The site also posted a making-of documentary primarily about the first episode, as well as a number of other behind-the-scenes videos and interviews. In the documentary, comic series creator and show executive producer Robert Kirkman as well as artist Charlie Adlard expressed that they were pleased with how faithful the show is to the comic and remark on the similarities between the actors and the comic's original character drawings. Several scenes from \"Days Gone Bye\" were screened July 23, 2010 as part of the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International. Hurd asserted that \"[they] really are doing six one-hour movie\", and Darabont insisted that the series would closely reflect the development in the comics. \"The path is a very strong template. But we're going to take every interesting detour we feel like taking. As long as were staying on the path of what Robert has done, I don't see any reason not to. If they have patience we'll eventually catch up to what Robert is doing.\"\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" debuted during the same week in 120 countries. \"Days Gone Bye\" premiered in Hong Kong on TVB Pearl on August 30, 2011, while it expanded in international markets during the first week of November. Two weeks prior to its official premiere in the United States, the contents of the episode leaked online. As part of an expansive campaign to advertise and heighten anticipation for the premiere, international broadcasting affiliates of AMC and Fox coordinated a worldwide zombie invasion event proceeding days prior to premiere of the episode in the United States. The event occurred in twenty six cities worldwide, and were hosted in select locations including the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., Palace of Westminster in London, Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul, Acropolis of Athens in Athens, and the Museo del Prado in Madrid. The campaign events commenced in Hong Kong and Taipei, and culminated in Los Angeles.\n\n\"The Walking Dead\" was included on the cover of the December 2010 edition of \"Entertainment Weekly\", which featured Rick Grimes pointing a gun at a horde of walkers. According to the journalist of the magazine, it \"examines the past, present, and future\" of the television franchise; \"from the comic book's humble beginnings, to unlikely path to the small screen, to even more unlikely path as a bona fide hit.\" Kirkman was ecstatic upon hearing of the news. \"I've got to say—not to kiss your magazine's a– or anything—but when they called me and said Frank [Darabont] wanted to do the show, I was like, 'Yeah, I'll believe it when I see it.' And then when AMC was like, 'We're picking up the show,' I was like, 'Yeah, alright, whatever.' When they actually started shooting the pilot I was like, 'Well, this is kind of real, this is neat.' But when they called me and said, 'Your show's on the cover of \"Entertainment Weekly\",' I think that was the first time I was like, 'Oh my god, I can't believe this is happening to me!'\"\n\n<onlyinclude></onlyinclude>\n\nThe first season of \"The Walking Dead\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. On Metacritic, the season holds a score of 82 out of 100, indicating \"universal acclaim\", based on 25 critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the season holds an 89% with an average rating of 7.49 out of 10, based on 24 reviews, and an average episode score of 87%. The site's critical consensus reads: \"Blood-spattered, emotionally resonant, and white-knuckle intense, \"The Walking Dead\" puts an intelligent spin on the overcrowded zombie subgenre.\" Following the pilot episode's debut, \"TV Guide\"s Matt Roush called the show \"a stark and harrowing survival parable ... visually stunning ... and daring in its artful use of silence.\" Following the second episode, Simon Abrams from \"Slant Magazine\" awarded the show three and a half stars out of a possible four; \"To say that Darabont has kicked his series off with a bang would be a serious understatement ... [he] has fashioned a fully realized alternate reality and it's a thrilling thing to experience.\"\n\nIn response to the season finale, James Poniewozik of \"TIME\" magazine gave the first season of \"The Walking Dead\" a glowing review stating, \"the show has an urgency and bravery that make it something special\". Josh Jackson of \"Paste\" magazine also praised the season by writing, \"the characters are worth caring about\" despite \"occasional stilted monologues, quick tempers and unfortunate stereotypes\". Some reviews were mixed, including one from Kofi Outlaw of \"Screen Rant\" who concluded, \"The Walking Dead still hasn't really defined itself as anything more than a vague survival story about the human condition\" but added, \"you can be sure I'm one of those Dead-heads already chomping at the bit for season 2\". Sean McKenna of TV Fanatic also offered mixed criticism saying the first season \"had its ups and downs\" noting that the second season should focus on \"a more specific story arc and strengthening of the character development\". Logan Hill of \"New York\" magazine was more critical, claiming the episodes contained \"atrocious dialogue\" and \"a lot of plot machinery that has been contrived to create action suspense but ... hasn't really moved the story itself anywhere in particular\", though he admits the fifth episode showed \"flashes of promise\".\n\nThe first season of \"The Walking Dead\" was named one of the Top 10 Television Programs in 2010 by the American Film Institute. The season was also nominated for Outstanding New Program at the 27th TCA Awards and at the 63rd Writers Guild of America Awards. It was also nominated for Best Television Series – Drama at the 68th Golden Globe Awards and Best Drama Series at the 1st Critics' Choice Television Awards.

The nominations were for Best Actor on Television (Andrew Lincoln), Best Actress on Television (Sarah Wayne Callies), Best Supporting Actor on Television (Steven Yeun), Best Supporting Actress on Television (Laurie Holden), and Best Guest Starring Role on Television (Noah Emmerich).\n\nThe pilot episode, \"Days Gone Bye\", received three Primetime Emmy Award nominations for the 63rd Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, winning Outstanding Prosthetic Makeup for a Series, Miniseries, Movie, or Special, and received nominations for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Special Visual Effects. Frank Darabont was nominated for Outstanding Directorial Achievement in Dramatic Series for his work on \"Days Gone Bye\".\n\nThe pilot received 5.3 million viewers, making it the most-watched series premiere episode of any AMC television series. The first-season finale received 6 million viewers, a season high; with 4 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic, making it the most watched basic cable series for the demographic. The first season had an average of 5.24 million viewers and a rating of 2.7 in the 18-49 demographic. In the United Kingdom, it premiered one week after it did in the United States, on November 5, 2010 on digital channel, FX.

                "Rita Hayworth\n\nRita Hayworth (born Margarita Carmen Cansino; October 17, 1918May 14, 1987) was an American actress and dancer. She achieved fame during the 1940s as one of the era's top stars, appearing in a total of 61 films over 37 years. The press coined the term \"The Love Goddess\" to describe Hayworth after she had become the most glamorous screen idol of the 1940s. She was the top pin-up girl for GIs during World War II.\n\nHayworth is perhaps best known for her performance in the 1946 film noir, \"Gilda\", opposite Glenn Ford, in which she played the \"femme fatale\" in her first major dramatic role. Fred Astaire, with whom she made two films, called her his favorite dance partner. Her greatest success was in the Technicolor musical \"Cover Girl\" (1944), with Gene Kelly. She is listed as one of the top 25 female motion picture stars of all time in the American Film Institute's survey, AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars.\n\nIn 1980, Hayworth was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which contributed to her death at age 68. The public disclosure and discussion of her illness drew attention to Alzheimer's, and helped to increase public and private funding for Alzheimer's research.\n\nHayworth was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1918 as Margarita Carmen Cansino, the oldest child of two dancers. Her father, Eduardo Cansino Sr., was from Castilleja de la Cuesta, a little town near Seville, Spain. \n\nHer mother, Volga Hayworth, was an American of Irish-English descent who had performed with the Ziegfeld Follies. The couple married in 1917. They also had two sons: Eduardo Jr. and Vernon.\n\nMargarita's father wanted her to become a professional dancer, while her mother hoped she would become an actress. Her paternal grandfather, Antonio Cansino, was renowned as a classical Spanish dancer. He popularized the bolero, and his dancing school in Madrid was world-famous. Hayworth later recalled, \"From the time I was three and a half … as soon as I could stand on my own feet, I was given dance lessons.\" She noted \"I didn't like it very much … but I didn't have the courage to tell my father, so I began taking the lessons. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse, that was my girlhood\".\n\nShe attended dance classes every day for a few years in a Carnegie Hall complex, where she was taught by her uncle Angel Cansino. She performed publicly from the age of six. In 1926 at the age of eight, she was featured in \"La Fiesta\", a short film for Warner Bros.\n\nIn 1927, her father took the family to Hollywood. He believed that dancing could be featured in the movies and that his family could be part of it. He established his own dance studio, where he taught such stars as James Cagney and Jean Harlow. During the Great Depression, he lost all his investments as commercial interest in his dancing classes waned.\n\nIn 1931, Eduardo Cansino partnered with his 12-year-old daughter to form an act called the Dancing Cansinos. Since under California law Margarita was too young to work in nightclubs and bars, her father took her with him to work across the border in Tijuana, Mexico. In the early 1930s, it was a popular tourist spot for people from Los Angeles. Because she was working, Cansino never graduated from high school, but she completed the ninth grade at Hamilton High in Los Angeles.\n\nCansino (Hayworth) took a bit part in the film \"Cruz Diablo\" (1934) at age 16, which led to another bit part in the film \"In Caliente\" (1935) with the Mexican actress Dolores del Río. She danced with her father in such nightspots as the Foreign and the Caliente clubs. Winfield Sheehan, the head of the Fox Film Corporation, saw her dancing at the Caliente Club and quickly arranged for Hayworth to do a screen test a week later. Impressed by her screen persona, Sheehan signed her for a short-term, six-month contract at Fox, under the name Rita Cansino, the first of two name changes during her film career.\n\nDuring her time at Fox, Hayworth was billed as Rita Cansino and appeared in unremarkable roles, often cast as the exotic foreigner. In late 1934, aged 16, she performed a dance sequence in the Spencer Tracy film \"Dante's Inferno\" (1935), and was put under contract in February 1935. She had her first speaking role as an Argentinian girl in \"Under the Pampas Moon\" (1935). She played an Egyptian girl in \"Charlie Chan in Egypt\" (1935), and a Russian dancer in \"Paddy O'Day\" (1935). Sheehan was grooming her for the lead in the 1936 Technicolor film \"Ramona\", hoping to establish her as Fox Film's new Dolores del Río.\n\nBy the end of her six-month contract, Fox had merged into 20th Century Fox, with Darryl F. Zanuck serving as the executive producer. Dismissing Sheehan's interest in her and giving Loretta Young the lead in \"Ramona\", Zanuck did not renew Cansino's contract. Sensing her screen potential, salesman and promoter Edward C. Judson, with whom she would elope in 1937, got freelance work for her in several small-studio films and a part in the Columbia Pictures feature \"Meet Nero Wolfe\" (1936). Studio head Harry Cohn signed her to a seven-year contract and tried her out in small roles.\n\nCohn argued that her image was too Mediterranean, which limited her to being cast in \"exotic\" roles that were fewer in number. He was heard to say her last name sounded too Spanish. Judson acted on Cohn's advice: Rita Cansino became Rita Hayworth when she adopted her mother's maiden name, to the consternation of her father. With a name that emphasized her British-American ancestry, people were more likely to regard her as a classic \"American\".\n\nWith Cohn and Judson's encouragement, Hayworth changed her hair color to dark red and had electrolysis to raise her hairline and broaden the appearance of her forehead.\n\nHayworth appeared in five minor Columbia pictures and three minor independent movies in 1937. The following year, she appeared in five Columbia B movies. In 1939, Cohn pressured director Howard Hawks to use Hayworth for a small but important role as a man-trap in the aviation drama \"Only Angels Have Wings,\" in which she played opposite Cary Grant and Jean Arthur.\n\nWith this film's box-office success, fan mail for Hayworth began pouring into Columbia's publicity department. Cohn began to see Hayworth as his first and official new star. The studio never officially had stars under contract, except for Jean Arthur, who was trying to break with it.\n\nCohn began to build up Hayworth in 1940 in features such as \"Music in My Heart\", \"The Lady in Question\", and \"Angels Over Broadway\". That year, she was first featured in a \"Life\" magazine cover story. Cohn loaned Hayworth to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to appear in \"Susan and God\" opposite Joan Crawford. While on loan to Warner Bros., Hayworth appeared as the second female lead in \"The Strawberry Blonde\" (1941), opposite James Cagney. Because the film was a big box-office success, Hayworth's popularity rose and she immediately became one of Hollywood's hottest actresses. So impressed was Warner Bros., they tried to buy Hayworth's contract from Columbia, but Cohn refused to release her.\n\nHer success led to a supporting role in \"Blood and Sand\" (1941) opposite Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell with Fox, the studio that had dropped her six years before. In one of her most notable screen roles, Hayworth played Doña Sol des Muire, the first of many screen sirens.\n\nShe returned in triumph to Columbia Pictures and was cast in the musical \"You'll Never Get Rich\" (1941) opposite Fred Astaire in one of the highest-budgeted films Columbia had ever made. The picture was so successful, the studio produced and released another Astaire-Hayworth picture the following year, \"You Were Never Lovelier\". Astaire's biographer Peter Levinson writes that the dancing combination of Astaire and Hayworth was \"absolute magnetism on the screen.\" Although Astaire made 10 films with Ginger Rogers, his other main dancing partner, Hayworth's sensuality surpassed Rogers's cool technical expertise. \"Rita's youthful exuberance meshed perfectly with Fred's maturity and elegance,\" says Levinson.\n\nWhen Astaire was asked who his favorite dance partner was, he tried not answering the question, but later admitted it was Hayworth: \"All right, I'll give you a name,\" he said. \"But if you ever let it out, I'll swear I lied. It was Rita Hayworth.\" Astaire commented that \"Rita danced with trained perfection and individuality … She was better when she was 'on' than at rehearsal.\" Biographer Charlie Reinhart describes the effect she had on Astaire's style:\n\nIn August 1941, Hayworth was featured in an iconic \"Life\" photo in which she posed in a negligee with a black lace bodice.\n\nBob Landry's photo made Hayworth one of the top two pin-up girls of the World War II years; the other was Betty Grable, in a 1943 photograph. For two years, Hayworth's photograph was the most requested pin-up photograph in circulation. In 2002, the satin nightgown Hayworth wore for the photo sold for $26,888.\n\nIn March 1942, Hayworth visited Brazil as a cultural ambassador for the Roosevelt administration's Good Neighbor policy, under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs.\n\nHayworth had top billing in one of her best-known films, the Technicolor musical \"Cover Girl\", released in 1944. The film established her as Columbia's top star of the 1940s, and it gave her the distinction of being the first of only six women to dance on screen with both Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. \"I guess the only jewels of my life,\" Hayworth said in 1970, \"were the pictures I made with Fred Astaire... And \"Cover Girl\", too.\"\n\nFor three consecutive years, starting in 1944, Hayworth was named one of the top movie box-office attractions in the world. She was adept in ballet, tap, ballroom, and Spanish routines. Cohn continued to showcase Hayworth's dance talents. Columbia featured her in the Technicolor films \"Tonight and Every Night\" (1945) with Lee Bowman and \"Down to Earth\" (1947) with Larry Parks.\n\nHer sexy, glamorous appeal was most noted in Charles Vidor's film noir \"Gilda\" (1946) with Glenn Ford, which caused censors some consternation. The role, in which Hayworth wore black satin and performed a legendary one-glove striptease, \"Put The Blame On Mame\", made her into a cultural icon as a \"femme fatale.\"\n\nWhile \"Gilda\" was in release, it was widely reported that an atomic bomb which was scheduled to be tested at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean's Marshall Islands would bear an image of Hayworth, a reference to her bombshell status. Although the gesture was undoubtedly meant as a compliment, Hayworth was deeply offended. Orson Welles, then married to Hayworth, recalled her anger in an interview with biographer Barbara Leaming: \"Rita used to fly into terrible rages all the time, but the angriest was when she found out that they'd put her on the atom bomb. Rita almost went insane, she was so angry... She wanted to go to Washington to hold a press conference, but Harry Cohn wouldn't let her because it would be unpatriotic.\" Welles tried to persuade Hayworth that the whole business was not a publicity stunt on Cohn's part, that it was simply homage to her from the flight crew.\n\nOn the June 30, 1946 broadcast of \"Orson Welles Commentaries\", Welles said of the imminent test, \"I want my daughter to be able to tell her daughter that grandmother's picture was on the last atom bomb ever to explode.\"\n\nThe fourth atomic bomb ever to be detonated was decorated with a photograph of Hayworth cut from the June 1946 issue of \"Esquire\" magazine. Above it was stenciled the device's nickname, \"Gilda\", in two-inch black letters.\n\nHayworth's performance in Welles's 1947 film \"The Lady from Shanghai\" was critically acclaimed. The film's failure at the box office was attributed in part to Hayworth's famous red hair being cut short and bleached platinum blonde for the role. Cohn had not been consulted and was furious that Hayworth's image was changed.\n\nAlso in 1947, Hayworth was featured in a \"Life\" cover story by Winthrop Sargeant that resulted in her being nicknamed \"The Love Goddess\". The term was adopted and used later as the title of a biopic and of a biography about her. In a 1980s interview, Hayworth said, \"Everybody else does nude scenes, but I don't. I never made nude movies. I didn't have to do that. I danced. I was provocative, I guess, in some things. But I was not completely exposed.\"\n\nHer next film, \"The Loves of Carmen\" (1948) with Glenn Ford, was the first film co-produced by Columbia and Hayworth's production company, The Beckworth Corporation (named for Rebecca, her daughter with Welles). It was Columbia's biggest moneymaker that year. She received a percentage of the profits from this and all her subsequent films until 1954, when she dissolved Beckworth to pay off debts.\n\nIn 1948, at the height of her fame, Hayworth traveled to Cannes and was introduced to Prince Aly Khan. They began a year-long courtship, and were married on May 27, 1949. Hayworth left Hollywood and sailed for France, breaking her contract with Columbia.\n\nBecause Hayworth was already one of the most well-known celebrities in the world, the courtship and the wedding received enormous press coverage around the world. Because she was still legally married to second husband Orson Welles, Hayworth also received some negative backlash for her courtship with the prince, causing some American fans to boycott her pictures. The wedding marked the first time a Hollywood actress became a princess. On December 28, 1949, Hayworth gave birth to the couple's only daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan.\n\nThough Hayworth was anxious to start a new life abroad, away from Hollywood, Aly Khan's flamboyant lifestyle and duties proved too difficult for Hayworth. She struggled to fit in with his friends, and found it difficult to learn French. Aly Khan was also known in circles as a playboy, and it was suspected that he had been unfaithful to Hayworth during the marriage.\n\nIn 1951, Hayworth set sail with her two daughters for New York. Although the couple did reconcile for a short time, they officially divorced in 1953.\n\nAfter the collapse of her marriage to Khan, Rita Hayworth was forced to return to Hollywood to star in her \"comeback\" picture, \"Affair in Trinidad\" (1952) which again paired her with Glenn Ford. Director Vincent Sherman recalled that Hayworth seemed \"rather frightened at the approach of doing another picture\". She continued to clash with Columbia boss Harry Cohn, and was placed on suspension during filming. Nevertheless, the picture was highly publicized. The picture ended up grossing $1 million more than her previous blockbuster, \"Gilda\".\n\nShe continued to star in a string of successful pictures. In 1953, she had two films released: \"Salome\" with Charles Laughton and Stewart Granger, and \"Miss Sadie Thompson\" with José Ferrer and Aldo Ray. She was off the big screen for another four years, mainly because of a tumultuous marriage to the singer Dick Haymes. During her marriage to Haymes, she was involved in much negative publicity, which significantly lessened her appeal. By the time she returned to the screen for \"Fire Down Below\" (1957), Kim Novak had become Columbia's top female star. Her last musical was \"Pal Joey\" (1957). After this film, Hayworth left Columbia for good.\n\nShe received good reviews for her performance in \"Separate Tables\" (1958), with Burt Lancaster and David Niven, and \"The Story on Page One\" (1960). She continued working throughout the 1960s. In 1962, her planned Broadway debut in \"Step on a Crack\" was cancelled for undisclosed health reasons. \"The Money Trap\" (1964) paired her, for the last time, with good friend Glenn Ford. She continued to act in films until the early 1970s. She made comedic television appearances on \"Laugh In\" and \"The Carol Burnett Show\" in the 1970s. Her last film was \"The Wrath of God\" (1972).\n\nHayworth had a strained relationship with Columbia Pictures for many years. In 1943, she was suspended without pay for nine weeks because she refused to appear in \"Once Upon a Time\". During this period in Hollywood, contract players could not choose their films; they were on salary rather than receiving a fixed amount per picture.\n\nIn 1947, Hayworth's new contract with Columbia provided a salary of $250,000 plus 50% of film's profits.\n\nIn 1951, Columbia alleged it had $800,000 invested in properties for her, including the film she walked out on that year. Hayworth left Hollywood to marry Prince Aly Khan and was suspended for failing to report to work on the film \"Affair in Trinidad\". In 1952, Hayworth refused to report for work because she objected to the script.\n\nIn 1955, she sued Columbia Pictures to be released from her contract, but asked for her $150,000 salary, alleging that the filming failed to start when agreed. She said, \"I was in Switzerland when they sent me the script for \"Affair in Trinidad\" and I threw it across the room. But I did the picture, and \"Pal Joey\", too. I came back to Columbia because I wanted to work and first, see, I had to finish that goddamn contract, which is how Harry Cohn \"owned\" me!\"\n\n\"Harry Cohn thought of me as one of the people he could exploit, and make a lot of money,\" Hayworth said in 1972. \"And I did make a lot of money for him, but not much for me.\"\n\nYears after her film career had ended and long after Cohn had died, Hayworth still resented her treatment by both him and Columbia. She spoke bluntly in a 1968 interview:\n\nI used to have to punch a time clock at Columbia. Every day of my life. That's what it was like. I was under exclusive contract, like they owned me … I think he had my dressing room bugged … He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him … You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.\n\nHayworth resented the fact that the studio had failed to train her to sing or even to encourage her to learn how to sing. Although she appeared to sing in many of her films, she was usually dubbed. Because the public did not know her secret, she was embarrassed to be asked to sing by troops at USO shows.\n\n\"I wanted to study singing\", Hayworth complained, \"but Harry Cohn kept saying, 'Who needs it?' and the studio wouldn't pay for it. They had me so intimidated that I couldn't have done it anyway. They always said, 'Oh, no, we can't let you do it. There's no time for that; it has to be done right now!' I was under contract, and that was it.\"\n\nHayworth did sing the acoustic guitar version of \"Put the Blame on Mame\" in \"Gilda\". The other songs in the picture were dubbed by Anita Ellis.\n\nCohn had a reputation as a taskmaster, but he had his own criticisms of Hayworth. He had invested heavily in her before she began a reckless affair with the married Aly Khan, and it could have caused a backlash against her career and Columbia's success. For instance, an article in the British periodical \"The People\" called for a boycott of Hayworth's films: \"Hollywood must be told its already tarnished reputation will sink to rock bottom if it restores this reckless woman to a place among its stars.\"\n\nCohn expressed his frustration in a 1957 interview with \"Time\" magazine: \"Hayworth might be worth ten million dollars today easily! She owned 25% of the profits with her own company and had hit after hit and she had to get married and had to get out of the business and took a suspension because she fell in love again! In five years, at two pictures a year, at 25%! Think of what she could have made! But she didn't make pictures! She took two or three suspensions! She got mixed up with different characters! Unpredictable!\"\n\nHayworth was a top glamour girl in the 1940s, a pin-up girl for military servicemen and a beauty icon for women. At and , she was tall enough to be a concern for dancing partners such as Fred Astaire. She reportedly changed her hair color eight times in eight movies.\n\nIn 1949, Hayworth's lips were voted best in the world by the Artists League of America. She had a modeling contract with Max Factor to promote its Tru-Color lipsticks and Pan-Stik make-up.\n\nIn 1941, Hayworth said she was the antithesis of the characters she played. \"I naturally am very shy … and I suffer from an inferiority complex.\" Her provocative role in \"Gilda\", in particular, was responsible for people expecting her to be what she was not. Hayworth once said, with some bitterness, \"Men go to bed with Gilda, but wake up with me.\"\n\nHayworth's two younger brothers, Eduardo Cansino Jr. ((October 13, 1919 – March 11, 1974) and Vernon Cansino, both served in World War II. Vernon left the United States Army in 1946 with several medals, including the Purple Heart, and later married Susan Vail, a dancer. Eduardo Jr. followed Hayworth into acting; he was also under contract with Columbia Pictures. In 1950, he made his screen debut in \"The Great Adventures of Captain Kidd\".\n\nHayworth was married and divorced five times. She said, \"Basically, I am a good, gentle person, but I am attracted to mean personalities.\"\n\nIn 1937, when Hayworth was 18, she married Edward Judson, an oilman turned promoter who was more than twice her age. They married in Las Vegas. He had played a major role in launching her acting career. A shrewd businessman, he was domineering and became her manager for months before he proposed. \"He helped me with my career,\" Hayworth conceded after they divorced, \"and helped himself to my money.\" She alleged that Judson compelled her to transfer a considerable amount of her property to him and she promised to pay him $12,000 under threats that he would do her \"great bodily harm.\" \n\nShe filed for divorce from him on February 24, 1942, with a complaint of cruelty. She noted to the press that his work took him to Oklahoma and Texas while she lived and worked in Hollywood. Judson was as old as her father, who was enraged by the marriage, which caused a rift between Hayworth and her parents until the divorce. Judson had failed to tell Hayworth before they married that he had previously been married twice. When she left him, she literally had no money; she asked her friend Hermes Pan if she could eat at his home.\n\nHayworth married Orson Welles on September 7, 1943, during the run of \"The Mercury Wonder Show\". None of her colleagues knew about the planned wedding (before a judge) until she announced it the day before. For the civil ceremony, she wore a beige suit, a ruffled white blouse, and a veil. A few hours after they got married, they returned to work at the studio. They had a daughter, Rebecca, who was born on December 17, 1944, and died at the age of 59 on October 17, 2004. They struggled in their marriage. Hayworth said that Welles did not want to be tied down:\nDuring the entire period of our marriage, he showed no interest in establishing a home. When I suggested purchasing a home, he told me he didn't want the responsibility. Mr. Welles told me he never should have married in the first place; that it interfered with his freedom in his way of life.\n\nHayworth called Welles the great love of her life. On November 10, 1947, she was granted a divorce that became final the following year.\n\nIn 1948, Hayworth left her film career to marry Prince Aly Khan, a son of Sultan Mahommed Shah, Aga Khan III, the leader of the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam. They were married on May 27, 1949. Her bridal trousseau had been influenced by Dior's \"New Look\", launched in 1947.\n\nAly Khan and his family were heavily involved in horse racing, owning and racing horses. Hayworth had no interest in the sport, but became a member of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club anyway. Her filly, Double Rose, won several races in France and finished second in the 1949 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.\n\nIn 1951, while still married to Hayworth, Khan was spotted dancing with the actress Joan Fontaine in the nightclub where he and Hayworth had met. Hayworth threatened to divorce him in Reno, Nevada. In early May, Hayworth moved to Nevada to establish legal residence to qualify for a divorce. She stayed at Lake Tahoe with their daughter, saying there was a threat the child would be kidnapped. Hayworth filed for divorce from Khan on September 2, 1951, on the grounds of \"extreme cruelty, entirely mental in nature.\"\n\nHayworth once said she might convert to Islam, but did not. During the custody fight over their daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, born , the prince said he wanted her to be raised as a Muslim; Hayworth wanted the child to be raised as a Christian. Hayworth rejected his offer of $1 million if she would rear Yasmin as a Muslim from age seven and allow her to go to Europe to visit with him for two or three months each year, stating:\nNothing will make me give up Yasmin's chance to live here in America among our precious freedoms and habits. While I respect the Muslim faith, and all other faiths, it is my earnest wish that my daughter be raised as a normal, healthy American girl in the Christian faith. There isn't any amount of money in the entire world for which it is worth sacrificing this child's privilege of living as a normal Christian girl here in the United States. There just isn't anything else in the world that can compare with her sacred chance to do that. And I'm going to give it to Yasmin regardless of what it costs.In January 1953 Hayworth was granted a divorce from Aly Khan on the grounds of extreme mental cruelty. Hayworth's daughter Yasmin played about the court while the case was being heard, finally climbing on to the Judge's lap.\n\nWhen Hayworth and Dick Haymes first met, he was still married and his singing career was waning. When she showed up at the clubs, he got a larger audience. Haymes was desperate for money, because two of his former wives were taking legal action against him for unpaid child support. His financial problems were so bad, he could not return to California without being arrested. On July 7, 1954, his ex-wife Nora Haymes got a bench warrant for his arrest, because he owed her $3,800 in alimony. Less than a week earlier, his other ex-wife, Joanne Dru, also got a bench warrant because she said he owed $4,800 in support payments for their three children. Hayworth ended up paying most of Haymes's debts.\n\nHaymes was born in Argentina, and did not have solid proof of American citizenship. Not long after he met Hayworth, U.S. officials initiated proceedings to have him deported to Argentina for being an illegal alien. He hoped Hayworth could influence the government and keep him in the United States. When she assumed responsibility for his citizenship, a bond was formed that led to marriage. The two were married on September 24, 1953, at the Sands Hotel, Las Vegas, and their wedding procession went through the casino.\n\nFrom the start of their marriage, Haymes was deeply indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). When Hayworth took time off from attending his comeback performances in Philadelphia, the audiences sharply declined. Haymes's $5000 weekly salary was attached by the IRS to pay a $100,000 bill, and he was unable to pay his pianist. Haymes' ex-wives demanded money while Hayworth publicly bemoaned her own lack of alimony from Aly Khan. At one point, the couple was effectively imprisoned in a hotel room for 24 hours in Manhattan at the Hotel Madison as sheriff's deputies waited outside threatening to arrest Haymes for outstanding debts. At the same time, Hayworth was fighting a severe custody battle with Khan, during which she reported death threats against their children. While living in New York, Hayworth sent the children to live with their nanny in Westchester County. They were found and photographed by a reporter from \"Confidential\" magazine.\n\nAfter a tumultuous two years together, Haymes struck Hayworth in the face in 1955 in public at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. Hayworth packed her bags, walked out, and never returned. The assault and crisis shook her, and her doctor ordered her to remain in bed for several days.\n\nHayworth was short of money after her marriage to Haymes. She had failed to gain child support from Aly Khan. She sued Orson Welles for back payment of child support which she claimed had never been paid. This effort was unsuccessful and added to her stress.\n\nHayworth began a relationship with film producer James Hill, whom she went on to marry on February 2, 1958. He put her in one of her last major films, \"Separate Tables.\" This film was popular and highly praised, although \"The Harvard Lampoon\" named her the worst actress of 1958 for her performance. On September 1, 1961, Hayworth filed for divorce, alleging extreme mental cruelty. Hill later wrote \"Rita Hayworth: A Memoir\", in which he suggested that their marriage collapsed because he wanted Hayworth to continue making movies, while she wanted them both to retire from Hollywood.\n\nIn his autobiography, Charlton Heston wrote about Hayworth's brief marriage to Hill. One night Heston and his wife Lydia joined the couple for dinner at a restaurant in Spain with the director George Marshall and the actor Rex Harrison, Hayworth's co-star in \"The Happy Thieves\". Heston wrote that the occasion \"turned into the single most embarrassing evening of my life,\" describing how Hill heaped \"obscene abuse\" on Hayworth until she was \"reduced to a helpless flood of tears, her face buried in her hands.\" Heston wrote that the others sat stunned, witnesses to a \"marital massacre\" and, though he was \"strongly tempted to slug him\" (Hill), he left with his wife Lydia after she stood up, almost in tears. Heston wrote, \"I'm ashamed of walking away from Miss Hayworth's humiliation. I never saw her again.\"\n\nOrson Welles noted Hayworth's problem with alcohol during their marriage, but he never believed that her problem was alcoholism. \"It certainly imitated alcoholism in every superficial way,\" he recalled in 1983. \"She'd fly into these rages, never at me, never once, always at Harry Cohn or her father or her mother or her brother. She would break all the furniture and she'd get in a car and I'd have to get in the car and try to control her. She'd drive up in the hills suicidally. Terrible, terrible nights. And I just saw this lovely girl destroying herself. I admire Yasmin so much.\"\n\nYasmin Aga Khan spoke of her mother's long struggle with alcohol:\nI remember as a child that she had a drinking problem. She had difficulty coping with the ups and downs of the business ...As a child, I thought, 'She has a drinking problem and she's an alcoholic.' That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner ... Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.\n\nIn 1972, the 54-year-old Hayworth wanted to retire from acting, but she needed money. At the suggestion of Robert Mitchum, she agreed to film \"The Wrath of God\". The experience exposed her poor health and her worsening mental state. Because she could not remember her lines, her scenes were shot one line at a time. In November, she agreed to complete one more movie, the British film \"Tales That Witness Madness\", but because of her worsening health, she left the set and returned to the United States. She never returned to acting.\n\nIn March 1974, both of her brothers died within a week of each other, which caused her great sadness and led to heavy drinking. In January 1976 at London's Heathrow Airport, Hayworth was removed from a TWA flight after having an angry outburst while traveling with her agent. The event attracted much negative publicity; a disturbing photograph was published in newspapers the next day. Hayworth's alcoholism hid symptoms of what was eventually understood to be Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"It was the outbursts,\" said Yasmin Aga Khan. \"She'd fly into a rage. I can't tell you. I thought it was alcoholism—alcoholic dementia. We all thought that. The papers picked that up, of course. You can't imagine the relief just in getting a diagnosis. We had a name at last, Alzheimer's! Of course, that didn't really come until the last seven or eight years. She wasn't diagnosed as having Alzheimer's until 1980. There were two decades of hell before that.\"\n\nBiographer Barbara Leaming wrote that Hayworth aged prematurely because of her addiction to alcohol and also because of the many stresses in her life. \"Despite the artfully applied make-up and shoulder-length red hair, there was no concealing the ravages of drink and stress,\" she wrote of Hayworth's arrival in New York in May 1956 in order to begin work on \"Fire Down Below\", her first film in three years. \"Deep lines had crept around her eyes and mouth, and she appeared worn, exhausted—older than her thirty-eight years.\"\n\nAlzheimer's disease had been largely forgotten by the medical community since its discovery in 1906. Medical historian Barron H. Lerner wrote that when Hayworth's diagnosis was made public in 1981, she became \"the first public face of Alzheimer's, helping to ensure that future patients did not go undiagnosed...Unbeknownst to her, Hayworth helped to destigmatize a condition that can still embarrass victims and their families.\"\n\nIn July 1981, Hayworth's health had deteriorated to the point that a judge in Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that she should be placed under the care of her daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan of New York City. Hayworth lived in an apartment at The San Remo on Central Park West adjoining that of her daughter, who arranged for her mother's care during her final years. When asked how her mother was doing, Yasmin replied, \"She's still beautiful. But it's a shell.\"\n\nIn 1983, Rebecca Welles arranged to see her mother for the first time in seven years. Speaking to his lifelong friend Roger Hill, Orson Welles expressed his concern about the visit's effect on his daughter. \"Rita barely knows me now,\" Welles said. He recalled seeing Hayworth three years before at an event which the Reagans held for Frank Sinatra. \"When it was over, I came over to her table and I saw that she was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, I could see that she realized who I was, and she began to cry quietly.\"\n\nIn an interview which he gave the evening before his death in 1985, Welles called Hayworth \"one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived\".\n\nHayworth was a lifelong Democrat who was an active member of the Hollywood Democratic Committee and was active in the campaign of Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the 1944 presidential election.\n\nHayworth was a Roman Catholic whose marriage to Prince Aly Khan was deemed \"illicit\" by The Pope.\n\nRita Hayworth lapsed into a semicoma in February 1987. She died at age 68 from complications associated with Alzheimer's disease three months later on May 14, 1987, at her home in Manhattan. President Ronald Reagan, who had been one of Hayworth's contemporaries in Hollywood, issued a statement:\n\nRita Hayworth was one of our country's most beloved stars. Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl. In her later years, Rita became known for her struggle with Alzheimer's disease. Her courage and candor, and that of her family, were a great public service in bringing worldwide attention to a disease which we all hope will soon be cured. Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend who we will miss. We extend our deep sympathy to her family.\n\nA funeral service was held on May 18, 1987, at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Pallbearers included actors Ricardo Montalbán, Glenn Ford, Don Ameche, agent Budd Burton Moss, and the choreographer Hermes Pan. She was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. Her headstone includes Yasmin's sentiment: \"To yesterday's companionship and tomorrow's reunion.\"\n\nHayworth received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama for her performance in \"Circus World\" (1964).\n\nIn 1978 at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, DC, Hayworth was presented with the inaugural National Screen Heritage Award of the National Film Society, a group that published \"American Classic Screen\" magazine (1976–84).\n\nIn 1999, Hayworth was acknowledged as one of the top-25 greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood cinema in the American Film Institute's survey, AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars.\n\nThe public disclosure and discussion of Hayworth's illness drew international attention to Alzheimer's disease, which was little known at the time, and it helped to greatly increase federal funding for Alzheimer's research.\n\nThe Rita Hayworth Gala, a benefit for the Alzheimer's Association, is held annually in Chicago and New York City. The program was founded in 1985 by Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, in honor of her mother. She is the hostess for the events and a major sponsor of Alzheimer's disease charities and awareness programs. , a total of more than $72 million had been raised through events in Chicago, New York and Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nOn October 17, 2016, a press release from the Springer Associates Public Relations Agency announced that Rita Hayworth's former manager and friend, Budd Burton Moss, initiated a campaign to solicit the United States Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp featuring Hayworth. Springer Associates also announced that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would be lobbied in hopes of having an honorary Academy Award issued in memory of Hayworth. The press release added that Hayworth's daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, the Alzheimer's Association of Greater Los Angeles, and numerous prominent personalities of stage and screen were supporting the Moss campaign. The press release stated the target date for fulfillment of the stamp and Academy Award to be on October 17, 2018, on what will be the centennial of Hayworth's birth.\n\nThe film \"I Remember Better When I Paint\" (2009) describes how Hayworth took up painting while struggling with Alzheimer's and produced art.\n\n\n",
                "Orson Welles\n\nGeorge Orson Welles (; May 6, 1915 – October 10, 1985) was an American actor, director, writer, and producer who worked in theatre, radio, and film. He is remembered for his innovative work in all three: in theatre, most notably \"Caesar\" (1937), a Broadway adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Julius Caesar\"; in radio, the legendary 1938 broadcast \"The War of the Worlds\"; and in film, \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), consistently ranked as one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nIn his 20s, Welles directed a number of high-profile stage productions for the Federal Theatre Project, including an adaptation of \"Macbeth\" with an entirely African American cast, and the political musical \"The Cradle Will Rock\". In 1937 he and John Houseman founded the Mercury Theatre, an independent repertory theatre company that presented a series of productions on Broadway through 1941. Welles found national and international fame as the director and narrator of a 1938 radio adaptation of H. G. Wells' novel \"The War of the Worlds\" performed for his radio anthology series \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\". It reportedly caused widespread panic when listeners thought that an invasion by extraterrestrial beings was actually occurring. Although some contemporary sources claim these reports of panic were mostly false and overstated, they rocketed Welles to notoriety.\n\nHis first film was \"Citizen Kane\" (1941), which he co-wrote, produced, directed, and starred in as Charles Foster Kane. Welles was an outsider to the studio system and directed only 13 full-length films in his career. He struggled for creative control on his projects early on with the major film studios and later in life with a variety of independent financiers, and his films were either heavily edited or remained unreleased. His distinctive directorial style featured layered and nonlinear narrative forms, uses of lighting such as chiaroscuro, unusual camera angles, sound techniques borrowed from radio, deep focus shots, and long takes. He has been praised as \"the ultimate auteur\".\n\nWelles followed up \"Citizen Kane\" with 12 other feature films, the most acclaimed of which include \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942), \"Touch of Evil\" (1958), and \"Chimes at Midnight\" (1966). Other works of his, such as \"The Lady from Shanghai\" (1947) and \"F for Fake\" (1973), are also well-regarded.\n\nIn 2002, Welles was voted the greatest film director of all time in two British Film Institute polls among directors and critics. Known for his baritone voice, Welles was an actor in radio and film, a Shakespearean stage actor, and a magician noted for presenting troop variety shows in the war years.\n\nGeorge Orson Welles was born May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, son of Richard Head Welles (b. Richard Hodgdon Wells, November 12, 1872, near St. Joseph, Missouri; d. December 28, 1930, Chicago, Illinois) and Beatrice Ives Welles (b. Beatrice Lucy Ives, September 1, 1883, Springfield, Illinois; d. May 10, 1924, Chicago). He was named after his paternal great-grandfather, influential Kenosha attorney Orson S. Head, and his brother George Head. An alternative story of the source of his first and middle names is one told by George Ade, who met Welles's parents on a West Indies cruise toward the end of 1914. Ade was traveling with a friend, Orson Wells (no relation), and the two of them sat at the same table as Mr. and Mrs. Richard Welles. Mrs Welles was pregnant at the time, and when they said good-by, she told them that she had enjoyed their company so much that if the child were a boy, she intended to name it for them - George Orson. Welles's birth announcement and a picture of him as a young boy are among George Ade's papers at Purdue University.\n\nDespite his family's affluence, Welles encountered hardship in childhood. His parents separated and moved to Chicago in 1919. His father, who made a fortune as the inventor of a popular bicycle lamp, became an alcoholic and stopped working. Welles's mother, a pianist, played during lectures by Dudley Crafts Watson at the Art Institute of Chicago to support her son and herself; the oldest Welles boy, \"Dickie\", was institutionalized at an early age because he had learning difficulties. Beatrice died of hepatitis in a Chicago hospital May 10, 1924, just after Welles's ninth birthday. The Gordon String Quartet, which had made its first appearance at her home in 1921, played at Beatrice's funeral.\n\nAfter his mother's death, Welles ceased pursuing music. It was decided that he would spend the summer with the Watson family at a private art colony in Wyoming, New York, established by Lydia Avery Coonley Ward. There he played and became friends with the children of the Aga Khan, including the 12-year-old Prince Aly Khan. Then, in what Welles later described as \"a hectic period\" in his life, he lived in a Chicago apartment with both his father and Dr. Maurice Bernstein, a Chicago physician who had been a close friend of both his parents. Welles briefly attended public school before his alcoholic father left business altogether and took him along on his travels to Jamaica and the Far East. When they returned they settled in a hotel in Grand Detour, Illinois, that was owned by his father. When the hotel burned down, Welles and his father took to the road again.\n\n\"During the three years that Orson lived with his father, some observers wondered who took care of whom\", wrote biographer Frank Brady.\n\n\"In some ways, he was never really a young boy, you know,\" said Roger Hill, who became Welles's teacher and lifelong friend.\n\nWelles briefly attended public school in Madison, Wisconsin, enrolled in the fourth grade. On September 15, 1926, he entered the Todd Seminary for Boys, an expensive independent school in Woodstock, Illinois, that his older brother, Richard Ives Welles, had attended ten years before but was expelled for misbehavior. At Todd School, Welles came under the influence of Roger Hill, a teacher who was later Todd's headmaster. Hill provided Welles with an \"ad hoc\" educational environment that proved invaluable to his creative experience, allowing Welles to concentrate on subjects that interested him. Welles performed and staged theatrical experiments and productions there.\n\n\"Todd provided Welles with many valuable experiences\", wrote critic Richard France. \"He was able to explore and experiment in an atmosphere of acceptance and encouragement. In addition to a theater the school's own radio station was at his disposal.\" Welles' first radio experience was on the Todd station, he performed an adaptation of \"Sherlock Holmes\" that was written by him.\n\nOn December 28, 1930, when Welles was 15, his father died of heart and kidney failure at the age of 58, alone in a hotel in Chicago. Shortly before this, Welles had announced to his father that he would stop seeing him, believing it would prompt his father to refrain from drinking. As a result, Orson felt guilty because he believed his father had drunk himself to death because of him. His father's will left it to Orson to name his guardian. When Roger Hill declined, Welles chose Maurice Bernstein.\n\nFollowing graduation from Todd in May 1931, Welles was awarded a scholarship to Harvard University, while his mentor Roger Hill advocated he attend Cornell College in Iowa. Rather than enrolling, he chose travel. He studied for a few weeks at the Art Institute of Chicago with Boris Anisfeld, who encouraged him to pursue painting.\n\nWelles would occasionally return to Woodstock, the place he eventually named when he was asked in a 1960 interview, \"Where is home?\" Welles replied, \"I suppose it's Woodstock, Illinois, if it's anywhere. I went to school there for four years. If I try to think of a home, it's that.\"\n\nAfter his father's death, Welles traveled to Europe using a small portion of his inheritance. Welles said that while on a walking and painting trip through Ireland, he strode into the Gate Theatre in Dublin and claimed he was a Broadway star. The manager of Gate, Hilton Edwards, later said he had not believed him but was impressed by his brashness and an impassioned audition he gave. Welles made his stage debut at the Gate Theatre on October 13, 1931, appearing in Ashley Dukes's adaptation of \"Jew Suss\" as Duke Karl Alexander of Württemberg. He performed small supporting roles in subsequent Gate productions, and he produced and designed productions of his own in Dublin. In March 1932 Welles performed in W. Somerset Maugham's \"The Circle\" at Dublin's Abbey Theatre and travelled to London to find additional work in the theatre. Unable to obtain a work permit, he returned to the U.S.\n\nWelles found his fame ephemeral and turned to a writing project at Todd School that would become the immensely successful, first entitled \"Everybody's Shakespeare\" and subsequently, \"The Mercury Shakespeare\". Welles traveled to North Africa while working on thousands of illustrations for the \"Everybody's Shakespeare\" series of educational books, a series that remained in print for decades.\n\nIn 1933, Roger and Hortense Hill invited Welles to a party in Chicago, where Welles met Thornton Wilder. Wilder arranged for Welles to meet Alexander Woollcott in New York, in order that he be introduced to Katharine Cornell, who was assembling a repertory theatre company. Cornell's husband, director Guthrie McClintic, immediately put Welles under contract and cast him in three plays. \"Romeo and Juliet\", \"The Barretts of Wimpole Street\" and \"Candida\" toured in repertory for 36 weeks beginning in November 1933, with the first of more than 200 performances taking place in Buffalo, New York.\n\nIn 1934, Welles got his first job on radio—on \"The American School of the Air\"—through actor-director Paul Stewart, who introduced him to director Knowles Entrikin. That summer Welles staged a drama festival with the Todd School in Woodstock, Illinois, inviting Micheál Mac Liammóir and Hilton Edwards from Dublin's Gate Theatre to appear along with New York stage luminaries in productions including \"Trilby\", \"Hamlet\", \"The Drunkard\" and \"Tsar Paul\". At the old firehouse in Woodstock he also shot his first film, an eight-minute short titled \"The Hearts of Age\".\n\nOn November 14, 1934, Welles married Chicago socialite and actress Virginia Nicolson (often misspelled \"Nicholson\") in a civil ceremony in New York. To appease the Nicolsons, who were furious at the couple's elopement, a formal ceremony took place December 23, 1934, at the New Jersey mansion of the bride's godmother. Welles wore a cutaway borrowed from his friend George Macready.\n\nA revised production of Katharine Cornell's \"Romeo and Juliet\" opened December 20, 1934, at the Martin Beck Theatre in New York. The Broadway production brought the 19-year-old Welles (now playing Tybalt) to the notice of John Houseman, a theatrical producer who was casting the lead role in the debut production of Archibald MacLeish's verse play, \"Panic\". On March 22, 1935, Welles made his debut on the CBS Radio series \"The March of Time\", performing a scene from \"Panic\" for a news report on the stage production\n\nBy 1935 Welles was supplementing his earnings in the theater as a radio actor in Manhattan, working with many actors who would later form the core of his Mercury Theatre on programs including \"America's Hour\", \"Cavalcade of America\", \"Columbia Workshop\" and \"The March of Time\". \"Within a year of his debut Welles could claim membership in that elite band of radio actors who commanded salaries second only to the highest paid movie stars,\" wrote critic Richard France.\n\nPart of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project (1935–39) was a New Deal program to fund theatre and other live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the United States during the Great Depression. It was created as a relief measure to employ artists, writers, directors and theater workers. Under national director Hallie Flanagan it was shaped into a true national theatre that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation and innovation, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time.\nJohn Houseman, director of the Negro Theatre Unit in New York, invited Welles to join the Federal Theatre Project in 1935. Far from unemployed — \"I was so employed I forgot how to sleep\" — Welles put a large share of his $1,500-a-week radio earnings into his stage productions, bypassing administrative red tape and mounting the projects more quickly and professionally. \"Roosevelt once said that I was the only operator in history who ever illegally siphoned money \"into\" a Washington project,\" Welles said.\n\nThe Federal Theatre Project was the ideal environment in which Welles could develop his art. Its purpose was employment, so he was able to hire any number of artists, craftsmen and technicians, and he filled the stage with performers. The company for the first production, an adaptation of William Shakespeare's \"Macbeth\" with an entirely African-American cast, numbered 150. The production became known as the \"Voodoo Macbeth\" because Welles changed the setting to a mythical island suggesting the Haitian court of King Henri Christophe, with Haitian \"vodou\" fulfilling the rôle of Scottish witchcraft. The play opened April 14, 1936, at the Lafayette Theatre in Harlem and was received rapturously. At 20, Welles was hailed as a prodigy. The production then made a 4,000-mile national tour that included two weeks at the Texas Centennial Exposition in Dallas.\n\nNext mounted was the farce \"Horse Eats Hat\", an adaptation by Welles and Edwin Denby of \"The Italian Straw Hat\", an 1851 five-act farce by Eugène Marin Labiche and Marc-Michel. The play was presented September 26 – December 5, 1936, at Maxine Elliott's Theatre, New York, and featured Joseph Cotten in his first starring role. It was followed by an adaptation of \"Dr. Faustus\" that used light as a prime unifying scenic element in a nearly black stage, presented January 8 – May 9, 1937, at Maxine Elliott's Theatre.\n\nOutside the scope of the Federal Theatre Project, American composer Aaron Copland chose Welles to direct \"The Second Hurricane\" (1937), an operetta with a libretto by Edwin Denby. Presented at the Henry Street Settlement Music School in New York for the benefit of high school students, the production opened April 21, 1937, and ran its scheduled three performances.\n\nIn 1937, Welles rehearsed Marc Blitzstein's political operetta, \"The Cradle Will Rock\". It was originally scheduled to open June 16, 1937, in its first public preview. Because of severe federal cutbacks in the Works Progress projects, the show's premiere at the Maxine Elliott Theatre was canceled. The theater was locked and guarded to prevent any government-purchased materials from being used for a commercial production of the work. In a last-minute move, Welles announced to waiting ticket-holders that the show was being transferred to the Venice, 20 blocks away. Some cast, and some crew and audience, walked the distance on foot. The union musicians refused to perform in a commercial theater for lower non-union government wages. The actors' union stated that the production belonged to the Federal Theater Project and could not be performed outside that context without permission. Lacking the participation of the union members, \"The Cradle Will Rock\" began with Blitzstein introducing the show and playing the piano accompaniment on stage with some cast members performing from the audience. This impromptu performance was well received by its audience.\n\nBreaking with the Federal Theatre Project in 1937, Welles and Houseman founded their own repertory company, which they called the Mercury Theatre. The name was inspired by the title of the iconoclastic magazine, \"The American Mercury\". Welles was executive producer, and the original company included such actors as Joseph Cotten, George Coulouris, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Arlene Francis, Martin Gabel, John Hoyt, Norman Lloyd, Vincent Price, Stefan Schnabel and Hiram Sherman.\n\n\"I think he was the greatest directorial talent we've ever had in the [American] theater,\" Lloyd said of Welles in a 2014 interview. \"When you saw a Welles production, you saw the text had been affected, the staging was remarkable, the sets were unusual, music, sound, lighting, a totality of everything. We had not had such a man in our theater. He was the first and remains the greatest.\"\n\nThe Mercury Theatre opened November 11, 1937, with \"Caesar\", Welles's modern-dress adaptation of Shakespeare's tragedy \"Julius Caesar\" — streamlined into an anti-fascist tour de force that Joseph Cotten later described as \"so vigorous, so contemporary that it set Broadway on its ear.\" The set was completely open with no curtain, and the brick stage wall was painted dark red. Scene changes were achieved by lighting alone. On the stage was a series of risers; squares were cut into one at intervals and lights were set beneath it, pointing straight up to evoke the \"cathedral of light\" at the Nuremberg Rallies. \"He staged it like a political melodrama that happened the night before,\" said Lloyd.\n\nBeginning January 1, 1938, \"Caesar\" was performed in repertory with \"The Shoemaker's Holiday\"; both productions moved to the larger National Theatre. They were followed by \"Heartbreak House\" (April 29, 1938) and \"Danton's Death\" (November 5, 1938). As well as being presented in a pared-down oratorio version at the Mercury Theatre on Sunday nights in December 1937, \"The Cradle Will Rock\" was at the Windsor Theatre for 13 weeks (January 4–April 2, 1938). Such was the success of the Mercury Theatre that Welles appeared on the cover of \"Time\" magazine, in full makeup as Captain Shotover in \"Heartbreak House\", in the issue dated May 9, 1938—three days after his 23rd birthday.\n\nSimultaneously with his work in the theatre, Welles worked extensively in radio as an actor, writer, director and producer, often without credit. Between 1935 and 1937 he was earning as much as $2,000 a week, shuttling between radio studios at such a pace that he would arrive barely in time for a quick scan of his lines before he was on the air. While he was directing the \"Voodoo Macbeth\" Welles was dashing between Harlem and midtown Manhattan three times a day to meet his radio commitments.\n\nIn addition to continuing as a repertory player on \"The March of Time\", in the fall of 1936 Welles adapted and performed \"Hamlet\" in an early two-part episode of CBS Radio's \"Columbia Workshop\". His performance as the announcer in the series' April 1937 presentation of Archibald MacLeish's verse drama \"The Fall of the City\" was an important development in his radio career and made the 21-year-old Welles an overnight star.\n\nIn July 1937, the Mutual Network gave Welles a seven-week series to adapt \"Les Misérables\". It was his first job as a writer-director for radio, the radio debut of the Mercury Theatre, and one of Welles's earliest and finest achievements. He invented the use of narration in radio.\n\n\"By making himself the center of the storytelling process, Welles fostered the impression of self-adulation that was to haunt his career to his dying day,\" wrote critic Andrew Sarris. \"For the most part, however, Welles was singularly generous to the other members of his cast and inspired loyalty from them above and beyond the call of professionalism.\"\n\nThat September, Mutual chose Welles to play Lamont Cranston, also known as \"The Shadow\". He performed the role anonymously through mid-September 1938.\n\nAfter the theatrical successes of the Mercury Theatre, CBS Radio invited Orson Welles to create a summer show for 13 weeks. The series began July 11, 1938, initially titled \"First Person Singular\", with the formula that Welles would play the lead in each show. Some months later the show was called \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\". The weekly hour-long show presented radio plays based on classic literary works, with original music composed and conducted by Bernard Herrmann.\n\nThe Mercury Theatre's radio adaptation of \"The War of the Worlds\" by H. G. Wells October 30, 1938, brought Welles instant fame. The combination of the news bulletin form of the performance with the between-breaks dial spinning habits of listeners was later reported to have created widespread confusion among listeners who failed to hear the introduction, although the extent of this confusion has come into question. Panic was reportedly spread among listeners who believed the fictional news reports of a Martian invasion. The myth of the result created by the combination was reported as fact around the world and disparagingly mentioned by Adolf Hitler in a public speech.\n\nWelles's growing fame drew Hollywood offers, lures that the independent-minded Welles resisted at first. \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air,\" which had been a sustaining show (without sponsorship) was picked up by Campbell Soup and renamed \"The Campbell Playhouse.\" \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" made its last broadcast on December 4, 1938, and \"The Campbell Playhouse\" began five days later.\n\nWelles began commuting from California to New York for the two Sunday broadcasts of \"The Campbell Playhouse\" after signing a film contract with RKO Pictures in August 1939. In November 1939, production of the show moved from New York to Los Angeles.\n\nAfter 20 shows, Campbell began to exercise more creative control and had complete control over story selection. As his contract with Campbell came to an end, Welles chose not to sign on for another season. After the broadcast of March 31, 1940, Welles and Campbell parted amicably.\n\nRKO Radio Pictures president George Schaefer eventually offered Welles what generally is considered the greatest contract offered to a filmmaker, much less to one who was untried. Engaging him to write, produce, direct and perform in two motion pictures, the contract subordinated the studio's financial interests to Welles's creative control, and broke all precedent by granting Welles the right of final cut. After signing a summary agreement with RKO on July 22, Welles signed a full-length 63-page contract August 21, 1939. The agreement was bitterly resented by the Hollywood studios and persistently mocked in the trade press.\n\nRKO rejected Welles's first two movie proposals, but agreed on the third offer—\"Citizen Kane\". Welles co-wrote, produced and directed the film, and performed the lead role. Welles conceived the project with screenwriter Herman J. Mankiewicz, who was writing radio plays for \"The Campbell Playhouse\". Mankiewicz based the original outline on the life of William Randolph Hearst, whom he knew socially and came to hate after being exiled from Hearst's circle.\n\nAfter agreeing on the storyline and character, Welles supplied Mankiewicz with 300 pages of notes and put him under contract to write the first draft screenplay under the supervision of John Houseman. Welles wrote his own draft, then drastically condensed and rearranged both versions and added scenes of his own. The industry accused Welles of underplaying Mankiewicz's contribution to the script, but Welles countered the attacks by saying, \"At the end, naturally, I was the one making the picture, after all—who had to make the decisions. I used what I wanted of Mank's and, rightly or wrongly, kept what I liked of my own.\"\n\nWelles's project attracted some of Hollywood's best technicians, including cinematographer Gregg Toland. For the cast, Welles primarily used actors from his Mercury Theatre. Filming \"Citizen Kane\" took ten weeks.\n\nHearst's newspapers barred all reference to \"Citizen Kane\" and exerted enormous pressure on the Hollywood film community to force RKO to shelve the film. RKO chief George Schaefer received a cash offer from MGM's Louis B. Mayer and other major studio executives if he would destroy the negative and existing prints of the film.\n\nWhile waiting for \"Citizen Kane\" to be released, Welles produced and directed the original Broadway production of \"Native Son\", a drama written by Paul Green and Richard Wright based on Wright's novel. Starring Canada Lee, the show ran March 24 – June 28, 1941, at the St. James Theatre. The Mercury Production was the last time Welles and Houseman worked together.\n\n\"Citizen Kane\" was given a limited release and the film received overwhelming critical praise. It was voted the best picture of 1941 by the National Board of Review and the New York Film Critics Circle. The film garnered nine Academy Award nominations but won only for Best Original Screenplay, shared by Mankiewicz and Welles. \"Variety\" reported that block voting by screen extras deprived \"Citizen Kane\" of Oscars for Best Picture and Best Actor (Welles), and similar prejudices were likely to have been responsible for the film receiving no technical awards.\n\nThe delay in the film's release and uneven distribution contributed to mediocre results at the box office. After it ran its course theatrically, \"Citizen Kane\" was retired to the vault in 1942. In postwar France, however, the film's reputation grew after it was seen for the first time in 1946. In the United States, it began to be re-evaluated after it began to appear on television in 1956. That year it was also re-released theatrically, and film critic Andrew Sarris described it as \"the great American film\" and \"the work that influenced the cinema more profoundly than any American film since \"Birth of a Nation\".\" \"Citizen Kane\" is now hailed as one of the greatest films ever made.\n\nWelles's second film for RKO was \"The Magnificent Ambersons\", adapted by Welles from the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Booth Tarkington. Toland was not available, so Stanley Cortez was named cinematographer. The meticulous Cortez worked slowly and the film lagged behind schedule and over budget. Prior to production, Welles's contract was renegotiated, revoking his right to control the final cut. \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" was in production October 28, 1941 – January 22, 1942.\n\nThroughout the shooting of the film Welles was also producing a weekly half-hour radio series, \"The Orson Welles Show\". Many of the \"Ambersons\" cast participated in the CBS Radio series, which ran September 15, 1941 – February 2, 1942.\n\nAt RKO's request, Welles worked on an adaptation of Eric Ambler's spy thriller, \"Journey into Fear\", co-written with Joseph Cotten. In addition to acting in the film, Welles was the producer. Direction was credited to Norman Foster. Welles later said that they were in such a rush that the director of each scene was determined by whoever was closest to the camera.\n\n\"Journey into Fear\" was in production January 6–March 12, 1942.\n\nIn late November 1941, Welles was appointed as a goodwill ambassador to Latin America by Nelson Rockefeller, U.S. Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and a principal stockholder in RKO Radio Pictures. The mission of the OCIAA was cultural diplomacy, promoting hemispheric solidarity and countering the growing influence of the Axis powers in Latin America. John Hay Whitney, head of the agency's Motion Picture Division, was asked by the Brazilian government to produce a documentary of the annual Rio Carnival celebration taking place in early February 1942. In a telegram December 20, 1941, Whitney wrote Welles, \"Personally believe you would make great contribution to hemisphere solidarity with this project.\"\n\nThe OCIAA sponsored cultural tours to Latin America and appointed goodwill ambassadors including George Balanchine and the American Ballet, Bing Crosby, Aaron Copland, Walt Disney, John Ford and Rita Hayworth. Welles was thoroughly briefed in Washington, D.C., immediately before his departure for Brazil, and film scholar Catherine L. Benamou, a specialist in Latin American affairs, finds it \"not unlikely\" that he was among the goodwill ambassadors who were asked to gather intelligence for the U.S. government in addition to their cultural duties. She concludes that Welles's acceptance of Whitney's request was \"a logical and patently patriotic choice\".\n\nIn addition to working on his ill-fated film project, \"It's All True\", Welles was responsible for radio programs, lectures, interviews and informal talks as part of his OCIAA-sponsored cultural mission, which was regarded as a success. He spoke on topics ranging from Shakespeare to visual art at gatherings of Brazil's elite, and his two intercontinental radio broadcasts in April 1942 were particularly intended to tell U.S. audiences that President Vargas was a partner with the Allies. Welles's ambassadorial mission was extended to permit his travel to other nations including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and Uruguay. Welles worked for more than half a year with no compensation.\n\nWelles's own expectations for the film were modest. \"\"It's All True\" was not going to make any cinematic history, nor was it intended to,\" he later said. \"It was intended to be a perfectly honorable execution of my job as a goodwill ambassador, bringing entertainment to the Northern Hemisphere that showed them something about the Southern one.\"\n\nIn July 1941, Welles conceived \"It's All True\" as an omnibus film mixing documentary and docufiction in a project that emphasized the dignity of labor and celebrated the cultural and ethnic diversity of North America. It was to have been his third film for RKO, following \"Citizen Kane\" (1941) and \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942). Duke Ellington was put under contract to score a segment with the working title, \"The Story of Jazz\", drawn from Louis Armstrong's 1936 autobiography, \"Swing That Music\". Armstrong was cast to play himself in the brief dramatization of the history of jazz performance, from its roots to its place in American culture in the 1940s. \"The Story of Jazz\" was to go into production in December 1941.\n\nMercury Productions purchased the stories for two other segments—\"My Friend Bonito\" and \"The Captain's Chair\"—from documentary filmmaker Robert J. Flaherty. Adapted by Norman Foster and John Fante, \"My Friend Bonito\" was the only segment of the original \"It's All True\" to go into production. Filming took place in Mexico September–December 1941, with Norman Foster directing under Welles's supervision.\n\nIn December 1941, the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs asked Welles to make a film in Brazil that would showcase the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro. With filming of \"My Friend Bonito\" about two-thirds complete, Welles decided he could shift the geography of \"It's All True\" and incorporate Flaherty's story into an omnibus film about Latin America—supporting the Roosevelt administration's Good Neighbor policy, which Welles strongly advocated. In this revised concept, \"The Story of Jazz\" was replaced by the story of samba, a musical form with a comparable history and one that came to fascinate Welles. He also decided to do a ripped-from-the-headlines episode about the epic voyage of four poor Brazilian fishermen, the jangadeiros, who had become national heroes. Welles later said this was the most valuable story.\n\nRequired to film the Carnaval in Rio de Janeiro in early February 1942, Welles rushed to edit \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" and finish his acting scenes in \"Journey into Fear\". He ended his lucrative CBS radio show February 2, flew to Washington, D.C., for a briefing, and then lashed together a rough cut of \"Ambersons\" in Miami with editor Robert Wise. Welles recorded the film's narration the night before he left for South America: \"I went to the projection room at about four in the morning, did the whole thing, and then got on the plane and off to Rio—and the end of civilization as we know it.\"\n\nWelles left for Brazil on February 4 and began filming in Rio February 8, 1942. At the time it did not seem that Welles's other film projects would be disrupted, but as film historian Catherine L. Benamou wrote, \"the ambassadorial appointment would be the first in a series of turning points leading—in 'zigs' and 'zags,' rather than in a straight line—to Welles's loss of complete directorial control over both \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" and \"It's All True\", the cancellation of his contract at RKO Radio Studio, the expulsion of his company Mercury Productions from the RKO lot, and, ultimately, the total suspension of \"It's All True\".\n\nIn 1942 RKO Pictures underwent major changes under new management. Nelson Rockefeller, the primary backer of the Brazil project, left its board of directors, and Welles's principal sponsor at RKO, studio president George Schaefer, resigned. RKO took control of \"Ambersons\" and edited the film into what the studio considered a commercial format. Welles's attempts to protect his version ultimately failed. In South America, Welles requested resources to finish \"It's All True\". Given a limited amount of black-and-white film stock and a silent camera, he was able to finish shooting the episode about the jangadeiros, but RKO refused to support further production on the film.\n\n\"So I was fired from RKO,\" Welles later recalled. \"And they made a great publicity point of the fact that I had gone to South America without a script and thrown all this money away. I never recovered from that attack.\" Later in 1942, when RKO Pictures began promoting its new corporate motto, \"Showmanship In Place of Genius: A New Deal at RKO\", Welles understood it as a reference to him.\n\nWelles returned to the United States August 22, 1942, after more than six months in South America. A week after his return he produced and emceed the first two hours of a seven-hour coast-to-coast War Bond drive broadcast titled \"I Pledge America\". Airing August 29, 1942, on the Blue Network, the program was presented in cooperation with the United States Department of the Treasury, Western Union (which wired bond subscriptions free of charge) and the American Women's Voluntary Services. Featuring 21 dance bands and a score of stage and screen and radio stars, the broadcast raised more than $10 million—more than $146 million today—for the war effort.\n\nOn October 12, 1942, \"Cavalcade of America\" presented Welles's radio play, \"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\", an entertaining and factual look at the legend of Christopher Columbus.\n\n\"It belongs to a period when hemispheric unity was a crucial matter and many programs were being devoted to the common heritage of the Americas,\" wrote broadcasting historian Erik Barnouw. \"Many such programs were being translated into Spanish and Portuguese and broadcast to Latin America, to counteract many years of successful Axis propaganda to that area. The Axis, trying to stir Latin America against Anglo-America, had constantly emphasized the differences between the two. It became the job of American radio to emphasize their common experience and essential unity.\"\n\n\"Admiral of the Ocean Sea\", also known as \"Columbus Day\", begins with the words, \"Hello Americans\"—the title Welles would choose for his own series five weeks later.\n\n\"Hello Americans\", a CBS Radio series broadcast November 15, 1942 – January 31, 1943, was produced, directed and hosted by Welles under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator for Inter-American Affairs. The 30-minute weekly program promoted inter-American understanding and friendship, drawing upon the research amassed for the ill-fated film, \"It's All True\". The series was produced concurrently with Welles's other CBS series, \"Ceiling Unlimited\" (November 9, 1942 – February 1, 1943), sponsored by the Lockheed-Vega Corporation. The program was conceived to glorify the aviation industry and dramatize its role in World War II. Welles's shows were regarded as significant contributions to the war effort.\n\nThroughout the war Welles worked on patriotic radio programs including \"Command Performance\", \"G.I. Journal\", \"Mail Call\", \"Nazi Eyes on Canada\", \"Stage Door Canteen\" and \"Treasury Star Parade\".\n\nIn early 1943, the two concurrent radio series (\"Ceiling Unlimited\", \"Hello Americans\") that Orson Welles created for CBS to support the war effort had ended. Filming also had wrapped on the 1943 film adaptation of \"Jane Eyre\" and that fee, in addition to the income from his regular guest-star roles in radio, made it possible for Welles to fulfill a lifelong dream. He approached the War Assistance League of Southern California and proposed a show that evolved into a big-top spectacle, part circus and part magic show. He offered his services as magician and director, and invested some $40,000 of his own money in an extravaganza he co-produced with his friend Joseph Cotten: \"The Mercury Wonder Show for Service Men\". Members of the U.S. armed forces were admitted free of charge, while the general public had to pay. The show entertained more than 1,000 service members each night, and proceeds went to the War Assistance League, a charity for military service personnel.\n\nThe development of the show coincided with the resolution of Welles's oft-changing draft status in May 1943, when he was finally declared 4-F—unfit for military service—for a variety of medical reasons. \"I felt guilty about the war,\" Welles told biographer Barbara Leaming. \"I was guilt-ridden about my civilian status.\" He had been publicly hounded about his patriotism since \"Citizen Kane\", when the Hearst press began persistent inquiries about why Welles had not been drafted.\n\n\"The Mercury Wonder Show\" ran August 3 – September 9, 1943, in an 80-by-120-foot tent located at 9000 Cahuenga Boulevard, in the heart of Hollywood.\n\nAt intermission September 7, 1943, KMPC radio interviewed audience and cast members of \"The Mercury Wonder Show\"—including Welles and Rita Hayworth, who were married earlier that day. Welles remarked that \"The Mercury Wonder Show\" had been performed for approximately 48,000 members of the U.S. armed forces.\n\nThe idea of doing a radio variety show occurred to Welles after his success as substitute host of four consecutive episodes (March 14 – April 4, 1943) of \"The Jack Benny Program\", radio's most popular show, when Benny contracted pneumonia on a performance tour of military bases. A half-hour variety show broadcast January 26 – July 19, 1944, on the Columbia Pacific Network, \"The Orson Welles Almanac\" presented sketch comedy, magic, mindreading, music and readings from classic works. Many of the shows originated on U.S. military camps, where Welles and his repertory company and guests entertained the troops with a reduced version of \"The Mercury Wonder Show\". The performances of the all-star jazz group Welles brought together for the show were so popular that the band became a regular feature and was an important force in reviving interest in traditional New Orleans jazz.\n\nWelles was placed on the U.S. Treasury payroll on May 15, 1944, as an expert consultant for the duration of the war, with a retainer of $1 a year. On the recommendation of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau asked Welles to lead the Fifth War Loan Drive, which opened June 12 with a one-hour radio show on all four networks, broadcast from Texarkana, Texas. Including a statement by the President, the program defined the causes of the war and encouraged Americans to buy $16 billion in bonds to finance the Normandy landings and the most violent phase of World War II. Welles produced additional war loan drive broadcasts on June 14 from the Hollywood Bowl, and June 16 from Soldier Field, Chicago. Americans purchased $20.6 billion in War Bonds during the Fifth War Loan Drive, which ended on July 8, 1944.\n\nWelles campaigned ardently for Roosevelt in 1944. A longtime supporter and campaign speaker for FDR, he occasionally sent the president ideas and phrases that were sometimes incorporated into what Welles characterized as \"less important speeches\". One of these ideas was the joke in what came to be called the Fala speech, Roosevelt's nationally broadcast September 23 address to the International Teamsters Union which opened the 1944 presidential campaign.\n\nWelles campaigned for the Roosevelt–Truman ticket almost full-time in the fall of 1944, traveling to nearly every state to the detriment of his own health and at his own expense. In addition to his radio addresses he filled in for Roosevelt, opposite Republican presidential nominee Thomas E. Dewey, at \"The New York Herald Tribune Forum\" broadcast October 18 on the Blue Network. Welles accompanied FDR to his last campaign rally, speaking at an event November 4 at Boston's Fenway Park before 40,000 people, and took part in a historic election-eve campaign broadcast November 6 on all four radio networks.\n\nOn November 21, 1944, Welles began his association with \"This Is My Best\", a CBS radio series he would briefly produce, direct, write and host (March 13 – April 24, 1945). He wrote a political column called \"Orson Welles' Almanac\" (later titled \"Orson Welles Today\") for \"The New York Post\" January–November 1945, and advocated the continuation of FDR's New Deal policies and his international vision, particularly the establishment of the United Nations and the cause of world peace.\n\nOn April 12, 1945, the day Franklin D. Roosevelt died, the Blue-ABC network marshalled its entire executive staff and national leaders to pay homage to the late president. \"Among the outstanding programs which attracted wide attention was a special tribute delivered by Orson Welles\", reported \"Broadcasting\" magazine. Welles spoke at 10:10 p.m Eastern War Time, from Hollywood, and stressed the importance of continuing FDR's work: \"He has no need for homage and we who loved him have no time for tears … Our fighting sons and brothers cannot pause tonight to mark the death of him whose name will be given to the age we live in.\"\n\nWelles presented another special broadcast on the death of Roosevelt the following evening: \"We must move on beyond mere death to that free world which was the hope and labor of his life.\"\n\nHe dedicated the April 17 episode of \"This Is My Best\" to Roosevelt and the future of America on the eve of the United Nations Conference on International Organization. Welles was an advisor and correspondent for the Blue-ABC radio network's coverage of the San Francisco conference that formed the UN, taking place April 24 – June 23, 1945. He presented a half-hour dramatic program written by Ben Hecht on the opening day of the conference, and on Sunday afternoons (April 29 – June 10) he led a weekly discussion from the San Francisco Civic Auditorium.\n\nIn the fall of 1945 Welles began work on \"The Stranger\" (1946), a film noir drama about a war crimes investigator who tracks a high-ranking Nazi fugitive to an idyllic New England town. Edward G. Robinson, Loretta Young and Welles star.\n\nProducer Sam Spiegel initially planned to hire director John Huston, who had rewritten the screenplay by Anthony Veiller. When Huston entered the military, Welles was given the chance to direct and prove himself able to make a film on schedule and under budget—something he was so eager to do that he accepted a disadvantageous contract. One of its concessions was that he would defer to the studio in any creative dispute.\n\n\"The Stranger\" was Welles's first job as a film director in four years. He was told that if the film was successful he could sign a four-picture deal with International Pictures, making films of his own choosing. Welles was given some degree of creative control, and he endeavored to personalize the film and develop a nightmarish tone. He worked on the general rewrite of the script and wrote scenes at the beginning of the picture that were shot but subsequently cut by the producers. He filmed in long takes that largely thwarted the control given to editor Ernest J. Nims under the terms of the contract.\n\n\"The Stranger\" was the first commercial film to use documentary footage from the Nazi concentration camps. Welles had seen the footage in early May 1945 in San Francisco, as a correspondent and discussion moderator at the UN Conference on International Organization. He wrote of the Holocaust footage in his syndicated \"New York Post\" column May 7, 1945.\n\nCompleted a day ahead of schedule and under budget, \"The Stranger\" was the only film made by Welles to have been a \"bona fide\" box office success upon its release. Its cost was $1.034 million; 15 months after its release it had grossed $3.216 million. Within weeks of the completion of the film, International Pictures backed out of its promised four-picture deal with Welles. No reason was given, but the impression was left that \"The Stranger\" would not make money.\n\nIn the summer of 1946, Welles moved to New York to direct the Broadway musical \"Around the World\", a stage adaptation of the Jules Verne novel \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" with a book by Welles and music by Cole Porter. Producer Mike Todd, who would later produce the successful 1956 film adaptation, pulled out from the lavish and expensive production, leaving Welles to support the finances. When Welles ran out of money he convinced Columbia Pictures president Harry Cohn to send enough money to continue the show, and in exchange Welles promised to write, produce, direct and star in a film for Cohn for no further fee. The stage show soon failed due to poor box-office, with Welles unable to claim the losses on his taxes.\n\nIn 1946, Welles began two new radio series—\"The Mercury Summer Theatre on the Air\" for CBS, and \"Orson Welles Commentaries\" for ABC. While \"Mercury Summer Theatre\" featured half-hour adaptations of some classic Mercury radio shows from the 1930s, the first episode was a condensation of his \"Around the World\" stage play, and is the only record of Cole Porter's music for the project. Several original Mercury actors returned for the series, as well as Bernard Herrmann. Welles invested his earnings into his failing stage play. \"Commentaries\" was a political vehicle for him, continuing the themes from his \"New York Post\" column. Again, Welles lacked a clear focus, until the NAACP brought to his attention the case of Isaac Woodard. Welles brought significant attention to Woodard's cause.\n\nThe last broadcast of \"Orson Welles Commentaries\" on October 6, 1946, marked the end of Welles's own radio shows.\n\nThe film that Welles was obliged to make in exchange for Harry Cohn's help in financing the stage production \"Around the World\" was \"The Lady from Shanghai\", filmed in 1947 for Columbia Pictures. Intended as a modest thriller, the budget skyrocketed after Cohn suggested that Welles's then-estranged second wife Rita Hayworth co-star.\n\nCohn disliked Welles's rough cut, particularly the confusing plot and lack of close-ups, and was not in sympathy with Welles's Brechtian use of irony and black comedy, especially in a farcical courtroom scene. Cohn ordered extensive editing and re-shoots. After heavy editing by the studio, approximately one hour of Welles's first cut was removed, including much of a climactic confrontation scene in an amusement park funhouse. While expressing displeasure at the cuts, Welles was appalled particularly with the musical score. The film was considered a disaster in America at the time of release, though the closing shootout in a hall of mirrors has since become a touchstone of film noir. Not long after release, Welles and Hayworth finalized their divorce.\n\nAlthough \"The Lady From Shanghai\" was acclaimed in Europe, it was not embraced in the U.S. until decades later. A similar difference in reception on opposite sides of the Atlantic followed by greater American acceptance befell the Welles-inspired Chaplin film \"Monsieur Verdoux\", originally to be directed by Welles starring Chaplin, then directed by Chaplin with the idea credited to Welles.\n\nPrior to 1948, Welles convinced Republic Pictures to let him direct a low-budget version of \"Macbeth\", which featured highly stylized sets and costumes, and a cast of actors lip-syncing to a pre-recorded soundtrack, one of many innovative cost-cutting techniques Welles deployed in an attempt to make an epic film from B-movie resources. The script, adapted by Welles, is a violent reworking of Shakespeare's original, freely cutting and pasting lines into new contexts via a collage technique and recasting \"Macbeth\" as a clash of pagan and proto-Christian ideologies. Some voodoo trappings of the famous Welles/Houseman Negro Theatre stage adaptation are visible, especially in the film's characterization of the Weird Sisters, who create an effigy of Macbeth as a charm to enchant him. Of all Welles's post-\"Kane\" Hollywood productions, \"Macbeth\" is stylistically closest to \"Citizen Kane\" in its long takes and deep focus photography.\n\nRepublic initially trumpeted the film as an important work but decided it did not care for the Scottish accents and held up general release for almost a year after early negative press reaction, including \"Life\"s comment that Welles's film \"doth foully slaughter Shakespeare.\" Welles left for Europe, while co-producer and lifelong supporter Richard Wilson reworked the soundtrack. Welles returned and cut 20 minutes from the film at Republic's request and recorded narration to cover some gaps. The film was decried as a disaster. \"Macbeth\" had influential fans in Europe, especially the French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, who hailed the film's \"crude, irreverent power\" and careful shot design, and described the characters as haunting \"the corridors of some dreamlike subway, an abandoned coal mine, and ruined cellars oozing with water.\"\n\nIn Italy he starred as Cagliostro in the 1948 film \"Black Magic\". His co-star, Akim Tamiroff, impressed Welles so much that Tamiroff would appear in four of Welles's productions during the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nThe following year, Welles starred as Harry Lime in Carol Reed's \"The Third Man\", alongside Joseph Cotten, his friend and co-star from \"Citizen Kane\", with a script by Graham Greene and a memorable score by Anton Karas.\n\nA few years later, British radio producer Harry Alan Towers would resurrect the Lime character in the radio series \"The Adventures of Harry Lime\".\n\nWelles appeared as Cesare Borgia in the 1949 Italian film \"Prince of Foxes\", with Tyrone Power and Mercury Theatre alumnus Everett Sloane, and as the Mongol warrior Bayan in the 1950 film version of the novel \"The Black Rose\" (again with Tyrone Power).\n\nDuring this time, Welles was channeling his money from acting jobs into a self-financed film version of Shakespeare's play \"Othello\". From 1949 to 1951, Welles worked on \"Othello\", filming on location in Europe and Morocco. The film featured Welles's friends, Micheál Mac Liammóir as Iago and Hilton Edwards as Desdemona's father Brabantio. Suzanne Cloutier starred as Desdemona and Campbell Playhouse alumnus Robert Coote appeared as Iago's associate Roderigo.\n\nFilming was suspended several times as Welles ran out of funds and left for acting jobs, accounted in detail in MacLiammóir's published memoir \"Put Money in Thy Purse\". The American release prints had a technically flawed soundtrack, suffering from a drop-out of sound at every quiet moment. Welles's daughter, Beatrice Welles-Smith, restored \"Othello\" in 1992 for a wide re-release. The restoration included reconstructing Angelo Francesco Lavagnino's original musical score, which was originally inaudible, and adding ambient stereo sound effects, which were not in the original film. The restoration went on to a successful theatrical run in America.\n\nIn 1952, Welles continued finding work in England after the success of the \"Harry Lime\" radio show. Harry Alan Towers offered Welles another series, \"The Black Museum\", which ran for 52 weeks with Welles as host and narrator. Director Herbert Wilcox offered Welles the part of the murdered victim in \"Trent's Last Case\", based on the novel by E. C. Bentley. In 1953, the BBC hired Welles to read an hour of selections from Walt Whitman's epic poem \"Song of Myself\". Towers hired Welles again, to play Professor Moriarty in the radio series, \"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\", starring John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson.\n\nWelles briefly returned to America to make his first appearance on television, starring in the \"Omnibus\" presentation of \"King Lear\", broadcast live on CBS October 18, 1953. Directed by Peter Brook, the production costarred Natasha Parry, Beatrice Straight and Arnold Moss.\n\nIn 1954, director George More O'Ferrall offered Welles the title role in the 'Lord Mountdrago' segment of \"Three Cases of Murder\", co-starring Alan Badel. Herbert Wilcox cast Welles as the antagonist in \"Trouble in the Glen\" opposite Margaret Lockwood, Forrest Tucker and Victor McLaglen. Old friend John Huston cast him as Father Mapple in his 1956 film adaptation of Herman Melville's \"Moby-Dick\", starring Gregory Peck.\n\nWelles's next turn as director was the film \"Mr. Arkadin\" (1955), which was produced by his political mentor from the 1940s, Louis Dolivet. It was filmed in France, Germany, Spain and Italy on a very limited budget. Based loosely on several episodes of the Harry Lime radio show, it stars Welles as a billionaire who hires a man to delve into the secrets of his past. The film stars Robert Arden, who had worked on the Harry Lime series; Welles's third wife, Paola Mori, whose voice was dubbed by actress Billie Whitelaw; and guest stars Akim Tamiroff, Michael Redgrave, Katina Paxinou and Mischa Auer. Frustrated by his slow progress in the editing room, producer Dolivet removed Welles from the project and finished the film without him. Eventually five different versions of the film would be released, two in Spanish and three in English. The version that Dolivet completed was retitled \"Confidential Report\". In 2005 Stefan Droessler of the Munich Film Museum oversaw a reconstruction of the surviving film elements.\n\nIn 1955, Welles also directed two television series for the BBC. The first was \"Orson Welles' Sketch Book\", a series of six 15-minute shows featuring Welles drawing in a sketchbook to illustrate his reminiscences for the camera (including such topics as the filming of \"It's All True\" and the Isaac Woodard case), and the second was \"Around the World with Orson Welles\", a series of six travelogues set in different locations around Europe (such as Venice, the Basque Country between France and Spain, and England). Welles served as host and interviewer, his commentary including documentary facts and his own personal observations (a technique he would continue to explore in later works).\n\nIn 1956, Welles completed \"Portrait of Gina\". The film cans would remain in a lost-and-found locker at the hotel for several decades, where they were discovered after Welles's death.\n\nIn 1956, Welles returned to Hollywood.\n\nHe began filming a projected pilot for Desilu, owned by Lucille Ball and her husband Desi Arnaz, who had recently purchased the former RKO studios. The film was \"The Fountain of Youth\", based on a story by John Collier. Originally deemed not viable as a pilot, the film was not aired until 1958—and won the Peabody Award for excellence.\n\nWelles guest starred on television shows including \"I Love Lucy\". On radio, he was narrator of \"Tomorrow\" (October 17, 1956), a nuclear holocaust drama produced and syndicated by ABC and the Federal Civil Defense Administration.\n\nWelles's next feature film role was in \"Man in the Shadow\" for Universal Pictures in 1957, starring Jeff Chandler.\n\nWelles stayed on at Universal to direct (and co-star with) Charlton Heston in the 1958 film \"Touch of Evil\", based on Whit Masterson's novel \"Badge of Evil\". Originally only hired as an actor, Welles was promoted to director by Universal Studios at the insistence of Charlton Heston. The film reunited many actors and technicians with whom Welles had worked in Hollywood in the 1940s, including cameraman Russell Metty (\"The Stranger\"), makeup artist Maurice Seiderman (\"Citizen Kane\"), and actors Joseph Cotten, Marlene Dietrich and Akim Tamiroff. Filming proceeded smoothly, with Welles finishing on schedule and on budget, and the studio bosses praising the daily rushes. Nevertheless, after the end of production, the studio re-edited the film, re-shot scenes, and shot new exposition scenes to clarify the plot. Welles wrote a 58-page memo outlining suggestions and objections, stating that the film was no longer his version—it was the studio's, but as such, he was still prepared to help with it.\n\nIn 1978, a longer preview version of the film was discovered and released.\n\nAs Universal reworked \"Touch of Evil\", Welles began filming his adaptation of Miguel de Cervantes' novel \"Don Quixote\" in Mexico, starring Mischa Auer as Quixote and Akim Tamiroff as Sancho Panza.\n\nHe continued shooting \"Don Quixote\" in Spain and Italy, but replaced Mischa Auer with Francisco Reiguera, and resumed acting jobs.\nIn Italy in 1959, Welles directed his own scenes as King Saul in Richard Pottier's film \"David and Goliath\". In Hong Kong he co-starred with Curt Jürgens in Lewis Gilbert's film \"Ferry to Hong Kong\". In 1960, in Paris he co-starred in Richard Fleischer's film \"Crack in the Mirror\". In Yugoslavia he starred in Richard Thorpe's film \"The Tartars\" and Veljko Bulajić's \"Battle of Neretva\".\n\nThroughout the 1960s, filming continued on \"Quixote\" on-and-off until the end of the decade, as Welles evolved the concept, tone and ending several times. Although he had a complete version of the film shot and edited at least once, he would continue toying with the editing well into the 1980s, he never completed a version film he was fully satisfied with, and would junk existing footage and shoot new footage. (In one case, he had a complete cut ready in which Quixote and Sancho Panza end up going to the moon, but he felt the ending was rendered obsolete by the 1969 moon landings, and burned 10 reels of this version.) As the process went on, Welles gradually voiced all of the characters himself and provided narration. In 1992, the director Jesús Franco constructed a film out of the portions of \"Quixote\" left behind by Welles. Some of the film stock had decayed badly. While the Welles footage was greeted with interest, the post-production by Franco was met with harsh criticism.\nIn 1961, Welles directed \"In the Land of Don Quixote\", a series of eight half-hour episodes for the Italian television network RAI. Similar to the \"Around the World with Orson Welles\" series, they presented travelogues of Spain and included Welles's wife, Paola, and their daughter, Beatrice. Though Welles was fluent in Italian, the network was not interested in him providing Italian narration because of his accent, and the series sat unreleased until 1964, by which time the network had added Italian narration of its own. Ultimately, versions of the episodes were released with the original musical score Welles had approved, but without the narration.\n\nIn 1962, Welles directed his adaptation of \"The Trial\", based on the novel by Franz Kafka and produced by Michael and Alexander Salkind. The cast included Anthony Perkins as Josef K, Jeanne Moreau, Romy Schneider, Paola Mori and Akim Tamiroff. While filming exteriors in Zagreb, Welles was informed that the Salkinds had run out of money, meaning that there could be no set construction. No stranger to shooting on found locations, Welles soon filmed the interiors in the Gare d'Orsay, at that time an abandoned railway station in Paris. Welles thought the location possessed a \"Jules Verne modernism\" and a melancholy sense of \"waiting\", both suitable for Kafka. To remain in the spirit of Kafka Welles set up the cutting room together with the Film Editor, Frederick Muller (as Fritz Muller), in the old un-used, cold, depressing, station master office. The film failed at the box-office. Peter Bogdanovich would later observe that Welles found the film riotously funny. Welles also told a BBC interviewer that it was his best film. While filming \"The Trial\" Welles met Oja Kodar, who later became his mistress and collaborator for the last 20 years of his life.\n\nWelles played a film director in \"La Ricotta\" (1963), Pier Paolo Pasolini's segment of the \"Ro.Go.Pa.G.\" movie, although his renowned voice was dubbed by Italian writer Giorgio Bassani. He continued taking what work he could find acting, narrating or hosting other people's work, and began filming \"Chimes at Midnight\", which was completed in 1966.\n\nFilmed in Spain, \"Chimes at Midnight\" was based on Welles's play, \"Five Kings\", in which he drew material from six Shakespeare plays to tell the story of Sir John Falstaff (Welles) and his relationship with Prince Hal (Keith Baxter). The cast includes John Gielgud, Jeanne Moreau, Fernando Rey and Margaret Rutherford; the film's narration, spoken by Ralph Richardson, is taken from the chronicler Raphael Holinshed. Welles held the film in high regard: \"It's my favorite picture, yes. If I wanted to get into heaven on the basis of one movie, that's the one I would offer up.\"\n\nIn 1966, Welles directed a film for French television, an adaptation of \"The Immortal Story\", by Karen Blixen. Released in 1968, it stars Jeanne Moreau, Roger Coggio and Norman Eshley. The film had a successful run in French theaters. At this time Welles met Oja Kodar again, and gave her a letter he had written to her and had been keeping for four years; they would not be parted again. They immediately began a collaboration both personal and professional. The first of these was an adaptation of Blixen's \"The Heroine\", meant to be a companion piece to \"The Immortal Story\" and starring Kodar. Unfortunately, funding disappeared after one day's shooting. After completing this film, he appeared in a brief cameo as Cardinal Wolsey in Fred Zinnemann's adaptation of \"A Man for All Seasons\"—a role for which he won considerable acclaim.\nIn 1967, Welles began directing \"The Deep\", based on the novel \"Dead Calm\" by Charles Williams and filmed off the shore of Yugoslavia. The cast included Jeanne Moreau, Laurence Harvey and Kodar. Personally financed by Welles and Kodar, they could not obtain the funds to complete the project, and it was abandoned a few years later after the death of Harvey. The surviving footage was eventually edited and released by the Filmmuseum München. In 1968 Welles began filming a TV special for CBS under the title \"Orson's Bag\", combining travelogue, comedy skits and a condensation of Shakespeare's play \"The Merchant of Venice\" with Welles as Shylock. In 1969 Welles called again the Film Editor Frederick Muller to work with him re-editing the material and they set up cutting rooms at the Safa Palatino Studios in Rome. Funding for the show sent by CBS to Welles in Switzerland was seized by the IRS. Without funding, the show was not completed. The surviving film clips portions were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.\n\nIn 1969, Welles authorized the use of his name for a cinema in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Orson Welles Cinema remained in operation until 1986, with Welles making a personal appearance there in 1977. Also in 1969 he played a supporting role in John Huston's \"The Kremlin Letter\". Drawn by the numerous offers he received to work in television and films, and upset by a tabloid scandal reporting his affair with Kodar, Welles abandoned the editing of \"Don Quixote\" and moved back to America in 1970.\n\nWelles returned to Hollywood, where he continued to self-finance his film and television projects. While offers to act, narrate and host continued, Welles also found himself in great demand on television talk shows. He made frequent appearances for Dick Cavett, Johnny Carson, Dean Martin and Merv Griffin.\n\nWelles's primary focus during his final years was \"The Other Side of the Wind\", an unfinished project that was filmed intermittently between 1970 and 1976. Written by Welles, it is the story of an aging film director (John Huston) looking for funds to complete his final film. The cast includes Peter Bogdanovich, Susan Strasberg, Norman Foster, Edmond O'Brien, Cameron Mitchell and Dennis Hopper. Financed by Iranian backers, ownership of the film fell into a legal quagmire after the Shah of Iran was deposed. While there have been several reports of all the legal disputes concerning ownership of the film being settled, enough disputes still exist to prevent its release.\nWelles portrayed Louis XVIII of France in the 1970 film \"Waterloo\", and narrated the beginning and ending scenes of the historical comedy \"Start the Revolution Without Me\" (1970).\n\nIn 1971, Welles directed a short adaptation of \"Moby-Dick\", a one-man performance on a bare stage, reminiscent of his 1955 stage production \"Moby Dick—Rehearsed\". Never completed, it was eventually released by the Filmmuseum München. He also appeared in \"Ten Days' Wonder\", co-starring with Anthony Perkins and directed by Claude Chabrol, based on a detective novel by Ellery Queen. That same year, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave him an honorary award \"For superlative artistry and versatility in the creation of motion pictures\". Welles pretended to be out of town and sent John Huston to claim the award, thanking the Academy on film. Huston criticized the Academy for awarding Welles, even while they refused to give Welles any work.\n\nIn 1972, Welles acted as on-screen narrator for the film documentary version of Alvin Toffler's 1970 book \"Future Shock\". Working again for a British producer, Welles played Long John Silver in director John Hough's \"Treasure Island\" (1972), an adaptation of the Robert Louis Stevenson novel, which had been the second story broadcast by \"The Mercury Theatre on the Air\" in 1938. This was the last time he played the lead role in a major film. Welles also contributed to the script, his writing credit was attributed to the pseudonym 'O. W. Jeeves'. In some versions of the film Welles's original recorded dialog was redubbed by Robert Rietty.\n\nIn 1973, Welles completed \"F for Fake\", a personal essay film about art forger Elmyr de Hory and the biographer Clifford Irving. Based on an existing documentary by François Reichenbach, it included new material with Oja Kodar, Joseph Cotten, Paul Stewart and William Alland. An excerpt of Welles's 1930s \"War of the Worlds\" broadcast was recreated for this film; however, none of the dialogue heard in the film actually matches what was originally broadcast. Welles filmed a five-minute trailer, rejected in the U.S., that featured several shots of a topless Kodar.\n\nWelles hosted a British syndicated anthology series, \"Orson Welles's Great Mysteries\", during the 1973–74 television season. His brief introductions to the 26 half-hour episodes were shot in July 1973 by Gary Graver. The year 1974 also saw Welles lending his voice for that year's remake of Agatha Christie's classic thriller \"Ten Little Indians\" produced by his former associate, Harry Alan Towers and starring an international cast that included Oliver Reed, Elke Sommer and Herbert Lom.\n\nIn 1975, Welles narrated the documentary \"\", focusing on Warner Bros. cartoons from the 1940s. Also in 1975, the American Film Institute presented Welles with its third Lifetime Achievement Award (the first two going to director John Ford and actor James Cagney). At the ceremony, Welles screened two scenes from the nearly finished \"The Other Side of the Wind\".\n\nIn 1976, Paramount Television purchased the rights for the entire set of Rex Stout's Nero Wolfe stories for Orson Welles. Welles had once wanted to make a series of Nero Wolfe movies, but Rex Stout—who was leery of Hollywood adaptations during his lifetime after two disappointing 1930s films—turned him down. Paramount planned to begin with an ABC-TV movie and hoped to persuade Welles to continue the role in a mini-series. Frank D. Gilroy was signed to write the television script and direct the TV movie on the assurance that Welles would star, but by April 1977 Welles had bowed out. In 1980 the Associated Press reported \"the distinct possibility\" that Welles would star in a Nero Wolfe TV series for NBC television. Again, Welles bowed out of the project due to creative differences and William Conrad was cast in the role.\n\nIn 1979, Welles completed his documentary \"Filming Othello\", which featured Michael MacLiammoir and Hilton Edwards. Made for West German television, it was also released in theaters. That same year, Welles completed his self-produced pilot for \"The Orson Welles Show\" television series, featuring interviews with Burt Reynolds, Jim Henson and Frank Oz and guest-starring the Muppets and Angie Dickinson. Unable to find network interest, the pilot was never broadcast. Also in 1979, Welles appeared in the biopic \"The Secret of Nikola Tesla\", and a cameo in \"The Muppet Movie\" as Lew Lord.\n\nBeginning in the late 1970s, Welles participated in a series of famous television commercial advertisements. For two years he was on-camera spokesman for the Paul Masson Vineyards, and sales grew by one third during the time Welles intoned what became a popular catchphrase: \"We will sell no wine before its time.\" He was also the voice behind the long-running Carlsberg \"Probably the best lager in the world\" campaign, promoted Domecq sherry on British television and provided narration on adverts for Findus, though the actual adverts have been overshadowed by a famous blooper reel of voice recordings, known as the Frozen Peas reel. He also did commercials for the Preview Subscription Television Service seen on stations around the country including WCLQ/Cleveland, KNDL/St. Louis and WSMW/Boston. As money ran short, he began directing commercials to make ends meet, including the famous British \"Follow the Bear\" commercials for Hofmeister lager.\n\nIn 1981, Welles hosted the documentary \"The Man Who Saw Tomorrow\", about Renaissance-era prophet Nostradamus. In 1982, the BBC broadcast \"The Orson Welles Story\" in the \"Arena\" series. Interviewed by Leslie Megahey, Welles examined his past in great detail, and several people from his professional past were interviewed as well. It was reissued in 1990 as \"With Orson Welles: Stories of a Life in Film\". Welles provided narration for the tracks \"Defender\" from Manowar's 1987 album \"Fighting the World\" and \"Dark Avenger\" on their 1982 album, \"Battle Hymns\".\n\nDuring the 1980s, Welles worked on such film projects as \"The Dreamers\", based on two stories by Isak Dinesen and starring Oja Kodar, and \"Orson Welles' Magic Show\", which reused material from his failed TV pilot. Another project he worked on was \"Filming The Trial\", the second in a proposed series of documentaries examining his feature films. While much was shot for these projects, none of them was completed. All of them were eventually released by the Filmmuseum München.\n\nIn 1984, Welles narrated the short-lived television series \"Scene of the Crime\". During the early years of \"Magnum, P.I.\", Welles was the voice of the unseen character Robin Masters, a famous writer and playboy. Welles's death forced this minor character to largely be written out of the series. In an oblique homage to Welles, the \"Magnum, P.I.\" producers ambiguously concluded that story arc by having one character accuse another of having hired an actor to portray Robin Masters. He also, in this penultimate year released a music single, titled \"I Know What It Is To Be Young (But You Don't Know What It Is To Be Old)\", which he recorded under Italian label Compagnia Generale del Disco. The song was performed with the Nick Perito Orchestra and the Ray Charles Singers and produced by Jerry Abbott (father of guitarist \"Dimebag Darrell\" Abbott).\n\nThe last film roles before Welles's death included voice work in the animated films \"Enchanted Journey\" (1984) and \"\" (1986), in which he played the planet-eating robot Unicron. His last film appearance was in Henry Jaglom's 1987 independent film \"Someone to Love\", released after his death but produced before his voice-over in \"Transformers: The Movie\". His last television appearance was on the television show \"Moonlighting\". He recorded an introduction to an episode entitled \"The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice\", which was partially filmed in black and white. The episode aired five days after his death and was dedicated to his memory.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Henry Jaglom taped lunch conversations with Welles at Los Angeles's Ma Maison as well as in New York. Edited transcripts of these sessions appear in Peter Biskind's 2013 book \"My Lunches With Orson: Conversations Between Henry Jaglom and Orson Welles\".\n\nOrson Welles and Chicago-born actress and socialite Virginia Nicolson (1916–1996) were married on November 14, 1934. The couple separated in December 1939, and were divorced on February 1, 1940. After bearing with Welles's romances in New York, Virginia had learned that Welles had fallen in love with Mexican actress Dolores del Río.\n\nInfatuated with her since adolescence, Welles met del Río at Darryl Zanuck's ranch soon after he moved to Hollywood in 1939. Their relationship was kept secret until 1941, when del Río filed for divorce from her second husband. They openly appeared together in New York while Welles was directing the Mercury stage production, \"Native Son\". They acted together in the movie \"Journey into Fear\" (1943). Their relationship came to an end, among other things, due to the infidelities of Welles. Del Río returned to México in 1943, shortly before Welles married Rita Hayworth.\n\nWelles married Rita Hayworth on September 7, 1943. They were divorced on November 10, 1947. During his last interview, recorded for \"The Merv Griffin Show\" on the evening before his death, Welles called Hayworth \"one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived … and we were a long time together—I was lucky enough to have been with her longer than any of the other men in her life.\"\n\nIn 1955, Welles married actress Paola Mori (née Countess Paola di Girifalco), an Italian aristocrat who starred as Raina Arkadin in his 1955 film, \"Mr. Arkadin\". The couple began a passionate affair, and they were married at her parents' insistence. They were wed in London May 8, 1955, and never divorced.\n\nCroatian-born artist and actress Oja Kodar became Welles's longtime companion both personally and professionally from 1966 onward, and they lived together for some of the last 20 years of his life.\n\nWelles had three daughters from his marriages: Christopher Welles Feder (born March 27, 1938, with Virginia Nicolson); Rebecca Welles Manning (December 17, 1944 – October 17, 2004, with Rita Hayworth); and Beatrice Welles (born November 13, 1955, with Paola Mori).\n\nWelles is thought to have had a son, British director Michael Lindsay-Hogg (born May 5, 1940), with Irish actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, then the wife of Sir Edward Lindsay-Hogg, 4th baronet. When Lindsay-Hogg was 16 his mother reluctantly divulged that there were pervasive rumors that his father was Welles, and she denied them—but in such detail that he doubted her veracity. Fitzgerald evaded the subject for the rest of her life. Lindsay-Hogg knew Welles, worked with him in the theatre and met him at intervals throughout Welles's life. After he learned that Welles's oldest daughter Chris, his childhood playmate, had long suspected that he was her brother, Lindsay-Hogg initiated a DNA test that proved inconclusive. In his 2011 autobiography Lindsay-Hogg reported that his questions were resolved by his mother's close friend Gloria Vanderbilt, who wrote that Fitzgerald had told her that Welles was his father. A 2015 Welles biography by Patrick McGilligan, however, reports the impossibility of Welles's paternity: Fitzgerald left the U.S. for Ireland in May 1939 and her son was conceived before her return in late October, while Welles did not travel overseas during that period.\n\nAfter the death of Rebecca Welles Manning, a man named Marc McKerrow was revealed to be her son, and therefore the direct descendant of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth. McKerrow's reactions to the revelation and his meeting with Oja Kodar are documented in the 2008 film \"Prodigal Sons\". McKerrow died on June 18, 2010.\n\nDespite an urban legend promoted by Welles, he was not related to Abraham Lincoln's wartime Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles. The myth dates back to the first newspaper feature ever written about Welles—\"Cartoonist, Actor, Poet and only 10\"—in the February 19, 1926, issue of \"The Capital Times\". The article falsely states that he was descended from \"Gideon Welles, who was a member of President Lincoln's cabinet\". As presented by Charles Higham in a genealogical chart that introduces his 1985 biography of Welles, Orson Welles's father was Richard Head Welles (born Wells), son of Richard Jones Wells, son of Henry Hill Wells (who had an uncle named Gideon \"Wells\"), son of William Hill Wells, son of Richard Wells (1734–1801).\n\nPeter Noble's 1956 biography describes Welles as \"a magnificent figure of a man, over six feet tall, handsome, with flashing eyes and a gloriously resonant speaking-voice\". Welles said that a voice specialist once told him he was born to be a heldentenor, a heroic tenor, but that when he was young and working at the Gate Theatre in Dublin he forced his voice down into a bass-baritone.\n\nEven as a baby Welles was prone to illness, including diphtheria, measles, whooping cough and malaria. From infancy he suffered from asthma, sinus headaches, and backache that was later found to be caused by congenital anomalies of the spine. Foot and ankle trouble throughout his life was the result of flat feet. \"As he grew older,\" Brady wrote, \"his ill health was exacerbated by the late hours he was allowed to keep [and] an early penchant for alcohol and tobacco\".\n\nIn 1928, at age 13, Welles was already more than six feet tall and weighed over 180 pounds. His passport recorded his height as six feet three inches, with brown hair and green eyes.\n\n\"Crash diets, drugs, and corsets had slimmed him for his early film roles,\" wrote biographer Barton Whaley. \"Then always back to\ngargantuan consumption of high-caloric food and booze. By summer 1949, when he was 34, his weight had crept up to a stout 230 pounds. In 1953 he ballooned from 250 to 275 pounds. After 1960 he remained permanently obese.\"\n\nWhen Peter Bogdanovich once asked him about his religion, Orson Welles gruffly replied that it was none of his business, then misinformed him that he was raised Catholic.\n\nAlthough the Welles family was no longer devout, it was fourth-generation Protestant Episcopalian and, before that, Quaker and Puritan. Welles's earliest paternal forebear in America, Richard Wells, was a leader of the Quaker community in Pennsylvania. His earliest maternal ancestor in America was John Alden, a crew member on the Pilgrim ship \"Mayflower\".\n\nThe funeral of Welles's father Richard H. Welles was Episcopalian.\n\nIn April 1982, when interviewer Merv Griffin asked him about his religious beliefs, Welles replied, \"I try to be a Christian. I don't pray really, because I don't want to bore God.\" Near the end of his life Welles was dining at Ma Maison, his favorite restaurant in Los Angeles, when proprietor Patrick Terrail conveyed an invitation from the head of the Greek Orthodox Church, who asked Welles to be his guest of honor at divine liturgy at Saint Sophia Cathedral. Welles replied, \"Please tell him I really appreciate that offer, but I am an atheist.\"\n\n\"Orson never joked or teased about the religious beliefs of others,\" wrote biographer Barton Whaley. \"He accepted it as a cultural artifact, suitable for the births, deaths, and marriages of strangers and even some friends—but without emotional or intellectual meaning for himself.\"\n\nWelles was politically active from the beginning of his career. He remained aligned with the left throughout his life, and always defined his political orientation as \"progressive\". He was a strong supporter of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, and often spoke out on radio in support of progressive politics. He campaigned heavily for Roosevelt in the 1944 election.\n\n\"During a White House dinner,\" Welles recalled in a 1983 conversation with his friend Roger Hill, \"when I was campaigning for Roosevelt, in a toast, with considerable tongue in cheek, he said, 'Orson, you and I are the two greatest actors alive today.' In private that evening, and on several other occasions, he urged me to run for a Senate seat either in California or Wisconsin. He wasn't alone.\"\n\nFor several years, he wrote a newspaper column on political issues and considered running for the U.S. Senate in 1946, representing his home state of Wisconsin—a seat that was ultimately won by Joseph McCarthy.\n\nWelles's name and political activities are reported on pages 155–157 of Red Channels, the anti-Communist publication that, in part, fueled the already flourishing Hollywood Blacklist. He was in Europe during the height of the Red Scare, thereby adding one more reason for the Hollywood establishment to ostracize him.\n\nIn 1970, Welles narrated (but did not write) a satirical political record on the administration of President Richard Nixon titled \"The Begatting of the President\".\n\nHe was also an outspoken critic of racism in the United States and the practice of segregation.\n\nOn the evening of October 9, 1985, Welles recorded his final interview on the syndicated TV program, \"The Merv Griffin Show\", appearing with biographer Barbara Leaming. \"Both Welles and Leaming talked of Welles's life and the segment was a nostalgic interlude,\" wrote biographer Frank Brady. Welles returned to his house in Hollywood and worked into the early hours typing stage directions for the project he and Gary Graver were planning to shoot at UCLA the following day. Welles died sometime on the morning of October 10, following a heart attack. He was found by his chauffeur at around 10 a.m.; the first of Welles's friends to arrive was Paul Stewart.\n\nWelles was cremated by prior agreement with the executor of his estate, Greg Garrison, whose advice about making lucrative TV appearances in the 1970s made it possible for Welles to pay off a portion of the taxes he owed the IRS. A brief private funeral was attended by Paola Mori and Welles's three daughters—the first time they had ever been together. Only a few close friends were invited: Garrison, Graver, Roger Hill and Prince Alessandro Tasca di Cuto. Chris Welles Feder later described the funeral as an awful experience.\n\nA public memorial tribute took place November 2, 1985, at the Directors Guild of America Theater in Los Angeles. Host Peter Bogdanovich introduced speakers including Charles Champlin, Geraldine Fitzgerald, Greg Garrison, Charlton Heston, Roger Hill, Henry Jaglom, Arthur Knight, Oja Kodar, Barbara Leaming, Janet Leigh, Norman Lloyd, Dan O'Herlihy, Patrick Terrail and Robert Wise.\n\n\"I know what his feelings were regarding his death,\" Joseph Cotten later wrote. \"He did not want a funeral; he wanted to be buried quietly in a little place in Spain. He wanted no memorial services ...\" Cotten declined to attend the memorial program; instead he sent a short message, ending with the last two lines of a Shakespeare sonnet that Welles had sent him on his most recent birthday:\n\nBut if the while I think on thee, dear friend,All losses are restored and sorrows end.\n\nIn 1987 the ashes of Welles and Mori (killed in a 1986 car crash) were taken to Ronda, Spain, and buried in an old well covered by flowers on the rural estate of a longtime friend, bullfighter Antonio Ordóñez.\n\nWelles's reliance on self-production meant that many of his later projects were filmed piecemeal or were not completed. Welles financed his later projects through his own fundraising activities. He often also took on other work to obtain money to fund his own films.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, Welles began work on \"Don Quixote\", initially a commission from CBS television. Welles expanded the film to feature length, developing the screenplay to take Quixote and Sancho Panza into the modern age. Filming stopped with the death of Francisco Reiguera, the actor playing Quixote, in 1969. Orson Welles continued editing the film into the early 1970s. At the time of his death, the film remained largely a collection of footage in various states of editing. The project and more importantly Welles's conception of the project changed radically over time. A version of the film was created from available fragments in 1992 and released to a very negative reception.\n\nA version Oja Kodar supervised, with help from Jess Franco, assistant director during production, was released in 2008 to mixed reactions.\n\nFrederick Muller — the film editor for The \"Trial\", \"Chimes at Midnight\" and the CBS Special \"Orson Bag\" was fortunate to work on editing three reels of the original, unadulterated version — was asked for his opinion in 2013 from a journalist of Time Out, his reply was he felt that if released without image re-editing, but with the addition of \"ad hoc\" sound and music, it probably would have been rather successful.\n\nIn 1969, Welles was given another TV commission to film a condensed adaptation of \"The Merchant of Venice\". Although Welles had actually completed the film by 1970, the finished negative was later mysteriously stolen from his Rome production office. A restored and reconstructed version of the film, made by using the original script and composer's notes, premiered at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival alongside \"Othello\" as part of the pre-opening ceremonies in 2015.\n\nIn 1970, Welles began shooting \"The Other Side of the Wind\". The film relates the efforts of a film director (played by John Huston) to complete his last Hollywood picture and is largely set at a lavish party. By 1972 the filming was reported by Welles as being \"96% complete\", though it is likely that Welles had only edited about 40 minutes of the film by 1979. In that year, legal complications over the ownership of the film forced the negative into a Paris vault. In 2004 director Peter Bogdanovich, who acted in the film, announced his intention to complete the production. As of 2009, legal complications over the Welles estate had kept the film from being finished or released.\n\nOn October 28, 2014, the Los Angeles-based production company Royal Road Entertainment announced that it had negotiated an agreement, with the assistance of producer Frank Marshall, and would purchase the rights to complete and release \"The Other Side of the Wind\". Bogdanovich and Marshall will complete Welles's nearly finished film in Los Angeles, aiming to have it ready for screening May 6, 2015, the 100th anniversary of Welles's birth. Royal Road Entertainment and German producer Jens Koethner Kaul acquired the rights held by Les Films de l'Astrophore and the late Mehdi Boushehri. They reached an agreement with Oja Kodar, who inherited Welles's ownership of the film, and Beatrice Welles, manager of the Welles estate; but at the end of 2015, efforts to complete the film were at an impasse.\n\nIn March 2017, Netflix acquired distribution rights to the film. That same month, the original negative, dallies and other footage arrived in Los Angeles, thus resuming the post-production process.\n\nSome footage is included in the documentaries \"Working with Orson Welles\" (1993) and \"Orson Welles: One Man Band\" (1995).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
                "Black dress of Rita Hayworth\n\nIn the 1946 film \"Gilda\", Rita Hayworth wore a black dress made by American costume designer Jean Louis. It was used in one of the most famous scenes of the film: one in which the character of Gilda sings the song \"Put the Blame on Mame\", improvising a quick striptease, choreographed by Jack Cole. The dress has helped consolidate the image of the \"femme fatale\", as well as being universally recognized as an icon of fashion and cinema. \"The Independent\" named it as one of the Ten Best Fashion Moments in Film.\n\nJean Louis, Columbia Pictures costume designer, collaborated with the actress Rita Hayworth in nine films from the 1945 until 1959. Louis is considered \"an essential ingredient in the formula that created the image of Rita Hayworth\".\n\nTo create clothes for Gilda, Jean Louis was inspired by \"Portrait of Madame X\", the famous socialite in Paris. According to \"Life\" magazine, the wardrobe designed by Jean Louis for Rita Hayworth had a value of about $60,000, a large figure for the time. The dress was said to illustrate that \"extreme sexuality\" in women, hot or cold, is a recipe for catastrophe.\n\nIn 1946, the image of Rita Hayworth in the Gilda black dress was imprinted on the first nuclear bomb to be tested after the Second World War, as part of Operation Crossroads. \nThe bomb, nicknamed \"Gilda\", was decorated with a photograph of Hayworth cut from the June 1946 issue of \"Esquire\" magazine. Above it was stenciled \"Gilda\" in two-inch black letters.\n\nIn April 2009, the dress was to be sold at the auction of the Forrest J. Ackerman estate. In the description of the lot it was specified that the dress still had the label \"property of Columbia Pictures\" and \"Rita Hayworth\" sewn inside. The initial price was estimated between $30,000 and $50,000, but the lot was withdrawn before it reached the auction. Later, in September 2009, the dress appeared mysteriously in an auction on eBay with a starting price of $30,000.\n\nThe famous scene with the black dress has been referenced in numerous films. One of the most remembered is a parody sung by Jessica Rabbit in the Disney film \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\", in which the character performs \"Why Don't You Do Right?\" in the style of Rita Hayworth in Gilda. For the 23rd \"James Bond\" film \"Skyfall\" (2012), costume designer Jany Temime referenced the black dress while creating an outfit for Bond girl Sévérine.\n\nThe strapless dress is a sheath in black satin with a straight neckline, leaving the shoulders bare. The dress is long and side-slit down to the ground. In the scene in the film \"Gilda\" in which it appears, the dress is paired with a pair of satin long gloves worn up to Hayworth's shoulders. The glove fabric is identical to the dress fabric; not made from cheaper stretch satin. \n\nTo be able to wear the dress, Hayworth had to wear a corset, because just a few months before she had given birth to her daughter, Rebecca, and had not yet regained her pre-pregnancy figure. In addition to the dress, Jean Louis made a harness, worn under the dress. The harness consisted of rigging—one under the breast, one in the middle and one on the side. In addition, the soft plastic had been molded around the top of the skirt.\n"

                "Rita Hayworth\n\nRita Hayworth (born Margarita Carmen Cansino; October 17, 1918May 14, 1987) was an American actress and dancer. She achieved fame during the 1940s as one of the era's top stars, appearing in a total of 61 films over 37 years. The press coined the term \"The Love Goddess\" to describe Hayworth after she had become the most glamorous screen idol of the 1940s. She was the top pin-up girl for GIs during World War II.\n\nHayworth is perhaps best known for her performance in the 1946 film noir, \"Gilda\", opposite Glenn Ford, in which she played the \"femme fatale\" in her first major dramatic role. Fred Astaire, with whom she made two films, called her his favorite dance partner. Her greatest success was in the Technicolor musical \"Cover Girl\" (1944), with Gene Kelly. She is listed as one of the top 25 female motion picture stars of all time in the American Film Institute's survey, AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars.\n\nIn 1980, Hayworth was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, which contributed to her death at age 68. The public disclosure and discussion of her illness drew attention to Alzheimer's, and helped to increase public and private funding for Alzheimer's research.\n\nHayworth was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1918 as Margarita Carmen Cansino, the oldest child of two dancers. Her father, Eduardo Cansino Sr., was from Castilleja de la Cuesta, a little town near Seville, Spain. \n\nHer mother, Volga Hayworth, was an American of Irish-English descent who had performed with the Ziegfeld Follies. The couple married in 1917. They also had two sons: Eduardo Jr. and Vernon.\n\nMargarita's father wanted her to become a professional dancer, while her mother hoped she would become an actress. Her paternal grandfather, Antonio Cansino, was renowned as a classical Spanish dancer. He popularized the bolero, and his dancing school in Madrid was world-famous. Hayworth later recalled, \"From the time I was three and a half … as soon as I could stand on my own feet, I was given dance lessons.\" She noted \"I didn't like it very much … but I didn't have the courage to tell my father, so I began taking the lessons. Rehearse, rehearse, rehearse, that was my girlhood\".\n\nShe attended dance classes every day for a few years in a Carnegie Hall complex, where she was taught by her uncle Angel Cansino. She performed publicly from the age of six. In 1926 at the age of eight, she was featured in \"La Fiesta\", a short film for Warner Bros.\n\nIn 1927, her father took the family to Hollywood. He believed that dancing could be featured in the movies and that his family could be part of it. He established his own dance studio, where he taught such stars as James Cagney and Jean Harlow. During the Great Depression, he lost all his investments as commercial interest in his dancing classes waned.\n\nIn 1931, Eduardo Cansino partnered with his 12-year-old daughter to form an act called the Dancing Cansinos. Since under California law Margarita was too young to work in nightclubs and bars, her father took her with him to work across the border in Tijuana, Mexico. In the early 1930s, it was a popular tourist spot for people from Los Angeles. Because she was working, Cansino never graduated from high school, but she completed the ninth grade at Hamilton High in Los Angeles.\n\nCansino (Hayworth) took a bit part in the film \"Cruz Diablo\" (1934) at age 16, which led to another bit part in the film \"In Caliente\" (1935) with the Mexican actress Dolores del Río. She danced with her father in such nightspots as the Foreign and the Caliente clubs. Winfield Sheehan, the head of the Fox Film Corporation, saw her dancing at the Caliente Club and quickly arranged for Hayworth to do a screen test a week later. Impressed by her screen persona, Sheehan signed her for a short-term, six-month contract at Fox, under the name Rita Cansino, the first of two name changes during her film career.\n\nDuring her time at Fox, Hayworth was billed as Rita Cansino and appeared in unremarkable roles, often cast as the exotic foreigner. In late 1934, aged 16, she performed a dance sequence in the Spencer Tracy film \"Dante's Inferno\" (1935), and was put under contract in February 1935. She had her first speaking role as an Argentinian girl in \"Under the Pampas Moon\" (1935). She played an Egyptian girl in \"Charlie Chan in Egypt\" (1935), and a Russian dancer in \"Paddy O'Day\" (1935). Sheehan was grooming her for the lead in the 1936 Technicolor film \"Ramona\", hoping to establish her as Fox Film's new Dolores del Río.\n\nBy the end of her six-month contract, Fox had merged into 20th Century Fox, with Darryl F. Zanuck serving as the executive producer. Dismissing Sheehan's interest in her and giving Loretta Young the lead in \"Ramona\", Zanuck did not renew Cansino's contract. Sensing her screen potential, salesman and promoter Edward C. Judson, with whom she would elope in 1937, got freelance work for her in several small-studio films and a part in the Columbia Pictures feature \"Meet Nero Wolfe\" (1936). Studio head Harry Cohn signed her to a seven-year contract and tried her out in small roles.\n\nCohn argued that her image was too Mediterranean, which limited her to being cast in \"exotic\" roles that were fewer in number. He was heard to say her last name sounded too Spanish. Judson acted on Cohn's advice: Rita Cansino became Rita Hayworth when she adopted her mother's maiden name, to the consternation of her father. With a name that emphasized her British-American ancestry, people were more likely to regard her as a classic \"American\".\n\nWith Cohn and Judson's encouragement, Hayworth changed her hair color to dark red and had electrolysis to raise her hairline and broaden the appearance of her forehead.\n\nHayworth appeared in five minor Columbia pictures and three minor independent movies in 1937. The following year, she appeared in five Columbia B movies. In 1939, Cohn pressured director Howard Hawks to use Hayworth for a small but important role as a man-trap in the aviation drama \"Only Angels Have Wings,\" in which she played opposite Cary Grant and Jean Arthur.\n\nWith this film's box-office success, fan mail for Hayworth began pouring into Columbia's publicity department. Cohn began to see Hayworth as his first and official new star. The studio never officially had stars under contract, except for Jean Arthur, who was trying to break with it.\n\nCohn began to build up Hayworth in 1940 in features such as \"Music in My Heart\", \"The Lady in Question\", and \"Angels Over Broadway\". That year, she was first featured in a \"Life\" magazine cover story. Cohn loaned Hayworth to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to appear in \"Susan and God\" opposite Joan Crawford. While on loan to Warner Bros., Hayworth appeared as the second female lead in \"The Strawberry Blonde\" (1941), opposite James Cagney. Because the film was a big box-office success, Hayworth's popularity rose and she immediately became one of Hollywood's hottest actresses. So impressed was Warner Bros., they tried to buy Hayworth's contract from Columbia, but Cohn refused to release her.\n\nHer success led to a supporting role in \"Blood and Sand\" (1941) opposite Tyrone Power and Linda Darnell with Fox, the studio that had dropped her six years before. In one of her most notable screen roles, Hayworth played Doña Sol des Muire, the first of many screen sirens.\n\nShe returned in triumph to Columbia Pictures and was cast in the musical \"You'll Never Get Rich\" (1941) opposite Fred Astaire in one of the highest-budgeted films Columbia had ever made. The picture was so successful, the studio produced and released another Astaire-Hayworth picture the following year, \"You Were Never Lovelier\". Astaire's biographer Peter Levinson writes that the dancing combination of Astaire and Hayworth was \"absolute magnetism on the screen.\" Although Astaire made 10 films with Ginger Rogers, his other main dancing partner, Hayworth's sensuality surpassed Rogers's cool technical expertise. \"Rita's youthful exuberance meshed perfectly with Fred's maturity and elegance,\" says Levinson.\n\nWhen Astaire was asked who his favorite dance partner was, he tried not answering the question, but later admitted it was Hayworth: \"All right, I'll give you a name,\" he said. \"But if you ever let it out, I'll swear I lied. It was Rita Hayworth.\" Astaire commented that \"Rita danced with trained perfection and individuality … She was better when she was 'on' than at rehearsal.\" Biographer Charlie Reinhart describes the effect she had on Astaire's style:\n\nIn August 1941, Hayworth was featured in an iconic \"Life\" photo in which she posed in a negligee with a black lace bodice.\n\nBob Landry's photo made Hayworth one of the top two pin-up girls of the World War II years; the other was Betty Grable, in a 1943 photograph. For two years, Hayworth's photograph was the most requested pin-up photograph in circulation. In 2002, the satin nightgown Hayworth wore for the photo sold for $26,888.\n\nIn March 1942, Hayworth visited Brazil as a cultural ambassador for the Roosevelt administration's Good Neighbor policy, under the auspices of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs.\n\nHayworth had top billing in one of her best-known films, the Technicolor musical \"Cover Girl\", released in 1944. The film established her as Columbia's top star of the 1940s, and it gave her the distinction of being the first of only six women to dance on screen with both Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire. \"I guess the only jewels of my life,\" Hayworth said in 1970, \"were the pictures I made with Fred Astaire... And \"Cover Girl\", too.\"\n\nFor three consecutive years, starting in 1944, Hayworth was named one of the top movie box-office attractions in the world. She was adept in ballet, tap, ballroom, and Spanish routines. Cohn continued to showcase Hayworth's dance talents. Columbia featured her in the Technicolor films \"Tonight and Every Night\" (1945) with Lee Bowman and \"Down to Earth\" (1947) with Larry Parks.\n\nHer sexy, glamorous appeal was most noted in Charles Vidor's film noir \"Gilda\" (1946) with Glenn Ford, which caused censors some consternation. The role, in which Hayworth wore black satin and performed a legendary one-glove striptease, \"Put The Blame On Mame\", made her into a cultural icon as a \"femme fatale.\"\n\nWhile \"Gilda\" was in release, it was widely reported that an atomic bomb which was scheduled to be tested at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean's Marshall Islands would bear an image of Hayworth, a reference to her bombshell status. Although the gesture was undoubtedly meant as a compliment, Hayworth was deeply offended. Orson Welles, then married to Hayworth, recalled her anger in an interview with biographer Barbara Leaming: \"Rita used to fly into terrible rages all the time, but the angriest was when she found out that they'd put her on the atom bomb. Rita almost went insane, she was so angry... She wanted to go to Washington to hold a press conference, but Harry Cohn wouldn't let her because it would be unpatriotic.\" Welles tried to persuade Hayworth that the whole business was not a publicity stunt on Cohn's part, that it was simply homage to her from the flight crew.\n\nOn the June 30, 1946 broadcast of \"Orson Welles Commentaries\", Welles said of the imminent test, \"I want my daughter to be able to tell her daughter that grandmother's picture was on the last atom bomb ever to explode.\"\n\nThe fourth atomic bomb ever to be detonated was decorated with a photograph of Hayworth cut from the June 1946 issue of \"Esquire\" magazine. Above it was stenciled the device's nickname, \"Gilda\", in two-inch black letters.\n\nHayworth's performance in Welles's 1947 film \"The Lady from Shanghai\" was critically acclaimed. The film's failure at the box office was attributed in part to Hayworth's famous red hair being cut short and bleached platinum blonde for the role. Cohn had not been consulted and was furious that Hayworth's image was changed.\n\nAlso in 1947, Hayworth was featured in a \"Life\" cover story by Winthrop Sargeant that resulted in her being nicknamed \"The Love Goddess\". The term was adopted and used later as the title of a biopic and of a biography about her. In a 1980s interview, Hayworth said, \"Everybody else does nude scenes, but I don't. I never made nude movies. I didn't have to do that. I danced. I was provocative, I guess, in some things. But I was not completely exposed.\"\n\nHer next film, \"The Loves of Carmen\" (1948) with Glenn Ford, was the first film co-produced by Columbia and Hayworth's production company, The Beckworth Corporation (named for Rebecca, her daughter with Welles). It was Columbia's biggest moneymaker that year. She received a percentage of the profits from this and all her subsequent films until 1954, when she dissolved Beckworth to pay off debts.\n\nIn 1948, at the height of her fame, Hayworth traveled to Cannes and was introduced to Prince Aly Khan. They began a year-long courtship, and were married on May 27, 1949. Hayworth left Hollywood and sailed for France, breaking her contract with Columbia.\n\nBecause Hayworth was already one of the most well-known celebrities in the world, the courtship and the wedding received enormous press coverage around the world. Because she was still legally married to second husband Orson Welles, Hayworth also received some negative backlash for her courtship with the prince, causing some American fans to boycott her pictures. The wedding marked the first time a Hollywood actress became a princess. On December 28, 1949, Hayworth gave birth to the couple's only daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan.\n\nThough Hayworth was anxious to start a new life abroad, away from Hollywood, Aly Khan's flamboyant lifestyle and duties proved too difficult for Hayworth. She struggled to fit in with his friends, and found it difficult to learn French. Aly Khan was also known in circles as a playboy, and it was suspected that he had been unfaithful to Hayworth during the marriage.\n\nIn 1951, Hayworth set sail with her two daughters for New York. Although the couple did reconcile for a short time, they officially divorced in 1953.\n\nAfter the collapse of her marriage to Khan, Rita Hayworth was forced to return to Hollywood to star in her \"comeback\" picture, \"Affair in Trinidad\" (1952) which again paired her with Glenn Ford. Director Vincent Sherman recalled that Hayworth seemed \"rather frightened at the approach of doing another picture\". She continued to clash with Columbia boss Harry Cohn, and was placed on suspension during filming. Nevertheless, the picture was highly publicized. The picture ended up grossing $1 million more than her previous blockbuster, \"Gilda\".\n\nShe continued to star in a string of successful pictures. In 1953, she had two films released: \"Salome\" with Charles Laughton and Stewart Granger, and \"Miss Sadie Thompson\" with José Ferrer and Aldo Ray. She was off the big screen for another four years, mainly because of a tumultuous marriage to the singer Dick Haymes. During her marriage to Haymes, she was involved in much negative publicity, which significantly lessened her appeal. By the time she returned to the screen for \"Fire Down Below\" (1957), Kim Novak had become Columbia's top female star. Her last musical was \"Pal Joey\" (1957). After this film, Hayworth left Columbia for good.\n\nShe received good reviews for her performance in \"Separate Tables\" (1958), with Burt Lancaster and David Niven, and \"The Story on Page One\" (1960). She continued working throughout the 1960s. In 1962, her planned Broadway debut in \"Step on a Crack\" was cancelled for undisclosed health reasons. \"The Money Trap\" (1964) paired her, for the last time, with good friend Glenn Ford. She continued to act in films until the early 1970s. She made comedic television appearances on \"Laugh In\" and \"The Carol Burnett Show\" in the 1970s. Her last film was \"The Wrath of God\" (1972).\n\nHayworth had a strained relationship with Columbia Pictures for many years. In 1943, she was suspended without pay for nine weeks because she refused to appear in \"Once Upon a Time\". During this period in Hollywood, contract players could not choose their films; they were on salary rather than receiving a fixed amount per picture.\n\nIn 1947, Hayworth's new contract with Columbia provided a salary of $250,000 plus 50% of film's profits.\n\nIn 1951, Columbia alleged it had $800,000 invested in properties for her, including the film she walked out on that year. Hayworth left Hollywood to marry Prince Aly Khan and was suspended for failing to report to work on the film \"Affair in Trinidad\". In 1952, Hayworth refused to report for work because she objected to the script.\n\nIn 1955, she sued Columbia Pictures to be released from her contract, but asked for her $150,000 salary, alleging that the filming failed to start when agreed. She said, \"I was in Switzerland when they sent me the script for \"Affair in Trinidad\" and I threw it across the room. But I did the picture, and \"Pal Joey\", too. I came back to Columbia because I wanted to work and first, see, I had to finish that goddamn contract, which is how Harry Cohn \"owned\" me!\"\n\n\"Harry Cohn thought of me as one of the people he could exploit, and make a lot of money,\" Hayworth said in 1972. \"And I did make a lot of money for him, but not much for me.\"\n\nYears after her film career had ended and long after Cohn had died, Hayworth still resented her treatment by both him and Columbia. She spoke bluntly in a 1968 interview:\n\nI used to have to punch a time clock at Columbia. Every day of my life. That's what it was like. I was under exclusive contract, like they owned me … I think he had my dressing room bugged … He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him … You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.\n\nHayworth resented the fact that the studio had failed to train her to sing or even to encourage her to learn how to sing. Although she appeared to sing in many of her films, she was usually dubbed. Because the public did not know her secret, she was embarrassed to be asked to sing by troops at USO shows.\n\n\"I wanted to study singing\", Hayworth complained, \"but Harry Cohn kept saying, 'Who needs it?' and the studio wouldn't pay for it. They had me so intimidated that I couldn't have done it anyway. They always said, 'Oh, no, we can't let you do it. There's no time for that; it has to be done right now!' I was under contract, and that was it.\"\n\nHayworth did sing the acoustic guitar version of \"Put the Blame on Mame\" in \"Gilda\". The other songs in the picture were dubbed by Anita Ellis.\n\nCohn had a reputation as a taskmaster, but he had his own criticisms of Hayworth. He had invested heavily in her before she began a reckless affair with the married Aly Khan, and it could have caused a backlash against her career and Columbia's success. For instance, an article in the British periodical \"The People\" called for a boycott of Hayworth's films: \"Hollywood must be told its already tarnished reputation will sink to rock bottom if it restores this reckless woman to a place among its stars.\"\n\nCohn expressed his frustration in a 1957 interview with \"Time\" magazine: \"Hayworth might be worth ten million dollars today easily! She owned 25% of the profits with her own company and had hit after hit and she had to get married and had to get out of the business and took a suspension because she fell in love again! In five years, at two pictures a year, at 25%! Think of what she could have made! But she didn't make pictures! She took two or three suspensions! She got mixed up with different characters! Unpredictable!\"\n\nHayworth was a top glamour girl in the 1940s, a pin-up girl for military servicemen and a beauty icon for women. At and , she was tall enough to be a concern for dancing partners such as Fred Astaire. She reportedly changed her hair color eight times in eight movies.\n\nIn 1949, Hayworth's lips were voted best in the world by the Artists League of America. She had a modeling contract with Max Factor to promote its Tru-Color lipsticks and Pan-Stik make-up.\n\nIn 1941, Hayworth said she was the antithesis of the characters she played. \"I naturally am very shy … and I suffer from an inferiority complex.\" Her provocative role in \"Gilda\", in particular, was responsible for people expecting her to be what she was not. Hayworth once said, with some bitterness, \"Men go to bed with Gilda, but wake up with me.\"\n\nHayworth's two younger brothers, Eduardo Cansino Jr. ((October 13, 1919 – March 11, 1974) and Vernon Cansino, both served in World War II. Vernon left the United States Army in 1946 with several medals, including the Purple Heart, and later married Susan Vail, a dancer. Eduardo Jr. followed Hayworth into acting; he was also under contract with Columbia Pictures. In 1950, he made his screen debut in \"The Great Adventures of Captain Kidd\".\n\nHayworth was married and divorced five times. She said, \"Basically, I am a good, gentle person, but I am attracted to mean personalities.\"\n\nIn 1937, when Hayworth was 18, she married Edward Judson, an oilman turned promoter who was more than twice her age. They married in Las Vegas. He had played a major role in launching her acting career. A shrewd businessman, he was domineering and became her manager for months before he proposed. \"He helped me with my career,\" Hayworth conceded after they divorced, \"and helped himself to my money.\" She alleged that Judson compelled her to transfer a considerable amount of her property to him and she promised to pay him $12,000 under threats that he would do her \"great bodily harm.\" \n\nShe filed for divorce from him on February 24, 1942, with a complaint of cruelty. She noted to the press that his work took him to Oklahoma and Texas while she lived and worked in Hollywood. Judson was as old as her father, who was enraged by the marriage, which caused a rift between Hayworth and her parents until the divorce. Judson had failed to tell Hayworth before they married that he had previously been married twice. When she left him, she literally had no money; she asked her friend Hermes Pan if she could eat at his home.\n\nHayworth married Orson Welles on September 7, 1943, during the run of \"The Mercury Wonder Show\". None of her colleagues knew about the planned wedding (before a judge) until she announced it the day before. For the civil ceremony, she wore a beige suit, a ruffled white blouse, and a veil. A few hours after they got married, they returned to work at the studio. They had a daughter, Rebecca, who was born on December 17, 1944, and died at the age of 59 on October 17, 2004. They struggled in their marriage. Hayworth said that Welles did not want to be tied down:\nDuring the entire period of our marriage, he showed no interest in establishing a home. When I suggested purchasing a home, he told me he didn't want the responsibility. Mr. Welles told me he never should have married in the first place; that it interfered with his freedom in his way of life.\n\nHayworth called Welles the great love of her life. On November 10, 1947, she was granted a divorce that became final the following year.\n\nIn 1948, Hayworth left her film career to marry Prince Aly Khan, a son of Sultan Mahommed Shah, Aga Khan III, the leader of the Ismaili sect of Shia Islam. They were married on May 27, 1949. Her bridal trousseau had been influenced by Dior's \"New Look\", launched in 1947.\n\nAly Khan and his family were heavily involved in horse racing, owning and racing horses. Hayworth had no interest in the sport, but became a member of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club anyway. Her filly, Double Rose, won several races in France and finished second in the 1949 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.\n\nIn 1951, while still married to Hayworth, Khan was spotted dancing with the actress Joan Fontaine in the nightclub where he and Hayworth had met. Hayworth threatened to divorce him in Reno, Nevada. In early May, Hayworth moved to Nevada to establish legal residence to qualify for a divorce. She stayed at Lake Tahoe with their daughter, saying there was a threat the child would be kidnapped. Hayworth filed for divorce from Khan on September 2, 1951, on the grounds of \"extreme cruelty, entirely mental in nature.\"\n\nHayworth once said she might convert to Islam, but did not. During the custody fight over their daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, born , the prince said he wanted her to be raised as a Muslim; Hayworth wanted the child to be raised as a Christian. Hayworth rejected his offer of $1 million if she would rear Yasmin as a Muslim from age seven and allow her to go to Europe to visit with him for two or three months each year, stating:\nNothing will make me give up Yasmin's chance to live here in America among our precious freedoms and habits. While I respect the Muslim faith, and all other faiths, it is my earnest wish that my daughter be raised as a normal, healthy American girl in the Christian faith. There isn't any amount of money in the entire world for which it is worth sacrificing this child's privilege of living as a normal Christian girl here in the United States. There just isn't anything else in the world that can compare with her sacred chance to do that. And I'm going to give it to Yasmin regardless of what it costs.In January 1953 Hayworth was granted a divorce from Aly Khan on the grounds of extreme mental cruelty. Hayworth's daughter Yasmin played about the court while the case was being heard, finally climbing on to the Judge's lap.\n\nWhen Hayworth and Dick Haymes first met, he was still married and his singing career was waning. When she showed up at the clubs, he got a larger audience. Haymes was desperate for money, because two of his former wives were taking legal action against him for unpaid child support. His financial problems were so bad, he could not return to California without being arrested. On July 7, 1954, his ex-wife Nora Haymes got a bench warrant for his arrest, because he owed her $3,800 in alimony. Less than a week earlier, his other ex-wife, Joanne Dru, also got a bench warrant because she said he owed $4,800 in support payments for their three children. Hayworth ended up paying most of Haymes's debts.\n\nHaymes was born in Argentina, and did not have solid proof of American citizenship. Not long after he met Hayworth, U.S. officials initiated proceedings to have him deported to Argentina for being an illegal alien. He hoped Hayworth could influence the government and keep him in the United States. When she assumed responsibility for his citizenship, a bond was formed that led to marriage. The two were married on September 24, 1953, at the Sands Hotel, Las Vegas, and their wedding procession went through the casino.\n\nFrom the start of their marriage, Haymes was deeply indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). When Hayworth took time off from attending his comeback performances in Philadelphia, the audiences sharply declined. Haymes's $5000 weekly salary was attached by the IRS to pay a $100,000 bill, and he was unable to pay his pianist. Haymes' ex-wives demanded money while Hayworth publicly bemoaned her own lack of alimony from Aly Khan. At one point, the couple was effectively imprisoned in a hotel room for 24 hours in Manhattan at the Hotel Madison as sheriff's deputies waited outside threatening to arrest Haymes for outstanding debts. At the same time, Hayworth was fighting a severe custody battle with Khan, during which she reported death threats against their children. While living in New York, Hayworth sent the children to live with their nanny in Westchester County. They were found and photographed by a reporter from \"Confidential\" magazine.\n\nAfter a tumultuous two years together, Haymes struck Hayworth in the face in 1955 in public at the Cocoanut Grove nightclub in Los Angeles. Hayworth packed her bags, walked out, and never returned. The assault and crisis shook her, and her doctor ordered her to remain in bed for several days.\n\nHayworth was short of money after her marriage to Haymes. She had failed to gain child support from Aly Khan. She sued Orson Welles for back payment of child support which she claimed had never been paid. This effort was unsuccessful and added to her stress.\n\nHayworth began a relationship with film producer James Hill, whom she went on to marry on February 2, 1958. He put her in one of her last major films, \"Separate Tables.\" This film was popular and highly praised, although \"The Harvard Lampoon\" named her the worst actress of 1958 for her performance. On September 1, 1961, Hayworth filed for divorce, alleging extreme mental cruelty. Hill later wrote \"Rita Hayworth: A Memoir\", in which he suggested that their marriage collapsed because he wanted Hayworth to continue making movies, while she wanted them both to retire from Hollywood.\n\nIn his autobiography, Charlton Heston wrote about Hayworth's brief marriage to Hill. One night Heston and his wife Lydia joined the couple for dinner at a restaurant in Spain with the director George Marshall and the actor Rex Harrison, Hayworth's co-star in \"The Happy Thieves\". Heston wrote that the occasion \"turned into the single most embarrassing evening of my life,\" describing how Hill heaped \"obscene abuse\" on Hayworth until she was \"reduced to a helpless flood of tears, her face buried in her hands.\" Heston wrote that the others sat stunned, witnesses to a \"marital massacre\" and, though he was \"strongly tempted to slug him\" (Hill), he left with his wife Lydia after she stood up, almost in tears. Heston wrote, \"I'm ashamed of walking away from Miss Hayworth's humiliation. I never saw her again.\"\n\nOrson Welles noted Hayworth's problem with alcohol during their marriage, but he never believed that her problem was alcoholism. \"It certainly imitated alcoholism in every superficial way,\" he recalled in 1983. \"She'd fly into these rages, never at me, never once, always at Harry Cohn or her father or her mother or her brother. She would break all the furniture and she'd get in a car and I'd have to get in the car and try to control her. She'd drive up in the hills suicidally. Terrible, terrible nights. And I just saw this lovely girl destroying herself. I admire Yasmin so much.\"\n\nYasmin Aga Khan spoke of her mother's long struggle with alcohol:\nI remember as a child that she had a drinking problem. She had difficulty coping with the ups and downs of the business ...As a child, I thought, 'She has a drinking problem and she's an alcoholic.' That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. I can just, sort of, stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner ... Her condition became quite bad. It worsened and she did have an alcoholic breakdown and landed in the hospital.\n\nIn 1972, the 54-year-old Hayworth wanted to retire from acting, but she needed money. At the suggestion of Robert Mitchum, she agreed to film \"The Wrath of God\". The experience exposed her poor health and her worsening mental state. Because she could not remember her lines, her scenes were shot one line at a time. In November, she agreed to complete one more movie, the British film \"Tales That Witness Madness\", but because of her worsening health, she left the set and returned to the United States. She never returned to acting.\n\nIn March 1974, both of her brothers died within a week of each other, which caused her great sadness and led to heavy drinking. In January 1976 at London's Heathrow Airport, Hayworth was removed from a TWA flight after having an angry outburst while traveling with her agent. The event attracted much negative publicity; a disturbing photograph was published in newspapers the next day. Hayworth's alcoholism hid symptoms of what was eventually understood to be Alzheimer's disease.\n\n\"It was the outbursts,\" said Yasmin Aga Khan. \"She'd fly into a rage. I can't tell you. I thought it was alcoholism—alcoholic dementia. We all thought that. The papers picked that up, of course. You can't imagine the relief just in getting a diagnosis. We had a name at last, Alzheimer's! Of course, that didn't really come until the last seven or eight years. She wasn't diagnosed as having Alzheimer's until 1980. There were two decades of hell before that.\"\n\nBiographer Barbara Leaming wrote that Hayworth aged prematurely because of her addiction to alcohol and also because of the many stresses in her life. \"Despite the artfully applied make-up and shoulder-length red hair, there was no concealing the ravages of drink and stress,\" she wrote of Hayworth's arrival in New York in May 1956 in order to begin work on \"Fire Down Below\", her first film in three years. \"Deep lines had crept around her eyes and mouth, and she appeared worn, exhausted—older than her thirty-eight years.\"\n\nAlzheimer's disease had been largely forgotten by the medical community since its discovery in 1906. Medical historian Barron H. Lerner wrote that when Hayworth's diagnosis was made public in 1981, she became \"the first public face of Alzheimer's, helping to ensure that future patients did not go undiagnosed...Unbeknownst to her, Hayworth helped to destigmatize a condition that can still embarrass victims and their families.\"\n\nIn July 1981, Hayworth's health had deteriorated to the point that a judge in Los Angeles Superior Court ruled that she should be placed under the care of her daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan of New York City. Hayworth lived in an apartment at The San Remo on Central Park West adjoining that of her daughter, who arranged for her mother's care during her final years. When asked how her mother was doing, Yasmin replied, \"She's still beautiful. But it's a shell.\"\n\nIn 1983, Rebecca Welles arranged to see her mother for the first time in seven years. Speaking to his lifelong friend Roger Hill, Orson Welles expressed his concern about the visit's effect on his daughter. \"Rita barely knows me now,\" Welles said. He recalled seeing Hayworth three years before at an event which the Reagans held for Frank Sinatra. \"When it was over, I came over to her table and I saw that she was very beautiful, very reposed looking, and didn't know me at first. After about four minutes of speaking, I could see that she realized who I was, and she began to cry quietly.\"\n\nIn an interview which he gave the evening before his death in 1985, Welles called Hayworth \"one of the dearest and sweetest women that ever lived\".\n\nHayworth was a lifelong Democrat who was an active member of the Hollywood Democratic Committee and was active in the campaign of Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the 1944 presidential election.\n\nHayworth was a Roman Catholic whose marriage to Prince Aly Khan was deemed \"illicit\" by The Pope.\n\nRita Hayworth lapsed into a semicoma in February 1987. She died at age 68 from complications associated with Alzheimer's disease three months later on May 14, 1987, at her home in Manhattan. President Ronald Reagan, who had been one of Hayworth's contemporaries in Hollywood, issued a statement:\n\nRita Hayworth was one of our country's most beloved stars. Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl. In her later years, Rita became known for her struggle with Alzheimer's disease. Her courage and candor, and that of her family, were a great public service in bringing worldwide attention to a disease which we all hope will soon be cured. Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend who we will miss. We extend our deep sympathy to her family.\n\nA funeral service was held on May 18, 1987, at the Church of the Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills. Pallbearers included actors Ricardo Montalbán, Glenn Ford, Don Ameche, agent Budd Burton Moss, and the choreographer Hermes Pan. She was interred at Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City. Her headstone includes Yasmin's sentiment: \"To yesterday's companionship and tomorrow's reunion.\"\n\nHayworth received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama for her performance in \"Circus World\" (1964).\n\nIn 1978 at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, DC, Hayworth was presented with the inaugural National Screen Heritage Award of the National Film Society, a group that published \"American Classic Screen\" magazine (1976–84).\n\nIn 1999, Hayworth was acknowledged as one of the top-25 greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood cinema in the American Film Institute's survey, AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars.\n\nThe public disclosure and discussion of Hayworth's illness drew international attention to Alzheimer's disease, which was little known at the time, and it helped to greatly increase federal funding for Alzheimer's research.\n\nThe Rita Hayworth Gala, a benefit for the Alzheimer's Association, is held annually in Chicago and New York City. The program was founded in 1985 by Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, in honor of her mother. She is the hostess for the events and a major sponsor of Alzheimer's disease charities and awareness programs. , a total of more than $72 million had been raised through events in Chicago, New York and Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nOn October 17, 2016, a press release from the Springer Associates Public Relations Agency announced that Rita Hayworth's former manager and friend, Budd Burton Moss, initiated a campaign to solicit the United States Postal Service to issue a commemorative stamp featuring Hayworth. Springer Associates also announced that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would be lobbied in hopes of having an honorary Academy Award issued in memory of Hayworth. The press release added that Hayworth's daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, the Alzheimer's Association of Greater Los Angeles, and numerous prominent personalities of stage and screen were supporting the Moss campaign. The press release stated the target date for fulfillment of the stamp and Academy Award to be on October 17, 2018, on what will be the centennial of Hayworth's birth.\n\nThe film \"I Remember Better When I Paint\" (2009) describes how Hayworth took up painting while struggling with Alzheimer's and produced art.\n\n\n",
                "Eduardo Cansino Sr.\n\nEduardo Cansino Reina (March 2, 1895 – December 24, 1968) was a Spanish-born American dancer and actor, and the father of actress Rita Hayworth.\n\nEduardo Cansino was born on March 2, 1895, in Castilleja de la Cuesta, Andalusia, Spain. His sister, Elisa, was also a dancer. He emigrated to the United States and joined the Ziegfeld Follies. In 1917 he married Volga Hayworth, his partner in the Follies.\n\nThey had three children: Margarita Carmen, Eduardo Jr. (October 13, 1919 – March 11, 1974), and Vernon (May 21, 1922 – March 23, 1974). After she began making films in Hollywood, Margarita Carmen Cansino would become the actress and dancer Rita Hayworth, taking her professional surname from her mother's maiden name.\n\nEduardo Cansino Sr. died in Pompano Beach, Florida, in 1968, aged 73, and is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale).\n\n\n",
                "Criminals of the Air\n\nCriminals of the Air (aka Guardians of the Air and Honeymoon Pilot) is a 1937 American action film, directed by Charles C. Coleman. It stars Rosalind Keith, Charles Quigley and Rita Hayworth. The film marked \"Rita Hayworth\"'s first onscreen credit; the actress, born Margarita Carmen Cansino, had previously used the stage name \"Rita Cansino\" or was uncredited in her prior 17 film appearances. \nIn the border town of Hernandez, New Mexico, undercover agent Mark Owens (Charles Quigley) is assigned to help the United States Border Patrol break up a well-organized band of smugglers. Hernandez also has a reputation for \"quick marriages\", just across the border in Mexico, so Mark soon signs on as a pilot on \"The Honeymoon Express.\"\n\n\"Hot Cake Joe\" (Herbert Heywood), who runs a sandwich stand, is an informant for the smugglers and recognizes Mark is a \"G-Man\". Reporter Nancy Rawlings (Rosalind Keith), looking for a good story, wants to feature Mark as the pilot of the marriage service, but he is very reluctant to be photographed. She begins to suspect that flying is only a cover for smuggling. When Nancy sees him accepting money from cafe owner Kurt Feldon (Russell Hicks), whom she is sure is the head of the smugglers, her suspicions are confirmed. When Joe tells Feldon that Mark is an undercover government agent, he orders \"Blast\" Reardon (Marc Lawrence), one of his gang, to kill Mark and arranges for Mark to fly \"Blast\" and his girlfriend to Mexico to get married. Hoping to catch the smugglers in the act, Nancy hides in Mark's aircraft but, along with Mark, is captured when the aircraft is forced to land at the smugglers' hideout, the same place that Mark had photographed from the air earlier.\n\nNancy's editor becomes worried when she does not show up at the newspaper and calls the Border Patrol, who send a rescue team using Mark's aerial photographs of the hideout. Nancy and Mark manage to escape in his aircraft, but are quickly followed by \"Blast\". The Border Patrol intercept \"Blast\" and shoot him down in an aerial dogfight. The smugglers attempt to make a getaway by car, but are also intercepted and gunned down by the Border Patrol. After realizing that they are attracted to each other, Mark and Nancy decide to get married.\n\nPrincipal photography for \"Criminals of the Air\" took place from February 8–25, 1937. \"The Honeymoon Express\" in the film was an obvious reference to the air service provided by Paul Mantz, noted for flying for Hollywood films. Mantz called his charter airline, \"Paul Mantz Air Services\", based at United Airport in Burbank, California, offering a \"discretion assured\" flight to Yuma, Arizona, Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada (Reno was the then \"honeymoon capital\" of the United States).\n\nFilm reviewer Hal Erickson noted, \"Columbia's 'Criminals of the Air' is another entry in the \"alien-smuggling\" movie cycle—and as such includes the obligatory scene in which the airborne smugglers escape detection by pulling a lever and disposing of their human cargo.\" Aviation film historian Stephen Pendo observed: \"Rita Hayworth did a dancing number which caused \"Variety\" to speculate that '... she seems to have possibilities for straight talking roles'.\"\n\n"

                "List of pizza varieties by country\n\nDuring the latter half of the 20th century, pizza became a globally accessible dish, mainly due to Italian immigrants that had brought their dishes to new people with resounding success, often in racially and culturally resistive environments.\n\nA survey from 2004 showed that Norwegians eat the most frozen pizza (5.4 kg/person*year), followed by Germans.\n\nPizza became a popular fast food in Bangladeshi urban areas. Since the introduction of various pizza brands such as Domino's and Pizza Hut in the early to mid-2000s, it has reached almost all classes of urban peoples.\n\nPizza is an emerging fast food in Indian urban areas. American pizza chains Domino's Pizza and Pizza Hut opened their first outlets in India in 1996. Domestic pizza brands include U.S.Pizza, Smokin' Joes and Pizza Corner. Branded pizza is available in most cities in India.\n\nPizzas served in India by foreign pizza brands feature greater \"recipe localization\" from pizza makers than many other markets such as Latin America and Europe, but similar to other Asian pizza markets. Indian pizzas are generally spicier and more vegetable-oriented than those in other countries. For instance, oregano spice packs are included with a typical pizza order in India instead of Parmesan cheese. In addition to spicier and more vegetable-oriented ingredients, Indian pizza also utilized unique toppings. For example, a pizza topping unique to India would be pickled ginger.\n\nPizza outlets serve pizzas with several Indian-style toppings, such as tandoori chicken and paneer. More conventional pizzas are also eaten. Pizzas available in India range from localized basic variants, available in neighborhood bakeries, to gourmet pizzas with exotic and imported ingredients available at specialty restaurants.\n\nIn Indonesia, Pizza Hut is the largest pizza chain restaurant who entered Indonesia in 1984, followed by Domino Pizza and Papa Ron's Pizza. Popular pizza recipes such as meat lover with pepperoni, tuna with melt cheese, and beef blackpepper exist in Indonesia. Those recipes are originated either from United States or Italy, thus derived from western counterpart. \n\nHowever, there are also Asian eastern pizza which includes Indonesian fusion pizza that combine Indonesian favourite as pizza toppings — such as satay, balado and rendang.\nOther than Indonesian fusion, other Asian fusion pizza are also known in Indonesia, including:\n\nAmerican pizza chains entered Japan in the 1970s (e.g. Shakey's Pizza and Pizza Hut 1973, Domino's pizza in 1985). The largest Japanese pizza chain is Pizza-La. Local types of pizza are popular, with many using mayonnaise sauces, and sometimes other ingredients such as corn, potatoes, avocado, eel, or even honey or chocolate (as in dessert). \"Side orders\" also often include items such as french fries, fried chicken, baked pasta, as well as vegetable soups, green salads, desserts, and soda or Japanese tea. There is also a strong tradition of using Tabasco sauce on cooked pizzas.\n\nPizza toppings in Japan also differ from that found in the United States. One of the unique pizza toppings found in Japan is squid. Seafood may be found on pizza everywhere, but having squid as the focal ingredient is unique to Japan.\n\nLocal crust variants also exist, for instance mochi pizza (crust made with Japanese mochi cakes). Traditional pizza served in Italian-style restaurants are also popular, and the most popular pizza chain promoting Italian style artisanal pizza is Salvatore Cuomo. The Italian association Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana also has an independent branch in Japan.\n\nPizza is a popular snack food in South Korea, especially among younger people. Major American brands such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's Pizza compete against domestic brands such as Mr. Pizza and Pizza Etang, offering traditional as well as local varieties which may include toppings such as bulgogi and dak galbi. Korean-style pizza tends to be complicated, and often has nontraditional toppings such as corn, potato wedges, sweet potato, shrimp, or crab. Traditional Italian-style thin-crust pizza is served in the many Italian restaurants in Seoul and other major cities. \nNorth Korea's first pizzeria opened in its capital Pyongyang in 2009.\n\nPizza restaurants in Malaysia include Domino's, Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Jom Pizza, and Sure Pizza.\n\nPizza is becoming more popular as a fast food in the urban areas of Nepal, particularly in the capital city, Kathmandu. There are a number of restaurants that serve pizzas in Kathmandu. With the opening of number of international pizza restaurants, the popularity as well as consumption has markedly increased in recent times.They are many types of pizza are there. Some are listed below\n1.mushroom pizza\n2.chicken pizza\n3. pane-er pizza\n\nThe first pizzerias opened in Karachi and Islamabad in the late 1980s, with Pappasallis serving pizza in Islamabad since 1990. Pizza has gained a measure of popularity in the eastern regions of Pakistan—namely, the provinces of Sindh, Punjab, and P.O.K, as well as the autonomous territory of Gilgit-Baltistan. Pizza has not penetrated into western Pakistan; of the remaining provinces and territories of Pakistan, only one (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) has seen much of the dish, in the form of a single Pizza Hut in Peshawar. Chicken Tikka and achari chicken pizzas are popular. In the regions where pizza is known, spicy chicken and sausage-based pizzas are also very popular, as they cater to the local palate.\n\nAuthentic Neapolitan pizzas (\"pizza napoletana\") are typically made with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese. They can be made with ingredients like San Marzano tomatoes, which grow on the volcanic plains to the south of Mount Vesuvius, and mozzarella di bufala Campana, made with the milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio in a semi-wild state (this mozzarella is protected with its own European protected designation of origin).\n\nAccording to the rules proposed by the \"Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana\", the genuine Neapolitan pizza dough consists of wheat flour (type \"0\" or \"00\", or a mixture of both), natural Neapolitan yeast or brewer's yeast, salt and water. For proper results, strong flour with high protein content (as used for bread-making rather than cakes) must be used. The dough must be kneaded by hand or with a low-speed mixer. After the rising process, the dough must be formed by hand without the help of a rolling pin or other machine, and may be no more than thick. The pizza must be baked for 60–90 seconds in a stone oven with an oak-wood fire. When cooked, it should be crispy, tender and fragrant. There are three official variants: \"pizza marinara\", which is made with tomato, garlic, oregano and extra virgin olive oil, \"pizza Margherita\", made with tomato, sliced mozzarella, basil and extra-virgin olive oil, and \"pizza Margherita extra\" made with tomato, mozzarella from Campania in fillets, basil and extra virgin olive oil. The pizza napoletana is a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (\"Specialità Tradizionale Garantita\", STG) product in Europe.\n\nPizza in Lazio (Rome), as well as in many other parts of Italy, is available in two different styles. Take-away shops sell \"pizza rustica\" or \"pizza al taglio\". This pizza is cooked in long, rectangular baking pans and relatively thick (1–2 cm). The pizza is often cooked in an electric oven. It is usually cut with scissors or a knife and sold by weight. In pizzerias, pizza is served in a dish in its traditional round shape. It has a thin, crisp base quite different from the thicker and softer Neapolitan style base. It is usually cooked in a wood-fired oven, giving the pizza its unique flavor and texture. In Rome, a \"pizza napoletana\" is topped with tomato, mozzarella, anchovies and oil (thus, what in Naples is called \"pizza romana\", in Rome is called \"pizza napoletana\"). Other types of Lazio-style pizza include\n\nPizza quattro stagioni is a popular style prepared with various ingredients in four sections, with each section representing a season of the year.\n\nPizza pugliese is prepared with tomato, mozzarella and onion.\n\nPizzetta a small pizza that can range in size from around three inches in diameter to the size of a small personal-sized pizza. It may be served as an hors d'oeuvre.\n\nSicilian pizza is prepared in a manner originating in Sicily, Italy. Just in the US, the phrase \"Sicilian pizza\" is often synonymous with thick-crust or deep-dish pizza derived from the Sicilian \"Sfincione\". In Sicily, there is a variety of pizza called \"Sfincione\". It is that believed Sicilian pizza, Sfincione, or focaccia with toppings, was popular on the western portion of the island as far back as the 1860s.\n\nThere was a bill before the Italian Parliament in 2002 to safeguard the \"traditional Italian pizza\", specifying permissible ingredients and methods of processing (e.g., excluding frozen pizzas). Only pizzas which followed these guidelines could be called \"traditional Italian pizzas\" in Italy. On 9 December 2009, the European Union, upon Italian request, granted Traditional Speciality Guaranteed (TSG) safeguard to traditional Neapolitan pizza, in particular to \"Margherita\" and \"Marinara\". The European Union enacted a protected designation of origin system in the 1990s.\n\nThe Maltese enjoy eating Italian style pizza and fast-food pizzas, as well as experimenting with various toppings, including local produce. One style of fast-food pizza is the typical \"pizza kwadra\" (square pizza), which is found in Pastizzi shops (\"pastizzeriji\"), a deep-pan pizza cut into squares, generally topped with either green olives (\"taż-żebbuġ\"), hard boiled egg and cocktail sausage (\"bajd u zalzett\"), or chicken and barbecue sauce (\"tat-tiġieġ\"). A typical \"Pizzerija\" restaurant will offer a vast number of different pizza recipes, mostly based on the Italian style ones. A typical menu would include:\n\n\nPizza has become a household dish. Nevertheless, the traditional Maltese pizza consists of a typical Maltese ftira covered in cheese (mainly local gbejna), onions and potatoes. In fact, it is most often known simply as \"ftira\" and is mainly sold on the island of Gozo. Different toppings can be added, including tuna, olives, anchovies, sundried tomatoes, and even traditional Maltese sausage.\n\nNorwegians eat the most pizza in the world according to a 2004 survey by ACNielsen 2004, 5,4 kg/year per capita. 50 million frozen pizzas were sold that year, with consumption being 22,000 tons of frozen pizza, 15,000 tons of home-baked and 13,000 tons of restaurant-made pizzas. By far the most popular is the frozen pizza Grandiosa, every other pizza sold, frozen or fresh is a Pizza Grandiosa. Since its start in 1980 the Grandiosa has been part of Norwegian modern culture and trends, going so far to be unofficial called \"The national dish of Norway\".\n\nNorway also has a traditional home-made pizza called \"lørdagspizza\" (literally translates to \"Saturday pizza\"). The dough is shaped to the pan (usually rectangular), then a mix of minced meat and tomato sauce follows. Finally it is gratinated with a generous amount of cheese.\n\nPizza arrived in Sweden with Italian guest workers and became popular around 1970. Swedish pizza is mainly of the Neapolitan type and most pizzerias in Sweden have Margherita, Capricciosa and Quattro Stagioni pizzas at the top of the menu, although with altered recipes. For example, a Swedish Margherita uses Swedish hard cheese instead of mozzarella and dried oregano instead of fresh basil. The Swedish pizza has been developed with lots of innovations and styles, creating a tradition distinct from the Italian one, although some names may overlap. Occasionally pizzerias offer \"Italian pizza\" imitating Italian recipes in addition to the Swedish ones.\n\nA typical Swedish pizzeria offers 40-50 different named varieties on the menu, even up to 100, and personal modifications are allowed. Also, many pizzerias also serve salads, lasagne, kebab and hamburgers, especially if there is a facility to sit and eat. Italian style restaurants often combine a restaurant menu with a pizza menu.\n\nSome popular varieties common in most of Sweden, mostly with the same name, all having tomato sauce and cheese to start with and additional toppings:\n\nPerhaps the most extreme pizza sort heard of in Sweden is the Calskrove or Calzskrove (a portmanteau of calzone and \"skrovmål\" meaning \"big meal\" but also Northern slang for \"hamburger meal\"), sold at some pizzerias in northern Sweden, a complete meal of a 150 or 250 grams hamburger with bread and all regular toppings, and chips (french fries), baked into a regular Calzone with ham as well.\n\nOne of the most popular types of pizza in Sweden since the 1990s is kebab-pizza, and a song in the Swedish Melodifestivalen 2008 was \"Kebabpizza slivovitza\". The invention is most likely the result of the common tendency of pizza bakers to create their own flagship compositions and novel flavors, using whatever might be available in their kitchen. In recent years one can find pizza with fresh lettuce or chips (French fries) put on top after baking. The amount of topping compared to the crust is rather high by international standards.\n\nThe typical side order with Swedish pizza is a free \"pizza salad\". 1969 Giuseppe \"Peppino\" Sperandio opened \"Pizzeria Piazza Opera\", one of the first restaurants only serving pizza in Stockholm, Sweden. Sperandio was born in northeast Italy where a cabbage salad called \"kupus salata\" was a very common dish, from bordering country Croatia. This salad from his childhood, was offered as a free side dish. Eaten, while waiting for the pizza to be baked. Sperandio became Stockholm's pizza king and had during his hey day more than 30 pizza restaurants. Today this Balkan salad (renamed to pizza salad), is as Swedish as the Dala horse.\nThe pizza salad is made with shredded cabbage, coarse pepper and sometimes red bell pepper, slightly pickled (fermented) in vinaigrette for a few days.\n\nIn general, Swedish pizzerias are private enterprises and not franchise, often owned as a family business by immigrants, but very seldom Italians. Of international restaurant chains only Pizza Hut is well established, although Vapiano has a few restaurants in Stockholm and Domino's have been trying to establish itself in southern Sweden since 2008. Many pizzerias offer affordable (about 1-2 € total, or free with large order) home delivery in less than 30 minutes and many are connected to an on-line ordering service. The take-away price of one standard size (30 cm) pizza is 5 to 8 € depending on topping, about the double for a \"family pizza\" of double size (weight), and about the half for a \"children's pizza\" (mostly served in restaurants). Pizza has become a staple food in Sweden (1,1 kg/year), although most people prepare their own food, as home cooking skills generally are good, and is largely considered as an acceptable occasional fast food alternative to a proper meal.\n\nSince the 1980s, a wide variety of pizzas ranging from fairly authentic Italian to American style to the mass-processed varieties are widely available and pizzas are also commonly made at home with children using local substitutions such as bacon for prosciutto and cheddar for mozzarella. Dough bases vary widely from homemade scone doughs to thin Roman-style and thick American stuffed-crust types. The typical British high-street now has a variety of international Italian- and American-style pizza chains, including homegrown chains PizzaExpress, Strada and Prezzo as well as Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's alongside much more authentic independent Italian-run restaurants with wood-fired ovens particularly in large cities such as London. Unique spicy varieties enjoy some popularity, including Chicken tikka masala or other curry toppings, chilli pizzas and a typical mid-range restaurant or takeaway will usually have versions of such standard \"Italian-American\" combinations as 'Hawaiian' (ham and pineapple); 'Peperroni' (spicy salami) and 'Meat Feast' (a mix of meats and salami) and a 'Vegeteriana' options. Non-Italian varieties are common too, for example, lahmacun called 'Turkish pizzas', or Alsatian 'Flammkuchen'. In some parts of Scotland you can get a deep-fried pizza from Fish and Chip shops. A frozen pizza, whole or half, dipped in batter and deep fried. It is usually served with in the same manner as any other fried item from these shops.\n\nIceland has all of the typical pizza toppings you would expect like pepperoni and sausage but also have some unique ones. A pizza topping that is found in Iceland that may not be found elsewhere, except Sweden, would be bananas. Bananas are used as toppings across the country showing how they have created their own version of an Italian classic.\n\nMany Israeli and American pizza stores and chains, including Pizza Hut and Sbarro, have both kosher and non-kosher locations. Kosher locations either have no meat or use imitation meat because of the Jewish religious dietary prohibition against mixing meat with dairy products, such as cheese. Kosher pizza locations must also close during the holiday of Passover, when no leavened bread is allowed in kosher locations. Some Israeli pizza differs from pizza in other countries because of the very large portions of vegetable toppings such as mushrooms or onions, and some unusual toppings, like corn or labane, and middle-Eastern spices, such as za'atar. Like most foods in Israel, pizza choices reflect multiple cultures.\n\nPizza establishments in Turkey are a mixture of local restaurants, local chains (e.g. Pizza Max), and international chains like Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza, Little Caesars, and Sbarro. While most combinations of toppings reflect common ingredients found in the US and Italy, there are additional ingredients available that cater to traditional tastes as well, such as minced beef, spicy Sucuk sausage, cured meats like Pastırma, cheeses like Kaşar and Beyaz, and local olives and herbs. With the exception of some restaurants, pork products like ham and bacon are not available, which are substituted with beef, chicken, or lamb equivalents.\n\nPizza has several equivalent or similar dishes in traditional Turkish cuisine, such as Black-Sea-style or Bafra-style Pide and Lahmacun, which adds to the popularity of the dish across Turkey.\n\nMexican pizza is a pizza made with ingredients typical of Mexican cuisine. The usual toppings that can be found throughout Mexico are chorizo, jalapeño pepper slices, grilled or fried onions, tomato, chile, shrimp, avocado, and sometimes beef, bell peppers, tripas or scallop. This pizza has the usual marinara sauce or white sauce and mozzarella cheese. Variations, substituting pepper jack cheese or Oaxaca cheese for mozzarella, are also popular.\n\nIn 1905, the first pizza establishment in the United States was opened in New York's Little Italy. Due to the influx of Italian immigrants, the U.S. has developed regional forms of pizza, some bearing only a casual resemblance to the Italian original. Chicago has its own style of a deep-dish pizza and New York City's style of pizza are well-known. New York-style pizza refers to the thin crust pizza popular in the states of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Philadelphia provides sauce on top of the cheese; St. Louis and other Midwest pizzas use thin crusts and rectangular slices in its local pizzas. Detroit-style pizza is a square pizza that has a thick deep-dish crisp crust, and is generally served with the sauce on top of the cheese. The square shape is the result of an early tradition of using metal trays originally meant to hold small parts in factories. The jumbo slice is an oversized New York-style pizza sold by the slice to go, especially in the Adams Morgan neighborhood in Washington, D.C. The white clam pie is a pizza variety that originated at the Frank Pepe Pizzeria Napoletana restaurant in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nCanada features many of the large pizza chains found in the United States, but with regional variations resulting from influences of local Canadian cuisine.\n\nThe \"Canadian pizza\" toppings typically include tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, bacon, pepperoni, and mushrooms; variations exist.); this recipe is also known internationally by that name. The typical preparation of the same recipe is often referred to in Québécois as \"pizza québécoise\".\n\nPoutine pizza is one variety that can be found sporadically across the country, and adaptations of this item have even been featured in upscale restaurants.\n\nAtlantic Canada has several unique varieties, which have spread to other parts of the country as people migrate for work. Donair pizza is inspired by the Halifax fast food of the same name, and is topped with mozzarella cheese, spiced & roasted ground beef, tomatoes, onions, and a sweetened condensed milk-based donair sauce. Garlic fingers is an Atlantic Canadian pizza garnished with melted butter, garlic, cheese, and sometimes bacon, with the round sliced into fingers and served with donair sauce. Pictou County Pizza is a variant of pizza unique to Pictou County in Nova Scotia; this pizza has a \"brown sauce\" made from vegetables and spices instead of red tomato sauce. \n\nToronto-style pizza, is a medium-thick crust margarita pizza topped with garlic and basil oil topping, a fusion of an Italian-type pizza and the Vietnamese traditions of using herbed oil toppings.\n\nThe predominantly francophone Canadian province of Quebec has its specialties. One is the \"all dressed\": tomato sauce (a little spicy), pepperoni, onions, green pepper slices, and mushrooms.\nThe poutine pizza variety is topped with French fries, light gravy, and fresh mozarella curds.\n\nAccording to a number of news outlets, the Hawaiian-style (tomato sauce, ham and pineapple) is a Canadian invention, originating at the Satellite Restaurant in Chatham, Ontario. Sam Panopoulos, owner of Satellite, first concocted the Hawaiian pizza in 1962 . By that time Satellite had already started serving Chinese food and Panopoulos thought people would like a similar sweet and savoury flavours together so he took a can of pineapple and tossed the fruit onto a pizza.\n\nThe usual Italian varieties are available, though more common is the style popular in the U.S., with more and richer toppings than Italian style. A common unique type is the Aussie, Australian or Australiana, which has the usual tomato base or a seasoned base and mozzarella cheese with options of chicken, ham, bacon and egg (seen as quintessentially Australian breakfast fare). Pizzas with seafood such as prawns are also popular. In the 1980s some Australian pizza shops and restaurants began selling \"gourmet pizzas\", that is, pizzas with more expensive ingredients such as salmon, dill, bocconcini, tiger prawns, or unconventional toppings such as kangaroo meat, emu and crocodile. \"Wood-fired pizzas\", that is, those cooked in a ceramic oven heated by wood fuel, are well-regarded.\n\nFranchised chains coexists with independent pizzerias, Middle-Eastern bakeries and kebabs shops.\n\nNew Zealand's first dedicated pizza outlet was opened by Pizza Hut in New Lynn in 1974, with Dominos following. One notable indigenous chain is Hell Pizza established in 1996 - which now has outlets worldwide - distinguishing itself by often-controversial marketing and using only free-range ingredients. Independent restaurants are common.\n\nNew Zealand has no rules for pizza construction, leading to an eclectic and varied approach to toppings. Gourmet and \"wild\" ingredients are often used, and New Zealanders are apt to push the boundaries of what a pizza can be.\n\nStandard Argentine pizza has a thicker crust than traditional Italian style pizza and includes more cheese. Pizza is made with very thin, and sometimes thick, high-rising doughs, with or without cheese, cooked in the oven or \"a la piedra\" (on a stone oven), and stuffed with numerous ingredients -— is a dish which can be found in nearly every corner of the country. Buenos Aires, Rosario, and Córdoba also serve it with fainá, which is a chick pea-flour dough placed over the piece of pizza. People say that what makes the Argentine pizza unique is the blending of Italian and Spanish cultures. At the turn of the 19th century, immigrants from Naples and Genoa opened the first pizza bars, though Spanish residents subsequently owned most of the pizza businesses.\nAnother very popular kind is the fugazza, which consists in a regular pizza crust topped with onions, ground black pepper, olive oil and mozzarella cheese (in this case it is called fugazzeta).\n\nSão Paulo has 6,000 pizza establishments and 1.4 million pizzas are consumed daily. It is said that the first Brazilian pizzas were baked in the Brás district of São Paulo in the late part of the 19th century. Until the 1940s, almost only found in the Italian communities around the country. Since then, pizza became increasingly popular among the rest of the population. The most traditional pizzerias are still found in the Italian neighborhoods, such as Bexiga (official name: Bela Vista). Both Neapolitan (thick crust) and Roman (thin crust) varieties are common in Brazil, with traditional versions using tomato sauce and mozzarella as a base. Brazilian pizza in general, though, tends to have less tomato sauce than the authentic (Italian) pizza, or uses slices of tomato in place of sauce. Brazilian pizzerias offer also Brazilian variants such as \"pizza com catupiry\". July 10 is \"Pizza Day\" in São Paulo, marking the final day of an annual competition among \"pizzaiolos\". In Brazil, pizza quatro queijos (\"pizza quattro formaggi\") uses mozzarella, provolone, parmesan and gorgonzola, and there is also a variety with five cheeses, which adds catupiry.\n\n\"Hawaiian pizza\" is popular in Colombia. The pizza is topped with ham and pineapple.\n\n",
                "Italian cuisine\n\nItalian cuisine is food typical from Italy. It has developed through centuries of social and economic changes, with roots stretching to antiquity.\n\nSignificant changes occurred with the discovery of the New World and the introduction of potatoes, tomatoes, bell peppers, maize and sugar beet, this last introduced in quantity in the 18th century. Italian cuisine is known for its regional diversity, especially between the north and the south of the Italian peninsula. It offers an abundance of taste, and is one of the most popular and copied in the world. It influenced several cuisines around the world chiefly that of the United States.\n\nItalian cuisine is characterized by its simplicity, with many dishes having only two to four main ingredients. Italian cooks rely chiefly on the quality of the ingredients rather than on elaborate preparation. Ingredients and dishes vary by region. Many dishes that were once regional, have proliferated with variations throughout the country.\n\nPasta, vegetables, olive oil and fish are a major part of the Italian cuisine. Italian cuisine is probably the most important expression of the Mediterranean diet.\n\nItalian cuisine has developed over the centuries. Although the country known as Italy did not unite until the 19th century, the cuisine can claim traceable roots as far back as the 4th century BCE. Food and culture was very important at that time as we can see from the cookbook (Apicius) which dates back to first century BC. Through the centuries, neighbouring regions, conquerors, high-profile chefs, political upheaval and the discovery of the New World have influenced its development. Italian food started to form after the fall of the Roman Empire, when different cities began to separate and form their own traditions. Many different types of bread and pasta were made, and there was a variation in cooking techniques and preparation. The country was split. For example, the north of Italy (Milan) is known for its risottos, the central/middle of the country (Bologna) is known for its tortellini and the south (Naples) is famous for its pizzas and spaghettis.\n\nThe first known Italian food writer was a Greek Sicilian named Archestratus from Syracuse in the 4th century BCE. He wrote a poem that spoke of using \"top quality and seasonal\" ingredients. He said that flavors should not be masked by spices, herbs or other seasonings. He placed importance on simple preparation of fish.\n\nSimplicity was abandoned and replaced by a culture of gastronomy as the Roman Empire developed. By the time \"De re coquinaria\" was published in the 1st century CE, it contained 470 recipes calling for heavy use of spices and herbs. The Romans employed Greek bakers to produce breads and imported cheeses from Sicily as the Sicilians had a reputation as the best cheesemakers. The Romans reared goats for butchering, and grew artichokes and leeks.\n\nWith culinary traditions from Rome and Athens, a cuisine developed in Sicily that some consider the first real Italian cuisine. Arabs invaded Sicily in the 9th century, introducing spinach, almonds, and rice. During the 12th century, a Norman king surveyed Sicily and saw people making long strings made from flour and water called \"atriya\", which eventually became \"trii\", a term still used for spaghetti in southern Italy. Normans also introduced casseroles, salt cod (baccalà) and stockfish, which remain popular.\n\nFood preservation was either chemical or physical, as refrigeration did not exist. Meats and fish would be smoked, dried or kept on ice. Brine and salt were used to pickle items such as herring, and to cure pork. Root vegetables were preserved in brine after they had been parboiled. Other means of preservation included oil, vinegar or immersing meat in congealed, rendered fat. For preserving fruits, liquor, honey and sugar were used.\n\nThe northern Italian regions show a mix of Germanic and Roman culture while the south reflects Arab influence, as much Mediterranean cuisine was spread by Arab trade. The oldest Italian book on cuisine is the 13th century \"Liber de coquina\" written in Naples. Dishes include \"Roman-style\" cabbage (\"ad usum romanorum\"), \"ad usum campanie\" which were \"small leaves\" prepared in the \"Campanian manner\", a bean dish from the Marca di Trevisio, a \"torta\", \"compositum londardicum\" which are similar to dishes prepared today. Two other books from the 14th century include recipes for Roman \"pastello\", Lasagna pie, and call for the use of salt from Sardinia or Chioggia.\nIn the 15th century, Maestro Martino was chef to the Patriarch of Aquileia at the Vatican. His \"Libro de arte coquinaria\" describes a more refined and elegant cuisine. His book contains a recipe for \"Maccaroni Siciliani\", made by wrapping dough around a thin iron rod to dry in the sun. The macaroni was cooked in capon stock flavored with saffron, displaying Persian influences. Of particular note is Martino's avoidance of excessive spices in favor of fresh herbs. The Roman recipes include \"coppiette\" (air-dried salami) and cabbage dishes. His Florentine dishes include eggs with \"Bolognese torta\", \"Sienese torta\" and Genoese recipes such as \"piperata\" (sweets), macaroni, squash, mushrooms, and spinach pie with onions.\n\nMartino's text was included in a 1475 book by Bartolomeo Platina printed in Venice entitled \"De honesta voluptate et valetudine\" (\"On Honest Pleasure and Good Health\"). Platina puts Martino's \"Libro\" in regional context, writing about perch from Lake Maggiore, sardines from Lake Garda, grayling from Adda, hens from Padua, olives from Bologna and Piceno, turbot from Ravenna, rudd from Lake Trasimeno, carrots from Viterbo, bass from the Tiber, \"roviglioni\" and shad from Lake Albano, snails from Rieti, figs from Tuscolo, grapes from Narni, oil from Cassino, oranges from Naples and eels from Campania. Grains from Lombardy and Campania are mentioned as is honey from Sicily and Taranto. Wine from the Ligurian coast, Greco from Tuscany and San Severino and Trebbiano from Tuscany and Piceno are also in the book.\n\nThe courts of Florence, Rome, Venice and Ferrara were central to the cuisine. Cristoforo di Messisbugo, steward to Ippolito d'Este, published \"Banchetti Composizioni di Vivande\" in 1549. Messisbugo gives recipes for pies and tarts (containing 124 recipes with various fillings). The work emphasizes the use of Eastern spices and sugar.\nIn 1570, Bartolomeo Scappi, personal chef to Pope Pius V, wrote his \"Opera\" in five volumes, giving a comprehensive view of Italian cooking of that period. It contains over 1,000 recipes, with information on banquets including displays and menus as well as illustrations of kitchen and table utensils. This book differs from most books written for the royal courts in its preference for domestic animals and courtyard birds rather than game.\n\nRecipes include lesser cuts of meats such as tongue, head and shoulder. The third volume has recipes for fish in Lent. These fish recipes are simple, including poaching, broiling, grilling and frying after marination.\n\nParticular attention is given to seasons and places where fish should be caught. The final volume includes pies, tarts, fritters and a recipe for a sweet Neapolitan pizza (not the current savory version, as tomatoes had not been introduced to Italy). However, such items from the New World as corn (maize) and turkey are included.\n\nIn the first decade of the 17th century, Giangiacomo Castelvetro wrote \"Breve Racconto di Tutte le Radici di Tutte l'Herbe et di Tutti i Frutti\" (\"A Brief Account of All Roots, Herbs and Fruit\"), translated into English by Gillian Riley. Originally from Modena, Castelvetro moved to England because he was a Protestant. The book has a list of Italian vegetables and fruits and their preparation. He featured vegetables as a central part of the meal, not just accompaniments.\n\nHe favored simmering vegetables in salted water and serving them warm or cold with olive oil, salt, fresh ground pepper, lemon juice or verjus or orange juice. He also suggests roasting vegetables wrapped in damp paper over charcoal or embers with a drizzle of olive oil. Castelvetro's book is separated into seasons with hop shoots in the spring and truffles in the winter, detailing the use of pigs in the search for truffles.\nIn 1662, Bartolomeo Stefani, chef to the Duchy of Mantua, published \"L'Arte di Ben Cucinare\". He was the first to offer a section on \"vitto ordinario\" (\"ordinary food\"). The book described a banquet given by Duke Charles for Queen Christina of Sweden, with details of the food and table settings for each guest, including a knife, fork, spoon, glass, a plate (instead of the bowls more often used) and a napkin.\n\nOther books from this time, such as \"Galatheo\" by Giovanni della Casa, tell how \"scalci\" (\"waiters\") should manage themselves while serving their guests. Waiters should not scratch their heads or other parts of themselves, or spit, sniff, cough or sneeze while serving diners. The book also told diners not to use their fingers while eating and not to wipe sweat with their napkin.\n\nAt the beginning of the 18th century, Italian culinary books began to emphasize the regionalism of Italian cuisine rather than French cuisine. Books written then were no longer addressed to professional chefs but to bourgeois housewives. Periodicals in booklet form such as \"La cuoca cremonese\" (\"The Cook of Cremona\") in 1794 give a sequence of ingredients according to season along with chapters on meat, fish and vegetables. As the century progressed these books increased in size, popularity and frequency.\n\nIn the 18th century, medical texts warned peasants against eating refined foods as it was believed that these were poor for their digestion and their bodies required heavy meals. It was believed by some that peasants ate poorly because they preferred eating poorly. However, many peasants had to eat rotten food and moldy bread because that was all they could afford.\n\nIn 1779, Antonio Nebbia from Macerata in the Marche region, wrote \"Il Cuoco Maceratese\" (\"The Cook of Macerata\"). Nebbia addressed the importance of local vegetables and pasta, rice and gnocchi. For stock, he preferred vegetables and chicken over other meats.\n\nIn 1773, the Neapolitan Vincenzo Corrado's \"Il Cuoco Galante\" (\"The Courteous Cook\") gave particular emphasis to \"Vitto Pitagorico\" (vegetarian food). \"Pythagorean food consists of fresh herbs, roots, flowers, fruits, seeds and all that is produced in the earth for our nourishment. It is so called because Pythagoras, as is well known, only used such produce. There is no doubt that this kind of food appears to be more natural to man, and the use of meat is noxious.\" This book was the first to give the tomato a central role with thirteen recipes.\n\"Zuppa alli Pomidoro\" in Corrado's book is a dish similar to today's Tuscan pappa al pomodoro. Corrado's 1798 edition introduced a \"Treatise on the Potato\" after the French Antoine-Augustin Parmentier's successful promotion of it. In 1790, Francesco Leonardi in his book \"L'Apicio moderno\" (\"Modern Apicius\") sketches a history of the Italian Cuisine from the Roman Age and gives as first a recipe of a tomato based sauce.\n\nIn the 19th century, Giovanni Vialardi, chef to King Victor Emmanuel, wrote \"A Treatise of Modern Cookery and Patisserie\" with recipes \"suitable for a modest household\". Many of his recipes are for regional dishes from Turin including twelve for potatoes such as \"Genoese Cappon Magro\". In 1829, \"Il Nuovo Cuoco Milanese Economico\" by Giovanni Felice Luraschi features Milanese dishes such as Kidney with Anchovies and Lemon and Gnocchi alla Romana. Gian Battista and Giovanni Ratto's \"La Cucina Genovese\" in 1871 addressed the cuisine of Liguria. This book contained the first recipe for pesto. \"La Cucina Teorico-Pratica\" written by Ippolito Cavalcanti has the first recipe for pasta with tomatoes.\n\n\"La scienza in cucina e l'arte di mangiare bene\" (\"The Science of Cooking and the Art of Eating Well\"), by Pellegrino Artusi, first published in 1891, is widely regarded as the canon of classic modern Italian cuisine, and it is still in print. Its recipes come mainly from Romagna and Tuscany, where he lived.\n\nItalian cuisine has a great variety of different ingredients which are commonly used, ranging from fruits, vegetables, sauces, meats, etc. In the North of Italy, fish (such as cod, or baccalà), potatoes, rice, corn (maize), sausages, pork, and different types of cheeses are the most common ingredients. Pasta dishes with use of tomato are spread in all Italy. Italians like their ingredients fresh and subtly seasoned and spiced.\n\nIn Northern Italy though there are many kinds of stuffed pasta, polenta and risotto are equally popular if not more so. Ligurian ingredients include several types of fish and seafood dishes; basil (found in pesto), nuts and olive oil are very common. In Emilia-Romagna, common ingredients include ham (prosciutto), sausage (cotechino), different sorts of salami, truffles, grana, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and tomatoes (Bolognese sauce or ragù).\nTraditional Central Italian cuisine uses ingredients such as tomatoes, all kinds of meat, fish, and pecorino cheese. In Tuscany pasta (especially pappardelle) is traditionally served with meat sauce (including game meat). Finally, in Southern Italy, tomatoes – fresh or cooked into tomato sauce – peppers, olives and olive oil, garlic, artichokes, oranges, ricotta cheese, eggplants, zucchini, certain types of fish (anchovies, sardines and tuna), and capers are important components to the local cuisine.\n\nItalian cuisine is also well known (and well regarded) for its use of a diverse variety of pasta. Pasta include noodles in various lengths, widths and shapes. Distinguished on shapes they are named—penne, maccheroni, spaghetti, linguine, fusilli, lasagne and many more varieties that are filled with other ingredients like ravioli and tortellini.\n\nThe word pasta is also used to refer to dishes in which pasta products are a primary ingredient. It is usually served with sauce. There are hundreds of different shapes of pasta with at least locally recognized names.\n\nExamples include spaghetti (thin rods), rigatoni (tubes or cylinders), fusilli (swirls), and lasagne (sheets). Dumplings, like gnocchi (made with potatoes or pumpkin) and noodles like spätzle, are sometimes considered pasta. They are both traditional in parts of Italy.\n\nPasta is categorized in two basic styles: dried and fresh. Dried pasta made without eggs can be stored for up to two years under ideal conditions, while fresh pasta will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator. Pasta is generally cooked by boiling. Under Italian law, dry pasta (pasta secca) can only be made from durum wheat flour or durum wheat semolina, and is more commonly used in Southern Italy compared to their Northern counterparts, who traditionally prefer the fresh egg variety.\n\nDurum flour and durum semolina have a yellow tinge in color. Italian pasta is traditionally cooked \"al dente\" (Italian: \"firm to the bite\", meaning not too soft). Outside Italy, dry pasta is frequently made from other types of flour, but this yields a softer product that cannot be cooked al dente. There are many types of wheat flour with varying gluten and protein levels depending on variety of grain used.\n\nParticular varieties of pasta may also use other grains and milling methods to make the flour, as specified by law. Some pasta varieties, such as pizzoccheri, are made from buckwheat flour. Fresh pasta may include eggs (pasta all'uovo 'egg pasta'). Whole wheat pasta has become increasingly popular because of its supposed health benefits over pasta made from refined flour.\n\nEach area has its own specialties, primarily at a regional level, but also at provincial level. The differences can come from a bordering country (such as France or Austria), whether a region is close to the sea or the mountains, and economics. Italian cuisine is also seasonal with priority placed on the use of fresh produce.\n\nPasta, meat and vegetables are central to the cuisine of Abruzzo and Molise. Chili peppers (\"peperoncini\") are typical of Abruzzo, where they are called \"diavoletti\" (\"little devils\") for their spicy heat. Due to the long history of shepherding in Abruzzo and Molise, lamb dishes are common. Lamb is often used with pasta. Mushrooms (usually wild mushrooms), rosemary, and garlic are also extensively used in Abruzzese cuisine.\n\nBest-known is the extra virgin olive oil produced in the local farms on the hills of the region, marked by the quality level DOP and considered one of the best in the country. Renowned wines like Montepulciano DOCG and Trebbiano d'Abruzzo DOC are considered amongst the world’s finest wines. In 2012 a bottle of Trebbiano d'Abruzzo Colline Teramane ranked #1 in the top 50 Italian wine award. \"Centerbe\" (\"Hundred Herbs\") is a strong (72% alcohol), spicy herbal liqueur drunk by the locals. Another liqueur is \"genziana\", a soft distillate of gentian roots.\n\nThe best-known dish from Abruzzo is \"arrosticini\", little pieces of castrated lamb on a wooden stick and cooked on coals. The \"\" (literally \"guitar\") is a fine stringed tool that pasta dough is pressed through for cutting. In the province of Teramo, famous local dishes include the \"virtù\" soup (made with legumes, vegetables and pork meat); the \"timballo\" (pasta sheets filled with meat, vegetables or rice); and the \"\" (lamb intestines filled with garlic, marjoram, lettuce, and various spices). The popularity of saffron, grown in the province of L'Aquila, has waned in recent years. The most famous dish of Molise is \"cavatelli\", a long shaped, handmade \"maccheroni\"-type pasta made of flour, semolina and water, often served with meat sauce, broccoli or mushrooms. Pizzelle cookies are a common dessert, especially around Christmas.\n\nThe cuisine of Basilicata is mostly based on inexpensive ingredients and deeply anchored in rural traditions.\n\nPork is an integral part of the regional cuisine, often made into sausages or roasted on a spit. Famous dry sausages from the region are lucanica and soppressata. Wild boar, mutton and lamb are also popular. Pasta sauces are generally based on meats or vegetables. Spicy peperoncini is largely used, as well as the so-called \"peperoni cruschi\" (crunchy peppers). The region produces cheeses like the Pecorino di Filiano PDO, Canestrato di Moliterno PGI, Pallone di Gravina and Paddraccio and olive oils like the Vulture PDO.\n\nBasilicata is known for spaghetti-like pasta \"troccoli\" and \"capunti\", a thick and short oval pasta whose shape is often compared to that of an open empty pea pod. \"Capunti\" are usually served with a hearty vegetable tomato sauce or various meat sauces.\n\nAmong the traditional dishes are \"lagane e ceci\", also known as \"piatto del brigante\" (brigand's dish), pasta prepared with chick peas and peeled tomatoes; \"rafanata\", a type of omelette with horseradish; \"ciaudedda\", a vegetable stew with artichokes, potatoes, broad beans and pancetta; and the \"baccalà alla lucana\", one of the few recipes made with fish. Desserts include \"taralli dolci\", made with sugar glaze and scented with anise; and \"calzoncelli\", fried pastries filled with a cream of chestnuts and chocolate.\n\nThe most famous wine of the region is the Aglianico del Vulture DOCG, others include Matera DOC, Terre dell'Alta Val d'Agri and Grottino di Roccanova.\n\nBasilicata is also known for its mineral waters which are sold widely in Italy. The springs are mostly located in the volcanic basin of the Vulture area.\n\nIn Calabria, a history of French rule under the House of Anjou and Napoleon, along with Spanish influence, affected the language and culinary skills as seen in the naming of things such as cake, \"gatò\", from the French \"gateau\". Seafood includes swordfish, shrimp, lobster, sea urchin and squid. Macaroni-type pasta is widely used in regional dishes, often served with goat, beef or pork sauce and salty \"ricotta\".\n\nMain courses include \"Frìttuli\" (prepared by boiling pork rind, meat and trimmings in pork fat), different varieties of spicy sausages (like Nduja and Capicola), goat and land snails. Melon and watermelon are traditionally served in a chilled fruit salad or wrapped in ham. Calabrian wines include Greco di Bianco, Bivongi, Cirò, Dominici, Lamezia, Melissa, Pollino, Sant'Anna di Isola Capo Rizzuto, San Vito di Luzzi, Savuto, Scavigna, Verbicaro.\n\nAnother famous dish that has a Calabrese background is its famous Calabrese pizza. This pizza has a Neapolitan-based structure with fresh tomato sauce and a cheese base. However, what makes this type of pizza unique from others is its spicy, but rather tasty flavor. Some of the ingredients included in a Calabrese pizza are: thinly sliced hot soppressata, hot capicola, hot peppers and fresh mozzarella. A Calabrese style pizza has become a well known menu item in many Italian restaurants around the world.\n\nCampania extensively produces tomatoes, peppers, spring onions, potatoes, artichokes, fennel, lemons and oranges which all take on the flavor of volcanic soil. The Gulf of Naples offers fish and seafood. Campania is one of the largest producers and consumers of pasta in Italy, especially spaghetti. In the regional cuisine, pasta is prepared in various styles that can feature tomato sauce, cheese, clams and shellfish.\n\n\"Spaghetti alla puttanesca\" is a popular dish made with olives, tomatoes, anchovies, capers, chili peppers and garlic. The region is well-known also for its \"mozzarella\" production (especially from the milk of water buffalo) that's used in a variety of dishes, including \"parmigiana\" (shallow fried eggplant slices layered with cheese and tomato sauce, then baked). Desserts include \"struffoli\" (deep fried balls of dough) \"ricotta\"-based \"pastiera\" and \"sfogliatelle\", and rum-dipped \"babà\".\n\nOriginating in Neapolitan cuisine, pizza has become popular in many different parts of the world. Pizza is an oven-baked, flat, disc-shaped bread typically topped with a tomato sauce, cheese (usually mozzarella) and various toppings depending on the culture. Since the original pizza, several other types of pizzas have evolved.\n\nSince Naples was the capital of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies, its cuisine took much from the culinary traditions of all the Campania region, reaching a balance between dishes based on rural ingredients (pasta, vegetables, cheese) and seafood dishes (fish, crustaceans, mollusks). A vast variety of recipes is influenced by the local aristocratic cuisine, like \"timballo\" and the \"\", pasta or rice dishes with very elaborate preparation, while the dishes coming from the popular traditions contain inexpensive but nutritionally healthy ingredients, like pasta with beans and other pasta dishes with vegetables.\n\nFamous regional wines are Aglianico (Taurasi), Fiano, Falanghina, and Greco di Tufo.\n\nEmilia-Romagna is known for its egg and filled pasta made with soft wheat flour. The Romagna subregion is known as well for pasta dishes like \"cappelletti\", \"garganelli\", \"strozzapreti\", \"sfoglia lorda\" and \"tortelli alla lastra\" or very peculiar cheese like , piada snacks are famous worldwide.\n\nIn the Emilia subregion, except Piacenza which is heavily influenced by the cuisines of Lombardy, rice is eaten to a lesser extent. \"Polenta\", a maize-based dish, is common both in Emilia and Romagna.\nBologna and Modena are notable for pasta dishes like \"tortellini\", \"lasagne\", gramigna and \"tagliatelle\" which are found also in many other parts of the region in different declinations. The celebrated balsamic vinegar is made only in the Emilian cities of Modena and Reggio Emilia, following legally binding traditional procedures. Parmigiano Reggiano cheese is produced in Reggio Emilia, Parma, Modena and Bologna and is much used in cooking, while Grana Padano variety is produced in Piacenza.\n\nAlthough the Adriatic coast is a major fishing area (well known for its eels and clams), the region is more famous for its meat products, especially pork-based, that include: Parma's \"prosciutto\", \"culatello\" and \"Felino salami\", Piacenza's \"pancetta\", \"coppa\" and salami, Bologna's \"mortadella\" and \"salame rosa\", Modena's \"zampone\", \"cotechino\" and \"\" and Ferrara's \"\". Piacenza is also known for some dishes prepared with horse and donkey meat. Regional desserts include \"zuppa inglese\" (custard-based dessert made with sponge cake and Alchermes liqueur) and \"panpepato\" (Christmas cake made with pepper, chocolate, spices, and almonds).\n\nFriuli-Venezia Giulia conserved, in its cuisine, the historical links with Austria-Hungary. Udine and Pordenone, in the western part of Friuli, are known for their traditional San Daniele del Friuli ham, Montasio cheese, and Frico cheese. Other typical dishes are \"pitina\" (meatballs made of smoked meats), game, and various types of \"gnocchi\" and \"polenta\".\n\nThe majority of the eastern regional dishes are heavily influenced by Austrian, Hungarian, Slovene and Croatian cuisines: typical dishes include Istrian Stew (soup of beans, sauerkraut, potatoes, bacon and spare ribs), Vienna sausages, \"goulash\", \"ćevapi\", apple strudel, \"gugelhupf\". Pork can be spicy and is often prepared over an open hearth called a \"fogolar\". Collio Goriziano, Friuli Isonzo, Colli Orientali del Friuli and Ramandolo are well-known DOC regional wines.\n\nLiguria is known for herbs and vegetables (as well as seafood) in its cuisine. Savory pies are popular, mixing greens and artichokes along with cheeses, milk curds and eggs. Onions and olive oil are used. Because of a lack of land suitable for wheat, the Ligurians use chickpeas in \"farinata\" and polenta-like \"panissa\". The former is served plain or topped with onions, artichokes, sausage, cheese or young anchovies.\n\nHilly districts use chestnuts as a source of carbohydrates. Ligurian pastas include \"corzetti\" from the Polcevera valley, \"pansoti\", a triangular shaped ravioli filled with vegetables, \"piccagge\", pasta ribbons made with a small amount of egg and served with artichoke sauce or \"pesto\" sauce, \"trenette\", made from whole wheat flour cut into long strips and served with pesto, boiled beans and potatoes, and \"trofie\", a Ligurian \"gnocchi\" made from whole grain flour and boiled potatoes, made into a spiral shape and often tossed in \"pesto\". Many Ligurians emigrated to Argentina in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, influencing the cuisine of this country (which otherwise dominated by meat and dairy products which the narrow Ligurian hinterland would have not allowed).\n\nPasta dishes based on the use of \"guanciale\" (unsmoked bacon prepared with pig's jowl or cheeks) are often found in Lazio, such as pasta \"alla carbonara\", and pasta \"all'amatriciana\". Another pasta dish of the region is \"arrabbiata\", with spicy tomato sauce. The regional cuisine widely use offal, resulting in dishes like the entrail-based \"rigatoni\" with \"pajata\" sauce and \"coda alla vaccinara\".\n\nIconic of Lazio is cheese made from ewes' milk (Pecorino Romano), \"porchetta\" (savory, fatty, and moist boneless pork roast) and Frascati white wine. The influence of the ancient Jewish community can be noticed in the Roman cuisine's traditional \"carciofi alla giudia\".\n\nThe regional cuisine of Lombardy is heavily based upon ingredients like maize, rice, beef, pork, butter, and lard. Rice dishes are very popular in this region, often found in soups as well as \"risotto\". The best-known version is \"risotto alla milanese\", flavoured with saffron and typically served with many typical Milanese main courses, such as \"ossobuco alla milanese\" (cross-cut veal shanks braised with vegetables, white wine and broth) and \"cotoletta alla milanese\" (a fried cutlet similar to Wiener schnitzel, but cooked \"bone-in\").\n\nOther regional specialities include \"cassoeula\" (a typical winter dish prepared with cabbage and pork), Cremona's Mostarda (rich condiment made with candied fruit and a mustard flavoured syrup), Valtellina's Bresaola (air-dried salted beef) and Pizzoccheri (a flat ribbon pasta, made with 80% buckwheat flour and 20% wheat flour cooked along with greens, cubed potatoes and layered with pieces of Valtellina Casera cheese) and Mantua's \"tortelli di zucca\" (\"ravioli\" with pumpkin filling) accompanied by melted butter and followed by turkey stuffed with chicken or other stewed meats.\nRegional cheeses include Robiola, Crescenza, Taleggio, Gorgonzola and Grana Padano (the plains of central and southern Lombardy allow intensive cattle-raising). \"Polenta\" is generally common across the region. Regional desserts include the famous \"panettone\" Christmas cake (sweet bread with candied orange, citron, and lemon zest, as well as raisins, which are added dry and not soaked).\n\nOn the coast of Marche, fish and seafood are produced. Inland, wild and domestic pigs are used for sausages and hams. These hams are not thinly sliced, but cut into bite-sized chunks. Suckling pig, chicken and fish are often stuffed with rosemary or fennel fronds and garlic before being roasted or placed on the spit.\n\nAscoli, Marche's southernmost province, is well known for \"Olive all'ascolana\", (stoned olives stuffed with several minced meats, egg and Parmesan, then fried). Another well-known Marche product are the \"\", from little town of Campofilone, a kind of hand-made pasta made only of hard grain flour and eggs, cut so thin that melts in the mouth.\n\nBetween the Alps and the Po valley, with a large number of different ecosystems, this region offers the most refined and varied cuisine of the Italian peninsula. Point of union of traditional Italian and French cuisine, Piedmont is the Italian region with the largest number of cheeses Protected Geographical Status and wines Denominazione di origine controllata. It is also the region where both Slow Food association and the most prestigious school of Italian cooking, the University of Gastronomic Sciences, were founded.\n\nPiedmont is a region where gathering nuts, mushrooms, cardoons and hunting and fishing takes place. Truffles, garlic, seasonal vegetables, cheese and rice are all used. Wines from the Nebbiolo grape such as Barolo and Barbaresco are produced as well as wines from the Barbera grape, fine sparkling wines, and the sweet, lightly sparkling, Moscato d'Asti. The region is also famous for its Vermouth and Ratafia production.\n\nCastelmagno is a prized cheese of the region. Piedmont is also famous for the quality of its Carrù beef (particularly famous for its fair of the \"Bue Grasso\", Fat Ox), hence the tradition of eating raw meat seasoned with garlic oil, lemon and salt the famous Carpaccio, the famous Brasato al vino, wine stew made from marinated beef, and boiled beef served with various sauces.\n\nThe food most typical of the Piedmont tradition are its traditional \"agnolotti\" (pasta folded over with a roast beef meat and vegetable stuffing), \"Panissa\" (a typical dish of Vercelli, a kind of risotto with Arborio rice or Maratelli rice, the typical kind of Saluggia beans, onion, Barbera wine, lard, salami, salt and pepper), \"taglierini\" (thinner version of tagliatelle), \"bagna cauda\" (sauce of garlic, anchovies, olive oil and butter) and \"bicerin\" (hot drink made of coffee, chocolate and whole milk). Finally Piedmont is one of the Italian capitals of pastry and chocolate in particular, with products like Nutella, \"gianduiotto\" and \"marron glacé\" that are famous worldwide.\n\nApulia is a massive food producer: major production includes wheat, tomatoes, zucchini, broccoli, bell peppers, potatoes, spinach, eggplants, cauliflower, fennel, endive, chickpeas, lentils, beans and cheese (like the traditional \"caciocavallo\" cheese). Apulia is also the largest producer of olive oil in Italy. The sea offers abundant fish and seafood that are extensively used in the regional cuisine, especially oysters, and mussels.\n\nGoat and lamb are occasionally used. The region is known for pasta made from durum wheat and traditional pasta dishes featuring \"orecchiette\"-type pasta, often served with tomato sauce, potatoes, mussels or cime di rapa. Pasta with cherry tomatoes and arugula is also popular.\n\nRegional desserts include \"zeppola\", doughnuts usually topped with powdered sugar and filled with custard, jelly, cannoli-style pastry cream or a butter-and-honey mixture. For Christmas, Apulians make a very traditional rose shape pastry called Cartellate. These are fried and dipped in Vin Cotto which is a reduction of wine or in some cases of fig juice.\n\nSuckling pig and wild boar are roasted on the spit or boiled in stews of beans and vegetables, thickened with bread. Herbs such as mint and myrtle are widely used in the regional cuisine. Sardinia also has many special types of bread, made dry, which keeps longer than high-moisture breads.\nAlso baked are \"carasau\" bread \"\", \"\", a highly decorative bread, and \"\" made with flour and water only, originally meant for herders, but often served at home with tomatoes, basil, oregano, garlic and a strong cheese. Rock lobster, scampi, squid, tuna, sardines are the predominant seafoods.\n\nCasu marzu is a very strong cheese produced in Sardinia, but is of questionable legality due to hygiene concerns.\n\nSicily shows traces of all the cultures which established themselves on the island over the last two millennia. Although its cuisine undoubtably has a predominantly Italian base, Sicilian food also has Spanish, Greek and Arab influences. Dionysus is said to have introduced wine to the region: a trace of historical influence from Ancient Greece.\nThe ancient Romans introduced lavish dishes based on goose. The Byzantines favored sweet and sour flavors and the Arabs brought sugar, citrus, rice, spinach, and saffron. The Normans and Hohenstaufens had a fondness for meat dishes. The Spanish introduced items from the New World including chocolate, maize, turkey and tomatoes.\n\nMuch of the island's cuisine encourages the use of fresh vegetables such as eggplant, peppers, and tomatoes, and fish such as tuna, sea bream, sea bass, cuttlefish, and swordfish. In Trapani, in the extreme western corner of the island, North African influences are clear in the use of various \"couscous\" based dishes, usually combined with fish. mint is used extensively in cooking unlike the rest of Italy.\n\nTraditional specialties from Sicily include \"arancini\" (a form of deep-fried rice croquettes), pasta \"alla Norma\", \"caponata\", \"pani ca meusa\", and a host of desserts and sweets such as cannoli, granita, and cassata).\n\nTypical of Sicily is Marsala, a red, fortified wine similar to Port and largely exported.\n\nBefore the Council of Trent in the middle of the 16th century, the region was known for the simplicity of its peasant cuisine. When the prelates of the Catholic Church established there, they brought the art of fine cooking with them. Later, also influences from Venice and the Austrian Habsburg Empire came in.\n\nThe Trentino subregion produces various types of sausages, \"polenta\", yogurt, cheese, potato cake, funnel cake and freshwater fish. In the Südtirol (Alto Adige) subregion, due to the German-speaking majority population, strong Austrian and Slavic influences prevail. The most renowned local product is traditional \"speck\" juniper-flavored ham which, as Speck Alto Adige PGI, is regulated by the European Union under the protected geographical indication (PGI) status. \"Goulash\", \"knödel\", apple strudel, \"kaiserschmarrn\", \"krapfen\", \"rösti\", \"spätzle\" and rye bread are regular dishes, along with potatoes, dumpling, homemade \"sauerkraut\", and lard. The territory of Bolzano is also reputed for its Müller-Thurgau white wines.\n\nSimplicity is central to the Tuscan cuisine. Legumes, bread, cheese, vegetables, mushrooms and fresh fruit are used. A good example would be \"ribollita\", a notable Tuscan soup whose name literally means \"reboiled\". Like most Tuscan cuisine, the soup has peasant origins.\n\nIt was originally made by reheating (i.e. reboiling) the leftover \"minestrone\" or vegetable soup from the previous day. There are many variations but the main ingredients always include leftover bread, cannellini beans and inexpensive vegetables such as carrot, cabbage, beans, silverbeet, \"cavolo nero\" (Tuscan kale), onion and olive oil.\n\nA regional Tuscan pasta known as \"pici\" resembles thick, grainy-surfaced spaghetti, and is often rolled by hand. White truffles from San Miniato appear in October and November. High-quality beef, used for the traditional Florentine steak, come from the Chianina cattle breed of the Chiana Valley and the Maremmana from Maremma.\n\nPork is also produced. The region is well-known also for its rich game, especially wild boar, hare, fallow deer, roe deer and pheasant that often are used to prepare \"pappardelle\" dishes. Regional desserts include \"panforte\" (prepared with honey, fruits and nuts), \"ricciarelli\" (biscuits made using an almond base with sugar, honey and egg white), and \"cavallucci\" (cookies made with almonds, candied fruits, coriander, flour, honey). Well-known regional wines include Brunello di Montalcino, Carmignano, Chianti, Morellino di Scansano, Parrina, Sassicaia, Vernaccia di San Gimignano.\n\nMany Umbrian dishes are prepared by boiling or roasting with local olive oil and herbs. Vegetable dishes are popular in the spring and summer, while fall and winter sees meat from hunting and black truffles from Norcia. Meat dishes include the traditional wild boar sausages, pheasants, geese, pigeons, frogs, snails. Castelluccio is known for its lentils, Spoleto and Monteleone are known for spelt. Freshwater fish include lasca, trout, freshwater perch, grayling, eel, barbel, whitefish, and tench. Orvieto and Sagrantino di Montefalco are important regional wines.\n\nIn the Aosta Valley, bread-thickened soups are customary as well as cheese fondue, chestnuts, potatoes, rice. \"Polenta\" is a staple along with rye bread, smoked bacon, Motsetta (cured chamois meat) and game from the mountains and forests. Butter and cream are important in stewed, roasted and braised dishes. Typical regional products include Fontina cheese, Vallée d'Aoste Lard d'Arnad, red wines and Génépi Artemisia-based liqueur.\n\nVenice and many surrounding parts of Veneto are known for \"risotto\", a dish whose ingredients can highly vary upon different areas, as fish and seafood being added closer to the coast and pumpkin, asparagus, radicchio and frogs' legs appearing further away from the Adriatic. Made from finely ground maize meal, \"polenta\" is a traditional, rural food typical of Veneto and most of Northern Italy. It may find its way into stirred dishes and baked dishes and can be served with various cheese, stockfish or meat dishes.\nSome polenta dishes includes porcini, rapini, or other vegetables or meats, such as small song-birds in the case of the Venetian and Lombard dish \"polenta e osei\", or sausages. In some areas of Veneto it can be also made of a particular variety of cornmeal, named \"biancoperla\", so that the colour of polenta is white and not yellow (the so-called \"polenta bianca\").\n\nBeans, peas and other legumes are seen in these areas with \"pasta e fagioli\" (beans and pasta) and \"risi e bisi\" (rice and peas). Veneto features heavy dishes using exotic spices and sauces. Ingredients such as stockfish or simple marinated anchovies are found here as well.\n\nLess fish and more meat is eaten away from the coast. Other typical products are sausages such as Soppressa Vicentina, garlic salami, Piave cheese and Asiago cheese. High quality vegetables are prized, such as red radicchio from Treviso and white asparagus from Bassano del Grappa. Perhaps the most popular dish of Venice is \"fegato alla veneziana\", thinly-sliced veal liver sauteed with onions.\n\nSquid and cuttlefish are common ingredients, as is squid ink, called \"nero di seppia\". Regional desserts include \"tiramisu\" (made of biscuits dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of egg yolks and \"mascarpone\", and flavored with liquor and cocoa), \"baicoli\" (biscuits made with butter and vanilla) and nougat.\n\nThe most celebrated Veneto wines include Bardolino, Prosecco, Soave, Amarone and Valpolicella DOC wines.\n\nTraditionally, meals in Italy usually contain four or five courses. Especially on weekends, meals are often seen as a time to spend with family and friends rather than simply for sustenance; thus, meals tend to be longer than in other cultures. During holidays such as Christmas and New Year's Eve, feasts can last for hours.\n\nToday, the traditional Italian menu is kept mainly for special events (such as weddings) while an everyday menu includes only the first and/or second course, the side dish, and coffee. A notable aspect of Italian meals is that the \"primo\" or first course is usually a more filling dish such as risotto or pasta. Italian cuisine also includes single courses (all-in-one courses), providing carbohydrates and proteins at the same time (e.g. pasta and legumes).\n\nEach type of establishment has a defined role and traditionally sticks to it.\n\nItalian style coffee (\"caffè\"), also known as espresso, is made from a blend of coffee beans. Espresso beans are roasted medium to medium dark in the north, and darker as you move south.\n\nA common misconception is that espresso has more caffeine than other coffee; in fact the opposite is true. The longer roasting period extracts more caffeine. The modern espresso machine, invented in 1937 by Achille Gaggia, uses a pump and pressure system with water heated to and forced at high pressure through a few grams of finely ground coffee in 25–30 seconds, resulting in about 25 milliliters (0.85 fl oz, two tablespoons) of liquid.\n\nHome coffee makers are simpler but work under the same principle. \"La Napoletana\" is a four-part stove-top unit with grounds loosely placed inside a filter; the kettle portion is filled with water and once boiling, the unit is inverted to drip through the grounds. The \"Moka per il caffè\" is a three-part stove-top unit that is placed on the stovetop with loosely packed grounds in a strainer; the water rises from steam pressure and is forced through the grounds into the top portion. In both cases, the water passes through the grounds just once.\n\nEspresso is usually served in a demitasse cup. Caffè macchiato is topped with a bit of steamed milk or foam; ristretto is made with less water, and is stronger; cappuccino is mixed or topped with steamed, mostly frothy, milk. It is generally considered a morning beverage, and usually is not taken after a meal; caffelatte is equal parts espresso and steamed milk, similar to café au lait, and is typically served in a large cup. Latte macchiato (spotted milk) is a glass of warm milk with a bit of coffee and caffè corretto is \"corrected\" with a few drops of an alcoholic beverage such as grappa or brandy.\n\nThe bicerin is also an Italian coffee, from Turin. It is a mixture of cappuccino and traditional hot chocolate, as it consists of a mix of coffee and drinking chocolate, and with a small addition of milk. It is quite thick, and often whipped cream/foam with chocolate powder and sugar is added on top.\n\nItaly produces the largest amount of wine in the world and is both the largest exporter and consumer of wine. Only about a quarter of this wine is put into bottles for individual sale. Two-thirds is bulk wine used for blending in France and Germany. The wine distilled into spirits in Italy exceeds the production of wine in the entirety of the New World. There are twenty separate wine regions.\n\nThose vineyards producing great wines are trying to do away with the old image of jug wines so often associated with Italian wine. To promote this, the Italian government passed the \"Denominazione di origine controllata\" (DOC) law in 1963 to regulate place of origin, quality, production method and type of grape. The designation \"Indicazione Geografica Tipica\" (IGT) is a less restrictive designation to help a wine maker graduate to the DOC level. In 1980, the government created the \"Denominazione di origine controllata e garantita\" (DOCG), reserved for only the best wines.\n\nIn Italy wine is commonly consumed (alongside water) in meals, which are rarely served without it, though it's extremely uncommon for meals to be served with any other drink, alcoholic or otherwise.\n\nItaly hosts a wide variety of different beers, which are usually pale lager. Beer is not as popular and widespread as wine (even though this is changing, and beer is becoming more and more popular), and average beer consumption in Italy is less than in some other neighbouring European nations, such as the United Kingdom, Germany and Austria. Among many popular brands, the most notable Italian breweries are Peroni and Moretti. Beer in Italy is often drunk in pizzerias, and South Tyrol (German-speaking region) is the area where beer is made and consumed the most.\n\nThere are also several other popular alcoholic drinks in Italy. Limoncello, a traditional lemon liqueur from Sicily and Southern Italy (Sorrento, Amalfi and the Gulf of Naples) in general, is one of the most common. Made from lemon, it is an extremely strong drink which is usually consumed in very small proportions, in small glasses or cups.\n\nAmaro Sicilianos are common Sicilian digestifs, made with herbs, which are usually drunk after heavy meals. Mirto, an herbal distillate made from the berries (red mirto) and leaves (white mirto) of the myrtle bush, is popular in Sardinia and other regions. Another well-known digestif is Amaro Lucano from Basilicata.\n\nGrappa is the typical alcoholic drink of northern Italy, generally associated with the culture of the Alps and of the Po Valley. The most famous grappas are distilled in Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Veneto, Piedmont and Trentino. The three most notable and recognizable Italian aperitifs are Martini, Vermouth and Campari. A sparkling drink which is becoming internationally popular as a less expensive substitute for French champagne is prosecco, from the Veneto region.\n\nFrom the Italian perspective, cookies and candy belong to the same category of sweets. Traditional candies include candied fruits, torrone, and nut brittles, all of which are still popular in the modern era. In medieval times, northern Italy became so famous for the quality of its stiff fruit pastes (similar to marmalade or conserves, except stiff enough to mold into shapes) that \"Paste of Genoa\" became a generic name for high-quality fruit conserves.\n\nSilver-coated almond dragées, which are called \"confetti\", are thrown at weddings. The idea of including a romantic note with candy may have begun with Italian dragées, no later than the early 19th century, and is carried on with the multilingual love notes included in boxes of Italy's most famous chocolate, Baci by Perugina in Milan. The most significant chocolate style is a combination of hazelnuts and milk chocolate, which is featured in gianduja pastes like Nutella, which is made by Ferrero SpA in Alba, Piedmont, as well as Perugnia's Baci and many other chocolate confections.\nEvery region has its own holiday recipes. During La Festa di San Giuseppe (St. Joseph's Day) on 19 March, Sicilians give thanks to St. Joseph for preventing a famine during the Middle Ages. The fava bean saved the population from starvation, and is a traditional part of St. Joseph's Day altars and traditions. Other customs celebrating this festival include wearing red clothing, eating Sicilian pastries known as zeppole and giving food to the poor.\n\nOn Easter Sunday, lamb is served throughout Italy. A typical Easter Sunday breakfast in Umbria and Tuscany includes salami, boiled eggs, wine, Easter Cakes and pizza. The common cake for Easter Day is the Colomba Pasquale (literally, Easter dove), which is often simply known as \"Italian Easter cake\" abroad. It is supposed to represent the dove, and is topped with almonds and pearl sugar.\n\nOn Christmas Eve a symbolic fast is observed with the \"cena di magro\" (\"light dinner\"), a meatless meal. Typical cakes of the Christmas season are panettone and pandoro.\n\nDue to several Italian colonies being set up in Africa, mainly in Ethiopia, Eritrea, Libya and Somalia (except the northern part, which was under British rule), there is a considerable amount of Italian influence on the cuisines of these nations.\n\nItaly's legacy from the days when Libya was invaded by Italy can be seen in the popularity of pasta on its menus, particularly Sharba, a highly spiced Libyan soup. Bazin, a local specialty, is a hard paste, made from barley, salt and water, and one of the most popular meals in the Libyan cuisine is Batata mubatana (filled potato). It consists of fried potato pieces filled with spiced minced meat and covered with egg and breadcrumbs.\n\nAll major cities and towns in South Africa have substantial populations of Italians. There are \"Italian Clubs\" in all main cities and they have had a significant influence on the cuisine of this country. Italian foods, like ham and cheeses, are imported and some also made locally, and every city has a popular Italian restaurant or two, as well as Pizzerias. Pastas are popular and is eaten more and more by South Africans. The production of good quality olive oil is on the rise in South Africa, especially in the drier south-western parts where there is a more Mediterranean-type of rainfall pattern. Some oils have even won top international awards.\n\nSpaghetti arrived during the time of the American occupation of the country in the early 1900s. It has since evolved into a distinctly Philippine version of the dish. Filipino spaghetti is characterized by a sauce based on banana ketchup and the presence of sliced hot dogs (sometimes substituted with sausage). Aside from the ketchup-based sauce, garlic, oregano, and bay leaf and some sugar are also used to flavour the sauce.\n\nGround beef or pork as well as ham may also be added. Baked macaroni (with a red sauce) is also present in the country's cuisine. Both can be found in authentic style or modified to suit the local palate and budget and can be found on restaurant menus as well as at Filipino parties and gatherings.\n\nLasagne is another Italian dish that made its way into Philippine cuisine. Unlike spaghetti, lasagne remains largely unchanged and Filipinos usually consume it with garlic bread.\n\nThe fast food chain Jollibee serves spaghetti with some meals, in contrast with other chains which serve rice or noodles.\n\nIn France, the cuisine of Corsica has much in common with the Italian cuisine, since the island was from the Early Middle Ages until 1768 first of a Pisan and then a Genoese possession. This is above all relevant by the first courses and by the \"charcuterie\".\n\nPizza and pasta dishes such as spaghetti bolognese and lasagne with bolognese \"ragù\" and Béchamel sauce are the most popular forms of Italian food in British, notably, English, cuisine.\n\nItalian cuisine has had a strong influence on Slovenian cuisine. For centuries, north-eastern Italy and western Slovenia have formed part of the same cultural-historical and geographical space. Between 1918 and 1945, western Slovenia (the Slovenian Littoral and part of Inner Carniola) were part of Italy. In addition, an autochthonous Italian minority live in Slovenian Istria.\n\nFor these reasons Italian dishes have penetrated the local Slovenian cuisine. Furthermore, there are numerous typical dishes that are shared between the Slovenian cuisines and the cuisine of the neighboring Italian region of Friuli Venezia Giulia: these include the \"gubana\" nut roll of Friuli (known as \"guban'ca\" or \"potica\" in Slovenia) and the \"jota\" stew.\n\nAmong the Slovenian dishes that come directly from Italian cuisine, the gnocchi and some types of pasta are especially popular, as well as dishes like the minestrone (known as mineštra in Slovene) or the frittata (known as frtalja in Slovene).\n\nProsciutto (pršut in Slovenian) and polenta are also popular.\n\nMuch of Italian-American cuisine is based on that found in Campania and Sicily, heavily Americanized to reflect ingredients and conditions found in the United States. Most pizza eaten around the world derives ultimately from the Neapolitan style, if somewhat thicker and usually with more toppings in terms of quantity.\n\nThroughout the country the \"torta de milanesa\" is a common item offered at food carts and stalls. It is a sandwich made from locally baked bread and contains a breaded, pan-fried cutlet of pork or beef. \"Pescado Veracruzano\" is a dish that originates from the port city of Veracruz and features a fillet of fresh fish (usually Gulf Red Snapper) covered in a distinctly Mediterranean influenced sauce containing stewed tomatoes, garlic, green olives, and capers. Also, \"espagueti\" (spaghetti) and other pastas are popular in a variety of soups.\n\nDue to large Italian immigration to Argentina, Italian food and drink is heavily featured in Argentine cuisine. An example could be \"milanesas\" (The name comes from the original cotoletta alla milanese from Milan, Italy) or breaded cutlets. Pizza (locally pronounced \"pisa or pitsa\"), for example, has been wholly subsumed and in its Argentine form more closely resembles Italian calzones than it does its Italian ancestor. There are several other Italian-Argentine dishes, such as \"Sorrentinos\" and Argentine gnocchi.\n\nItalian cuisine is popular in Brazil, due to great immigration there in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Due to the huge Italian community, São Paulo is the place where this cuisine is most appreciated. Several types of pasta and meat, including milanesa steaks, have made their way into both daily home and street kitchens and fancy restaurants. The city has also developed its particular variety of pizza, different from both Neapolitan and American varieties, and it is largely popular on weekend dinners. In Rio de Janeiro Italian cuisine is also popular, and pizza has developed as a typical botequim counter snack.\n\nThere is considerable Italian influence in Venezuelan cuisine. \"Pan chabata\", or Venezuelan ciabatta, \"Pan Siciliano\", Sicilian bread, \"Cannoli siciliano\", Sicilian cannoli, and the drink chinotto are examples of the Italian influence in Venezuelan food and beverages.\n\n\n",
                "Pizza\n\nPizza is a traditional Italian dish consisting of a yeasted flatbread typically topped with tomato sauce and cheese and baked in an oven. It can also be topped with additional vegetables, meats, and condiments, and can be made without cheese. \n\nThe term \"pizza\" was first recorded in the 10th century, in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italy town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular and common in many areas of the world. In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish. \n\"Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana\" (True Neapolitan Pizza Association), a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples, aims to \"promote and protect... the true Neapolitan pizza\".\n\nPizza is one of the most popular foods in the world and common fast food item in Europe and North America. Many independent or chain restaurants, cafes, and fast food outlets offer pizza. Restaurants or chains specializing in pizza are pizzerias. Pizza delivery is common in some parts of the world.\n\nPizza is sold fresh or frozen, either whole or in portions. Various types of ovens are used to cook them and many varieties exist. Several similar dishes are prepared from ingredients commonly used in pizza preparation, such as calzone and stromboli. In the United States, pizza is usually eaten out of hand after dividing into slices from a large pizza or small pizzetta as a whole. In Italy, pizza is eaten with a fork and knife in restaurants, but is also sold to take away and eaten out of hand. Frozen pizza became popular in the late 20th century.\n\nThe word \"pizza\" () first appeared in a Latin text from the southern Italy town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta \"duodecim pizze\" (\"twelve pizzas\") every Christmas Day, and another twelve every Easter Sunday\".\n\nSuggested etymologies include:\n\nFoods similar to pizza have been made since the neolithic age. Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. The ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese, and in the 6th century BC, the soldiers in Persian King Darius I's armies baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields. An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the \"tables\" prophesied by Celaeno.\n\nModern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples in the 18th or early 19th century. Prior to that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, cheese, and basil. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims. Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries, and pizzerias keep this old tradition alive today. \n\nA popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, \"pizza Margherita\", was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag: red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen, although recent research casts doubt on this legend.\n\nPizza was brought to the United States with Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century, and first appeared in areas where Italian immigrants concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in 1905. Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign after being introduced to Italy's native cuisine proved a ready market for pizza in particular. Since then pizza consumption has exploded in the U.S. Pizza chains such as Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's, pizzas from take and bake pizzerias, and chilled or frozen pizzas from supermarkets make pizza readily available nationwide. It is so ubiquitous, thirteen percent of the U.S. population consumes pizza on any given day.\n\nPizza is prepared fresh, frozen, and as portion-size slices or pieces. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.\n\nAnother form of uncooked pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to complete at home before baking in an oven.\n\nIn restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven or, in the case of more expensive restaurants, a wood- or coal-fired brick oven. On deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum). Prior to use, a peel may be sprinkled with cornmeal to allow pizza to easily slide onto and off of it. When made at home, it can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce the effect of a brick oven. Another option is grilled pizza, in which the crust is baked directly on a barbecue grill. Greek pizza, like Chicago-style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.\n\nWhen it comes to preparation, the dough and ingredients can be combined on any kind of table. With mass production of pizzas the process can be completely automated. Most restaurants still use standard and purpose built pizza preparation tables. Pizzerias nowadays can even opt for hi tech pizza preparation tables that combine mass production elements with traditional techniques.\n\nThe bottom of the pizza, called the \"crust\", may vary widely according to style—thin as in a typical hand-tossed Neapolitan pizza, or thick as in a deep-dish Chicago-style. It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the \"cornicione\". Often pizza dough contains sugar, both to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.\nDipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by American pizza chain Papa John's Pizza in 1984, and has since become popular when eating pizza, especially the crust.\n\nMozzarella is commonly used on pizza, with the highest quality buffalo mozzarella produced in the surroundings of Naples. Today, other cheeses have been used as pizza ingredients (particularly Italian cheeses), including provolone, pecorino romano, ricotta, and scamorza. Less expensive processed cheeses or cheese analogues have been developed for mass-market pizzas to produce desirable qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and stable shelf life. This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins and other changes in manufacture. In 1997 it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was in the U.S. and in Europe.\n\nAuthentic Neapolitan pizza (\"pizza napoletana\") is typically made with San Marzano tomatoes, grown on the volcanic plains south of Mount Vesuvius, and mozzarella di bufala Campana, made with milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio. This mozzarella is protected with its own European protected designation of origin. Other traditional pizzas include \"pizza alla marinara\", which is topped with marinara sauce and is allegedly the most ancient tomato-topped pizza,\npizza capricciosa, which is prepared with mozzarella cheese, baked ham, mushroom, artichoke and tomato, and pizza pugliese, prepared with tomato, mozzarella and onions.\n\nA popular variant of pizza in Italy is Sicilian pizza (locally called \"sfincione\" or \"sfinciuni\"), a thick-crust or deep-dish pizza originating during the 17th century in Sicily: it is essentially a focaccia that is typically topped with tomato sauce and other ingredients. Until the 1860s, \"sfincione\" was the type of pizza usually consumed in Sicily, especially in the Western portion of the island. Other variations of pizzas are also found in other regions of Italy, for example \"pizza al padellino\" or \"pizza al tegamino\", a small-sized, thick-crust and deep-dish pizza typically served in Turin, Piedmont.\n\nCommon toppings for pizza in the United States include ground beef, mushrooms, onions, pepperoni, pineapple, garlic, olives, peppers, carrots, tomatoes, spinach, anchovies, chicken, bacon, ham and sausage. Distinct regional types developed in the twentieth century, including California, Chicago, Greek, New Haven, Detroit, St. Louis, and New York styles. The first pizzeria in the U.S. was opened in New York's Little Italy in 1905 and since then regions throughout the U.S. offer variations, including deep-dish, stuffed, pockets, turnovers, rolled and pizza-on-a-stick, each with seemingly limitless combinations of sauce and toppings.\n\nAnother variation is grilled pizza, created by taking a fairly thin, round (more typically, irregularly shaped) sheet of yeasted pizza dough, placing it directly over the fire of a grill and then turning it over once the bottom has baked and placing a thin layer of toppings on the baked side. Toppings may be sliced thin to ensure that they heat through, and chunkier toppings such as sausage or peppers may be precooked before being placed on the pizza. Garlic, herbs, or other ingredients are sometimes added to the pizza or the crust to maximize the flavor of the dish.\n\nGrilled pizza was offered in the United States at the Al Forno restaurant in Providence, Rhode Island by owners Johanne Killeen and George Germon in 1980. Although it was inspired by a misunderstanding that confused a wood-fired brick oven with a grill, grilled pizza did exist prior to 1980, both in Italy, and in Argentina where it is known as \"pizza a la parrilla\". It has become a popular cookout dish, and there are even some pizza restaurants that specialize in the style. The traditional style of grilled pizza employed at Al Forno restaurant uses a dough coated with olive oil, strained tomato sauce, thin slices of fresh mozzarella, and a garnish made from shaved scallions, and is served uncut. The final product can be likened to flatbread with pizza toppings. Another Providence establishment, Bob & Timmy's Grilled Pizza, was featured in a Providence-themed episode of the Travel Channel's \"Man v. Food Nation\" in 2011.\n\nThe world's largest pizza was prepared in Rome in December 2012, and measured . The pizza was named \"Ottavia\" in homage to the first Roman emperor Octavian Augustus, and was made with a gluten-free base. The world's longest pizza was made in Naples in 2016. It was baked using a series of wheeled ovens which moved along its length, and measured .\n\nThe world's most expensive pizza listed by \"Guinness World Records\" is a commercially available thin-crust pizza at Maze restaurant in London, United Kingdom, which costs . The pizza is wood fire-baked, and is topped with onion puree, white truffle paste, fontina cheese, baby mozzarella, pancetta, cep mushrooms, freshly picked wild mizuna lettuce, and fresh shavings of a rare Italian white truffle.\n\nThere are several instances of more expensive pizzas, such as the \"Pizza Royale 007\" at Haggis restaurant in Glasgow, Scotland, which has caviar, lobster and is topped with 24-carat gold dust, and the caviar pizza made by Nino's Bellissima pizzeria in New York City, New York. However, these are not officially recognized by \"Guinness World Records\". Additionally, a pizza was made by the restaurateur Domenico Crolla that included toppings such as sunblush-tomato sauce, Scottish smoked salmon, medallions of venison, edible gold, lobster marinated in cognac, and champagne-soaked caviar. The pizza was auctioned for charity in 2007, raising .\n\nIn 2017, the world pizza market was $128 billion and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias. Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over, consumed pizza on any given day.\n\nSome mass-produced pizzas by fast food chains have been criticized as having an unhealthy balance of ingredients. Pizza can be high in salt, fat and calories (food energy). The USDA reports an average sodium content of 5,101 mg per pizza in fast food chains. There are concerns about negative health effects. Food chains have come under criticism at various times for the high salt content of some of their meals.\n\nFrequent pizza eaters in Italy have been found to have a relatively low incidence of cardiovascular disease and digestive tract cancers relative to infrequent pizza eaters, although the nature of the correlation between pizza and such perceived benefits is unclear. Pizza consumption in Italy might only indicate adherence to traditional Mediterranean dietary patterns, which have been shown to have various health benefits.\n\nSome attribute the apparent health benefits of pizza to the lycopene content in pizza sauce, which research indicates likely plays a role in protecting against cardiovascular disease and various cancers.\n\nNational Pizza Month is an annual observance that occurs for the month of October in the United States and some areas of Canada. This observance began in October 1984, and was created by Gerry Durnell, the publisher of \"Pizza Today\" magazine. During this time, some people observe National Pizza Month by consuming various types of pizzas or pizza slices, or going to various pizzerias.\n\n\n"
