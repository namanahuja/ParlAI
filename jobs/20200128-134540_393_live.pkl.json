                "Sushi\n\nSushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients, and many others are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish is popular as a garnish.\n\nSushi is often confused with sashimi, a related Japanese dish consisting of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.\n\nSushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known today as \"narezushi\" ( – \"salted fish\"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling; the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish. This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term \"sushi\" comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means \"sour-tasting\"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as \"funa-zushi\" from Shiga Prefecture.\n\nVinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the rice's sourness, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be furthered developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became \"oshi-zushi\"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.\n\nIt was not until the Edo period (1603-1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice. The particular style of today's \"nigirizushi\" became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of \"nigirizushi\"'s origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799-1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku. The dish was originally termed \"Edomae zushi\" as it used freshly caught fish from the \"Edo-mae\" (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term \"Edomae nigirizushi\" is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" mistakenly notes the earliest written mention of sushi in English in an 1893 book, \"A Japanese Interior\", where it mentions sushi as \"a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring\". However, there is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese-English dictionary from 1873, and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal \"Notes and Queries\".\n\nThe common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared \"sushi rice\". Fillings, toppings, condiments, and preparation vary widely.\n\nNote that due to rendaku consonant mutation, sushi is spelled with a \"z\" instead of an \"s\" whenever a prefix is attached, such as in nigirizushi for instance.\n\n\"Chirashizushi\" (, \"scattered sushi\", also referred to as \"barazushi\") serves the rice in a bowl and tops it with a variety of raw fish and vegetable garnishes. It is commonly eaten because it is filling, fast and easy to make. It is eaten annually on Hinamatsuri in March.\n\nInarizushi () is a pouch of fried tofu typically filled with sushi rice alone.\n\nTales tell that inarizushi is named after the Shinto god \"Inari\". Foxes, messengers of Inari are believed to have a fondness for fried tofu, and an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears.\n\nRegional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette (, \"fukusa-zushi\", or , \"chakin-zushi\") instead of tofu. It should not be confused with \"inari maki\", which is a roll filled with flavored fried tofu.\n\nCone sushi is a variant of \"inarizushi\" originating in Hawaii that may include green beans, carrots, or gobo along with rice, wrapped in a triangular aburage piece. It is often sold in \"okazu-ya\" (Japanese delis) and as a component of bento boxes.\nMakizushi (, \"rolled sushi\"), norimaki (, \"Nori roll\") or makimono (, \"variety of rolls\") is a cylindrical piece, formed with the help of a bamboo mat known as a \"makisu\" (). \"Makizushi\" is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed), but is occasionally wrapped in a thin omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or shiso (perilla) leaves. \"Makizushi\" is usually cut into six or eight pieces, which constitutes a single roll order. Below are some common types of \"makizushi\", but many other kinds exist.\nFutomaki (, \"thick, large or fat rolls\") is a large cylindrical piece, usually with \"nori\" on the outside. A typical \"futomaki\" is five to six centimeters (2–2.5 in) in diameter. They are often made with two, three, or more fillings that are chosen for their complementary tastes and colors. During the evening of the Setsubun festival, it is traditional in the Kansai region to eat uncut futomaki in its cylindrical form, where it is called \"ehō-maki\" (, lit. happy direction rolls). By 2000 the custom had spread to all of Japan. Futomaki are often vegetarian, and may utilize strips of cucumber, \"kampyō\" gourd, \"takenoko\" bamboo shoots, or lotus root. Strips of \"tamagoyaki\" omelette, tiny fish roe, chopped tuna, and \"oboro\" whitefish flakes are typical non-vegetarian fillings. Traditionally, the rice is lightly seasoned with salt and sesame oil/perilla oil. Popular protein ingredients are fish cakes, imitation crab meat, eggs, or seasoned beef rib-eye. Vegetables usually include cucumbers, spinach, carrot and (pickled radish). After the makizushi has been rolled and sliced, it is typically served with takuan.\n\nShort grain white rice is usually used, although short-grain brown rice, like olive oil on nori, is now becoming more widespread among the health-conscious. Rarely, sweet rice is mixed in makizushi rice.\nNowadays, the rice in makizushi can be many kinds of black rice, boiled rice and cereals etc.Besides the common ingredients listed above, some varieties may include cheese, spicy cooked squid, yakiniku, kamaboko, lunch meat, sausage, bacon or spicy tuna. The nori may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds. In a variation, sliced pieces of makizushi may be lightly fried with egg coating.\n\nHosomaki (, \"thin rolls\") is a small cylindrical piece, with \"nori\" on the outside. A typical \"hosomaki\" has a diameter of about two and a half centimeters (1 in). They generally contain only one filling, often tuna, cucumber, \"kanpyō\", thinly sliced carrots, or, more recently, avocado. \"Kappamaki\", () a kind of \"Hosomaki\" filled with cucumber, is named after the Japanese legendary water imp fond of cucumbers called the kappa. Traditionally, \"kappamaki\" is consumed to clear the palate between eating raw fish and other kinds of food, so that the flavors of the fish are distinct from the tastes of other foods. \"Tekkamaki\" () is a kind of \"hosomaki\" filled with raw tuna. Although it is believed that the word \"tekka\", meaning \"red hot iron\", alludes to the color of the tuna flesh or salmon flesh, it actually originated as a quick snack to eat in gambling dens called \"tekkaba\" (), much like the sandwich. \"Negitoromaki\" () is a kind of \"hosomaki\" filled with scallion (\"negi\") and chopped tuna (\"toro\"). Fatty tuna is often used in this style. \"Tsunamayomaki\" () is a kind of \"hosomaki\" filled with canned tuna tossed with mayonnaise.\n\nTemaki (, \"hand roll\") is a large cone-shaped piece of \"nori\" on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end. A typical \"temaki\" is about ten centimeters (4 in) long, and is eaten with fingers because it is too awkward to pick it up with chopsticks. For optimal taste and texture, \"temaki\" must be eaten quickly after being made because the \"nori\" cone soon absorbs moisture from the filling and loses its crispness, making it somewhat difficult to bite through. For this reason, the \"nori\" in pre-made or take-out temaki is sealed in plastic film which is removed immediately before eating.\n\n\"Narezushi\" (, \"matured sushi\") is a traditional form of fermented sushi. Skinned and gutted fish are stuffed with salt, placed in a wooden barrel, doused with salt again, then weighed down with a heavy tsukemonoishi (pickling stone). As days pass, water seeps out and is removed. After six months, this \"sushi\" can be eaten, remaining edible for another six months or more. The most famous variety of \"narezushi\" still being produced is \"funa-zushi\" (made from fish of the crucian carp genus, authentically from \"C. auratus grandoculis\" () endemic to Lake Biwa), a typical dish of Shiga Prefecture.\n\n\"Nigirizushi\" (, \"hand-pressed sushi\") consists of an oblong mound of \"sushi rice\" that the chef presses between the palms of the hands to form an oval-shaped ball, and a topping (the \"neta\") draped over the ball. It is usually served with a bit of \"wasabi\"; \"neta\" are typically fish such as salmon, tuna or other seafood. Certain toppings are typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of \"nori\", most commonly octopus (\"tako\"), freshwater eel (\"unagi\"), sea eel (\"anago\"), squid (\"ika\"), and sweet egg (\"tamago\"). One order of a given type of fish typically results in two pieces, while a sushi set (sampler dish) may contain only one piece of each topping.\n\n\"Gunkanmaki\" (, \"warship roll\") is a special type of \"nigirizushi\": an oval, hand-formed clump of sushi rice that has a strip of \"nori\" wrapped around its perimeter to form a vessel that is filled with some soft, loose or fine-chopped ingredient that requires the confinement of \"nori\" such as roe, \"nattō\", oysters, \"uni\" (sea urchin roe), corn with mayonnaise, scallops, and quail eggs. \"Gunkan-maki\" was invented at the \"Ginza Kyubey\" restaurant in 1941; its invention significantly expanded the repertoire of soft toppings used in sushi.\n\n\"Temarizushi\" (, \"ball sushi\") is a sushi made by pressing rice and fish into a ball-shaped form by hand using a plastic wrap.\n\n, also known as , \"hako-zushi\", \"box sushi\"), is a pressed sushi from the Kansai region, a favorite and specialty of Osaka. A block-shaped piece is formed using a wooden mold, called an \"oshibako\". The chef lines the bottom of the \"oshibako\" with the toppings, covers them with sushi rice, and then presses the lid of the mold down to create a compact, rectilinear block. The block is removed from the mold and then cut into bite-sized pieces. Particularly famous is (\"battera\", pressed mackerel sushi) or (\"saba zushi\"). In \"oshizushi\", all the ingredients are either cooked or cured and raw fish is never used.\nThe increasing popularity of \"sushi\" around the world has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world, but rarely in Japan (a notable exception to this is the use of salmon, which was introduced by Bjorn Eirik Olsen, a Norwegian businessman tasked with helping the Norwegian salmon industry sell more fish in the early 1980s). Such creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll (a \"norimaki\" with crab (later, imitation crab), cucumber, and avocado). A wide variety of popular rolls (\"norimaki\" and \"uramaki\") has evolved since. Norway roll is another variant of \"uramakizushi\" filled with \"tamago\" (omelette), imitation crab and cucumber, rolled with \"shiso\" leaf and \"nori\", topped with slices of Norwegian salmon, garnished with lemon and mayonnaise.\n\nUramaki (, \"inside-out roll\") is a medium-sized cylindrical piece with two or more fillings, and was developed as a result of the creation of the California roll, as a method originally meant to hide the nori. \"Uramaki\" differs from other \"makimono\" because the rice is on the outside and the \"nori\" inside. The filling is in the center surrounded by \"nori\", then a layer of rice, and optionally an outer coating of some other ingredients such as roe or toasted sesame seeds. It can be made with different fillings, such as tuna, crab meat, avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber or carrots.\n\nExamples of variations include the rainbow roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced \"maguro, hamachi, ebi, sake\" and avocado) and the caterpillar roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced avocado). Also commonly found is the \"rock and roll\" (an inside-out roll with barbecued freshwater eel and avocado with toasted sesame seeds on the outside).\n\nIn Japan, \"uramaki\" is an uncommon type of \"makimono\"; because sushi is traditionally eaten by hand in Japan, the outer layer of rice can be quite difficult to handle with fingers.\n\n\"Futomaki\" is a more popular variation of sushi within the United States, and comes in variations that take their names from their place of origin. Other rolls may include a variety of ingredients, including chopped scallops, spicy tuna, beef or chicken teriyaki roll, okra, and assorted vegetables such as cucumber and avocado, and the \"tempura roll\", where shrimp tempura is inside the roll or the entire roll is battered and fried tempura-style. In the Southern United States, many sushi restaurants prepare rolls using crawfish. Sometimes, rolls are made with brown rice or black rice, which appear in Japanese cuisine as well.\n\nPer Food and Drug Administration regulations, raw fish served in the United States must be frozen prior to serving in order to kill parasites. Because of this and the relative difficulty of acquiring fresh seafood compared to Japan, raw seafood (e.g., sashimi) is not as prevalent of a component in American-style sushi.\n\nSince rolls are usually made to-order it is not unusual for the customer to specify the exact ingredients desired (e.g. salmon roll, cucumber roll, avocado roll, Shrimp/tuna tempura roll, tuna roll, etc.). Though the menu names of dishes often vary by restaurant, some examples include:\n\nAll sushi has a base of specially prepared rice, complemented with other ingredients.\n\n\"Sushi-meshi\" (also known as \"Su-meshi\" , \"shari\" , or \"gohan\" ) is a preparation of white, short-grained, Japanese rice mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally kombu and \"sake\". It has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a \"sushi\" or else it will get too sticky while being seasoned. Traditionally, the mixing is done with a hangiri, which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a wooden paddle (shamoji).\n\nSushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi is different from glutinous rice. Freshly harvested rice (\"shinmai\") typically contains too much water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some fusion cuisine restaurants, short-grain brown rice and wild rice are also used.\n\nThere are regional variations in sushi rice and individual chefs have their individual methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the Kantō region (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; in Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.\n\nThe black seaweed wrappers used in \"makimono\" are called \"nori\" (海苔). \"Nori\" is a type of algae, traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in a process similar to making rice paper. Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets.\n\nThe size of a \"nori\" sheet influences the size of \"makimono\". A full-size sheet produces \"futomaki\", and a half produces \"hosomaki\" and \"temaki\". To produce \"gunkan\" and some other \"makimono\", an appropriately-sized piece of \"nori\" is cut from a whole sheet.\n\n\"Nori\" by itself is an edible snack and is available with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi.\n\nWhen making \"fukusazushi\", a paper-thin omelette may replace a sheet of \"nori\" as the wrapping. The omelette is traditionally made on a rectangular omelette pan (makiyakinabe), and used to form the pouch for the rice and fillings.\n\nFor culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to that of fish which is to be cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection. Commonly used fish are tuna (\"maguro, shiro-maguro\"), Japanese amberjack, yellowtail (\"hamachi\"), snapper (\"kurodai\"), mackerel (\"saba\"), and salmon (\"sake\"). The most valued sushi ingredient is \"toro,\" the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a variety of \"ōtoro\" (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and \"chūtoro\", meaning \"middle toro\", implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between \"toro\" and the regular cut. \"Aburi\" style refers to \"nigiri\" sushi where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw \"neta\".\n\nOther seafoods such as squid (\"ika\"), eel (\"anago\" and \"unagi\"), pike conger (\"hamo\"), octopus (\"tako\"), shrimp (\"ebi\" and \"amaebi\"), clam (\"mirugai\", \"aoyagi\" and \"akagai\"), fish roe (\"ikura\", \"masago\", \"kazunoko\" and \"tobiko\"), sea urchin (\"uni\"), crab (\"kani\"), and various kinds of shellfish (abalone, prawn, scallop) are the most popular seafoods in sushi. Oysters, however, are less common, as the taste is not thought to go well with the rice. \"Kani kama\", or imitation crab stick, is commonly substituted for real crab, most notably in California rolls.\n\nPickled daikon radish (\"takuan\") in \"shinko maki\", pickled vegetables (\"tsukemono\"), fermented soybeans (\"nattō\") in \"nattō maki\", avocado, cucumber in \"kappa maki\", asparagus, yam, pickled ume (\"umeboshi\"), gourd (\"kanpyō\"), burdock (\"gobo\"), and sweet corn (possibly mixed with mayonnaise) are also used in sushi.\n\nTofu and eggs (in the form of slightly sweet, layered omelette called \"tamagoyaki\" and raw quail eggs ride as a \"gunkan-maki\" topping) are common.\n\nSushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in shōyu, soy sauce, and is usually flavored with wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated stem of the \"Wasabia japonica\" plant. Japanese-style mayonnaise is a common condiment in Japan on salmon, pork and other sushi cuts.\n\nTrue wasabi has anti-microbial properties and may reduce the risk of food poisoning. The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or \"samegawa oroshi\". An imitation wasabi (\"seiyo-wasabi\"), made from horseradish, mustard powder and green dye is common. It is found at lower-end \"kaiten-zushi\" restaurants, in bento box sushi and at most restaurants outside Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled \"Japanese Horseradish\".\n\nGari (sweet, pickled ginger) is eaten in between sushi courses to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion. In Japan, green tea (\"ocha\") is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as \"mecha\". In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as \"agari\".\n\nSushi may be garnished with gobo, grated daikon, thinly sliced vegetables, carrots/radishes/cucumbers that have been shaped to look like flowers, real flowers, or seaweed salad.\n\nWhen closely arranged on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called \"baran\" or \"kiri-zasa\" (切り笹). These dividers prevent the flavors of neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the \"Aspidistra elatior\" (葉蘭 \"haran\") and \"Sasa veitchii\" (熊笹 \"kuma-zasa\") plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had the added benefit of releasing antimicrobial phytoncides when cut thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi. Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic in order to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration which acted to extend the shelf life of sushi without the need for the cut leaves. Today the plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and to a lesser degree in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish.\n\nThe main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in protein, carbohydrates (the rice only), vitamins, and minerals, as are \"gari\" and \"nori\". Other vegetables wrapped within the sushi also offer various vitamins and minerals. Many of the seafood ingredients also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have a variety of health benefits. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish has certain beneficial property, especially on cardiovascular health, natural anti-inflammatory compounds, and play a role in brain function. \n\nGenerally sushi is not a particularly fattening food. However, rice in sushi contains a fair amount of carbohydrates, plus the addition of other ingredients such as mayonnaise added into sushi rolls might increase the caloric content. Sushi also has a relatively high sodium content, especially contributed from \"shoyu\" soy sauce seasoning.\n\nSome of the ingredients in sushi can present health risks. Large marine apex predators such as tuna (especially bluefin) can harbor high levels of methylmercury, which can lead to mercury poisoning when consumed in large quantity or when consumed by certain higher-risk groups, including women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers and young children.\n\nAccording to recent studies, there have been about 18 million infections worldwide from eating raw fish. This serves as a great risk to expecting mothers due to the health risks that medical interventions or treatment measures may pose on the developing fetus. Parasitic infections can have a wide range of health impacts, including bowel obstruction, anemia, liver disease, and more. The impact of these illnesses alone can pose some health concerns on the expecting mother and baby, but the curative measures that may need to take place to recover are also of concern as well.\n\nSashimi or other types of sushi containing raw fish present a risk of infection by three main types of parasites:\n\nFor the above reasons, EU regulations forbid the use of fresh raw fish. It must be frozen at temperatures below in all parts of the product for no less than 24 hours. As such, a number of fishing boats, suppliers and end users \"super-freeze\" fish for sushi to temperatures as low as −60 °C. As well as parasite destruction, super-freezing also prevents oxidation of the blood in tuna flesh, thus preventing the discoloration that happens at temperatures above −20 °C.\n\nSome forms of sushi, notably those containing pufferfish fugu and some kinds of shellfish, can cause severe poisoning if not prepared properly. Particularly, fugu consumption can be fatal. Fugu fish has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and, by law in many countries, must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the prefectural examination in Japan. The licensing examination process consists of a written test, a fish-identification test, and a practical test that involves preparing the fugu and separating out the poisonous organs. Only about 35 percent of the applicants pass.\n\nSustainable sushi is sushi made from fished or farmed sources that can be maintained or whose future production does not significantly jeopardize the ecosystems from which it is acquired. Concerns over the sustainability of sushi ingredients arise from greater concerns over environmental, economic and social stability and human health.\n\nTraditionally, sushi is served on minimalist Japanese-style, geometric, mono- or duo-tone wood or lacquer plates, in keeping with the aesthetic qualities of this cuisine.\n\nMany sushi restaurants offer fixed-price sets, selected by the chef from the catch of the day. These are often graded as \"shō-chiku-bai\" (), \"shō/matsu\" (, pine), \"chiku/take\" (, bamboo) and (\"bai/ume\"), with \"matsu\" the most expensive and \" ume\" the cheapest. Sushi restaurants will often have private booth dining, where guests are asked to remove their shoes, leaving them outside the room; However, most sushi bars offer diners a casual experience with an open dining room concept.\n\nSushi may be served \"kaiten zushi\" (sushi train) style. Color-coded plates of sushi are placed on a conveyor belt; as the belt passes, customers choose as they please. After finishing, the bill is tallied by counting how many plates of each color have been taken. Newer \"kaiten zushi\" restaurants use barcodes or RFID tags embedded in the dishes to manage elapsed time after the item was prepared.\n\nSome specialized or slang terms are used in the sushi culture. Most of these terms are used only in sushi bars.\n\n\nUnlike sashimi, which is almost always eaten with chopsticks, \"nigirizushi\" is traditionally eaten with the fingers, even in formal settings. Although it is commonly served on a small platter with a side dish for dipping, sushi can also be served in a \"bento\", a box with small compartments that hold the various dishes of the meal.\n\nSoy sauce is the usual condiment, and sushi is normally served with a small sauce dish, or a compartment in the bento. Traditional etiquette suggests that the sushi is turned over so that only the topping is dipped; this is because the soy sauce is for flavoring the topping, not the rice, and because the rice would absorb too much soy sauce and would fall apart. If it is difficult to turn the sushi upside-down, one can baste the sushi in soy sauce using \"gari\" (sliced ginger) as a brush. Toppings that have their own sauce (such as eel) should not be eaten with soy sauce.\n\nTraditionally, the sushi chef will add an appropriate amount of wasabi to the sushi while preparing it, and etiquette suggests eating the sushi as is, since the chef is supposed to know the proper amount of wasabi to use. However, today wasabi is more a matter of personal taste, and even restaurants in Japan may serve wasabi on the side for customers to use at their discretion, even when there is wasabi already in the dish.\n\n\n",
                "Ceviche\n\nCeviche () is a seafood dish popular in the coastal regions of Latin America and the Caribbean. Though the origin of ceviche is hotly debated, the dish is most closely associated with Peru. It is typically made from fresh raw fish cured in citrus juices, such as lemon or lime, and spiced with \"ají\" or chili peppers. Additional seasonings, such as chopped onions, salt, and cilantro, may also be added. Ceviche is usually accompanied by side dishes that complement its flavors, such as sweet potato, lettuce, corn, avocado or plantain. As the dish is not cooked with heat, it must be prepared and consumed fresh to minimize the risk of food poisoning.\n\nThough archeological records suggest that something resembling ceviche may have been consumed in Peru nearly two thousand years ago, some historians believe the predecessor to the dish was brought to Peru by Moorish women from Granada, who accompanied the Spanish conquistadors and colonizers, and this dish eventually evolved into what now is considered ceviche. Peruvian chef Gastón Acurio further explains the dominant position that Lima held through four centuries as the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru allowed for popular dishes such as ceviche to be brought to other Spanish colonies in the region, and in time they became a part of local cuisine by incorporating regional flavors and styles.\n\nCeviche is now a popular international dish prepared in a variety of ways throughout the Americas, reaching the United States in the 1980s. The greatest variety of ceviches are found in Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Perú; but other distinctly unique styles can also be found in coastal Honduras, El Salvador, Belize, Guatemala, the United States, Mexico, Panama, and several other nations.\n\nThe origin of the name of the dish is also disputed. One hypothesis suggests the common Spanish word for the dish, \"cebiche\", has its origin in the Latin word \"cibus\", which translates to English as \"food\" Another hypothesis, supported by the Royal Spanish Academy, is the name might derive from the Spanish-Arabic word \"assukkabáǧ\", which itself derives from the Arabic word \"sakbāj\" (, meaning meat cooked in vinegar). It is ultimately from the unattested Middle Persian *\"sikbāg\", from \"sik\" (\"vinegar\") and *\"bāg\" (\"soup\"), which also yielded the Persian word \"sekbā\" (, a soup made with meat and vinegar). Further hypotheses base the origin of the term on \"escabeche\", Spanish for pickle, or it is simply a variation of the word \"siwichi\", the traditional Quechua name for the dish.\n\nThe name of the dish may be spelled variously as \"cebiche\", \"ceviche\", or \"seviche\", but the more common spelling in Peru is Ceviche with \"v\" based on location; all three spelling variations are accepted by the Royal Spanish Academy, the official institution responsible for regulating the Spanish language. Despite this, other local terms, such as \"cerbiche\" and \"serviche\", are still used as variations to name the dish.\n\nIn regard to its origin, various explanations are given. According to some historic sources from Peru, ceviche would have originated among the Moche, a coastal civilization that began to flourish in the area of current-day northern Peru nearly 2000 years ago. The Moche apparently used the fermented juice from the local banana passionfruit. Recent investigations further show, during the Inca Empire, fish were marinated with the use of \"chicha\", an Andean fermented beverage. Different chronicles also report, along the Peruvian coast prior to the arrival of Europeans, fish was consumed with salt and \"ají\". Furthermore, this theory proposes the natives simply switched to the citrus fruits brought by the Spanish colonists, but the main concepts of the plate remain essentially the same.\n\nThe invention of the dish is also attributed to places ranging from Central America to the Polynesian islands in the South Pacific. In Ecuador, it could have also had its origins with its coastal civilizations, as both Peru and Ecuador have shared cultural heritages (such as the Inca empire) and a large variety of fish and shellfish. Ceviche is not native to Mexico, despite the fact that the dish has been a part of traditional Mexican coastal cuisine for centuries. The Spanish, who brought from Europe citrus fruits such as lime, could have originated the dish in Spain with roots in Moorish cuisine.\n\nNevertheless, most historians agree ceviche originated during colonial times in the area of present-day Peru. They propose the predecessor to the dish was brought to Peru by Moorish women from Granada who accompanied the Spaniards, and this dish eventually evolved into what nowadays is considered ceviche. Peruvian chef Gastón Acurio further explains the dominant position that Lima held through four centuries as the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru allowed for popular dishes such as ceviche to be brought to other Spanish colonies in the region, and in time they became a part of local cuisine by incorporating regional flavors and styles. Other notable chefs who support the Peruvian origin of the plate include Chilean Christopher Carpentier and Spaniard Ferran Adrià, who in an interview stated, \"Cebiche was born in Peru, and so the authentic and genuine [cebiche] is Peruvian.\"\n\nCeviche is marinated in a citrus-based mixture, with lemons and limes being the most commonly used. In addition to adding flavor, the citric acid causes the proteins in the seafood to become denatured, appearing to be cooked. (However, acid marinades will not kill bacteria or parasitic worms, unlike the heat of cooking.) Traditional-style ceviche was marinated for about three hours. Modern-style ceviche, popularized in the 1970s , usually has a very short marinating period. With the appropriate fish, it can marinate in the time it takes to mix the ingredients, serve, and carry the ceviche to the table.\n\nMost Latin American countries have given ceviche its own touch of individuality by adding their own particular garnishes.\n\nIn Chile, ceviche is often made with fillets of halibut or Patagonian toothfish, and marinated in lime and grapefruit juices, as well as finely minced garlic and red chili peppers and often fresh mint and cilantro are added.\n\nIn Ecuador, the shrimp ceviche is sometimes made with tomato sauce for a tangy taste. The Manabí style, made with lime juice, salt and the juice provided by the cooked shrimp itself is very popular. Occasionally, ceviche is made with various types of local shellfish, such as black clam (cooked or raw), oysters (cooked or raw), spondylus (raw), barnacles (cooked percebes), among others mostly cooked. It is served in a bowl with toasted corn kernels as a side dish (fried green plantain chunks called \"patacones\", thinly sliced plantain chips called \"chifle\", and popcorn are also typical ceviche side dishes). In some regions, ceviche is served with rice on the side. Well cooked Sea bass (corvina), octopus, and crab ceviches are also common in Ecuador. In all ceviches, lime juice and salt are ubiquitous ingredients.\n\nIn Peru, ceviche has been declared to be part of Peru's \"national heritage\" and has even had a holiday declared in its honor. The classic Peruvian ceviche is composed of chunks of raw fish, marinated in freshly squeezed key lime or bitter orange (\"naranja agria\") juice, with sliced onions, chili peppers, salt and pepper. Corvina or cebo (sea bass) was the fish traditionally used. The mixture was traditionally marinated for several hours and served at room temperature, with chunks of corn-on-the-cob, and slices of cooked sweet potato. Regional or contemporary variations include garlic, fish bone broth, minced Peruvian \"ají limo\", or the Andean chili \"rocoto\", toasted corn or \"cancha\" and \"yuyo\" (seaweed). A specialty of Trujillo is ceviche prepared from shark (\"tollo\" or \"tojo\"). \"Lenguado\" (sole) is often used in Lima. The modern version of Peruvian ceviche, which is similar to the method used in making Japanese sashimi, consists of fish marinated for a few minutes and served promptly. It was developed in the 1970s by Peruvian-Japanese chefs including Dario Matsufuji and Humberto Sato. Many Peruvian \"cevicherías\" serve a small glass of the marinade (as an appetizer) along with the fish, which is called \"leche de tigre\" or \"leche de pantera.\"\n\nIn Mexico and some parts Central America, it is served either in cocktail cups with tostadas, salted crackers, or as a tostada topping and taco filling. In Mexico, when served in a cup with tomato sauce, it is called a ceviche cocktail. Although this cocktail is made from the \"dry\" ceviche recipe, this presentation is rather unusual outside of some specific areas, and in most areas of Mexico the ceviche cocktail is very popular. Shrimp, octopus, squid, tuna, and mackerel are also popular bases for Mexican ceviche, apart from fish. The marinade ingredients include salt, lime, onion, chili peppers, avocado, and coriander leaves (known as cilantro in the Americas). Cut olives and a bit of tomatoes are often added to the preparation (ketchup is not used because it adds sugar and is not fresh).\n\nIn El Salvador and Nicaragua one popular ceviche recipe is \"ceviche de concha negra\" (\"black conch ceviche\"), known in Mexico as \"pata de mula\" (\"mule's foot\"). It is dark, nearly black, with a distinct look and flavor. It is prepared with lime juice, onion, yerba buena, salt, pepper, tomato, Worcestershire sauce, and sometimes picante (any kind of hot sauce or any kind of hot pepper) as desired.\n\nIn Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the dish includes marinated fish, lime juice, salt, ground black pepper, finely minced onions, coriander (cilantro) and finely minced peppers. It is usually served in a cocktail glass with a lettuce leaf and soda crackers on the side, as in Mexico. Popular condiments are tomato ketchup, mayonnaise, and tabasco sauce. The fish is typically tilapia or corvina, although mahi-mahi, shark and marlin are also popular.\n\nIn Panama, ceviche is prepared with lemon juice, chopped onion, celery, cilantro, assorted peppers, and sea salt. Ceviche de corvina (white sea bass) is very popular and is served as an appetizer in most local restaurants. It is also commonly prepared with octopus, shrimp, and squid, or served with little pastry shells called \"canastitas.\"\n\nIn Cuba, ceviche is often made using mahi-mahi prepared with lime juice, salt, onion, green pepper, habanero, and a touch of allspice. Squid and tuna are also popular. In Puerto Rico and other places in the Caribbean, the dish is prepared with coconut milk. In The Bahamas and south Florida, a conch ceviche known as 'conch salad' is very popular. It is prepared by marinating diced fresh conch in lime with chopped onions, celery, and bell pepper. Diced pequin pepper and/or scotch bonnet pepper is often added for spice. In south Florida, it is common to encounter a variation to which tomato juice has been added.\n\nIn the Philippines, \"kinilaw\" (or \"kilawin\") which use raw fish are usually referred to in English as \"Filipino ceviche\". However, this is inaccurate as \"kinilaw\" technically refers to an indigenous cooking process and thus not restricted to fish. Unlike Latin American ceviches, which primarily use citrus juices, \"kilawin\" instead primarily uses vinegar (usually coconut vinegar) and other acidic fruit juices. It is native to the Philippines, with archeological evidence dating back to the 10th to 13th century AD. It was also described by Spanish colonists and explorers to the Philippines, with the earliest mention being in the \"Vocabulario de la Lengua Tagala\" (1613) as \"cqinicqilao\" and \"cquilao\".\n\nFish \"kinilaw\" typically use \"tanigue\" (Spanish mackerels), \"malasugi\" (marlins or swordfish), and anchovies. The raw fish are cubed and then marinated in vinegar, souring agents (usually calamansi, but can also be other sour fruits), and salt and spices like black pepper, ginger, onions, and chili peppers (commonly \"siling labuyo\" or bird's eye chili). Variants can also use other ingredients, like shrimp, squid, clams, oysters, crabs, sea urchin roe, seaweed, shipworms (\"tamilok\"), vegetables, and cooked meat (usually goat meat, pork, beef, or chicken).\n\nIn the Northern Mariana Islands, \"kelaguen\", is another ceviche-type dish among the Chamorro people. It is derived from and closely resembles the Filipino \"kilawin\". It is believed to have originated from Filipino settlers during the Manila galleon trade in the Spanish period. Like the Filipino \"kilawin\", the Chamorro dish is also not restricted to fish or seafood, and can use cooked meat (commonly chicken or beef), but it is influenced by the Latin American version in that they exclusively use citrus juices. It is usually served with \"titiya\" (Chamorro tortillas) during fiestas.\n\nCeviche is ideally very healthy. However, bad sanitary conditions during its preparation may lead to illness. Aside from contaminants, raw seafood can also be the vector for various pathogens, viral and bacterial, as well as larger parasitic creatures.\nAccording to the 2009 Food Code published by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and more recent studies, specific microbial hazards in ceviche include \"Anisakis simplex\", \"Diphyllobothrium\" spp., \"Pseudoterranova decipiens\" and \"Pseudoterranova cattani\", and \"Vibrio parahaemolyticus\". Anisakiasis is a zoonotic disease caused by the ingestion of larval nematodes in raw seafood dishes such as ceviche. The Latin American cholera outbreaks in the 1990s may have been attributed to the consumption of raw cholera-infested seafood that was eaten as ceviche.\n\nThe American Dietetic Association urges women to avoid ceviche during pregnancy.\n\n\n",
                "Raw bar\n\nA raw bar is a small restaurant or a bar within a restaurant where live raw shellfish are shucked and served. Raw bars typically offer a variety of raw and cooked seafood and shellfish that is served cold. Seafood-based dishes may also be proferred, and additional, non-seafood foods may also be part of the fare. Raw bars may offer alcoholic beverages such as oyster shooters, as well as wine and sake that is paired with various foods. Additional accompaniments may include condiments, sauces and foods such as lemon and lime. Several restaurants in the United States offer raw bars, some of which are seasonal.\n\nRaw bars may serve a selection of raw oysters, clams, quahogs (hard clams), scallops and mussels. Varieties of hard clam may include littlenecks, which are less than 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) in size, and cherrystones, which are up to 2 inches (5 cm). Various types of oysters may be served. Some raw bars may offer oyster shooters, a type of cocktail prepared with raw oyster. Some also offer ceviche, a dish prepared with raw seafood that is cured with citrus juices, particularly lime. Thinly sliced octopus (octopus carpaccio) is another raw bar item.\n\nRaw bars sometimes supplement the menu with cooked versions of the same and additional seafoods and shellfish that are typically served cold, such as clam chowder, oyster stew, poached shrimp, shrimp cocktail, cooked or seared scallops, mussels, crab legs, lobster, cured salmon, sea urchin and steamers (steamed clams).\n\nSometimes lightly cooked liver or foie gras is a raw bar item.\n\nThe plateau de fruits de mer is a seafood dish sometimes offered by raw bars that is prepared with raw and cooked shellfish and cold on a platter, usually on a bed of ice. Another raw bar dish is ceviche.\n\nRaw bars may offer wine or sake to accompany and be paired with the various foods. Condiments, such as cocktail sauce and lemon, may be available, which are typically served with raw oysters. These may also be used on other foods. Other food additions may include lime, tomato, chili peppers, mignonette sauce and caviar\n\nRaw bars exist in various cities in the United States, such as Jay's Restaurant in New York City, which has a raw bar. Some bistro-style restaurants offer a raw bar. Some restaurants offer a seasonal raw bar, such as Grand Banks restaurant in New York City and the newly opening Bagley & Shakespeare in London\n\nConsumming raw oysters is potentially dangerous as it might contains harmful bacteria. People eating raw oyster might contract vibriosis, an illness typically caused by eating raw seafood. There are reports of human casualities caused by consumming raw oyster.\n\n"

                "Sushi\n\nSushi can be prepared with either brown or white rice. It is often prepared with raw seafood, but some varieties of sushi use cooked ingredients, and many others are vegetarian. Sushi is often served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish is popular as a garnish.\n\nSushi is often confused with sashimi, a related Japanese dish consisting of thinly sliced raw fish or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.\n\nSushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known today as \"narezushi\" ( – \"salted fish\"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling; the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish. This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term \"sushi\" comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means \"sour-tasting\"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste. Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as \"funa-zushi\" from Shiga Prefecture.\n\nVinegar began to be added to the preparation of narezushi in the Muromachi period (1336–1573) for the sake of enhancing both taste and preservation. In addition to increasing the rice's sourness, the vinegar significantly increased the dish's longevity, causing the fermentation process to be shortened and eventually abandoned. The primitive sushi would be furthered developed in Osaka, where over several centuries it became \"oshi-zushi\"; in this preparation, the seafood and rice were pressed into shape with wooden (typically bamboo) molds.\n\nIt was not until the Edo period (1603-1868) that fresh fish was served over vinegared rice. The particular style of today's \"nigirizushi\" became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of \"nigirizushi\"'s origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799-1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku. The dish was originally termed \"Edomae zushi\" as it used freshly caught fish from the \"Edo-mae\" (Edo or Tokyo Bay); the term \"Edomae nigirizushi\" is still used today as a by-word for quality sushi, regardless of its ingredients' origins.\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" mistakenly notes the earliest written mention of sushi in English in an 1893 book, \"A Japanese Interior\", where it mentions sushi as \"a roll of cold rice with fish, sea-weed, or some other flavoring\". However, there is an earlier mention of sushi in James Hepburn's Japanese-English dictionary from 1873, and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal \"Notes and Queries\".\n\nThe common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared \"sushi rice\". Fillings, toppings, condiments, and preparation vary widely.\n\nNote that due to rendaku consonant mutation, sushi is spelled with a \"z\" instead of an \"s\" whenever a prefix is attached, such as in nigirizushi for instance.\n\n\"Chirashizushi\" (, \"scattered sushi\", also referred to as \"barazushi\") serves the rice in a bowl and tops it with a variety of raw fish and vegetable garnishes. It is commonly eaten because it is filling, fast and easy to make. It is eaten annually on Hinamatsuri in March.\n\nInarizushi () is a pouch of fried tofu typically filled with sushi rice alone.\n\nTales tell that inarizushi is named after the Shinto god \"Inari\". Foxes, messengers of Inari are believed to have a fondness for fried tofu, and an Inari-zushi roll has pointed corners that resemble fox ears.\n\nRegional variations include pouches made of a thin omelette (, \"fukusa-zushi\", or , \"chakin-zushi\") instead of tofu. It should not be confused with \"inari maki\", which is a roll filled with flavored fried tofu.\n\nCone sushi is a variant of \"inarizushi\" originating in Hawaii that may include green beans, carrots, or gobo along with rice, wrapped in a triangular aburage piece. It is often sold in \"okazu-ya\" (Japanese delis) and as a component of bento boxes.\nMakizushi (, \"rolled sushi\"), norimaki (, \"Nori roll\") or makimono (, \"variety of rolls\") is a cylindrical piece, formed with the help of a bamboo mat known as a \"makisu\" (). \"Makizushi\" is generally wrapped in nori (seaweed), but is occasionally wrapped in a thin omelette, soy paper, cucumber, or shiso (perilla) leaves. \"Makizushi\" is usually cut into six or eight pieces, which constitutes a single roll order. Below are some common types of \"makizushi\", but many other kinds exist.\nFutomaki (, \"thick, large or fat rolls\") is a large cylindrical piece, usually with \"nori\" on the outside. A typical \"futomaki\" is five to six centimeters (2–2.5 in) in diameter. They are often made with two, three, or more fillings that are chosen for their complementary tastes and colors. During the evening of the Setsubun festival, it is traditional in the Kansai region to eat uncut futomaki in its cylindrical form, where it is called \"ehō-maki\" (, lit. happy direction rolls). By 2000 the custom had spread to all of Japan. Futomaki are often vegetarian, and may utilize strips of cucumber, \"kampyō\" gourd, \"takenoko\" bamboo shoots, or lotus root. Strips of \"tamagoyaki\" omelette, tiny fish roe, chopped tuna, and \"oboro\" whitefish flakes are typical non-vegetarian fillings. Traditionally, the rice is lightly seasoned with salt and sesame oil/perilla oil. Popular protein ingredients are fish cakes, imitation crab meat, eggs, or seasoned beef rib-eye. Vegetables usually include cucumbers, spinach, carrot and (pickled radish). After the makizushi has been rolled and sliced, it is typically served with takuan.\n\nShort grain white rice is usually used, although short-grain brown rice, like olive oil on nori, is now becoming more widespread among the health-conscious. Rarely, sweet rice is mixed in makizushi rice.\nNowadays, the rice in makizushi can be many kinds of black rice, boiled rice and cereals etc.Besides the common ingredients listed above, some varieties may include cheese, spicy cooked squid, yakiniku, kamaboko, lunch meat, sausage, bacon or spicy tuna. The nori may be brushed with sesame oil or sprinkled with sesame seeds. In a variation, sliced pieces of makizushi may be lightly fried with egg coating.\n\nHosomaki (, \"thin rolls\") is a small cylindrical piece, with \"nori\" on the outside. A typical \"hosomaki\" has a diameter of about two and a half centimeters (1 in). They generally contain only one filling, often tuna, cucumber, \"kanpyō\", thinly sliced carrots, or, more recently, avocado. \"Kappamaki\", () a kind of \"Hosomaki\" filled with cucumber, is named after the Japanese legendary water imp fond of cucumbers called the kappa. Traditionally, \"kappamaki\" is consumed to clear the palate between eating raw fish and other kinds of food, so that the flavors of the fish are distinct from the tastes of other foods. \"Tekkamaki\" () is a kind of \"hosomaki\" filled with raw tuna. Although it is believed that the word \"tekka\", meaning \"red hot iron\", alludes to the color of the tuna flesh or salmon flesh, it actually originated as a quick snack to eat in gambling dens called \"tekkaba\" (), much like the sandwich. \"Negitoromaki\" () is a kind of \"hosomaki\" filled with scallion (\"negi\") and chopped tuna (\"toro\"). Fatty tuna is often used in this style. \"Tsunamayomaki\" () is a kind of \"hosomaki\" filled with canned tuna tossed with mayonnaise.\n\nTemaki (, \"hand roll\") is a large cone-shaped piece of \"nori\" on the outside and the ingredients spilling out the wide end. A typical \"temaki\" is about ten centimeters (4 in) long, and is eaten with fingers because it is too awkward to pick it up with chopsticks. For optimal taste and texture, \"temaki\" must be eaten quickly after being made because the \"nori\" cone soon absorbs moisture from the filling and loses its crispness, making it somewhat difficult to bite through. For this reason, the \"nori\" in pre-made or take-out temaki is sealed in plastic film which is removed immediately before eating.\n\n\"Narezushi\" (, \"matured sushi\") is a traditional form of fermented sushi. Skinned and gutted fish are stuffed with salt, placed in a wooden barrel, doused with salt again, then weighed down with a heavy tsukemonoishi (pickling stone). As days pass, water seeps out and is removed. After six months, this \"sushi\" can be eaten, remaining edible for another six months or more. The most famous variety of \"narezushi\" still being produced is \"funa-zushi\" (made from fish of the crucian carp genus, authentically from \"C. auratus grandoculis\" () endemic to Lake Biwa), a typical dish of Shiga Prefecture.\n\n\"Nigirizushi\" (, \"hand-pressed sushi\") consists of an oblong mound of \"sushi rice\" that the chef presses between the palms of the hands to form an oval-shaped ball, and a topping (the \"neta\") draped over the ball. It is usually served with a bit of \"wasabi\"; \"neta\" are typically fish such as salmon, tuna or other seafood. Certain toppings are typically bound to the rice with a thin strip of \"nori\", most commonly octopus (\"tako\"), freshwater eel (\"unagi\"), sea eel (\"anago\"), squid (\"ika\"), and sweet egg (\"tamago\"). One order of a given type of fish typically results in two pieces, while a sushi set (sampler dish) may contain only one piece of each topping.\n\n\"Gunkanmaki\" (, \"warship roll\") is a special type of \"nigirizushi\": an oval, hand-formed clump of sushi rice that has a strip of \"nori\" wrapped around its perimeter to form a vessel that is filled with some soft, loose or fine-chopped ingredient that requires the confinement of \"nori\" such as roe, \"nattō\", oysters, \"uni\" (sea urchin roe), corn with mayonnaise, scallops, and quail eggs. \"Gunkan-maki\" was invented at the \"Ginza Kyubey\" restaurant in 1941; its invention significantly expanded the repertoire of soft toppings used in sushi.\n\n\"Temarizushi\" (, \"ball sushi\") is a sushi made by pressing rice and fish into a ball-shaped form by hand using a plastic wrap.\n\n, also known as , \"hako-zushi\", \"box sushi\"), is a pressed sushi from the Kansai region, a favorite and specialty of Osaka. A block-shaped piece is formed using a wooden mold, called an \"oshibako\". The chef lines the bottom of the \"oshibako\" with the toppings, covers them with sushi rice, and then presses the lid of the mold down to create a compact, rectilinear block. The block is removed from the mold and then cut into bite-sized pieces. Particularly famous is (\"battera\", pressed mackerel sushi) or (\"saba zushi\"). In \"oshizushi\", all the ingredients are either cooked or cured and raw fish is never used.\nThe increasing popularity of \"sushi\" around the world has resulted in variations typically found in the Western world, but rarely in Japan (a notable exception to this is the use of salmon, which was introduced by Bjorn Eirik Olsen, a Norwegian businessman tasked with helping the Norwegian salmon industry sell more fish in the early 1980s). Such creations to suit the Western palate were initially fueled by the invention of the California roll (a \"norimaki\" with crab (later, imitation crab), cucumber, and avocado). A wide variety of popular rolls (\"norimaki\" and \"uramaki\") has evolved since. Norway roll is another variant of \"uramakizushi\" filled with \"tamago\" (omelette), imitation crab and cucumber, rolled with \"shiso\" leaf and \"nori\", topped with slices of Norwegian salmon, garnished with lemon and mayonnaise.\n\nUramaki (, \"inside-out roll\") is a medium-sized cylindrical piece with two or more fillings, and was developed as a result of the creation of the California roll, as a method originally meant to hide the nori. \"Uramaki\" differs from other \"makimono\" because the rice is on the outside and the \"nori\" inside. The filling is in the center surrounded by \"nori\", then a layer of rice, and optionally an outer coating of some other ingredients such as roe or toasted sesame seeds. It can be made with different fillings, such as tuna, crab meat, avocado, mayonnaise, cucumber or carrots.\n\nExamples of variations include the rainbow roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced \"maguro, hamachi, ebi, sake\" and avocado) and the caterpillar roll (an inside-out topped with thinly sliced avocado). Also commonly found is the \"rock and roll\" (an inside-out roll with barbecued freshwater eel and avocado with toasted sesame seeds on the outside).\n\nIn Japan, \"uramaki\" is an uncommon type of \"makimono\"; because sushi is traditionally eaten by hand in Japan, the outer layer of rice can be quite difficult to handle with fingers.\n\n\"Futomaki\" is a more popular variation of sushi within the United States, and comes in variations that take their names from their place of origin. Other rolls may include a variety of ingredients, including chopped scallops, spicy tuna, beef or chicken teriyaki roll, okra, and assorted vegetables such as cucumber and avocado, and the \"tempura roll\", where shrimp tempura is inside the roll or the entire roll is battered and fried tempura-style. In the Southern United States, many sushi restaurants prepare rolls using crawfish. Sometimes, rolls are made with brown rice or black rice, which appear in Japanese cuisine as well.\n\nPer Food and Drug Administration regulations, raw fish served in the United States must be frozen prior to serving in order to kill parasites. Because of this and the relative difficulty of acquiring fresh seafood compared to Japan, raw seafood (e.g., sashimi) is not as prevalent of a component in American-style sushi.\n\nSince rolls are usually made to-order it is not unusual for the customer to specify the exact ingredients desired (e.g. salmon roll, cucumber roll, avocado roll, Shrimp/tuna tempura roll, tuna roll, etc.). Though the menu names of dishes often vary by restaurant, some examples include:\n\nAll sushi has a base of specially prepared rice, complemented with other ingredients.\n\n\"Sushi-meshi\" (also known as \"Su-meshi\" , \"shari\" , or \"gohan\" ) is a preparation of white, short-grained, Japanese rice mixed with a dressing consisting of rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and occasionally kombu and \"sake\". It has to be cooled to room temperature before being used for a filling in a \"sushi\" or else it will get too sticky while being seasoned. Traditionally, the mixing is done with a hangiri, which is a round, flat-bottom wooden tub or barrel, and a wooden paddle (shamoji).\n\nSushi rice is prepared with short-grain Japanese rice, which has a consistency that differs from long-grain strains such as those from India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Thailand, and Vietnam. The essential quality is its stickiness or glutinousness, although the type of rice used for sushi is different from glutinous rice. Freshly harvested rice (\"shinmai\") typically contains too much water, and requires extra time to drain the rice cooker after washing. In some fusion cuisine restaurants, short-grain brown rice and wild rice are also used.\n\nThere are regional variations in sushi rice and individual chefs have their individual methods. Most of the variations are in the rice vinegar dressing: the Kantō region (or East Japan) version of the dressing commonly uses more salt; in Kansai region (or West Japan), the dressing has more sugar.\n\nThe black seaweed wrappers used in \"makimono\" are called \"nori\" (海苔). \"Nori\" is a type of algae, traditionally cultivated in the harbors of Japan. Originally, algae was scraped from dock pilings, rolled out into thin, edible sheets, and dried in the sun, in a process similar to making rice paper. Today, the commercial product is farmed, processed, toasted, packaged, and sold in sheets.\n\nThe size of a \"nori\" sheet influences the size of \"makimono\". A full-size sheet produces \"futomaki\", and a half produces \"hosomaki\" and \"temaki\". To produce \"gunkan\" and some other \"makimono\", an appropriately-sized piece of \"nori\" is cut from a whole sheet.\n\n\"Nori\" by itself is an edible snack and is available with salt or flavored with teriyaki sauce. The flavored variety, however, tends to be of lesser quality and is not suitable for sushi.\n\nWhen making \"fukusazushi\", a paper-thin omelette may replace a sheet of \"nori\" as the wrapping. The omelette is traditionally made on a rectangular omelette pan (makiyakinabe), and used to form the pouch for the rice and fillings.\n\nFor culinary, sanitary, and aesthetic reasons, the minimum quality and freshness of fish to be eaten raw must be superior to that of fish which is to be cooked. Sushi chefs are trained to recognize important attributes, including smell, color, firmness, and freedom from parasites that may go undetected in commercial inspection. Commonly used fish are tuna (\"maguro, shiro-maguro\"), Japanese amberjack, yellowtail (\"hamachi\"), snapper (\"kurodai\"), mackerel (\"saba\"), and salmon (\"sake\"). The most valued sushi ingredient is \"toro,\" the fatty cut of the fish. This comes in a variety of \"ōtoro\" (often from the bluefin species of tuna) and \"chūtoro\", meaning \"middle toro\", implying that it is halfway into the fattiness between \"toro\" and the regular cut. \"Aburi\" style refers to \"nigiri\" sushi where the fish is partially grilled (topside) and partially raw. Most nigiri sushi will have completely raw \"neta\".\n\nOther seafoods such as squid (\"ika\"), eel (\"anago\" and \"unagi\"), pike conger (\"hamo\"), octopus (\"tako\"), shrimp (\"ebi\" and \"amaebi\"), clam (\"mirugai\", \"aoyagi\" and \"akagai\"), fish roe (\"ikura\", \"masago\", \"kazunoko\" and \"tobiko\"), sea urchin (\"uni\"), crab (\"kani\"), and various kinds of shellfish (abalone, prawn, scallop) are the most popular seafoods in sushi. Oysters, however, are less common, as the taste is not thought to go well with the rice. \"Kani kama\", or imitation crab stick, is commonly substituted for real crab, most notably in California rolls.\n\nPickled daikon radish (\"takuan\") in \"shinko maki\", pickled vegetables (\"tsukemono\"), fermented soybeans (\"nattō\") in \"nattō maki\", avocado, cucumber in \"kappa maki\", asparagus, yam, pickled ume (\"umeboshi\"), gourd (\"kanpyō\"), burdock (\"gobo\"), and sweet corn (possibly mixed with mayonnaise) are also used in sushi.\n\nTofu and eggs (in the form of slightly sweet, layered omelette called \"tamagoyaki\" and raw quail eggs ride as a \"gunkan-maki\" topping) are common.\n\nSushi is commonly eaten with condiments. Sushi may be dipped in shōyu, soy sauce, and is usually flavored with wasabi, a piquant paste made from the grated stem of the \"Wasabia japonica\" plant. Japanese-style mayonnaise is a common condiment in Japan on salmon, pork and other sushi cuts.\n\nTrue wasabi has anti-microbial properties and may reduce the risk of food poisoning. The traditional grating tool for wasabi is a sharkskin grater or \"samegawa oroshi\". An imitation wasabi (\"seiyo-wasabi\"), made from horseradish, mustard powder and green dye is common. It is found at lower-end \"kaiten-zushi\" restaurants, in bento box sushi and at most restaurants outside Japan. If manufactured in Japan, it may be labelled \"Japanese Horseradish\".\n\nGari (sweet, pickled ginger) is eaten in between sushi courses to both cleanse the palate and aid in digestion. In Japan, green tea (\"ocha\") is invariably served together with sushi. Better sushi restaurants often use a distinctive premium tea known as \"mecha\". In sushi vocabulary, green tea is known as \"agari\".\n\nSushi may be garnished with gobo, grated daikon, thinly sliced vegetables, carrots/radishes/cucumbers that have been shaped to look like flowers, real flowers, or seaweed salad.\n\nWhen closely arranged on a tray, different pieces are often separated by green strips called \"baran\" or \"kiri-zasa\" (切り笹). These dividers prevent the flavors of neighboring pieces of sushi from mixing and help to achieve an attractive presentation. Originally, these were cut leaves from the \"Aspidistra elatior\" (葉蘭 \"haran\") and \"Sasa veitchii\" (熊笹 \"kuma-zasa\") plants, respectively. Using actual leaves had the added benefit of releasing antimicrobial phytoncides when cut thereby extending the limited shelf life of the sushi. Sushi bento boxes are a staple of Japanese supermarkets and convenience stores. As these stores began rising in prominence in the 1960s, the labor-intensive cut leaves were increasingly replaced with green plastic in order to lower costs. This coincided with the increased prevalence of refrigeration which acted to extend the shelf life of sushi without the need for the cut leaves. Today the plastic strips are commonly used in sushi bento boxes and to a lesser degree in sushi presentations found in sushi bars and restaurants. In store-sold or to-go packages of sushi, the plastic leaf strips are often used to prevent the rolls from coming into early or unwanted contact with the ginger and wasabi included with the dish.\n\nThe main ingredients of traditional Japanese sushi, raw fish and rice, are naturally low in fat, high in protein, carbohydrates (the rice only), vitamins, and minerals, as are \"gari\" and \"nori\". Other vegetables wrapped within the sushi also offer various vitamins and minerals. Many of the seafood ingredients also contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have a variety of health benefits. The omega-3 fatty acids found in fish has certain beneficial property, especially on cardiovascular health, natural anti-inflammatory compounds, and play a role in brain function. \n\nGenerally sushi is not a particularly fattening food. However, rice in sushi contains a fair amount of carbohydrates, plus the addition of other ingredients such as mayonnaise added into sushi rolls might increase the caloric content. Sushi also has a relatively high sodium content, especially contributed from \"shoyu\" soy sauce seasoning.\n\nSome of the ingredients in sushi can present health risks. Large marine apex predators such as tuna (especially bluefin) can harbor high levels of methylmercury, which can lead to mercury poisoning when consumed in large quantity or when consumed by certain higher-risk groups, including women who are pregnant or may become pregnant, nursing mothers and young children.\n\nAccording to recent studies, there have been about 18 million infections worldwide from eating raw fish. This serves as a great risk to expecting mothers due to the health risks that medical interventions or treatment measures may pose on the developing fetus. Parasitic infections can have a wide range of health impacts, including bowel obstruction, anemia, liver disease, and more. The impact of these illnesses alone can pose some health concerns on the expecting mother and baby, but the curative measures that may need to take place to recover are also of concern as well.\n\nSashimi or other types of sushi containing raw fish present a risk of infection by three main types of parasites:\n\nFor the above reasons, EU regulations forbid the use of fresh raw fish. It must be frozen at temperatures below in all parts of the product for no less than 24 hours. As such, a number of fishing boats, suppliers and end users \"super-freeze\" fish for sushi to temperatures as low as −60 °C. As well as parasite destruction, super-freezing also prevents oxidation of the blood in tuna flesh, thus preventing the discoloration that happens at temperatures above −20 °C.\n\nSome forms of sushi, notably those containing pufferfish fugu and some kinds of shellfish, can cause severe poisoning if not prepared properly. Particularly, fugu consumption can be fatal. Fugu fish has a lethal dose of tetrodotoxin in its internal organs and, by law in many countries, must be prepared by a licensed fugu chef who has passed the prefectural examination in Japan. The licensing examination process consists of a written test, a fish-identification test, and a practical test that involves preparing the fugu and separating out the poisonous organs. Only about 35 percent of the applicants pass.\n\nSustainable sushi is sushi made from fished or farmed sources that can be maintained or whose future production does not significantly jeopardize the ecosystems from which it is acquired. Concerns over the sustainability of sushi ingredients arise from greater concerns over environmental, economic and social stability and human health.\n\nTraditionally, sushi is served on minimalist Japanese-style, geometric, mono- or duo-tone wood or lacquer plates, in keeping with the aesthetic qualities of this cuisine.\n\nMany sushi restaurants offer fixed-price sets, selected by the chef from the catch of the day. These are often graded as \"shō-chiku-bai\" (), \"shō/matsu\" (, pine), \"chiku/take\" (, bamboo) and (\"bai/ume\"), with \"matsu\" the most expensive and \" ume\" the cheapest. Sushi restaurants will often have private booth dining, where guests are asked to remove their shoes, leaving them outside the room; However, most sushi bars offer diners a casual experience with an open dining room concept.\n\nSushi may be served \"kaiten zushi\" (sushi train) style. Color-coded plates of sushi are placed on a conveyor belt; as the belt passes, customers choose as they please. After finishing, the bill is tallied by counting how many plates of each color have been taken. Newer \"kaiten zushi\" restaurants use barcodes or RFID tags embedded in the dishes to manage elapsed time after the item was prepared.\n\nSome specialized or slang terms are used in the sushi culture. Most of these terms are used only in sushi bars.\n\n\nUnlike sashimi, which is almost always eaten with chopsticks, \"nigirizushi\" is traditionally eaten with the fingers, even in formal settings. Although it is commonly served on a small platter with a side dish for dipping, sushi can also be served in a \"bento\", a box with small compartments that hold the various dishes of the meal.\n\nSoy sauce is the usual condiment, and sushi is normally served with a small sauce dish, or a compartment in the bento. Traditional etiquette suggests that the sushi is turned over so that only the topping is dipped; this is because the soy sauce is for flavoring the topping, not the rice, and because the rice would absorb too much soy sauce and would fall apart. If it is difficult to turn the sushi upside-down, one can baste the sushi in soy sauce using \"gari\" (sliced ginger) as a brush. Toppings that have their own sauce (such as eel) should not be eaten with soy sauce.\n\nTraditionally, the sushi chef will add an appropriate amount of wasabi to the sushi while preparing it, and etiquette suggests eating the sushi as is, since the chef is supposed to know the proper amount of wasabi to use. However, today wasabi is more a matter of personal taste, and even restaurants in Japan may serve wasabi on the side for customers to use at their discretion, even when there is wasabi already in the dish.\n\n\n",
                "History of sushi\n\nThe history of sushi began with paddy fields in Southeast Asia, where fish was fermented with salt and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The dish is today known as \"narezushi\", and was introduced to Japan around the Yayoi period. In the Muromachi period, people began to eat the rice as well as the fish. During the Edo period, vinegar rather than fermented rice began to be used. In pre-modern times and modern times, it has become a form of fast food strongly associated with Japanese culture.\n\nThe earliest form of sushi, a dish today known as narezushi, has its probable origin with paddy fields along the Mekong river in Southeast Asia. The prototypical narezushi is made by lacto-fermenting fish with salt and rice in order to control putrefaction. Spreading southwards down the Mekong, narezushi then entered Austronesia. In Japan the dish's distribution overlaps with the introduction of wet-field rice cultivation during the Yayoi period.\n\nNarezushi appears in the Chinese dictionary in the 2nd century AD as the character \"sa\" (鮓, pickled fish with salt and rice), which was during a period in which Han people were migrating south of the Yangtze river, adopting the food from the non-Han minority peoples.\n\nThe Japanese preferred to eat fish with rice, known as \"namanare\" or \"namanari\" (生成, なまなれ, なまなり, semi-fermented). During the Muromachi period \"namanare\" was the most popular type of sushi. \"Namanare\" was partly raw fish wrapped in rice, consumed fresh, before it changed flavor. This new way of consuming fish was no longer a form of preservation but rather a new dish in Japanese cuisine.\n\nDuring the Edo period, a third type of sushi was introduced, \"haya-zushi\" (早寿司, 早ずし, fast sushi). \"Haya-zushi\" was assembled so that both rice and fish could be consumed at the same time, and the dish became unique to Japanese culture. It was the first time that rice was not being used for fermentation. Rice was now mixed with vinegar, with fish, vegetables and dried food stuff added. This type of sushi is still very popular today. Each region utilizes local flavors to produce a variety of sushi that has been passed down for many generations.\n\nToday's style of \"nigirizushi\" (握り寿司), consisting of an oblong mound of rice with a slice of fish draped over it, became popular in Edo (contemporary Tokyo) in the 1820s or 1830s. One common story of \"nigirizushi\"'s origins is of the chef Hanaya Yohei (1799-1858), who invented or perfected the technique in 1824 at his shop in Ryōgoku. After the Great Kanto earthquake in 1923, \"nigirizushi\" chefs were displaced from Edo throughout Japan, popularizing the dish throughout the country.\n\nThe earliest reference to \"sushi\" in Japan appeared in 718 in the Yōrō Code (養老律令 \"Yōrō-ritsuryō\"). As an example of tax paid by actual items, it is written down as \"雑鮨五斗 (about 64 liters of zakonosushi or zatsunosushi?)\". However, there is no way to know what this \"sushi\" was or even how it was pronounced. By the 9th and 10th century \"鮨\" and \"鮓\" are read as \"sushi\". This \"sushi\" was similar to today's \"narezushi\".\n\nFor almost the next 800 years, until the early 19th century, sushi slowly changed and the Japanese cuisine changed as well. The Japanese started eating three meals a day, rice was boiled instead of steamed, and of large importance, was the development of rice vinegar. While sushi continued to be produced by fermentation of fish with rice, the addition of rice vinegar greatly reduced the time of fermentation and the rice used began to be eaten along with the fish. In the Muromachi Period (1336 to 1573), the process of producing \"oshizushi\" was gradually developed where in the fermentation process was abandoned and vinegar was used. In the Azuchi-Momoyama period (1573–1603), \"namanare\" was invented. A 1603 Japanese-Portuguese dictionary has an entry for \"namanrina sushi\", literally \"half-made sushi\". The namanare was fermented for a shorter period than the narezushi and possibly marinated with rice vinegar. It still had the distinctive smell of narezushi.\n\nThe smell of narezushi was likely one of the reasons for shortening and eventually skipping the fermentation process. It is commonly described as \"a cross between blue cheese, fish, and rice vinegar\". A story from Konjaku Monogatarishū written in early 12th century makes it clear that it was not an attractive smell, even if it tasted good: In the early 18th century, \"oshizushi\" was perfected in Osaka and it came to Edo by the middle of 18th century. These sushi were sold to customers, but because they still required a little fermentation time, stores hung a notice and posters to customers on when to come for a sushi. Sushi was also sold near a park during a hanami period and a theater as a type of Bento. Inarizushi was sold along oshizushi. Makizushi and chirashizushi also became popular in Edo period.\n\nThere were three famous sushi restaurants in Edo, \"Matsunozushi\" (松之鮨), \"Yoheizushi\" (興兵衛鮓), and \"Kenukizushi\" (けぬき寿し) but there were thousands more sushi restaurants. They were established in a span of barely twenty years at the start of the 19th century. \"Nigirizushi\" was an instant hit and it spread through Edo like wildfire. In the book \"Morisadamanko\" (守貞謾稿) published in 1852, the author writes that for a \"cho\" (100 meters by 100 meters or 10,000 square meters) section of Edo there were one or two sushi restaurants, but that only one soba restaurant could be found in 1 or 2 cho. This means that there were nearly 2 sushi restaurants for every soba restaurant.\n\nThese early \"nigirizushi\" were not identical to today's varieties. Fish meat was marinated in soy sauce or vinegar or heavily salted so there was no need to dip into soy sauce. Some fish was cooked before it was put onto a sushi. This was partly out of necessity as there were no refrigerators. Each piece was also larger, almost the size of two pieces of today's sushi.\n\nThe advent of modern refrigeration allowed sushi made of raw fish to reach more consumers than ever before. The late 20th century saw sushi gaining in popularity all over the world.\n\nFunazushi is a rare type of narezushi still prepared near Lake Biwa, Shiga Prefecture. Eighteen generations of the Kitamura family have been preparing the dish at Kitashina since 1619.\n\nFresh \"funa\" are scaled and gutted through their gills keeping the body (and always the roe) of the fish intact. The fish are then packed with salt and aged for a year before being repacked annually in rice for up to four years. The resulting fermented dish may be served sliced thin or used as an ingredient in other dishes.\n\nAuthentic funazushi is made from a wild subspecies of goldfish called \"nigorobuna\" (\"Carassius auratus grandoculis\") endemic to the lake. It is actually technically misleading to say that \"crucian carp\" is used, as though any \"funa\" type carp in the genus may be substituted, especially since the true crucian carp is a distinct species altogether, \"C. carassius\", and is not indigenous to Lake Biwa. However, due to reduced catch of \"nigorobuna\" in recent years, it is true that, by necessity, certain other native species are starting to be substituted.\n\nAfter the invention of the sheet form of nori seaweed around 1750, \"makizushi\" or \"norimaki\", rice and various ingredients rolled with nori appeared. The term \"makizushi\" was first used in a book \"Ryōri Sankaikyō\" (料理山海郷, 1749). However this dish is not current day makizushi but seafood rolled with bamboo mat (makisu). Current day makizushi first appeared in a book \"Shinsen Kondate buruishū\" (新撰献立部類集, 1776) which describes makizushi as \"Place a sheet of asakusa-nori, pufferfish or paper on the makisu and spread the cooked rice then arrange fishes on it. Roll the makisu tightly from one side ...\" In 1778, a food shop guide book \"Shichijyūgonichi\" (七十五日, 1778) listed a shop whose famous menu is \"norimaki-zushi\". A later book \"Meihan Burui\" (名飯部類, 1802) describes \"makizushi\" as \"Spread asakusa-nori on the board, place the sushi rice on it. Ingredients are sea bream, abalone, shiitake, mitsuba and shiso. Roll them firmly...\"\n\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" notes the earliest written mention of sushi in an 1893 book, \"Japanese Interiors\", where it mentions that \"Domestics served us with tea and sushi or rice sandwiches\". However, there is also mention of sushi in a Japanese-English dictionary from 1873, and an 1879 article on Japanese cookery in the journal \"Notes and Queries\". Additionally, the 1879 best-selling book \"A Tour Around the World by General Grant\" by James Dabney McCabe describes former president Ulysses S. Grant dining on the \"shashimi\" [sic] version of sushi during his visit to Japan.\n\nSushi was already being served in the United States by the early 1900s, following an influx of Japanese immigration after the Meiji Restoration. The first sushi shop in the U.S. reportedly opened in 1906 in the Little Tokyo neighborhood of Los Angeles. H.D. Miller, food historian of Lipscomb University has written that a wave of Japanophilia in American high society resulted in the serving of sushi at social functions. Popularity of Japanese food peaked ca. 1905 when it was being served at Japanese-themed social gatherings across the United States, including in mid-western cities such as Minneapolis, Minnesota, St. Louis, Missouri and Bismarck, North Dakota. According to Miller, the earliest published mention of sushi eaten by an American, in America, was an August 18, 1904 article in the Los Angeles Herald about a luncheon served in Santa Monica by the socialite Fern Dell Higgins.\n\nSeveral years later, a wave of anti-Japanese nativism sentiments and restrictions on Japanese immigration, starting with the Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907, caused a subsequent decline in the acceptance of Japanese cuisine. After the outbreak of World War II, Japanese-American restaurants on the West Coast were generally forced to close and sell off their businesses due to internment orders on their proprietors. One restaurant that reopened after the war to serve sushi was Matsuno Sushi (Matsu-no-sushi) in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles. This restaurant had been in business at least since 1938 or 1939, and by 1949, it was back serving sushi (featuring local bluefin tuna) for lunch. But the maki and \"inari\" they served was not shaped by hand by trained chefs, but molded in cookie-cutters.\n\nThe Kawafuku restaurant in Little Tokyo has been credited with being the \"first true sushi bar\" in the United States, that is to say, the first to serve sushi from a trained sushi chef in the country. Some sources accept the claim made by a man named Noritoshi Kanai that he was the person instrumental in persuading Kawafuku's owner to start the sushi section. Kanai has also claimed to be the person who coined the term \"sushi bar\". Kanai headed the Tokyo-based arm of Mutual Trading, an importer of Japanese food ingredients that served Kawafuku and other restaurants. The first sushi chef in America according to this account was Shigeo Saito, and some sources paint the chef as the principal figure who brought real sushi to the U.S.\n\nThe California roll was invented in Los Angeles by substituting a slice of avocado for the seasonal \"toro\" (fatty tuna) in a traditional maki roll.\n\nA report of sushi being consumed in Britain occurred when the then Crown Prince Akihito (born 1933) visited Queen Elizabeth II at the time of her Coronation in May 1953. In September 1953, Crown Prince Akihito served sushi at the Japanese Embassy in Washington, DC.\n\nAustralia is a major source of rice used in sushi, in particular Leeton, New South Wales, which is the headquarters of SunRice.\n\nThe first known sushi conveyor belt in Australia appeared in Queensland in 1993, when Sushi Train opened its first restaurant.\nThe Japanese name \"sushi\" is written with kanji (Chinese characters) for ancient Chinese dishes which bear little resemblance to today's sushi.\n\nOne of these might have been a salt pickled fish. The first use of \"鮨\" appeared in the face and hand, the oldest Chinese dictionary believed to be written around the 3rd century BC. It is explained as literally \"Those made with fish (are called) 鮨, those made with meat (are called) 醢\". \"醢\" is a fermented meat made from salt and minced pork and \"鮨\" is a fermented fish made from salt and minced fish. The Chinese character \"鮨\" is believed to have a much earlier origin, but this is the earliest recorded instance of that character being associated with food. \"鮨\" was not associated with rice.\n\nIn 2nd century AD, another character used to write \"sushi\", \"鮓\", appeared in another Chinese dictionary of Han dynasty: \"鮓滓也 以塩米醸之加葅 熟而食之也\", which translates as \"鮓滓 is a food where fish is pickled by rice and salt, and itself is eaten when cooked\" (\"cooked\" here referring to preparing food by denaturing proteins with acid rather than heat, similar to the preparation of ceviche). This food is believed to be similar to \"narezushi\", i.e. that the fish was fermented for long times in conjunction with rice and was then eaten after removing the rice.\n\nA century later, the meaning of the two characters had become confused and by the time these two characters arrived in Japan, the Chinese themselves did not distinguish between them. The Chinese had stopped using rice as a part of the fermentation process, and then stopped eating pickled fish altogether. By the Ming dynasty, \"鮨\" and \"鮓\" had disappeared from Chinese cuisine.\n\n\n",
                "Kuai (dish)\n\nKuai was a Chinese dish consisting of finely cut strips of raw fish or meat, which was popular and commonly eaten in the early Chinese dynasties. According to the \"Book of Rites\" compiled between 202 BC and 220 AD, \"kuai\" consists of small thin slices or strips of raw meat, which are prepared by first thinly slicing the meat and then cutting the thin slices into strips. In modern times, the dishes are more often referred to as \"raw fish slices\" () or as \"yusheng\" (). The type of fish commonly used in ancient times included carp (鯉) and mandarin fish (鳜), while in modern times salmon (鮭) is commonly used.\n\nSauces were an essential part of \"kuai\" dishes, with scallions used for preparation of sauces in spring and mustard seed used for sauces in autumn. According to many classical texts, \"kuai\" served without sauces was deemed inedible and should be avoided.\n\nRaw fish and meat dishes, known collectively as \"kuai\", were first documented in China in the Zhou dynasty (1045–256 BC), and are mentioned in the \"Classic of Poetry\", \"Classic of Rites\", \"Analects\" and \"Mencius\". A related preparation method is \"xuan\" (軒), which involve slicing the raw meat in large thin pieces in the manner of carpaccio, however the term \"kuai\" was used to refer to this method. \"Kuai\" is the preferred preparation of raw beef and lamb, or fish such as the carp, while meat from wild deer and boar were prepared as \"xuan\". Thinness in the slices or strips was an important factor for judging the quality of the dish. During the Zhou dynasty and the Warring States period, \"kuai\" made from all fauna were widely consumed.\n\nDuring the time of the Qin (221–206 BC) and Han (206 BC–220 AD) dynasties, \"kuai\" made from the meat of land fauna became less popular with the term used to refer more and more to thinly sliced raw fish. The dish was widely consumed by all classes and coincides with the appearance of the character \"kuai\" (鱠) with its fish radical (魚) during this period (alongside the character 膾 with the \"\" meat radical). In addition, characters such as \"kuai\" (燴) with the fire radical (火) were introduced to indicate fish that has grilled to the rare stage and then thinly sliced, similar to Japanese tataki. Indeed, \"kuai\" and raw fish were so commonly consumed that Ying Shao wrote in the \"Fengsu Tongyi\", a manuscript that described the odd and exotic practices of various cultures and peoples, that \"in Zhu and E, raw fish is not consumed\", alluding to the perceived oddity of not eating fish raw. It is also during this period that the renowned dish \"jinji yukuai\" (金齏玉膾) along its accompanying \"baheji\" sauce (八和齏) was created.\n\nAlthough the dish was not widely consumed in later Chinese dynasties, it enjoyed a very high status in Chinese cuisine. Chinese physicians of the time sometimes recommended against it due to the very real possibility of serious illness due to flukes and other parasitic organisms, however many prominent Chinese individuals (including Cao Zhi and Chen Deng) maintained a strong affinity for the dish. It was believed that the application of strongly flavored spices such as mustard or Sichuan pepper could render the dish safe to consume.\n\nConsumption of \"kuai\" in China declined sharply by the time of the Qing dynasty. Since that time, most Chinese food has been cooked, though a Chaozhou (Teochew) dish called \"yusheng\" uses raw fish as its primary ingredient.\n\n\n"

                "Pit bull\n\nPit bull is the common name for a type of dog. Formal breeds often considered in North America to be of the pit bull type include the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, American Bully, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The American Bulldog is also sometimes included. Many of these breeds were originally developed as fighting dogs from cross breeding bull-baiting dogs (used to hold the faces and heads of larger animals such as bulls) and terriers. After the use of dogs in blood sports was banned, such dogs were used as catch dogs in the United States for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt and drive livestock, and as family companions. Despite dog fighting now being illegal in the United States, it still exists as an underground activity, and pit bulls are a common breed of choice.\n\nThe term pit bull is often used loosely to describe dogs with similar physical characteristics, and the morphological (physical) variation amongst \"bully breed\" dogs makes it difficult for anyone, even experts, to visually identify them as distinct from \"non-pit bulls\". While mixed breed dogs are often labeled as \"pit bulls\" if they have certain physical characteristics such as a square shaped head or bulky body type, visual identification of mixed breed dogs is not recommended by the scholarly community.\n\nPit bulls were created by breeding bulldogs and terriers together to produce a dog that combined the gameness and agility of the terrier with the strength of the bulldog. In the United Kingdom, these dogs were used in blood sports such as bull-baiting and bear-baiting. These blood sports were officially eliminated in 1835 as Britain began to introduce animal welfare laws. Since dogfights were cheaper to organize and far easier to conceal from the law than bull or bear baits, blood sport proponents turned to pitting their dogs against each other instead. Dog fighting was used as both a blood sport (often involving gambling) and a way to continue to test the quality of their stock. For decades afterwards, dog fighting clandestinely took place in small areas of Britain and America. In the early 20th century pit bulls were used as catch dogs in America for semi-wild cattle and hogs, to hunt, and drive livestock, and as family companions. Some have been selectively bred for their fighting prowess.\n\nPit bulls also constitute the majority of dogs used for illegal dog fighting in America. In addition, law enforcement organisations report these dogs are used for other nefarious purposes, such as guarding illegal narcotics operations, use against police, and as attack dogs. On the other side of the law, pit bulls have been used as police dogs.\n\nIn an effort to counter the fighting reputation of pit bull-type dogs, in 1996 the San Francisco Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals renamed pit bull terriers to \"St. Francis Terriers\", so that people might be more likely to adopt them. 60 temperament-screened dogs were adopted until the program was halted, after several of the newly adopted pit bulls killed cats. The New York City Center for Animal Care and Control tried a similar approach in 2004, relabeling their pit bulls as \"New Yorkies\", but dropped the idea in the face of overwhelming public opposition.\n\nViolent interactions between humans and canines have been studied by the US government, notably the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as academic veterinary researchers. The interpretation of these studies, breed identification and relevance issues, and variable circumstances have given rise to intense controversy.\n\nIn a 2014 literature review of dog bite studies, the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) states that breed is a poor sole predictor of dog bites.\nControlled studies do not show pit bulls to be disproportionately dangerous. While pit bull-type dogs are more frequently identified with cases involving very severe injuries or fatalities than other breeds, the review suggests this may relate to the popularity of the breed, noting that sled dogs and Siberian Huskies compose a majority of fatal dog attacks in some areas of Canada. \n\nIn a 2000 review by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which examines data from both media reports and from The Humane Society of the United States, pit bull-type dogs were identified in approximately one-third of dog bite-related fatalities in the United States between 1981 and 1992. However, the review notes that studies on dog bite-related fatalities which collect information by surveying news reports are subject to potential errors, as some fatal attacks may not have been reported, a study might not find all relevant news reports, and the dog breed might be misidentified. The AVMA has also noted fundamental problems with tracking breed in dog bite-related fatalities. In a 2013 study of 256 fatalities in the United States from 2000–2009, the AVMA determined that valid breed determination was possible for only 17.6% of cases.\n\nContrary to popular myth, pit bulls do not have \"locking jaws\". There is no physiological \"locking mechanism\" in the jaw muscle and bone structure of pit bulls or other dogs. Pit bull-type dogs, like other terriers, hunting, and bull-baiting breeds, can exhibit a bite, hold, and shake behavior and at times refuse to release. Pit bulls also have wide skulls, well-developed facial muscles, and strong jaws, and some research suggests that pit bull bites are particularly serious because they tend to bite deeply and grind their molars into tissue. Breaking an ammonia ampule and holding it up to the dog's nose can cause the dog to release its hold.\n\nWidely reported pit bull attacks in popular media have resulted in the enactment of breed-specific legislation in several jurisdictions. In some cases breed specific bans have been reversed or prohibited by state legislation. These perceptions have also led to increased premiums for liability insurance.\n\nBreed-specific legislation has been largely found to be ineffective at reducing the number of dog attacks. Research has indicated that there is resistance by those who work in the adoption industry, applying a sharper distinction before allowing a dog to be labelled as a pit bull, as well as objections from veterinarians.\n\nMany of the jurisdictions that restrict pit bulls apply their restriction to the modern American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and any other dog that has the substantial physical characteristics and appearance of those breeds. Such jurisdictions include the Canadian province of Ontario, and the U.S. cities of Miami and Denver. However a few jurisdictions, such as Singapore and Franklin County, Ohio, also classify the modern American Bulldog as a \"pit bull-type dog\". In the United Kingdom, a pit bull is an American Pit Bull Terrier.\n\nCourts in the United States and Canada have ruled that expert identification, when using published breed standards, is sufficient for the enforcement of breed-specific legislation.\n\nApproximately 550 jurisdictions have enacted breed-specific legislation (BSL) in response to a number of well-publicized incidents involving pit bull-type dogs, and some government organizations such as the U.S. Army and Marine Corps have taken administrative action as well. These actions range from outright bans on the possession of pit bull-type dogs, to restrictions and conditions on pit bull ownership. They often establish a legal presumption that a pit bull-type dog is \"prima facie\" a legally \"dangerous\" or \"vicious\" dog. In response, 16 states in the U.S. prohibited or restricted the ability of municipal governments within those states to enact BSL, though these restrictions do not affect military installations located within the states.\n\nIt is now generally settled in caselaw that jurisdictions in the U.S. and Canada have the right to enact breed-specific legislation. Despite these holdings by the courts, there is some public skepticism over whether the laws are effective. One point of view is that pit bulls are a public safety issue that merits actions such as banning ownership, mandatory spay/neuter for all pit bulls, mandatory microchip implants and liability insurance, or prohibiting people convicted of a felony from owning pit bulls. Another point of view is that comprehensive \"dog bite\" legislation, coupled with better consumer education and legally mandating responsible pet-keeping practices, is a better solution to the problem of dangerous pit bulls than BSL.\n\nA third point of view is that breed-specific legislation should not ban breeds entirely, but should instead strictly regulate the conditions under which specific breeds could be owned, for example, forbidding certain classes of individuals from owning them, specifying public areas from which they would be prohibited, and establishing conditions, such as requiring a dog to wear a muzzle, for taking specific breeds of dogs into public places. Finally, some governments, such as in Australia, have forbidden the import of specific breeds, and are requiring the spay/neuter of all existing dogs of these breeds in an attempt to eliminate the breed's population slowly through natural attrition.\n\nThe ASPCA said that along with putative over-reporting, false reporting was a major contributor to public perceptions about the breed.\n\nIn England and Wales the Dangerous Dogs Act prohibits the ownership of American Pit Bull Terriers, along with three other breeds. The Act also bans the breeding, sale and exchange of these dogs. Similar legislation in Australia has been criticized by veterinary professionals.\n\nDog owners in the United States can be held legally liable for injuries inflicted or caused by their dogs. In general, owners are considered liable if they were unreasonably careless in handling or restraining the dog, or if they knew beforehand that the dog had a tendency to cause injury (e.g., bite); however, dog owners are automatically considered liable if local laws hold an owner strictly liable for all damage caused by their dog, regardless of carelessness or foreknowledge of a dog's tendencies. Homeowners and renters insurance policies typically provide liability coverage from US$100,000–300,000 for injuries inflicted by dogs; however, some insurance companies limit their exposure to dog bite liability claims by putting restrictions on dog owners that they insure. These restrictions include refusing to cover dog bites under the insurance policy, increasing insurance rates for homeowners with specific breeds, requiring owners of specific breeds to take special training or have their dogs pass the American Kennel Club Canine Good Citizen test, requiring owners to restrict their dogs with muzzles, chains, or enclosures, and refusing to write policies for homeowners or renters who have specific breeds of dogs.\n\nOwners of rental properties may also be held liable if they knew an aggressive dog was living on their property and they did nothing to ensure the safety of other tenants at the property; as a result, many rental properties forbid pit bull-type dogs and any other breeds if the rental property's insurance will not cover damage inflicted by that type of dog. The dog breeds most often targeted by insurance companies include pit bull-type dogs, Rottweilers, German Shepherd Dogs, Doberman Pinschers, Akitas (Akita Inu and American Akita), and Chow Chows.\n\nIn 2013, Farmers Insurance notified policy holders in California that \"it will no longer cover bites by pit bulls, rottweilers and wolf hybrids. A spokeswoman for Farmers said those breeds account for more than a quarter of the agency's dog bite claims.\"\n\nSeveral air carriers embargo certain dog breeds, due to the effect of high temperature and humidity on brachycephalic animals. The following table has a sampling of air carrier embargoes on dogs.\nUnited Airlines formerly embargoed American Pit Bull Terriers for safety reasons. However, pit bulls (along with American Staffordshires and other similar breeds) are now permitted, provided that dogs over six months old or weighing more than 20 pounds (9 kg) are transported in reinforced crates.\n\nPit bull breeds have become famous for their roles as soldiers, police dogs, search and rescue dogs, actors, television personalities, seeing eye dogs, and celebrity pets. The American Staffordshire Terrier, Pete the Pup from the movie Little Rascals is a historically well known pit bull. Lesser known, but still historically notable pit bulls include Billie Holiday's companion \"Mister\", Helen Keller's dog \"Sir Thomas\", Buster Brown's dog \"Tige\", Horatio Jackson's dog \"Bud\", President Theodore Roosevelt's Pit Bull terrier \"Pete\", \"Jack Brutus\" who served for Company K, the First Connecticut Volunteer Infantry during the civil war, Sergeant Stubby who served for the 102nd Infantry, 26th (Yankee) Division during World War I, and Sir Walter Scott's \"Wasp\".\n\nContemporary significant pit bulls are: Weela, who helped save 32 people, 29 dogs, 3 horses, and 1 cat during southern California's widespread flooding in 1993; Popsicle, a five-month-old puppy originally found nearly dead in a freezer, who grew to become one of the nation's most important police dogs; Norton, who was placed in the Purina Animal Hall of Fame after he rescued his owner from a severe reaction to a spider bite; Titan, who rescued his owner's wife, who would have died from an aneurysm; D-Boy, who took three bullets to save his family from an intruder with a gun; Star, who while protecting her owner was shot by police in a video that went viral; and Lilly, who lost a leg after being struck by a freight train while pulling her unconscious owner from the train tracks. Daddy, Cesar Millan's right-hand dog, was famous for his mellow temperament and his ability to interact calmly with ill-mannered dogs.\n",
                "Breed-specific legislation\n\nBreed-specific legislation is a law passed by a legislative body pertaining to a specific breed or breeds of domesticated animals. In practice, it generally refers to laws pertaining to a specific dog breed or breeds.\n\nSome jurisdictions have enacted breed-specific legislation in response to a number of well-publicized incidents involving pit bull-type dogs or other dog breeds commonly used in dog fighting, and some government organizations such as the United States Army and Marine Corps have taken administrative action as well. This legislation ranges from outright bans on the possession of these dogs, to restrictions and conditions on ownership, and often establishes a legal presumption that these dogs are \"prima facie\" legally \"dangerous\" or \"vicious\". In response, some state-level governments in the United States have prohibited or restricted the ability of municipal governments within those states to enact breed-specific legislation.\n\nIt is generally settled in case law that jurisdictions in the United States and Canada have the right to enact breed-specific legislation; however, the appropriateness and effectiveness of breed-specific legislation in preventing dog bite fatalities and injuries is disputed. One point of view is that certain dog breeds are a public safety issue that merits actions such as banning ownership, mandatory spay/neuter for all dogs of these breeds, mandatory microchip implants and liability insurance, or prohibiting people convicted of a felony from owning them. Another point of view is that comprehensive \"dog bite\" legislation, coupled with better consumer education and legally mandating responsible pet keeping practices, is a better solution than breed-specific legislation to the problem of dangerous dogs. A third point of view is that breed-specific legislation should not ban breeds entirely, but should strictly regulate the conditions under which specific breeds could be owned, \"e.g.\", forbidding certain classes of individuals from owning them, specifying public areas in which they would be prohibited, and establishing conditions, such as requiring a dog to wear a muzzle, for taking dogs from specific breeds into public places. Finally, some governments, such as that of Australia, have forbidden the import of specific breeds and are requiring the spay/neuter of all existing dogs of these breeds in an attempt to eliminate the population slowly through natural attrition.\n\nA study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2000 concluded that while fatal attacks on humans appeared to be a breed-specific problem (pit bull-type dogs and Rottweilers), other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates, and that since fatal attacks represent a small proportion of dog bite injuries to humans, there are better alternatives for prevention of dog bites than breed-specific ordinances. Given many media sources incorrectly reported that this study suggested that pit bull-type dogs and Rottweilers are disproportionately more dangerous than other dog breeds, the American Veterinary Medical Association whose journal published the original article released a statement detailing that this study \"cannot be used to infer any breed specific risk for dog bite fatalities\".\n\nThe importation of the Dogo Argentino, Fila Brasileiro, Japanese tosa, American pit bull terrier and Perro de Presa Canario or Presa Canario into Australia is absolutely prohibited.\n\nThe Canadian federal government does not regulate pit bull-type dogs, but one provincial government and some municipal governments in Canada have enacted breed-specific legislation banning or restricting pit bull-type dogs. The following table discusses a sampling of the restrictions in force.\n\nIn \"Cochrane v. Ontario (Attorney General)\", 2007 CanLII 9231 (ON S.C.), Ms. Catherine Cochrane sued the Province of Ontario to prevent it from enforcing the Dog Owner's Liability Act (DOLA) ban on pit bull-type dogs, arguing that the law was unconstitutionally broad because the ban was grossly disproportionate to the risk pit bulls pose to public safety, and that the law was unconstitutionally vague because failed to provide an intelligible definition of pit bulls. She also argued that a provision allowing the Crown to introduce as evidence a veterinarian's certificate certifying that the dog is a pit bull violates the right to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence.\n<br>The presiding judge ruled that the DOLA was not overbroad because,\n\"The evidence with respect to the dangerousness of pit bulls, although conflicting and inconclusive, is sufficient, in my opinion, to constitute a 'reasoned apprehension of harm'. In the face of conflicting evidence as to the feasibility of less restrictive means to protect the public, it was open to the legislature to decide to restrict the ownership of all pit bulls.\"\n\nThe presiding judge found the term \"a pit bull terrier\" was unconstitutionally vague since it could include an undefined number of dogs similar to the American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, and Staffordshire Bull Terrier. The judge also ruled that the government's ability to introduce a veterinarian's certificate certifying that the dog is a pit bull created a mandatory presumption that the dog was a pit bull, and that this placed an unconstitutional burden of proof upon the defendant.\nMs. Cochrane and the Attorney General of Ontario appealed different aspects of the decision to the Court of Appeal for Ontario.\nIn \"Cochrane v. Ontario\" (2008 ONCA 718), the Court of Appeal reversed the lower court's ruling:\n\nOn June 11, 2009 the Supreme Court of Canada declined to hear further appeal of the case, thereby upholding the Ontario ban on pit bulls.\n\nThe Control of Dogs Regulations 1998 place controls on 11 breeds of dogs:\n\nThese dogs, or strains and crosses thereof, must be kept on a strong, short lead (less than 2 metres / 6'7\") by a person over 16 years of age who is capable of controlling them. The dog/s must be securely muzzled too. A recent study conducted in Ireland found that dog bite injuries significantly increased since the introduction of such legislation, although data from before the introduction of the ban was not included. The study reported that dog bite hospitalisations may rise as a result of targeting dog breeds due to reinforcing incorrect stereotypes of the dangerousness of certain breeds and assuming the safety of others simply due to their breed may result in people incorrectly interacting with dogs from both categories.\n\nIn the United Kingdom the main piece of breed-specific legislation is the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991, which makes it illegal to own any 'Specially Controlled Dogs' without specific exemption from a court. The dogs have to be muzzled and kept on a lead in public, they must be registered and insured, neutered, tattooed and receive microchip implants. The Act also bans the breeding, sale and exchange of these dogs, even if they are on the 'Index of Exempted Dogs'.\n\nFour types of dogs are specifically identified by the Act:\n\n\nThe Act also covers cross-breeds of the above four types of dog. Dangerous dogs are classified by \"type\", not by breed label. This means that whether a dog is prohibited under the Act will depend on a judgement about its physical characteristics, and whether they match the description of a prohibited \"type\". This assessment of the physical characteristics is made by a court.\n\nThe Act applies in England, Wales and Scotland, with the Dangerous Dogs (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 having a similar effect in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe United States federal government has not enacted breed-specific legislation, but the Marine Corps has banned \"large dog breeds with a predisposition toward aggressive or dangerous behavior\", including pit bull-type dogs (among other breeds) in on-base housing and privatized housing, as have a number of United States Army, U.S. Air Force and Navy installations. Several hundred municipal governments in the United States have enacted breed-specific legislation banning or restricting pit bull-type dogs and a few other breeds.\n\nCourt challenges to breed-specific legislation on constitutional grounds have been largely unsuccessful. Dana M. Campbell summarized the legal challenges and the general court findings as of July 2009:\nCourt cases challenging BSL have focused on constitutional concerns such as substantive due process, equal protection, and vagueness. Most BSL will survive the minimum scrutiny analysis allowed by the due process clauses of the Constitution's Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because there is no fundamental right at issue. This analysis requires that the law being challenged must be rationally related to a legitimate government goal or purpose. Because state and local jurisdictions enjoy broad police powers, including protecting the public's safety and welfare, courts have not had trouble finding that BSL is rationally related to the goal of protecting the public from allegedly dangerous breeds.\nThis has caused big problems for many who use them as police, guide or other service dogs, as they are not always excluded, and in some cases are confiscated and put down.\n<br><br>\nChallenges based on equal protection arguments are similarly difficult to sustain. Here courts are looking at whether there is a rational purpose for treating pit bull breeds differently from other dog breeds. Dog owners have attacked the rational purpose requirement by arguing either that BSL is over-inclusive, because it bans all dogs of a breed when only certain individuals within the breed have proven to be vicious, or under-inclusive, because many types of dogs have injured people and the BSL fails to include those other breeds. However, again under minimum scrutiny review, BSL will survive as long as the government can establish that the BSL is rationally related to its purpose, even if the law is found to be over-inclusive or under-inclusive.\n<br><br>\nClaims that BSL is unconstitutionally vague have brought dog owners mixed success. Procedural due process requires that laws provide the public with sufficient notice of the activity or conduct being regulated or banned. Here owners of pit bulls or other banned breeds argue that the breed ban laws do not adequately define just what is a \"pit bull\" (or other banned breed) for purposes of the ban. Another argument is that the laws are too vague to help the dog-owning public or the BSL enforcement agency—such as animal control or police—to be able to identify whether a dog falls under the BSL if the dog was adopted with an unknown origin or is a mixed breed.\n\nIn \"Sentell v. New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Company\", 166 U.S. 698 (1897), Mr. Sentell sued the New Orleans and Carrollton Railroad Company to recover the value of his female Newfoundland dog that he alleged to have been negligently killed by the railroad company. The company claimed that Louisiana law held that only people who licensed their dogs were entitled to sue for compensation if the dog were killed, and that Mr. Sentell was not entitled to damages since he had not licensed his dog. The trial court in Orleans Parish found for Mr. Sentell and awarded him $250 US, so the railroad company appealed to the Louisiana Court of Appeal, which reversed the decision of the trial court. The Louisiana Supreme Court declined to hear the case, so Mr. Sentell then appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which agreed to hear the case.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled against Mr. Sentell and established the precedent in U.S. jurisprudence that the regulation of dogs was within the police power of the state, and that the dogs were not as valuable as horses, cattle, sheep, or other domesticated animals:It is true that under the Fourteenth Amendment, no state can deprive a person of his life, liberty, or property without due process of law, but in determining what is due process of law, we are bound to consider the nature of the property, the necessity for its sacrifice, and the extent to which it has heretofore been regarded as within the police power. So far as property is inoffensive or harmless, it can only be condemned or destroyed by legal proceedings, with due notice to the owner; but, so far as it is dangerous to the safety or health of the community, due process of law may authorize its summary destruction...\n<br><br>\nAlthough dogs are ordinarily harmless, they preserve some of their hereditary wolfish instincts, which occasionally break forth in the destruction of sheep and other helpless animals. Others, too small to attack these animals, are simply vicious, noisy, and pestilent. As their depredations are often committed at night, it is usually impossible to identify the dog or to fix the liability upon the owner, who, moreover, is likely to be pecuniarily irresponsible [irresponsible with money]. In short, the damages are usually such as are beyond the reach of judicial process, and legislation of a drastic nature is necessary to protect persons and property from destruction and annoyance. Such legislation is clearly within the police power of the state. It ordinarily takes the form of a license tax, and the identification of the dog by a collar and tag, upon which the name of the owner is sometimes required to be engraved, but other remedies are not uncommon.\n\nIn \"Vanater v. Village of South Point\", 717 F. Supp. 1236 (D. Ohio 1989), the Ohio federal district court held that the criminal ordinance of South Point, Ohio prohibiting the owning or harboring of pit bull terriers within the village limits was not overly broad, concluding:\n\nThe Court concludes that the definitions of a Pit Bull Terrier in this Ordinance are not unconstitutionally vague. An ordinary person could easily refer to a dictionary, a dog buyer's guide or any dog book for guidance and instruction; also, the American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club have set forth standards for Staffordshire Bull Terriers and American Staffordshire Terriers to help determine whether a dog is described by any one of them. While it may be true that some definitions contain descriptions which lack \"mathematical certainty,\" such precision and definiteness is not essential to constitutionality.\nThe court made the following findings of fact when it determined the village showed that pit bull terriers are uniquely dangerous and therefore, are proper subjects of the village's police power for the protection of the public's health and welfare:\n\n\nIn \"American Dog Owners Ass'n, Inc. v. Dade County, Fla.\", 728 F.Supp. 1533 (S.D.Fla.,1989), dog owners sued in the federal district court of Florida to prevent Dade County from enforcing a pit bull ban, claiming that there is no such thing as a pit bull dog but rather three separate breeds; however, their own expert witnesses repeatedly identified dogs from the three separate breeds as \"pit bull dogs\" during the trial. The court upheld the Dade County ordinance, concluding:\nBased upon the substantial evidence presented at trial, this court finds that Dade County Ordinance No. 89-022 provides sufficient guidance to dog owners, both in its explicit reference to pit bull dogs, and in its definitional section, to enable pit bull owners to determine whether their dogs fall within the proscriptions of the ordinance...Certainly there are some applications of the ordinance which pass constitutional muster. As long as the enactment is not impermissibly vague in all its applications, this court must uphold its constitutionality. Upon consideration of the evidence presented at trial, the pleadings, memoranda, exhibits and arguments of counsel and upon application of the controlling authority, this court finds that plaintiffs have failed to meet their burden of proof and that the Court is required to uphold the constitutionality of Dade County Ordinance No. 089-22.\n\nIn \"American Canine Federation and Florence Vianzon v. City of Aurora, Colorado\", 618 F.Supp.2d 1271 (2009), the plaintiffs sued in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado to prevent Aurora, Colorado from enforcing a pit bull ban on the grounds that the law was unconstitutionally vague, that the law was an abuse of the city's police power, and that the ban represented an unconstitutional taking of property. The court rejected each of these claims based on existing legal precedents and upheld the city's ordinance.\n\nIn \"Holt v. City of Maumelle\", 817 S.W.2d 208 (AR., 1991), Mr. Steele Holt sued the city of Maumelle, Arkansas in 1988 in an attempt to have its prohibition against pit bulls overturned on the grounds that the ordinance was impermissibly vague, that it was unreasonable to ban pit bull-type dogs, and that the city's Board of Directors committed a breach of contract by passing a pit bull ordinance that it had previously agreed to forego; Mr. Holt also asked that the city pay compensatory damages, punitive damages, and his attorney's fees. The Pulaski County circuit court made a summary judgment dismissing the suit, and Mr. Holt appealed. In 1991, the Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed the circuit court's decision, finding that the pit bull ordinance was not impermissibly vague, that the restrictions were reasonable, and that any agreement made by the city to limit its own legislative powers was null and void since the city's first duty was to protect the public interest.\n\nIn \"Colorado Dog Fanciers, Inc. v. City and County of Denver\", 820 P.2d 644, Colo., 1991, the Colorado Supreme Court upheld a Denver city ordinance that dog owners had complained was unconstitutional, along the following lines:\nIn \"City & County of Denver v. State of Colorado\", 04CV3756, Denver challenged a 2004 law passed by the Colorado General Assembly that prohibited breed specific laws on the grounds that the state law violated the city's home rule authority in regard to animal control legislation. The Denver District Court Judge ruled in favor of Denver, finding that:\n\nIn \"State of Florida v. Peters\", 534 So.2d 760 (Fla.App. 3 Dist. 1988), the Florida Third District Court of Appeal reviewed the City of North Miami ordinance regulating the ownership of pit bull dogs within the city limits, and held: (1) the ordinance did not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution since the city's action in light of the evidence was neither arbitrary or irrational; (2) the ordinance's requirement to obtain liability insurance did not violate due process since the city had the right to regulate dogs under its police powers; (3) the definition of \"pit bull\" was not unconstitutionally vague, citing substantial precedent that laws requiring \"substantial conformance\" with a standard are not considered vague; and that mathematical certainty of a dog's identity as a pit bull was not required for a legal determination that a dog was in fact a pit bull.\n\nIn \"Hearn v. City of Overland Park\", 772 P.2d 758 (Kan. 1989), the Supreme Court of Kansas reviewed the ruling of a county court that overturned an ordinance of the City of Overland Park regulating the ownership of pit bull dogs within the city limits, and held: (1) The ordinance is not unconstitutionally vague or overbroad; (2) the ordinance does not violate the due process rights of plaintiffs under the United States and Kansas Constitutions; (3) the ordinance does not violate the equal protection clauses of the United States and Kansas Constitutions; and (4) the district court did not err in dismissing the plaintiffs' claim for damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1982).\n\nIn \"Bess v. Bracken County Fiscal Court\", 210 S.W.3d 177 (Ky.App.,2006), the Kentucky Court of Appeals reviewed a Bracken County ordinance that banned pit bull terriers. The appellants (Mr. Bess and Mr. Poe) had sought a temporary injunction against the ordinance in the Bracken County Circuit Court. The Circuit Court dismissed the motion on the grounds that the police power of the fiscal court allowed it to ban pit bull terriers and seize them without compensation. The appellants appealed on the grounds that\nThe Appeals court upheld the Bracken County ordinance, finding that\n\nIn \"American Dog Owners Ass'n, Inc. v. City of Lynn\", 404 Mass. 73, 533 N.E.2d 642 (Mass.,1989), the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court reviewed a series of ordinances enacted by Lynn, Massachusetts targeting dogs variously referred to as \"American Staffordshire Terrier[s], a/k/a American Pit Bull Terrier[s] or Bull Terrier[s]\" (July 1985); \"American Staffordshire, Staffordshire Pit Bull Terrier or Bull Terrier, hereinafter referred to as 'Pit Bulls'\" (June 1986); and \"\"American Staffordshire, Staffordshire Pit Bull Terrier, Bull Terrier or any mixture thereof\" (September 1986).\n\nThe Supreme Judicial Court determined that the issue was technically moot since each of the ordinances in question had been repealed by passage of a subsequent \"pit bull\" ordinance in June 1987; however, the court specifically observed (but did not rule) that the 1987 ordinance relied on the \"common understanding and usage\" of the names of the breeds in question, and warned that \n\nthe Lynn Pit Bull ban ordinance depends for enforcement on the subjective understanding of dog officers of the appearance of an ill-defined \"breed,\" leaves dog owners to guess at what conduct or dog \"look\" is prohibited, and requires \"proof\" of a dog's \"type\" which, unless the dog is registered, may be impossible to furnish. Such a law gives unleashed discretion to the dog officers charged with its enforcement, and clearly relies on their subjective speculation whether a dog's physical characteristics make it what is \"commonly understood\" to be a \"Pit Bull.\"\nAs a result of this case, breed-specific legislation in the United States often relies on the published standards of the American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club to clearly identify the characteristics of dogs subject to regulation as \"pit bulls.\"\n\nIn \"Garcia v. Village of Tijeras\", 767 P.2d 355 (1988), the New Mexico Court of Appeals reviewed an ordinance of the Village of Tijeras that banned the ownership or possession of a breed of dog \"known as American Pit Bull Terrier\"; any dog found in violation of the ordinance after a court hearing would be euthanized. The court held against each of the defendants' claims and upheld the ordinance on the following grounds:\n\nIn New York City, the New York City Housing Authority, which is not a legislature but rather a city government authority which provides affordable housing for low- and moderate-income residents and administers a citywide government-legislature-approved Section 8 Leased Housing Program, in May 2009 prohibited residents of the Authority from owning the following dog breeds: Akita Inu, Alangu Mastiff, Alano Español, American Pit Bull Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier, Argentine Dogo, Bedlington Terrier, Boston Terrier, Bull and Terrier, Bull Terrier, Bully Kutta, Cane Corso, Dogue de Bordeaux, Dogo Sardesco, English Mastiff, Fila Brasileiro, Gull Dong, Gull Terr, Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Korean Jindo Dog, Lottatore Brindisino, Neapolitan Mastiff, Perro de Presa Canario, Perro de Presa Mallorquin, Shar Pei, Staffordshire Bull Terrier, Tosa Inu.\n\nIn \"Toledo v. Tellings\" – Reversed – 871 N.E.2d 1152 (Ohio, 2007), the Ohio Sixth District Court of Appeal struck down a portion of the Toledo, Ohio municipal code that limited people to owning only one pit bull. The law relied on a state definition of a vicious dog as one that has bitten or killed a human, has killed another dog, or \"belongs to a breed that is commonly known as a Pit Bull dog.\" The court held that the legislation was void for violation of a Pit Bull owner's right to due process since the owner could not appeal a designation of his pet as a vicious dog. The court held that,\"Since we conclude that there is no evidence that pit bulls are inherently dangerous or vicious, then the city ordinance limitation on ownership is also arbitrary, unreasonable and discriminatory.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court of Ohio reversed the Court of Appeal (\"Toledo v. Tellings\", 114 Ohio St.3d 278, 2007-Ohio-3724), and reinstated the Toledo ordinance for the following reasons:\n\nMr. Tellings appealed the case to the Supreme Court of the United States, which declined to hear the case.\n\nIn \"City of Richardson v. Responsible Dog Owners of Texas\", 794 S.W.2d 17 (Tex. 1990), several people (\"Responsible Dog Owners\") sued the city of Richardson, Texas to prevent it from enforcing restrictions on pit bulls within its city limits on the grounds that the Texas state legislature had passed legislation preempting the a city's power to adopt an ordinance regulating the keeping of dogs. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the City, but the Texas Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's decision (781 S.W.2d 667). The Supreme Court of Texas reversed the Court of Appeals and upheld the original decision on the grounds that\nUnder article XI, section 5 of the Texas Constitution, home-rule cities have broad discretionary powers provided that no ordinance \"shall contain any provision inconsistent with the Constitution of the State, or of the general laws enacted by the Legislature of this State...\" Thus, the mere fact that the legislature has enacted a law addressing a subject does not mean that the subject matter is completely preempted...Although there is a small area of overlap in the provisions of the narrow statute and the broader ordinance, we hold that it is not fatal.\n\nIn the State of Texas, the State Health and Safety Code prohibits breed-specific legislation as stated\nSec. 822.047. LOCAL REGULATION OF DANGEROUS DOGS. A county or municipality may place additional requirements or restrictions on dangerous dogs if the requirements or restrictions:<br>\n(1) are not specific to one breed or several breeds of dogs; and<br>\n(2) are more stringent than restrictions provided by this subchapter.<br>\n<br>\nAdded by Acts 1991, 72nd Leg., ch. 916, Sec. 1, eff. September 1, 1991.\n\nIn \"McQueen v. Kittitas County\", 115 Wash. 672, 677 (1921), the Washington Supreme Court established the broadly accepted precedent that cities have the power to regulate dogs, even to the point of banning specific breeds.[D]ogs do not stand on the same plane as horses, cattle, sheep, and other domesticated animals...On the general question, it is the almost universal current of authority that dogs are a subject of the police power of the state, and their keeping subject to any kind of license or regulation, even to absolute prohibition...since dogs are a subject of the police power, we see no reason why the legislature may not make distinctions between breeds, sizes and the localities in which they may be kept. The object of the statute is protection. The purpose is to prevent injuries to persons and property by dogs. Any distinction founded upon reasons at least, is therefore valid...\"\n\nIn \"American Dog Owners Ass'n v. City of Yakima\", 777 P.2d 1046 (Wash.1989, \"en banc\"), the Washington Supreme Court reviewed a pit bull ban in Yakima, Washington. The dog owners asked a state court to prevent Yakima from enforcing its ban on pit bull dogs. The trial court issued a temporary injunction against the city and accepted motions for summary judgment from both the dog owners and the city. The court decided in favor of the city and lifted the injunction, whereupon the dog owners appealed to the Washington Supreme Court on the grounds that the ordinance was vague because a person of ordinary intelligence could not tell what was prohibited, and that the trial court had improperly decided the summary judgment in favor of the city.\n\nThe Washington Supreme Court ruled that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally vague because it specified the dog breeds that together fit the definition of \"pit bull\", whereas an earlier case in Massachusetts, \"American Dog Owners Ass'n, Inc. v. Lynn\", 404 Mass. 73, 533 N.E.2d 642 (1989), had resulted in the pit bull ban being annulled because the ordinance did not specify in sufficient detail what a \"pit bull\" was; in addition, the higher court ruled that the summary judgment had been properly awarded, thus upholding the Yakima pit bull ban.\n\nIn \"Dog Federation of Wisconsin, Inc. v. City of South Milwaukee\", 178 Wis.2d 353, 504 N.W.2d 375 (Wis.App.,1993), the Wisconsin Court of Appeals reviewed the appeal of a trial court decision upholding a pit bull ban in South Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Court of Appeals upheld the trial court on the following grounds:\n\nA number of other countries have breed-specific legislation on the books. The United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) restricts the ownership of pit-bull type dogs and other breeds. In May 2010, a pit-bull type dog named Lennox was impounded from his disabled owner and deemed to be a danger to the public by authorities in Belfast, Northern Ireland, under the Dangerous Dogs (NI) Order 1991. The impoundment and subsequent court order to destroy Lennox sparked a two-year-long legal battle and heated public relations campaign over the fate of the dog that included an international letter-writing and social media campaign; a petition signed by more than 214,000 people worldwide; street protests in Belfast, London, and New York City; public appeals from celebrities like the boxer Lennox Lewis and the First Minister of Northern Ireland Peter Robinson; and threatening letters and acts of violence directed at some of Belfast's dog wardens. Dog trainer and international television celebrity Victoria Stilwell campaigned to save Lennox's life, appealing to the Belfast City Council and Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Michelle O'Neill to allow her to re-home Lennox in the United States, where several rescue organizations had offered him sanctuary. All appeals, including Stilwell's were ignored by Belfast City Councillors, and Lennox was euthanised on July 11, 2012. Belfast City Council declined to return Lennox's body, his collar, or his ashes to his family.\n",
                "Dog fighting in the United States\n\nDog fighting in the United States is an activity in which fights between two game dogs are staged as a form of entertainment and gambling. Such activity has existed since the early 19th century in the United States and was gradually prohibited in all states. It continues as an underground activity in both rural and urban locations.\n\nIn the late 20th century, police and animal control law enforcement task forces of primarily local and state authorities were formed in many parts of the country to combat dog fighting rings to combat serious animal welfare violations with links to organized crime and social problems. In 2007, the U.S. Congress passed a Federal law against interstate dog fighting activities, providing for felony-level penalties including multi-year prison sentences and large fines for each offense; passage of this law was followed by the involvement of the Inspector General's Office of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in ongoing investigations around the country.\n\nIn April 2007, the illegal activity received widespread attention after evidence surfaced suggesting professional football player Michael Vick had a dog fighting ring operating on his property. The case resulted in guilty pleas by several individuals and to a single felony count for Vick, who received a 21-month federal sentence.\n\nAccording to a study by the Michigan State University College of Law published in 2005, in the United States, dog fighting was once completely legal and was sanctioned and promoted during the colonial period (17th century through 1776) and continuing through the Victorian era in the late 19th century. The early 19th century saw the development in England of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, first imported into the United States ca. 1817. Organized dog fighting became a part of American culture, and was promoted by the United Kennel Club. As the activity grew in popularity, so too did opposition to it. By the early 20th century the United Kennel Club dropped its support and by the 1960s most states had made it illegal. It was not until 1976 that it was outlawed in all states and even then, enforcement was generally lax.\nBy the late 20th century, as dog fighting became more popular in the poor areas of major U.S. cities, research and investigations revealed strong links with connected with street gangs and social ills, enforcement efforts increased.\n\nDespite legality issues, dogs are still commonly used for fighting purposes all across the continent. The American Pit Bull Terrier is the most popular breed used for fighting, but foreign breeds, such as the Dogo Argentino (used widely in South America), and to a lesser extent, the Presa Canario are also gaining popularity. The Dogo Argentino is now often seen in dog fight circuits in areas of the United States where the American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT) has been banned. In Miami-Dade County, Florida, where the APBT, American Staffordshire Terrier, and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier (or any other dog that substantially conforms to any of these breeds' characteristics) is banned, the Dogo Argentino has become the main fighting dog of choice, being used at both organized and street level dogfighting.\n\nIn the 21st century, dog fighting has become an objectionable and unlawful activity in most places broad categories, and each have motivated constituencies in many areas.\n\nDog fighting is often considered one of the most serious forms of animal abuse, not only for the violence that the dogs endure during and after the fights, but because they often suffer their entire lives. At least one major study alleges that the prevailing mind set among dog fighters is that, the more the dog suffers, the tougher he will become, and the better fighter he will therefore be. This position and the resulting treatment afforded the dogs stand in stark contrast with prevailing public values regarding the treatment of dogs in many civilized societies.\n\nIn addition to the controversial treatment a dog receives when he has potential as a fighter, according to a filing in U.S. District Court in Richmond by Federal investigators in Virginia, which was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act and published by the \"Baltimore Sun\" on July 6, 2007, a losing dog or one whose potential is considered unacceptable faces \"being put to death by drowning, strangulation, hanging, gun shot, electrocution or some other method\".\n\nDuring the furor arising around the Bad Newz Kennels investigation in Virginia in 2007 and revelations of extreme brutality there, even such diverse notables as hip-hop mogul Russell Simmons and the Reverend Al Sharpton joined with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and the Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) in calling for strong stands against animal cruelty, jointly stating:\n\nIn addition to the fate which awaits fighters or even dogs likely to become fighters, often \"bait\" animals are used to test a dog's fighting instinct. With the use of \"Adoption Wanted\" or \"Good Home Needed\" posters to track their \"bait\" which is used in the training for these \"fighters\". The \"bait\" is mauled or killed in the process. Often \"bait\" animals are stolen pets, as officials with the Sheriff's Department in Pima County, Arizona say they were shocked to discover a few years ago, according to a story by \"National Geographic News\". According to news reports compiled by the National Humane Society, the snouts of bait dogs are wrapped with duct tape to prevent them from injuring dogs being trained for fighting. Some bait animals have been recovered with their teeth ground down to the gums to render them helpless against fighting dogs. Other animals, such as cats and rabbits are also reported to be used as \"bait\" for fighting dogs. Experts have said small dogs, kittens, and rabbits are more at risk of being stolen for bait than larger animals.\n\n\"National Geographic\" noted that there are no statistics on how many pets are taken and used as bait by dog fighting rings each year. Patricia Wagner, head of the National Illegal Animal Fighting Task Force for the Humane Society of the United States, offered the statement \"I think every state has a problem with it, whether they know it or not.\"\n\nAfter a life of training as a fighting dog, if a dog does not suffer its death while in such service, it is often euthanized. In Richmond, Virginia, when a dog fighter was sentenced in June 2007, it was revealed in court that over a dozen of his dogs had to be euthanized, either because of serious illness, injury or malnutrition, or because their training as fighting dogs made them too dangerous for adoption. Until 2006, the man had kept 16 pit bulls in the backyard of his house, confined with heavy chains used for automobile towing. Experts say chaining the animals is a dogfighting technique for building strength. When an animal control officer arrived in response to a complaint from a neighbor that one of the dogs had died, he found the dead dog in a trash can. The others had no food, no clean water and no adequate shelter. Jody Jones, program manager of Richmond Animal Care and Control, said in court that the case produced more dogs euthanized than any other case she knows of from her 15-year career in animal control.\n\nFollowing the seizure of a large number of dogs in an April 2007 dog fighting case in Mississippi, Tara High, executive director of the Humane Society of South Mississippi said \"The reality is that they've been used for entertainment. It's quite tragic for those of us that are kind of left to deal with it and the reality that these animals aren't going to be able to be rehabilitated,\" she said. Ms. High compared the animals to \"a loaded weapon. And not something we feel very comfortable letting out into the community.\"\n\nFor many years, even after it was outlawed, dog fighting was considered an isolated animal welfare issue, and as such was ignored, denied, or disregarded by law enforcement agencies. However, it has now been established that the dog fighting culture is often intimately connected to other criminal activity, with dog fighters frequently involved in organized crime, racketeering, drug distribution, or gangs, and dog fighting events often facilitating gambling and drug trafficking.\n\nAccording to the aforementioned Michigan State study,\nDog fighting is unlawful in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. Before the Federal law was passed, New York already had issued felony penalties up to four years to individuals fighting any types of animals, but some other levels of participation were only misdemeanor offenses. The state of New York considers attending an animal fight to be merely a violation, which ultimately leads to a fine. States surrounding New York like New Jersey and Connecticut passed a bill, stated that attendance at an animal fight is indeed a felony charge. Due to a loophole it is legal in 49 out of 50 states to possess dogs for fighting. The Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act closed the loophole that allowed people to knowingly attend dogfighting events.\n\nIn all states, it is against the law (and often a felony) even to attend a dog fighting event, regardless of direct participation. According to authorities, dog fighting is increasingly practiced by gangs, and is linked to other unlawful activities, such as illegal gambling. On February 7, 2014 President Obama signed the Farm Bill which contained the U.S. H.R. 366/S. 666—Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act. \"The final bill includes a provision making it a federal crime to attend or bring a child under the age of 16 to an animal fighting event[.]\" \"The Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act would make it a federal offense to knowingly attend an organized animal fight and would impose additional penalties for bringing children to animal fights. Violators would face up to one year in prison for attending a fight, and up to three years in prison for bringing a minor to a fight.\" \n\nEven though it is illegal, dog fighting still occurs across the globe. To combat dog fighting and curb ownership of \"dangerous dogs,\" Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) has been passed in some countries, as well as in some local and regional jurisdictions. However, opponents argue that BSL affects responsible pet owners more than those who keep dogs for fighting purposes.Even though Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) is to keep tough dogs out of some states, many people have had problems with it and have started Petitions and held events to get rid of it.\n\nIn May 2007, a new Federal law went into effect making interstate dog fighting activities felonious and providing for imprisonment and imposition of large fines. The Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act, a new Federal law sponsored by US Senators Arlen Specter (D-PA.), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA.), and John Ensign (R-NV.), was enacted by the U.S. Congress earlier in 2007 and signed by President George W. Bush on May 3, making organizing a dog fight a felony. The law provides a penalty of up to three years of imprisonment and up to a $250,000 fine for each offense of interstate or foreign transport of animals for fighting purposes. Using the provisions of the new law, which took effect immediately, the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is pursuing cases in a number of locations around the country with considerable support from humane societies and local police departments.\n\nThe United States Humane Society estimates that more than 40,000 people across the country buy and sell fighting dogs and are involved in dogfighting activities. But authorities say those in dogfighting circles also are involved in a number of other crimes, including narcotics trafficking, illegal gambling and murder.\n\nIn August 2006, a suspected dog fighter in Texas bled to death after he was shot by intruders who apparently intended to torture him into revealing where he had hidden $100,000 wagered in a high-stakes dog match.\n\nThe \"Chicago Sun-Times\" reported that an analysis during a study by the College of Law at Michigan State University found that, in more than two dozen raids on dogfights, in virtually every instance police also seized illegal narcotics and weapons. Police seized $250,000 in cash during another 2004 raid in Covington, Georgia. \"Law enforcement is realizing it's a real community problem, intertwined with other crimes such as drugs and gambling,\" John Goodwin, an official with the Humane Society stated in an interview for the Norfolk \"Virginian-Pilot\" newspaper published in June 2007.\n\nMany communities in widespread areas across the United States are aggressively targeting dog fighting by coordinating local and regional dog fighting task forces. \"It's clear that when you have dogfighting, drugs and gambling and other criminal subcultures follow,\" according to Mark Plowden, a spokesman for the South Carolina Attorney General's Office, which in 2004 created a dogfighting task force. In Chicago, Illinois, a special police unit is devoted to investigating cases of abuse due to the connection between dog fighting and other gang crimes. In 2005, the police in Los Angeles, California formed an Animal Cruelty Task Force, leading to prosecutions of gang members there for animal abuse.\n\nAmong those linked to dog fighting is LeShon Johnson, former NFL running back, received a five-year deferred sentence in 2005 after officials seized 200 dogs during a raid of his dog fighting operation that led to 20 people being convicted in Oklahoma. Former National Basketball Association forward Qyntel Woods, pleaded guilty to animal abuse in 2005 at his home in Portland, Oregon. Former Dallas Cowboys lineman Nate Newton was arrested at a dogfight in Texas, although charges were later dropped.\n\nCurrently, NFL quarterback Michael Vick is linked to property in southeastern Virginia where authorities believe a multi-state dog fighting operation was based. In an interview with WAVY-TV, Portsmouth, Virginia, Washington Redskins running back Clinton Portis and a teammate, offensive tackle Chris Samuels, defended Vick. Portis said that if Vick is charged and convicted of dog fighting, \"then you're putting him behind bars for no reason. I don't know if he was fighting dogs or not, but it's his property. It's his dog. If that's what he wants to do, do it.\" Those comments were sharply criticized by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The Redskins and Portis himself later apologized, stating that his controversial remarks about dog fighting were insensitive and that he now realizes he \"shouldn't have made the comments.\" He added, \"At that time I had no idea the love people have for animals, and I didn't consider it when I made those comments.\"\nNew York Animal Control Officer Kleinfelder says, \"For pro athletes, it's not about the money... Instead of boxers just beating up on each other, they want to see it go to the death, and with dogs they can let it go that far. To them, dogs are expendable.\"\n\nRhonda Evans is a sociologist and associate professor in the department of criminal justice at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette who has published four academic articles on dog fighting. She stated in a story published by the \"Palm Beach Post\" that she had found that owners of high-dollar fighting dogs spanned all walks of life and social classes, with a common link of \"a machismo mentality.\" Evans said \"For them, tough dogs are a symbol of manhood... and by winning, the dogs build up their owners' ego. They see it as a valid, legitimate sport that is no worse than boxing or football.\"\n\nRap and other urban music also seem to glorify dog fighting. Jay-Z shows dogs being prepared for a fight in the uncensored version of his music video, \"99 Problems\". A powerful-looking pit bull is on the cover of a CD by rapper DMX that is titled \"Grand Champ\". \"Grand Champ\" is said to be a reference to a dog that has won five dogfights.\n\nMadison Avenue advertising firms have capitalized on the same theme. When Nike was criticized about an ad featuring a growling pit bull and Rottweiler about to face off, the company denied the ad encourages dog fighting. The representative went on to state, however, \"People have to understand the youth culture we cater to. Our market is the urban, edgy, hip-hop culture.\"\n\nInternational Boxing Federation Champion Steve Cunningham: \"Dogs are truly Man's best friend. Yet some people take advantage of their loyalty by forcing them into dog fighting. It's disgusting and a heinous thing to do. It must be stopped. So join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting.\"\n\nMixed Martial Arts Champion Tito Ortiz: \"Animal abuse happens every day in the form of dog fighting. It's cruel, inhumane, and it needs to be stopped. Show your strength and join me, Tito Ortiz, The Huntington Beach Bad Boy, in Knocking Out Dog Fighting.\"\n\nMixed Martial Arts Champion Andrei Arlovski: \"The pit bull has a long history in America. In the early 1900s the U.S. proudly used pit bulls on WWI posters to symbolize qualities that make up America - friendly, courageous, hard working and worthy of respect. I chose my name because I admire the breed for the same reasons. When I hear about pit bulls being used in dog fighting, it makes me angry. I have a choice to step into the cage to fight, but these dogs have no choice. Dog fighting is morally wrong and inhumane. In my opinion it's torture. Please join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting.\"\n\nMixed Martial Arts Champion Cung Le: \"Dog fighting is cruel and inhumane and those who engage in it are losers. Show your strength and join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting.\"\n\nMixed Martial Arts Champion Josh Thomson: \"Torturing or abusing animals is not cool nor is it a sign of strength. Real fighters stand up for what is right to protect those less able to do so. Show your strength and join me in Knocking Out Dog Fighting.\"\n\nMixed Martial Arts Champion Rob McCullough: \"I choose to fight, but a lot of dogs don't get that choice. Knock Out Dog Fighting...cuz dog fighting is not cool.\"\n\nIn recent times, a combination of animal rights groups and law enforcement agencies have drawn new attention to dog fighting and related criminal activities in the United States. A story in the New York \"Daily News\" published on June 10, 2007, stated \"dog fighting is a multi-million-dollar industry that is part of an underground subculture that holds its events in secret locations. It is extremely difficult for authorities to prove who has dogs for fighting purposes.\" A few weeks later, in Buffalo, New York, police and animal control officers at the City of Buffalo Animal Shelter rescued 15 pit bulls believed to be part of dogfighting activities during a two-week period. Authorities found pit bulls — dead and alive — as well as \"dogfighting kits\", which include harnesses, muzzles, pre-fight training guides, stacks of breeding papers, and even videos on dogfighting. \"We have been back to the same house three different times, and each time we pull out more and more dogs,\" said Animal Control Officer Andrew Kleinfelder. \"Even when someone is arrested, a normal pit bull fighting ring has at least 30 people involved. Someone keeps the fights going.\"\n\nRecently, longer sentences have resulted in some dog fighting-related cases. In South Carolina, David Tant, breeder of fighting dogs, is serving a 30-year sentence, among the stiffest ever imposed for the crime. Tant, 63, formerly of the Charleston area, pleaded guilty in November 2004 to more than 40 counts of illegally breeding fighting dogs, and one assault count connected to a surveyor who was wounded by a booby trap after he wandered onto Tant’s property in southern Charleston County. The surveyor was showered by an explosion of birdshot, injuring him slightly. The device was described as a \"directional mine\" meant to ward off intruders. \"Fat Bill\" Reynolds of Henry County, Virginia near Martinsville, publisher of \"American Gamedog Times\", a dog fighting magazine with an Internet website, was convicted in 2001 of transmitting images of fighting dogs across state lines and sentenced to 30 months in prison.\n\nIn March 2007, a combined Federal, state and local law enforcement team disrupted a large dog fighting network in Dayton, Ohio which was operating in Ohio, Kentucky, and Michigan. The investigation of the operation based in Montgomery County, Ohio had lasted a year. More than two dozen arrests were made and more than 60 dogs were seized. In May, 7 persons in Ohio submitted guilty pleas to state charges. Sentencing was pending at the time of a USDA news release in June 2007.\n\nOn April 24, authorities in Pass Christian, Mississippi raided a large dog fighting training compound owned by Maxwell Landry. According to several news stories on local television station WLOX, 17 persons were arrested and fighting dogs from Louisiana, crack cocaine and several other illicit drugs were found at the scene and confiscated. 44 pit bulls were seized. Landry once lived in Chalmette, Louisiana. After the area was damaged as a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, he moved to the Harrison County, Mississippi site, located about north of Interstate 10. Federal agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) discovered the dogs and the training compound during aerial surveillance relating to an investigation of drug trafficking.\n\nMembers of the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals came to help take care of the dogs. Property owner Landry was one of 14 people named in a Federal drug trafficking indictment involving activity between Mississippi, Louisiana and South Carolina. He faces to 43 counts of illegal dog fighting in Harrison County.\n\nJohn Wesley Black and Constance Jean Courtney could spend a minimum of one year in prison per illegal dog fighting charge, and are linked to two dog fighting allegations. Courtney was employed as a veterinarian's assistant. According to Harrison County Prosecutor Herman Cox, Landry has confessed to investigators that he made about $5,000 a month fighting his dogs against other dogs.\n\nOn April 25, 2007, an investigation began in Virginia after evidence of a dog fighting ring turned up during a narcotics search of a home and property owned by Michael Vick, a professional football player with the Atlanta Falcons of the NFL and a dog breeder. The property is located in southeastern Surry County a few miles northwest of the Isle of Wight County town of Smithfield. The original search began following several narcotics arrests of 26-year-old Davon T. Boddie, Vick's cousin and cook, who had given authorities the address of Vick's property at 1915 Moonlight Road, Surry, Virginia as his home address when he was arrested.\n\nThe investigation eventually involved local, state and Federal authorities. In late April, Vick told \"The Atlanta Journal-Constitution\" \"I'm never at the house…I left the house with my family…They just haven't been doing the right thing…It's unfortunate I have to take the heat behind it. If I'm not there, I don't know what's going on.\"\n\nOn July 2, agents of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) filed court documents describing a five-year operation of an interstate dog fighting ring which called itself \"Bad Newz Kennels\" and had been based at Vick's property. No one was named individually in the July 2 court papers. WAVY-TV (Portsmouth, Virginia) posted a copy of one of the Federal court document from July 2, and has made it available online.\n\nOn July 17, Vick and three men described as his employees were indicted by a Federal grand jury for \"conspiracy to travel in interstate commerce in aid of unlawful activities and to sponsor a dog in animal fighting venture\". They faced $350,000 in fines and six years in prison if convicted of the Federal felony and misdemeanor charges.\n\nDetails in the indictments describing extreme acts of brutality against losing and under-performing dogs included executions by electrocution, hanging, drowning, shooting, and blunt force resulted in widespread public protests and calls for Vick's removal from NFL play pending resolution by a diverse spectrum of notable persons and public officials. On July 23, Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended him for an indefinite period pending investigation of possible violations of the league's Personal Conduct Policy. Atlanta Falcons team owner Arthur Blank stated that Vick should give up thoughts of playing until the case is resolved.\n\nAn arraignment and detention hearing was held on July 26 in U.S. District Court in Richmond. A trial date was set for November 26, and all four defendants were released without bond, but under the direct supervision of the court and under certain conditions. Federal prosecutors stated they would file a superseded indictment in August, which could have included additional charges and/or defendants. According to the Code of Virginia at the time, various violations of the Virginia laws involving dog fighting and cruelty to companion animals were considered class 6 felony crimes, each carrying a fine and 1 to 5 years in prison per offense. Over fifty dogs were seized, in addition to carcasses recovered during several searches of Vick's property.\n\nOn August 24, Vick plead guilty. He joined three others who had also plead guilty earlier to similar charges. The four faced up to five years in prison, fines of up to $250,000 and restitution. Each received sentences ranging from 60 days to 23 months.\n\nIn June 2007, a circuit court judge in Richmond, Virginia imposed a four-year prison sentence and $20,000 in fines on 40-year-old Stacey A. Miller, an Army veteran and convicted dog fighter. The \"Richmond Times-Dispatch\" reported that Miller was convicted in January by a jury of felony dogfighting, two counts of felony animal cruelty, a dozen counts of misdemeanor animal cruelty and two counts of possessing steroids. The jury recommended the four-year sentence and $20,000 in fines that the judge imposed. Miller also was ordered to pay Richmond Animal Care and Control $26,205.29 in restitution for the cost of caring for the 15 American pit bull terriers that were seized from him in February 2006, 12 of which had to be euthanized.\n\nOn July 13, 2007, police in a suburb of Chicago, Illinois rescued 37 fighting dogs from a heavily insulated and ventilated old chicken coop behind a house in the village of South Holland. At a news conference, Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart stated that it was \"the largest seizure of fighting dogs in state history.\"\n\nAccording to the \"Chicago Tribune\", an investigation began in May after police were informed that fighting dogs were being bred and raised at the home. Two workers for an animal shelter said that they had tipped off police. Officials close to the investigation confirmed their role. Neighbors told the news media that they had also called police to complain about barking from the barn and what was described as \"a stench\" by several. One neighbor said that he had called police several months ago after seeing a dog chained in the yard on a hot day without water. Another neighbor who lives across the street told reporters that he began seeing police in unmarked cars watching the home several weeks earlier, and one investigator had interviewed him about a week before the raid. The \"Tribune\" reported that the neighbor said that he told the investigator \"...the place was like a gas station, people coming and going constantly at night...I thought maybe he was dealing drugs.\"\n\nExecuting a warrant, a team formed by the Cook County sheriff's police special operations unit, Cook County animal control, and the South Holland Police Department entered the property and the soundproofed barn, seizing the dogs and evidence. They also found a boa constrictor snake and a substance suspected of being crack cocaine inside of the home, according to a WLS-TV (Chicago) news report.\n\nThe \"Chicago Sun-Times\" reported that the site had \"all the makings of a sophisticated and professional dog fighting operation.\" It was noted that treadmills and weights were nearby for building strength, while a female dog was kept in a separate room where breeding was done. Drugs used to make them stronger and fight harder were also found. One of the dogs, larger than the pit bulls and described as \"urine-soaked\" with its hair falling out, was thought to be a \"bait dog\" used in training others.\n\nWBBM radio news reported that the dogs seized in the raid ranged from weeks-old puppies to older dogs, some of whom suffered from physical injuries. Officers wore industrial masks Friday as they rescued the dogs, which were kept in pet transport carriers in the barn and positioned in a way that restricted sunlight. Several of the carriers had bite marks around their openings. Dart described the conditions inside the barn as horrible. \"It's very difficult to breathe inside,\" he said. \"The smell is overwhelming, and the conditions are deplorable.\"\n\nSheriff Dart said it was clear that the 29-year-old homeowner was an active ringleader on the dog-fighting circuit, breeding fighting dogs while renting out others for matches and raking in hundreds of dollars each time. Kevin Taylor was known to authorities. He has two prior convictions related to dog fighting, including cruelty to animals. He was convicted On June 15, 2007 in Livingston County after being arrested for attending dog fights near Pontiac in September 2005. According to news reports, a Livingston County jury convicted Taylor on a Class C misdemeanor charge. He paid a fine of $1,275 and spent six days in jail, a total that counts his initial arrest and subsequent arrests on bench warrants after he failed to show for court dates.\n\nOn July 14, Taylor was charged with 37 misdemeanor counts of cruelty to animals, a felony count of possession of a controlled substance, a felony count of dog-fighting and two other misdemeanor charges, one count each of possession of dogs by a felon and owning sport fighting dogs. Sheriff Dart said that although Taylor is thought to have bred and trained the dogs to sell or rent there, evidence did not indicate that any dogfights took place at the South Holland location. On July 16, Cook County Circuit Judge Camille Willis set Taylor's bond at $100,000.\n\nOn July 19, 2007, U.S. Senator Robert Byrd, 89, of West Virginia, a well-known dog lover, gave a passionate speech in the U.S. Congress about the practice of dog fighting in response to the indictment of football player Michael Vick. Senator Byrd stated:\n\nThe following day, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts said he had sent a letter to the NFL commissioner calling for Vick's immediate suspension. Kerry wrote to Commissioner Roger Goodell:\n\nKerry, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, also said he planned to introduce anti-dogfighting legislation. According to his office, Senator Kerry's proposal would make it illegal to transmit images of dogfighting, to run Web sites that cater to dogfighting, and to own or train dogs for the purpose of fighting under Federal laws.\n\n\n\n\n"

                "Nothing Records\n\nNothing Records was an American record label specializing in industrial rock and electronic music, founded by John Malm Jr. and Trent Reznor in 1992. It is considered an example of a vanity label, where an artist is able to run a label with some degree of independence from within a larger parent company—in this case, Interscope Records was the parent company.\n\nNothing Records became largely defunct in 2004 due to a lawsuit by Reznor against John Malm. The label became inactive as a whole following several further releases—the \"Beside You in Time\" (February 2007) home video was the label's final release.\n\nNothing Records is most famous for its two original signings, Trent Reznor's own band Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson.\n\nStill, the label gained semi-iconic status within the industrial rock scene, and even acquired its own online-fanzine in \"Sick Among the Pure\", although this later became a more general industrial fanzine, and ceased to exist at all in 2005. The Nothing label would often reward its fanbase over the Internet — one form of this outreach was Radio Nothing: an exclusive collection of free MP3 music streams, compiled by Nothing label artists, producers and fans.\n\nIn September 2004, coinciding with Trent Reznor leaving New Orleans for the west coast, the Nine Inch Nails website announced \"nothing studios: 1994-2004\", suggesting that Nothing Studios was closed. This later proved to be the end of the associated record label as well. Speculation among listeners that the label could continue ceased when Reznor successfully sued co-founder John Malm for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty (amongst others), ensuring that the Nothing era was over.\n\nIn a May 5, 2005 post to nin.com, Trent wrote, \"To be clear: my involvement with Nothing Records is over. Is Nothing Records alive or an entity? You'd have to ask John Malm (we're not really speaking that much these days)... Nothing studios is still in New Orleans and I'm not sure what I'll do with it. I'll figure that out when I finish touring.\"\n\nWhile \"With Teeth\" and its following singles carry the Nothing Records logo, Reznor has publicly stated that this was at the insistence of John Malm.\n\n\"Beside You In Time\" (February 2007) was the last release to carry the Nothing Records logo on its packaging. The logo also appears in the end credits.\n\n\"Year Zero\" (April 2007) and its single \"Survivalism\" do not carry the Nothing logo.\n\nSince early 2004, the official website, NothingRecords.com, has closed down.\n\nIn addition to Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, the label also signed and released albums from 2wo, Pig, Pop Will Eat Itself, Prick, 12 Rounds, Einstürzende Neubauten, The The, and Meat Beat Manifesto. Additionally, Coil was under contract for a record but it was never delivered (though some of the songs from the slated Nothing album appeared in reworked form on \"The Ape of Naples\" and \"The New Backwards\"). John Bergin was also signed briefly under the name Trust Obey, but the album he recorded (\"Hands of Ash\") was instead released in 1996 on Fifth Colvmn Records with a sticker that quoted Reznor's reaction to the completed work: \"Not a great commercial potential.\"\n\nNothing also distributed music from Warp Records, Sheffield, England's venerable electronic music label, under an exclusive license in the U.S., with albums by Autechre, Plaid, and Squarepusher (although Warp's Aphex Twin appeared on the \"Further Down the Spiral\" release, he was already under a contract with Sire Records in the U.S. at the time). This distribution deal ended when Warp expanded operations into the U.S. market in 2001. Nothing also managed to secure the U.S. release of two albums from England's Blue Planet Recordings. The two albums were slightly different than the UK releases. Plug's \"Drum and Bass for Papa\" included an extra disc of tracks from earlier EPs, and The Bowling Green's \"One Pound Note\" omitted one track from the UK release due to problems with sample clearance.\n\nNothing Records was founded by Trent Reznor and his former manager John Malm Jr. in 1992. Amid pressure from Nine Inch Nails' then-label TVT to produce a follow-up to \"Pretty Hate Machine\", Reznor began to feel the label was hindering his control of the band and requested to terminate their contract, to which they ignored his plea. In response, Reznor secretly began recording under various pseudonyms to avoid record company interference. TVT ultimately put together a deal with Interscope Records (then part of Atlantic Records), in which they would still retain some financial stake, while Reznor worked creatively under a new label. However, Interscope President Jimmy Iovine looked to allow him more creative freedom. Reznor stated:\n\nPart of the deal included allowing Reznor the run his own boutique label under the Interscope umbrella, which became Nothing Records. Reznor and Malm began a series of signings to the label, which included the likes of Marilyn Manson, Coil, Prick, Trust Obey, Pop Will Eat Itself and Mondo Vanilli. Reznor stated of the label, \"The whole thing I want to do right now is provide a shell to other bands where they can have the benefit of a major label without being fucked with creatively in any way. Let them do what they want to do, make them aware of the business side of things how the money is spent.\" The label would go on to set up offices in Cleveland, Ohio and New York City, New York, with a recording studio in New Orleans, Louisiana.\n\nThe first release bearing the label's name was Nine Inch Nails' \"Broken\" EP. Released September 22, 1992, the EP marked their major label debut and consisted entirely of new material, departing from the electronica and synthpop style of \"Pretty Hate Machine\" and instead presenting a considerably heavier sound, which would act as a precursor for Nine Inch Nails' acclaimed second studio album, \"The Downward Spiral\". The EP originally included a bonus 3\" CD or 7\" vinyl, depending which format was purchased, featuring two bonus songs; \"Physical,\" a cover of an Adam and the Ants song and \"Suck,\" a reworked version of a song Trent originally recorded with Pigface. Later pressings of the release merged these tracks as a single release, although a 2017 vinyl repress by the band once again pressed them as a separate 7\".\n\nThe Broken film accompanied the EP, directed by Coil's Peter Christopherson. Reznor recalled, “Making the \"Broken\" movie was a lot of fun. There was no label involvement or pressure from anyone, it was just he (Christopherson) and I talking.. At the completion of filming, Christopherson felt the footage was so realistic, he informed Reznor, “I'm going to send it to you, but it's going to show up in a paper bag unmarked because there could be... I'm not sure I want the authorities knowing this came from me.\" After reviewing the film, Reznor stated, “It felt like we'd crossed over into territory that was perhaps too far. And to be honest, at that point I was living in the Sharon Tate house recording \"The Downward Spiral\". Anyway, that's where I was living when this package turned up, and I thought, 'Enough. I don't know that I need this kind of thing.' With the house it felt too stunty, and Peter agreed.\"\n\nFive of the eight total tracks were edited down into music videos, were widely censored from television airplay, due to their disturbing content. The complete, uncensored film was never officially released, however it was leaked as a bootleg, which became heavily traded on VHS in the 1990s and later became widely available via the Internet. \"We shelved it, but little did we know that the Internet would come into existence, and it would find its home on there,\" stated Reznor. Most of the film's content was later included on the release of the band's 1997 VHS \"Closure\". In 2006, an unofficial version of the film was released on a DVD disc image and distributed via BitTorrent at The Pirate Bay by an anonymous user called \"seed0,\" who also uploaded a DVD version of \"Closure\". The DVD image represented a significant upgrade in visual and audio quality from previous bootlegs and included the video for \"Help Me I Am in Hell.\" It is widely believed by fans that Reznor himself was behind the 2006 leaks, as implied by a post on his official blog: \"12/21/06 : Happy Holidays! This one is a guilt-free download. (shhhh - I didn't say that out loud). If you know what I'm talking about, cool.\"\n\nContributing to the band's growing mainstream success, the EP sold well upon release, peaking at number 7 on the \"Billboard\" 200 charts and eventually going platinum \"Wish\" won the 1993 Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance, as did \"Happiness in Slavery\" (live performance at Woodstock '94) in 1996. Despite their increasing commercial success, Trent opted against touring in support of the EP, choosing instead to remain at work in the studio.\n\nA companion remix EP, \"Fixed\", was released on December 7, 1992 and featured remixes from the band, as well as J. G. Thirlwell of Foetus, Butch Vig of Garbage and future Nothing label-mates Coil. An additional Butch Vig remix of \"Last\" was omitted from the EP, although the outro can be heard on \"Throw This Away.\" The complete Vig remix circulated on the Internet as a bootleg file, until Reznor finally released it at remix.nin.com. Vig later addressed the reason for its omission, stating \"I started recording a lot of new parts, and took it in a much different direction. When it was finished, Trent thought the front part of the mix didn't fit the EP, so he just used the ending. I'm glad it's on his website. Duke and Steve worked with me on the remix, in the very early days of Garbage.\"\n\nAfter \"Broken\", Reznor began recording Nine Inch Nails' full-length debut for the Nothing / Interscope Records, the seminal sophomore album, \"The Downward Spiral\". For the recording of \"Broken\", Reznor had moved into 10050 Cielo Drive in Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles, where actress Sharon Tate was murdered by members of the Manson Family. He named the home studio \"Le Pig,\" in reference to a message once scrawled in blood on the front door of the residence by Manson Family member Susan Atkins. Reznor would record \"The Downward Spiral\" at Le Pig, co-producing it with Flood. The recordings were inspired by concept albums such as David Bowie's \"Low\" and Pink Floyd's \"The Wall\". Guitarist Richard Patrick had left the band after touring completed for \"Pretty Hate Machine\", moving on to form his own band, Filter. Adrian Belew would take over guitar duties for much of the album, while Robin Finck would become the full-time guitarist for the band.\n\nThe first single from the album, \"March of the Pigs,\" was released on February 25, 1994. The single featured remixes by Dave Ogilvie, as well as an exclusive instrumental, entitled \"A Violet Fluid\". A pair of music videos for the song were also shot. The first version was ultimately scrapped, while the second and final version was directed by Coil's Peter Christopherson. Portions of the original, incomplete video eventually surfaced as part of an online, DVD disc image version of the \"Closure\" DVD in 2006, which surfaced on BitTorrent website The Pirate Bay.\n\n\"The Downward Spiral\" was released on March 8, 1994. The album was an immediate success, debuting at number two on the US \"Billboard\" 200 with sales of nearly 119,000 copies in its first week. It also garnered wide, critical acclaim, helping elevate Nine Inch Nails into one of the most successful rock acts of the 1990s. \"Closer\" became the second single for the album, released on May 30, 1994. The single included remixes from Nothing Records acts Coil and Meat Beat Manifesto, as well as an exclusive cover of Soft Cell's \"Memorabilia.\" A music video for \"Closer\" was directed by Mark Romanek. Despite undergoing heavy censorship for television and radio airplay, the song received major airplay, becoming one of the biggest hits of NIN's career. The uncensored version of the music video was eventually released in 1997 on the band's \"Closure\" home video. \"Piggy\" and \"Hurt\" were both released as promotional singles to radio and received regular airplay. Nine Inch Nails also recorded a pair of exclusive songs for soundtracks. A cover of Joy Division's \"Dead Souls was released on the soundtrack to \"The Crow\", while an original track, \"Burn,\" was recorded for the \"Natural Born Killers\" soundtrack. The latter also filmed a music video and the soundtrack was released on Nothing Records. A remix of \"Closer\" was also used in the opening credits to the David Fincher film \"Seven\".\n\nThe album was promoted with the extensive Self Destruct Tour, which featured opening Nothing Records acts Marilyn Manson, Pop Will Eat Itself and Pig during various legs. Danny Lohner would join the band as full-time bassist for the tour. The tour included a set at Woodstock '94, which was broadcast on pay-per-view and featured the band performing while covered in mud. The performance went on to become one of the most famous of the band's career. In 1995, Nine Inch Nails embarked on a tour with David Bowie, with Nothing Records act Prick supporting as guest openers.\n\nA companion remix album, \"Further Down the Spiral\", was released in on June 1, 1995, which once again included contributions from Nothing act Coil, as well as Rick Rubin, J. G. Thirlwell and some original interludes by Aphex Twin. The album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on June 26, 1996, denoting sales in excess of 500,000 copies in the US.\n\nNine Inch Nails released the double VHS collection \"Closure\" on November 25, 1997. The first half documented the Self-Destruct Tour, while the second half compiled all of the band's music videos to that point. A DVD release was planned at one point, but never came to fruition. Instead, in 2006, an unofficial version was released on a DVD disc image and distributed via BitTorrent at The Pirate Bay by an anonymous user called \"seed0.\" It is widely believed by fans that Reznor himself was behind the 2006 leaks, as implied by a post on his official blog: \"12/21/06 : Happy Holidays! This one is a guilt-free download. (shhhh - I didn't say that out loud). If you know what I'm talking about, cool.\" As the title suggests, \"Closure\" marked the conclusion of \"The Downward Spiral\" era for the band.\n\nA landmark release for the band, \"The Downward Spiral\" established Nine Inch Nails as a reputable force in the 1990s music scene, with its sound being widely imitated and Reznor receiving media hype and multiple honors. As of 2011, it was certified quadruple platinum and had sold 3.7 million copies in the United States. \"The Downward Spiral\" has been regarded by music critics and audiences as one of the most important albums of the 1990s and was praised for its abrasive, eclectic nature and dark themes, although it was scrutinized by social conservatives for its lyrics. For its tenth anniversary, the album was remastered and re-released on November 23, 2004 in high-resolution Super Audio CD (SACD) and DualDisc formats, with a second disc collecting many b-sides and rarities. In 2017, the band reissued the album on vinyl.\n\nIn the months following the momentum of\"The Downward Spiral\", the next release from the label came from Marilyn Manson. One of the earliest signings to the label, Marilyn Manson, real name Brian Warner, first met Reznor in 1990, while enrolled as a student at Broward Community College in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Warner was working towards a degree in journalism and gaining experience in the field by writing articles for a music magazine, \"25th Parallel\". One of his interviews for the magazine was with Reznor. Manson also performed as a local opener for Nine Inch Nails in July 1990 with his band, then known as Marilyn Manson and The Spooky Kids, at Club Nu in Ft. Lauderdale, FL (a show which also included future Nothing Records act Meat Beat Manifesto). Manson wound up giving Reznor a tape of his material.\n\nUpon forming the Nothing Records imprint, Reznor called Manson and offered to sign him to the label, alongside an opening slot supporting Nine Inch Nails on their upcoming \"Self Destruct Tour\". At the time, Manson's band had been fielding offers from numerous record companies, including Madonna's Maverick label. Given the promise of total artistic freedom, the band opted to sign to Nothing Records.\n\nRecording sessions for their debut studio album began in July 1993 with Swans producer Roli Mosimann at Criteria Studios in Miami, Florida. Recording a selection of new songs, along with material from their Spooky Kids repertoire, the first version of their debut, titled \"The Manson Family Album\", was completed by the end of September. However, it was not well received. The band's members, along with Reznor, felt Mosimann's production was flat, lifeless and poorly representative of the band's live performances. Seeking a more raw sound, Reznor agreed to rework production of \"The Manson Family Album\" in October 1993 at Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. After seven weeks of mixing and re-recording, the album, retitled \"Portrait of an American Family\", was presented to Nothing's parent label Interscope. The song \"Filth\" was dropped from the revised album, while the songs \"Prelude (The Family Trip)\" and \"Wrapped In Plastic\" were added. The song \"Citronella\" was renamed \"Dogma\". Several other minor musical and lyrical differences exist throughout the two versions, such as fewer Charles Manson samples being included in the song \"My Monkey\".\n\nUpon delivery of the album, Interscope was receiving a lot of negative press for the content of artists on another label they were housing at the time, Death Row Records, and expressed some reservations about releasing the album, which they anticipated could be controversial. Reznor threatened to take the album to another label if necessary, at which time Interscope agreed to release it, on the condition that the band remove some photos from the album sleeve. The album's original cover art featured no text, simply a painting of a clown by John Wayne Gacy (the Gacy painting was later used as album art by the band Acid Bath for the album \"When the Kite String Pops\" in 1994). The sleeve photography included Polaroid pictures (faked by Manson and friends) of a mutilated female body, and a photo of what Manson described as \"one of those dolls from the 60s and you pull a string on the back of it and the eyes get really big and they change colors.\" Manson also intended to use a picture of himself as a child sitting nude on a couch in the album's interior artwork. Though no genitalia was shown in the picture and it was taken by his own parents with no vulgar intent, the record label feared it would be misunderstood as child pornography. The ideas of using the Gacy artwork and the nude photos were ultimately dropped and, after a few months delay, the album was released on Nothing Records on July 19, 1994 and peaked at number thirty-five on \"Billboard\"s Top Heatseekers album chart, establishing the band as rising stars and a commercial success.\n\nOriginally, their song \"Snake Eyes And Sissies\" from Mosimann's \"The Manson Family Album\" sessions was intended to be the band's first single, with a single edit having been created. However, after the Reznor sessions, the album was instead led by the single \"Get Your Gunn\", followed by \"Lunchbox\" and \"Dope Hat\". The album was certified Gold on May 29, 2003 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in the United States.\n\nDuring this time, in addition to recording with Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson for the label, Reznor also worked on the soundtrack to Oliver Stone's controversial 1994 film, \"Natural Born Killers\". Reznor oversaw the structure of the soundtrack, which included audio collages from the film and aimed to recreate the style the film itself. Reznor worked on the soundtrack using a portable Pro Tools in his hotel room. Reznor received a producer credit, but did not select the artists chosen for it (which was done by music supervisor Budd Carr). The soundtrack originally included the songs \"A Warm Place\" and \"Something I Can Never Have\" by Nine Inch Nails. A new composition from the band, \"Burn\", was recorded for the soundtrack, with a music video shot in the style of the film (although it was not directed by Stone). Reznor said of the experience:\n\nThe resulting soundtrack blended both previously released and unreleased material, spanning the genres of rock, punk, world music, country, hip-hop and more. It was released on August 23, 1994 to commercial and critical success. To date, the soundtrack has sold over 500,000 copies in the United States, making it a gold record. It was also named third best compilation album of 1995 by \"New Musical Express\" (December 24, 1994). and one of the \"90 Best Albums of the 1990s\" by \"Q\" magazine (December 1, 1999).\n\nNine Inch Nails' video for \"Burn\" was later included on the home video release of the \"Natural Born Killers: Director's Cut\" on VHS and laserdisc, but omitted from subsequent editions, such as DVD and blu-ray. The bonus features on the home video editions of the director's cut also included a behind-the-scenes featurette, in which Oliver Stone recollects his experiences working with Reznor on the film.\n\nCapping off a successful year in 1994 at Nothing Records was the arrival of Pop Will Eat Itself, who were licensed by the label for Stateside release. Already established in the UK by the late 1980s, the band (sometimes referred to as PWEI or The Poppies) had a growing fanbase, with albums such as \"Box Frenzy\", \"This Is the Day...This Is the Hour...This Is This!\", \"Cure for Sanity\" and \"The Looks or the Lifestyle?\". The latter album peaked at UK No. 15 and featured the Top 30 hit singles \"Karmadrome\" and \"Bulletproof!\" Despite healthy sales and successful touring, by January 1993, a shake-up at their longtime label RCA would lead to the band's biggest supporters leaving the company. The remaining executives did not understand the band or their music, suggesting that EMF 'write a hit' for them at one meeting. The band was dropped from the label before their \"Get the Girl! Kill the Baddies!\" single was released. It went on to peak at number 9 in the UK Singles Chart, becoming the band's biggest hit to date, also making them, at that time, the highest charting act to ever appear on Top of The Pops without a record deal.\n\nIn the wake of the RCA shake-up, Pop Will Eat Itself moved to Infectious Records in the UK. A call between PWEI and Nine Inch Nails management would lead to Nothing Records picking up licensing rights for the band in the United States. Former frontman Clint Mansell (who shared songwriting and vocal duties with Graham Crabb) recalled:\n\n\"Dos Dedos Mis Amigos\" was released on September 19, 1994 on Nothing Records. It marked a change in direction for the band, which had, until that time, featured a sound that blended hip-hop, electronic and alternative influences. \"Dos Dedos Mis Amigos\" took on a heavier, industrial rock sound. It was led by the singles \"Ich Bin Ein Auslander\", \"Everything's Cool\", \"R.S.V.P.\" and \"Underbelly\". \"Ich Bin Ein Auslander\" was accompanied by a music video, which received some airplay on MTV. Around this same time, the band had a high-profile collaboration with The Prodigy, on the track \"Their Law\" from the album Music for the Jilted Generation. \"Dos Dedos Mis Amigos\" peaked at No. 11 in the UK Albums Chart and their single \"Everything's Cool\" became their ninth Top 30 UK hit. A Japanese edition of \"Dos Dedos Mis Amigos\" was released on Midi Music, which included four bonus tracks, all of which have since been released elsewhere by the band.\n\nThe band followed up \"Dos Dedos Mis Amigos\" with the \"Amalgamation\" EP, featuring remixes and additional tracks from the album sessions. The EP was picked up for US release on Nothing, which also released a promo-only single for \"R.S.V.P.\", featuring alternate mixes. However, there were several releases tied into the album in the UK that Nothing opted not to license for release in the States. Infectious Records released singles for \"Ich Bin Ein Auslander\", \"R.S.V.P. / Familus Horribilus\", \"Everything's Cool\" and \"Underbelly\", none of which received licensing from Nothing. Most notable of all was the remix album \"Two Fingers My Friends!\", which featured acts such as The Orb, Feotus and Die Krupps remixing tracks from \"Dos Dedos Mis Amigmos\". The remix collection was released in Infectious in 1995 in both a single disc set, as well as a limited edition two-disc edition, featuring additional remixes. \"Two Fingers My Friends!\" was not picked up for US release by Nothing.\n\nPWEI toured to promote the album and enjoyed a raised profile in the States, but at the end of touring, the band found themselves struggling to continue as a creative force. Work did begin on an untitled follow-up to \"Dos Dedos Mis Amigos\", with the band entering the studio in 1996. Their sixth studio album, which had been intended for Stateside release via Nothing, would not see release before the band broke up, however. Member Graham Crabb quit the band to focus on his ambient project Golden Claw Musics. Members Richard March and Robert \"Fuzz\" Townshend went on to form the big beat band Bentley Rhythm Ace. Townshend also released two solo albums, while Clint Mansell would end up signing onto Nothing Records as a solo artist. Mansell stated:\n\nOnly two songs from the sixth album's recording sessions were released at the time, both on compilations. A cover of Gary Numan's \"Friends\" was included on the Numan tribute album \"Random\" on the Beggars Banquet label, while the song \"Zero Return (Instrumental Mix)\" was included on Future Music Magazine's June 1996 sampler \"FMCD June 1996\", which also featured Nothing Records label-mates Meat Beat Manifesto.\n\nClint Mansell's time as a solo artist for the label would be short-lived, as his career as a film composer blossomed. While Mansell would appear on numerous releases for the label as a remixer and collaborator, as well as an appearance in 1996 on the label's \"Nights Of Nothing\" label showcase, performing with Nine Inch Nails (which included performances of some Pop Will Eat Itself songs), his planned solo album for Nothing was ultimately scrapped. Only two demos from Mansell's solo album ever surfaced. The songs \"Atlantic Crossing\" and \"The Mechanic\" found their way online, by way of Clint Mansell and Nothing Records' official websites (both since defunct). Mansell also put together a streaming mix for \"Radio Nothing\" on the Nothing Records website, which included \"The Mechanic\", alongside other tracks from the label. After Mansell's successful work composing the film \"π\", he went on to become a full-time film composer, on such films as \"Requiem for a Dream\", \"Doom\" (the soundtrack to which featured an exclusive Mansell remix of Nine Inch Nails' track \"You Know What You Are\"), \"The Fountain\", \"The Wrestler\", \"Moon\", and \"Black Swan\".\n\nIn January 2005, Pop Will Eat Itself reunited for a brief series of shows in the UK, which produced a number of Instant Live albums, whereby ten minutes after the completion of each gig, double live albums of the performance could be purchased. The band also released a preview of newly recorded material (not to be confused with their then-unreleased 1996 material), under the working title of \"Sonic Noise Byte\" in November 2005, via their official website, pweination. However, an announcement on the official website in March 2006 confirmed that Mansell and March would no longer be involved in the reformation of the band, due to other work commitments, effectively ending that conception of the PWEI reformation. However, the remaining band members continued as Vileevils, performing live, releasing re-recorded versions of several tracks from the \"Sonic Noise Byte\" sessions and releasing two EPs; \"Demon / Axe Of Men 2010\" and \"Demon / Axe Of Men 2010 Remixes\", both of which were credited as featuring Clint Mansell and Pop Will Eat Itself.\n\nVileevils performed their final live date in December 2008, before recording an unreleased album, which was cancelled prior to release in 2010. Instead, Pop Will Eat Itself finally reformed in 2011, with Graham Crabb serving as the band's only original member, while having the blessing of all the former members. Songs from both the abandoned Vile Evils album, as well as the abandoned \"Sonic Noise Byte\" album, were reworked and re-recorded for alongside new material for Pop Will Eat Itself's return album \"New Noise Designed by a Sadist\", released in 2011 on Cooking Vinyl in the UK and Metropolis Records in the US.\n\nThe revived PWEI also began a series of reissues of their back-catalog, via the Cherry Red label. On October 7, 2013, the band re-issued \"Dos Dedos Mis Amigos\" on Cherry Red, featuring five rare bonus tracks, as well as a second disc; the unreleased 1996 album, now titled \"A Lick Of The Old Cassette Box\". \"A Lick Of The Old Cassette Box\" was also released as a limited edition, stand-alone vinyl pressing that same year. Pop Will Eat Itself continues as a full-time project to this day, under the direction of Graham Crabb.\n\nOne act to depart during the early era of the label was Mondo Vanilli. Mondo Vanilli (sometimes referred to as MV Inc. or The Artists Formerly Known As Mondo Vanilli) was the brainchild of R. U. Sirius, real name Ken Goffman, an American writer, editor, talk show host, musician and cyberculture personality. Sirius was editor-in-chief of \"Mondo 2000\", a glossy cyberculture magazine published in California during the 1980s and 1990s. It covered cyberpunk topics such as virtual reality and smart drugs, serving as a more anarchic and subversive predecessor to the later-founded \"Wired\" magazine. Sirius described the band as \"a virtual reality band that would proudly lip-synch, or maybe not, even pretend to play live music on stage - perhaps we would exist totally in virtuality - or else we would do other, more original types of performance to our music.\" Sirius was backed by members Scrappi DüChamp - real name Dave Fleminger, with whom he had collaborated on previous musical projects and would compose most of the music - and Simone Third Arm, a performance artist introduced to Sirius early into the project's inception.\n\nMondo Vanilli's involvement with Nothing Records came about through a chance meeting at Reznor's then-home at 10050 Cielo Drive, the site of the infamous Tate murders by members of the Manson Family in 1969. Sirius, a Northern California resident, had left Mondo 2000 three months prior and was visiting Los Angeles with some promotional Mondo Vanilli booklets and demo tapes, to shop them around the L.A. music scene. Sirius had been invited as a guest of Timothy Leary to a housewarming party at the grounds. It was there he met Reznor and gave him some of the Mondo Vanilli recordings, which included the songs \"Love Is The Product\", \"Thanx!\" and \"Wraparound World.\" The day after the party, Reznor expressed interest in the band and discussed a deal singing them to Nothing Records. When the contract arrived, however, the band expressed some reservations. Sirius stated:\n\nRecording commenced on the album at San Francisco's Razor's Edge Studios. The finished album, titled \"IOU Babe\" was completed in late 1993 and delivered to the label. However, the album was met with resistance from the label. Sirius recalled, \"We finished the album right around the end of 1993. In fact, the timing was such that we went to a NIN show in Oakland and handed in the final product in person to his management. This time, we weren’t invited into the dressing room and Reznor never came out to speak to us. I think it was maybe a few weeks after that Tony Ciula from Nothing Records told us that Interscope was making Nothing drop all their artists except NIN and Marilyn Manson but that we could have the album gratis.\"\n\nThe band suddenly found themselves without a label, having been dropped by Nothing. The final recording contract between the two parties had never been signed. However, upon requesting a formal notice of their release from the label, the situation became further complicated and it seemed the band would be unable to shop the album elsewhere. Sirius stated, \"When our lawyer asked for a formal notification of this (release from the label), the Interscope lawyer told us that they weren’t going to give us the rights to the music unless some other record company paid off their full bill... and I think they had some other demands as well. In our position, we would have had to have gone to small indie labels, so it was pretty much impossible.\"\n\nIn the wake of the fallout from the label, the band took to publicly criticizing Nothing and Reznor for a time, posting an article called “True Story of Brent Buzzkill and MV Inc,” using psudonyms and parody to recall their side of the story in their experiences with the label. They also recorded a new track for the \"IOU Babe\" album, \"The Ballad of Brent Buzzkill\", aimed at Reznor and the label. Sirious reflected, \"Maybe he (Reznor) didn't really get the album, as a whole. We heard he liked some of it. He also went into a well-publicized… ahem… downward spiral around that time. And we did make merciless fun of him for a few years after it all happened... We were pretty mean!\"\n\nThe band ended up posting the album online for free, originally via member Scrappi DüChamp's now-defunct website. It the years to follow, the album would disappear and reappear online, through numerous outlets, such as Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Internet Archive and The Pirate Bay, with slightly revised track lists. In 2011, the band stated on their Bandcamp website that a CD edition of the album was forthcoming, though to date, it has never materialized. Trent Reznor was given an unfeigned special thanks in later editions of the \"IOU Babe\" album credits.\n\n1995 was kicked off by the arrival of Prick, led by Reznor's longtime friend and collaborator, Kevin McMahon. Prior to Nothing Records, the two musicians first crossed paths in the 1980s Cleveland music scene. McMahon, a Cleveland native, had spent much of the 70s and 80s fronting the rock band Lucky Pierre there, while in 1985, Reznor began performing with another local act called Exotic Birds . Exotic Birds was led by future Prick drummer Andy Kubiszewski (and even featured future Nine Inch Nails member Chris Vrenna for a short time). By 1988, Reznor had left Exotic Birds and joined Lucky Pierre. His time there would be likewise abbreviated, due to his desire to start his own project. However, he remained on long enough to appear on Lucky Pierre's 1988 \"Communiqué\" 12\" EP, performing on the tracks \"Communiqué\" (an alternate version of which had been released as a 7\" single four years prior in 1984, which did not feature Reznor) and \"I Need To Get To Know\". Lucky Pierre was also being managed at the time by John Malm. Reznor left the band shortly thereafter and went on to begin work on Nine Inch Nails' debut album, Pretty Hate Machine, hiring Malm as his manager in the process.\n\nMeanwhile, McMahon also switched gears musically, moving to Los Angeles to begin what would become Prick. Rounding out the initial incarnation of the band was guitarist Chris Schleyer and former Exotic Birds member Andy Kubiszewski on drums, though the latter would intermittently drop in and out of the fold over the years to come, taking on duties with numerous other bands, including future Nothing Record act The The. By 1994, Prick's live band consisted of Kevin McMahon on vocals and guitar, Chris Schleyer on lead guitar, Sebastien Monney on bass, Brian Kehew on keyboards and Sean Furlong on drums, performing for a short time under the name Riverhead in clubs around Los Angeles.\n\nBy this time, Reznor himself had relocated to Los Angeles, where he was soon to begin work on The Downward Spiral. McMahon and Reznor agreed to spend some time in the studio together, revisiting some of the old Lucky Pierre material and recording new versions of \"Communique\", \"Tough\", \"Other People\" (previously known as \"I Need To Get To Know\") and \"No Fair Fights\". The songs were not yet intended for any specific project or label. \"We were just doing it to do music,\" stated McMahon. Aware of the collaboration's resemblance in sound to Nine Inch Nails, McMahon opted to embrace Trent's contributions, rather than try to avoid common ground. McMahon stated, “Trent was the other part of the band on the songs that he produced. He and I were the band, so there’s going to be some kind of similarity there. I’m certainly not going to ask him to not do what he does best, so that I won’t have any indication of any sound like that.”\n\nMcMahon would go on to sign Prick to a contract with Interscope Records. He began work on a debut album, flying to London to record material with producer Warne Livesey. After completing recording, the album was shelved at Interscope for an extended period, to the degree that Andy Kubiszewski, who was back with the band at this time, performing drums on the album, opted to take an offer to tour with Stabbing Westward. McMahon began to feel he wasn't getting what he wanted out of Interscope, at which time he reconnected with Reznor and Malm and Prick was moved under the Nothing Records umbrella.\n\nAt least two of the Livesey produced tracks were ultimately cut from the album, although they would later surface of future McMahon projects. \"Attitude\" and \"Johnny Goes To Paris\" appeared on Lucky Pierre's 2004 \"ThinKing\" album, while drummer Andy Kubiszewski stated an early version of \"Actress\" was also recorded with Livesey during the original album sessions. It later appeared on Prick's \"The Wreckard\" album. In lieu of the cut songs, McMahon's recent material with Reznor was added. The album was finally on track for release, with a promo 7\" for \"Communique / Crack\" surfacing in 1994, while the full-length, self-titled album followed on February 7, 1995. The album was led by the single \"Animal\", which received moderate airplay on MTV and alternative radio and was featured on the soundtrack to the film Showgirls. It went on to sell over 66,000 copies.\n\nPrick toured the album, supporting such acts as Ned's Atomic Dustbin, Lords Of Acid and My Life With The Thrill Kill Kult. Garrett Hammond replaced Andy Kubiszewski on drums, while frequent Nine Inch Nails collaborator Dave Ogilvie was hired for live programming. Prick was then invited to their largest showcase yet, as openers for Nine Inch Nails' and David Bowie's 1995 co-headlining Outside Tour. In 1996, McMahon played guitar with Nine Inch Nails for three shows on \"Nights of Nothing\" showcase, which included two Prick songs (\"Animal\" and \"Tough\") as part of NIN's set.\n\nAs the promotional cycle for Prick's debut album winded down, McMahon began to feel discomfort with the increased spotlight, stating \"I’m not comfortable with the fame thing, even just walking out after a show and having somebody recognize me or anything like that, because I kind of just am there on stage when I’m on stage or in the studio. That’s sort of when I do whatever I do. The other times I’m just kind of looking around like everybody else. I don’t want to have to be anything that somebody expects me to be. I just think that once that starts, it’s the beginning of deterioration of the person.\" Differences were also mounting with Nothing/Interscope, due in part to McMahon feeling they were putting a greater emphasis on their expanding roster, while diminishing their focus on Prick. McMahon recalled:\n\nInterscope was a young enough company where they were saying, \"We have only 12 artists, and it's not like we're going to be throwing out 15 a month and see what sticks. We're going to try to pay attention to you. As time passed, the record came out, they signed more and more people, and all of a sudden, the idea of me doing a record every year or every 18 months turned into, \"Well, there's no commercial radio hit here anymore, you need to do a commercial radio kind of thing.\"\n\nIn spite of the growing differences, McMahon set about plans of recording a follow-up, double-album of Prick material for Nothing, under the working title of \"Numb\". However, Nothing management pulled the plug at the last minute, requesting McMahon do additional work on the album to make it more radio friendly. McMahon stated, \"The day before I was supposed to begin recording the second album, the label decided they didn't want to do it. They wanted more radio-friendly songs. And since I don't listen to the radio, I didn't know what they were talking about. I can't write songs that someone wants me to write.\"\n\nWith the two parties at an impasse, Prick would quietly part ways with the Nothing Records. In spite of this, McMahon left in good standing with both Reznor and Malm. \"There was never any real blowout with Trent,\" McMahon stated. John Malm expressed his admiration for McMahon as well, but noted, “I think that he didn’t take well to the major label situation.”\n\nIn the subsequent years, McMahon quietly recorded on and off, while attempting to reacquire publishing rights to his new material. After successfully doing so in 1999, McMahon surfaced online with an MP3 of a new track, “Wetcat,” in late 2000. Two more tracks, \"I Know It's Gonna Hurt\" and \"Cloud\", followed in 2001 (the latter ultimately surfacing on Lucky Pierre's \"ThinKing\" album). Opting not to shop his material to new labels, McMahon instead chose to self-release. In 2002, Prick finally announced their sophomore album, \"The Wreckard\", to be released online via McMahon's own Lucky Pierre Music. The album featured two tracks produced by Warne Livesey, \"Into My Arms\" and \"Tomorrow\", both of which were recorded in 1997, as well as \"Wetcat\" and \"I Know It's Gonna Hurt.\" McMahon assembled a live band to support the album, consisting of Greg Zydyk on guitar, (Lucky Pierre bandmate) Tom Lash on bass and Andy Kubiszewski once again on drums. They performed a small run of regional shows around the Midwest and Eastern US, from late 2002 into 2003.\n\nIn 2004, McMahon returned to Lucky Pierre, with the album \"ThinKing\", which included the two tracks originally cut from Prick's 1995 debut, as well as the track \"Cloud\", which had surfaced three years prior as an MP3. \"ThinKing\" marked Lucky Pierre's first full-length album ever, nearly 30 years after their formation.\n\nAfter another period of silence, in 2009, McMahon returned with his largest wave of material to date. In addition to reissues of \"The Wreckard\" and \"ThinKing\", both featuring upgraded packaging, Prick's first live album was released, \"Boston Live\", as well as a self-titled compilation of the bulk of Lucky Pierre's back-catalog. Two additional McMahon projects also saw release at this time. Fear Of Blue was a more electronic-based project, recorded in 1990 by Kevin McMahon and Ray DiLeo, while ( sic ), a rock-based project, featured McMahon, Andy Kebiszewski, Greg Zydyk and Mark Gamiere. Released as an EP, ( sic )'s \"Standard Idiom Communiqué\" included the track \"Runaway Brain,\" which had also previously surfaced online as an MP3.\n\nIn early 2010, the Lucky Pierre Music website closed down, with a message stating, \"Hello Friends / Fans, While LPM is expanding its content of new and vintage music and merch available to you at our store, and as we work to develop the best ways and means of reaching any and all those interested, we have decided to close the site for an indefinite amount of time to facilitate this effort.\" To date, Prick has not publicly surfaced since. However, in 2017, Interscope Records released Prick's 1995 self-titled debut on vinyl for the first time.\n\nBy 1995, Trust Obey completed their first album for Nothing Records, \"Hands Of Ash\", though it would never see release though the label. Trust Obey is John Bergin, an illustrator, designer, writer, filmmaker and musician. Originally a Pennsylvania native, Bergin had been \"drawing and painting for as long as I can remember.\" By 1984, while attending the University of the Arts in Philadelphia (from 1984 - 1988), Bergin began experimenting in music, citing such acts as Swans and future Nothing Records act Einstürzende Neubauten as influences. Trust Obey was founded in 1988 in Kansas City, Missouri, beginning as a one-man project with a series of self-released cassettes; \"Fucking The Wound\" (1989), \"Rip Saw\" (1989), \"Locust\" (1990), \"The Veil\" (1990), \"Room 101\" (1991) and \"Exit Wound\" (1991). In 1993, Bergin added guitarist Brett Smith as a permanent member of the band, in order to accommodate live performances.\n\nBy 1994, Bergin had become heavily immersed in the graphic design and comic book worlds and Trust Obey was commissioned to compose music to accompany James O'Barr's graphic novel, The Crow. Timed to coincide with the release of the Alex Proyas directed motion picture starring Brandon Lee, the graphic novel was released in a special hardcover edition on Kitchen Sink Press and Graphitti Design and included Trust Obey's companion CD album, \"Fear And Bullets\". At this time, O'Barr even claimed to have joined on as a member of Trust Obey, however, his only credited appearance on any Trust Obey release would be contributing some lyrics to the song \"The Crow\" on the \"Fear And Bullets\" album.\n\nTrent Reznor would also have involvement with The Crow franchise, on the motion picture side of things, delivering a Nine Inch Nails cover of Joy Division's \"Dead Souls\" for the hit soundtrack. Reznor would hear the \"Fear And Bullets\" album and offer Trust Obey a five-album contract with Nothing Records, making them one of the earliest acts signed to the label. In an interview on the bootleg Nine Inch Nails disc, \"Disturbed\", Reznor discussed singing Trust Obey, noting that the band was \"not a great commercial potential.\"\n\nWorking on the film score to The Crow were composer Graeme Revell and Brian \"Lustmord\" Williams (as a \"musical sound designer\"), both of whom went on to become friends with John Bergin through their mutual association with the franchise (Bergin went on to design art for releases with both Revell and Lustmord). Nothing Records expressed interest in signing composer Graeme Revell to release his score to The Crow film, which would be paired with a reissue of Trust Obey's \"Fear And Bullets\" graphic novel compositions and released together as a double album. However, Brian Lustmord expressed reservations about such a partnership. Bergin explained:\n\n\"Nothing Records was interested in releasing my Trust Obey Crow soundtrack and Graeme (Revell)'s Crow film score as a double CD. At the time Graeme didn't have a label for this work, so he was into the idea. Back then Brian (Lustmord) had first said to me \"oh...Nothing records...Nine Inch Nails... I'll say no more.\" He wasn't too excited about the notion of associating with Trent's label. He was right. The whole idea of the double CD fell apart.\"\n\nWith plans for the Graeme Revell/Trust Obey joint release scrapped, Revell's score was ultimately released instead on the Varèse Sarabande soundtrack label, while Trust Obey entered the studio in the spring of 1995 to begin recording an album of new material for Nothing Records. The resulting album, \"Hands Of Ash\", was delivered to the label, where it was met with apprehension. The album remained shelved for an extended period, before Bergin became frustrated with the situation and the parties agreed to part ways in February 1996, with Bergin retaining the rights to the \"Hands Of Ash\" album.\n\nIn the wake of Trust Obey's departure from Nothing Records, Brian McNelis of Lakeshore Entertainment would put Bergin in touch with Jared Louche of the industrial rock band Chemlab. Bergin met with Louche in Chicago, while he was recording Chemlab's \"East Side Militia\" album. Louche at the time was serving as general manager for Fifth Colvmn Records and requested Bergin send him some material for release consideration.\n\nFifth Colvmn Records would opt to pick up Hands Of Ash, as well as another project of Bergin's, C17H19NO3 (the source of name being the chemical formula for morphine), for the \"Terra Damnata\" album. \"Hands Of Ash\" was released on August 2, 1996 on Fifth Colvmn Records, bearing a sticker on the CD jewel case, featuring Reznor's \"Not a great commercial potential\" quotation on the cover. The album's liner notes also included mention of Reznor and Nothing Records in the credits, stating, \"Thanks to Trent and Nothing for something.\"\n\nBergin would go on to form numerous other music projects, such as Orifice, Blackmouth, Tertium Non Data, Lolo and Camouflaged Abominations. He also performed as a member of Paved In Skin and had a short stint as a member of the industrial rock supergroup Pigface. Pigface was led by musician Martin Atkins, who also ran Invisible Records. On October 28, 1999, Invisible Records reissued Trust Obey's \"Fear And Bullets\" album, with reworked versions of the original graphic novel tracks, as well as one song being added (\"A Murder Of Crows\") and one song removed (\"Don't Look\"). In 2001, Invisible also released C17H19NO3's \"Terra Null\" double album (the second disc of which was a reissue of the \"Terra Damnata\" album).\n\nBergin is currently the art director at Lakeshore Records, where he has been involved in creating the artwork for hundreds of releases. He has also created numerous comic book series, including \"Ashes\", \"Golgothika\" and \"Wednesday\". For his graphic novel work, Bergin was nominated for the Harvey Award for Best New Talent in 1991. Through the 1990s, Bergin created short comics and illustrated titles for Heavy Metal Magazine, Marvel, DC and Dark Horse Comics. In the mid-90s, Bergin collaborated with James O'Barr, working as creative talent for Tundra, where in addition to \"The Crow\", they produced \"Bone Saw\", \"IO\" and \"From Inside\". In 2008, Bergin directed an animated feature-length film adaptation of \"From Inside\", which won numerous awards and screened at over 50 international film festivals, including SITGES (Best Animated Feature), Fantasia Film Festival (Jury Prize), Utopiales (Grand Prix) and Future Film Festival of Italy. \"From Inside\" was released on home video in October 2014.\n\nIn 2015, Trust Obey reissued \"Hands Of Ash\" digitally, via Bergin's own Stompbox13 label. Missing from the release was the final track, \"Larvatus,\" though it was included as a bonus track on Stompbox13's Bandcamp edition, as well as the previously unreleased song \"Malice Buried,\" which serves as part two of the song \"Hands Of Malice.\" Bergin continues to use Stompbox13 as the primary outlet for his musical output.\n\nMeat Beat Manifesto would have many encounters with Trent Reznor in the years leading up to their arrival on Nothing Records. However, the partnership was born out of a dark period for the group, due to difficulties with their European label, Play It Again Sam. Meat Beat Manifesto, originally the duo of Jack Dangers and Johnny Stephens, struggled to find any labels willing to support them in the UK throughout their formative years in the late 1980s. This prompted the band to accept an unfavorable deal with Belgian label Play It Again Sam. Jack Dangers recalled, \"I couldn’t get a label to sign me in the UK, and that’s why I ended up in a disastrous contract with Belgian label PIAS (Play It Again Sam).\" In spite of this, the deal sparked interest from many labels in the US. Venerable imprints such as Wax Trax! Records and Mute Records would license the band's early material in the United States, such as \"Storm the Studio\", \"Armed Audio Warfare\", \"99%\" and \"Satyricon\", which gave MBM an increased Stateside following. Dangers reflected, \"I remember going to see Mute Records in 1988 and they weren’t interested in the slightest in what I was doing. Two years later they were running all over the world to sign me for the American end of the deal because PIAS only had me signed for Europe. It’s funny how two years prior they wouldn’t even listen to my records.\"\n\nTheir early work would capture the attention of Trent Reznor, leading to an invitation in 1990 for Meat Beat Manifesto to perform as openers during Nine Inch Nails' \"Hate '90\" tour (a tour which also included a guest appearance from one of the earliest incarnations of Marilyn Manson, who performed as local openers when the tour ran through Florida). Meat Beat Manifesto were also invited to remix Nine Inch Nails, first on the Closer To God remix disc in 1994, followed by The Perfect Drug in 1997 (the former also featured Nothing Records act Coil, while the latter also featured Nothing act Plug).\n\nIn 1993, Dangers relocated from England to San Francisco, California and began work on a follow-up to 1992's \"Satyricon\". By this time, Dangers had become the sole, constant member of the band and recording of the subsequent album, \"Subliminal Sandwich\", would mark a dark time in his life, due in part to the death of his father, as well as increasing tension with his label, PIAS. Dangers stated, \"\"Subliminal Sandwich\" was done while I was in the middle of trying to get out of my label deal, which is always a bad thing, so I just made the best of a terrible thing and did a double album. I was just waiting to get out of that miserable, boring, heard-it-all-before stuff.\"\n\nThroughout the recording of \"Subliminal Sandwich\", the band faced uncertainty regarding their Stateside distribution. Mute Records was in the process of downsizing, while their licensing contract with Play It Again Sam was likewise nearing its conclusion. A US 12\" single for \"Nuclear Bomb\" from the \"Subliminal Sandwich\" sessions made it as far as the test pressing stage at Mute in late 1995, before plans for a commercial release were scrapped.\n\nMBM's North American licensing via Mute soon lapsed and the band found themselves without U.S. distribution, paving the way for Nothing Records to begin licensing their work in the United States in 1996. \"Subliminal Sandwich\" was released as a double album on June 4, 1996 on Nothing Records. The album was led by a cover of the World Domination Enterprises song \"Asbestos Lead Asbestos,\" which was released as commercial single in Europe on PIAS and as a promo only CD/12\" single on Nothing in the US. A video for the song also received minor US airplay on MTV. Additionally, a single for \"Transmission\" was released in Europe on PIAS, though it was not picked up for US release by Nothing.\n\nMeat Beat Manifesto would support \"Subliminal Sandwich\" with extensive touring across the United States and Europe, featuring a line-up of Jack Dangers, John Wilson on guitar, Lynn Farmer on drums and Mike Powell on samples and keys. In 1996, the band took part in the \"Nights Of Nothing\" label showcase, which featured label-mates Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails, with the latter's line-up including Clint Mansell of Pop Will Eat Itself and Kevin McMahon from Prick.\n\nThe band would go on to become one of the more prolific acts on Nothing, releasing many additional titles in the years to follow, as well as helping reshape the sound of the label. However, Dangers and Reznor maintained a mostly professional relationship throughout their tenure, with Dangers stating, \"I was never really hanging out with Trent. I don’t know if that was the perception.\" Despite the fact the band was only ever licensed via Belgian label PIAS, Meat Beat Manifesto's relationship with Nothing Records was considered a positive one, with Dangers describing Nothing Records at the time as \"the best label we've ever been a part of.\"\n\nIn 1994, Nine Inch Nails invited Pig to open a series of shows in London during the European leg of their Self Destruct Tour. By this time, Raymond Watts, founder of Pig, had firmly established himself in the industrial scene as a founding member of KMFDM (though he would come and go from the band's line-up, opting to focus on Pig), as well as a collaborator with such acts as Psychic TV, Foetus and future Nothing Records act Einstürzende Neubauten. Pig’s earliest work had seen release via the seminal Wax Trax! Records. However, much of his output, which included \"A Poke in the Eye... With a Sharp Stick!\", \"Praise the Lard\", \"A Stroll in the Pork\" and \"The Swining\", was scattered across numerous labels around the world and often proved difficult to find. Much of his output by the mid-90s had become released exclusively in Japan, where Watts had garnered a respectable fanbase.\n\nReznor was familiar with most of Watts' scattered body of work and during their encounters Europe, Watts gave Reznor a copy of his latest album, \"Sinsation\", which was released in 1995 on Japanese label Victor Entertainment. When Watts came to the United States to work with KMFDM on their Nihil album and tour, the band would meet up with Reznor in New Orleans (where then-KMFDM member En Esch was living at the time). Soon after, Trent would suggest to release Pig in the US on Nothing Records. Watts explained, \"I met Trent very briefly in London and the next time he was back he asked me and my band (Pig) to open up for quite a few of their (Nine Inch Nails) European shows. He was aware that there had been sporadic Pig releases on different labels, because I moved about a bit. He was obviously aware of the \"Sinsation\" album, because I'd given him a copy of it somewhere along the line and then last year, when I was out with KMFDM, we met again and it was just a little bit after that that it was suggested that it might be possible to work together with regard to getting it out on Nothing.\"\n\nWatts accepted a deal to license \"Sinsation\" to Nothing Records, where it was released on September 17, 1996. However, the album received only minor promotional support from Nothing/Interscope. One such instance of insufficient promotion involved a music video for the band's single, \"Paniac\". The video, which had already been shot and received airplay in Japan, was delivered to MTV for airplay in the States. However, the video featured heavy use of fire, which was a sensitive issue for the network at the time, due to controversy over the Beavis and Butt-Head show, which had been accused of provoking a child to light fire to his home. The network requested the video be edited in order to receive airplay, which would have cost only a minor amount for Interscope. In spite of this, they declined to finance the edit. Watts stated, \"We had a really good video for \"Painiac\", the one with the flames and shit and MTV didn't want to show it unless we edited it. It would have cost $2,000 to edit it and Interscope, in their infinite wisdom, thought that it wasn't worth the investment. I think they wanted a couple of things taken out. And Interscope was running things for Nothing. It was really nice that Nothing wanted to put out our records, but they're busy dealing with this shit (focusing on the larger acts), and we had everyday Interscope people dealing with our shit.\" A single for \"Painiac\" was also released in Japan in 1995 on Victor Entertainment, which was not licensed for release by Nothing Records.\n\nWhile Pig had an open-ended agreement with Nothing, which included the possibility of more Pig material being licensed to the label, Watts began to feel that, in spite of being shepherded by a major label, Nothing was in fact a very small operation and was only able to focus most of their energy on their largest acts. Watts stated, \"they were too busy with other artists and I expected a little bit more feedback from a label on which I was signed.\" Despite having a follow-up album, entitled \"Wrecked\", already completed by the time Nothing released \"Sinsation\" in the United States, Watts felt the label showed minimal interest in it, explaining:\n\nTrent had known about Pig for a long time and basically thought that it might be a good idea to raise the profile. And it seemed to be something that might be a good gesture, because we didn't get releases here and it raised the profile. But in fact, they were a small label, and they've got very big artists to work with, like Manson, which became a huge, huge act. They've got big artists to deal with. And being kind of small and obscure and stuff, we felt mutually that they had gotten the ball rolling for Pig in the States here and there was this other album (\"Wrecked\") to release and this tour (with KMFDM) came up, and we mutually agreed that maybe other people could be more pro-active in the Pig situation. So we just went, \"Well we did this one, that's great, thanks a lot, these people (at Wax Trax!) can probably put more into it.\n\nPig left Nothing Records in 1997 under amicable terms, returning to Wax Trax! Records to release \"Wrecked\" in the United States (which had likewise been licensed from Japanese label Victor Entertainment, who first released the album in 1996). Pig followed this with a national tour of the US, opening for KMFDM in late 1997. In the wake of the Wax Trax! label folding, Pig went on to release numerous albums via Metropolis Records in the US, such as \"Genuine American Monster\", \"Pigmata\" and \"The Gospel\".\n\nWinding down promotion on their debut album, \"Portrait of an American Family\", Marilyn Manson initially planned a remix single for the track \"Dope Hat.\" However, various contributions by engineer and Skinny Puppy producer Dave Ogilvie and Nine Inch Nails then-live keyboardist Charlie Clouser, combined with new material by the band, resulted in an eclectic and unusual combination and it was decided to expand the release into an EP. Leading up to it in Spring of 1995, Marilyn Manson took an opening slot with the band Danzig. The tour was rife with drug binges and unusual backstage escapades, many of which were the genesis for ideas which became the \"Smells Like Children\" EP.\n\nThe band was once again produced by Trent Reznor. \"Smells Like Children\" was full of recordings from backstage on the Danzig tour, as well as samples from the films \"Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory\" and \"Chitty Chitty Bang Bang\" (the EP derives its title in reference to the latter), as well as distorted clips of the band's appearance on \"The Phil Donahue Show\". An early version of the EP, which had not cleared the rights for its audio samples, was mistakenly pressed by Nothing/Interscope and distributed as a promo release. Upon realizing their mistaken, unauthorized film samples, as well as other sound bites considered too extreme, Interscope insisted the EP's track listing be revised for public release. The final, commercial release removed the original opening track, \"Abuse, Part 1 (There is Pain Involved),\" featuring the voices of Manson and Danzig/Pantera tour bus driver Tony F. Wiggins, as they attempted to calm down a masochistic girl, and \"Abuse, Part 2 (Confessions),\" featuring an interview with a teenage girl who confesses to molesting her seven-year-old male cousin. These tracks were replaced by \"The Hands of Small Children\" and \"May Cause Discoloration of the Urine or Feces,\" respectively. Speaking about the promo edition, Manson stated in his autobiography:\n\nThe only solace was that through some unfortunate error someone at the record pressing plant made several thousand copies of our original version of the album, thinking it was the new one. Without even listening to them, the record company sent them out as promotional copies to radio stations and journalists before realizing their mistake. Now, they are available to anyone who wants to hear them on the Internet. Though someone at the label actually accused me of plotting it, I wish I was that resourceful. God, however irrelevant he may be to me, works in mysterious ways.\n\nThe final EP did still feature some backstage debauchery from the Danzig tour, for which Interscope demanded written affidavits from the participants in the sound bites, certifying their consent to be recorded. However, most notable on the EP was the band's cover version of Eurythmics' 1983 hit \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\", which was released as a single, despite Manson claiming Nothing Records was resistant to doing so. Despite this, the song became a major hit on radio and MTV, eventually being nominated at the MTV Video Music Awards for Best Rock Video and helping launch the band into mainstream success. \"Smells Like Children\" was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).\n\nMarilyn Manson's success in the wake of their hit single \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" helped garner much anticipation for their follow-up, sophomore album, \"Antichrist Superstar\". Trent Reznor once again came on board as producer, while Manson, Sean Beavan and Dave Ogilvie shared co-production duties. Members of both Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails also participated in production duties. The album was recorded at Reznor's Nothing Studios in New Orleans. The process of making the album was long and difficult, involving experiments in sleep deprivation and near-constant drug use, in an effort to create a violent and hostile environment suited to the album's content. During this time, antagonism between band members was high, which caused the departure of guitarist and co-founding member Daisy Berkowitz, with Twiggy Ramirez performing much of the album's guitar work as a result.\n\n\"Antichrist Superstar\", a rock opera concept album was released on October 8, 1996. It was led by the single The Beautiful People, which became a major hit on the alternative rock charts, being awarded gold record certification by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), reaching number twenty-six on the US \"Billboard\" and number eighteen in the UK. The music channel VH1 named it number twenty-eight of their \"40 Greatest Metal Songs\". \"Antichrist Superstar\" debuted at number three on the \"Billboard\" 200 with first-week sales of 132,000 copies. Manson also appeared on the cover of \"Rolling Stone\", who awarded the band their \"Best New Artist\" accolade in 1997. The year long \"Dead to the World Tour\" followed, which was the band's longest and largest tour yet.\n\nMeanwhile, the band was also reaching new heights of controversy, finding themselves the target of congressional hearings, led by Senator Joseph Lieberman, to determine the effects, if any, of violent lyrics on young listeners. Lieberman would famously go on to refer to Marilyn Manson as \"perhaps the sickest group ever promoted by a mainstream record company.\" Nearly every performance of their \"Dead to the World\" tour was picketed by religious organizations.\n\nThe band, however, embraced the controversy and catapulted themselves into one of the top rock acts of the late 1990s. \"Antichrist Superstar\" has sold over 7 million copies worldwide, with 1.9 million of those sold in the United States alone. It spawned two commercial singles and music videos (\"The Beautiful People\" and \"Tourniquet\") and an additional three music videos; \"Cryptorchid\", \"Man That You Fear\" and the title track, \"Antichrist Superstar\". The latter was screened at the 1997 San Francisco Film Festival, depicting Manson on a podium, bearing a lightning bolt symbol and, in one scene, tearing apart the Bible and dumping it on the public. Interscope Records refused to release the \"Antichrist Superstar\" music video for airplay. However, in 2010, the unedited video was leaked on YouTube.\n\nThe band followed the album with the \"Remix & Repent\" EP on November 25, 1997, as well as the \"Dead to the World\" VHS video on February 10, 1998, which documented their controversial tour. Three previously unreleased songs from the band were also included on high-profile soundtracks to motion pictures. \"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\" appeared on the soundtrack to Todd McFarlane's \"Spawn\", \"Apple of Sodom\" on the soundtrack to David Lynch's \"Lost Highway\" (also released on Nothing Records) and \"The Suck for Your Solution\" featured on the to the Howard Stern biopic \"Private Parts\". \"Antichrist Superstar\" remains a milestone in the band's career. In the years since its release, it has been heralded by numerous publications as a modern classic and essential listening.\n\nThe late 90s at Nothing Records featured many electronic acts arriving at the label, via licensing deals with UK labels Warp Records and Blue Planet. Nothing continued to sign rock based acts as well, such as 12 Rounds and Rob Halford's 2wo project. They would also release new albums from their highest selling acts, Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson, as well as another high-profile film soundtrack, \"Lost Highway\". This period of time would become the most prolific era for the label.\n\nIn late 1995, filmmaker David Lynch began production on Lost Highway. The film score was created by long-time Lynch composer Angelo Badalamenti, with additional music provided by Barry Adamson. Supplementing their compositions, Lynch also sought to use unnerving soundscapes throughout the film and, at the suggestion of a mutual friend, reached out to Trent Reznor to achieve this. Over the years, Reznor had publicly praised Lynch's work, particularly the film \"Blue Velvet\" and the TV series \"Twin Peaks\", the latter of which Reznor claimed to have even delayed Nine Inch Nails performances, in order to watch the latest episodes.\n\nAlthough Reznor would accept Lynch’s offer, he initially found the experience to be a stressful one. \"At first it was like the most high-pressure situation ever. He (Lynch) would describe a scene and say, 'Here's what I want. Now, there's a police car chasing Fred down the highway, and I want you to picture this: There's a box, okay? And in this box there's snakes coming out; snakes whizzing past your face. So, what I want is the sound of that – the snakes whizzing out of the box – but it's got to be like impending doom.' And he hadn't brought any footage with him. He says, 'Okay, okay, go ahead. Give me that sound.' He wasn't doing it to intimidate me. At the same time, I had to tell him, 'David, I'm not a film-effects guy, I don't have ad clients and I'm not used to being in this environment. I don't work that way, so respect that and understand that I just need a few moments to be alone, so that I know that when I suck, no one is knowing I'm sucking and then I'll give you the good stuff.'\"\n\nReznor composed two instrumental pieces for the film under his own name, enlisting Coil's Peter Christopherson to assist on the songs. Reznor had lobbied for Coil to take on a greater role in composing music for Lynch’s films, but Lynch declined. Coil member John Balance recalled, “You know, with \"Lost Highway\", Trent literally forced (us) down David Lynch's throat, saying ‘Look, please put this Coil stuff on.' You know, he really did help to get us on that soundtrack, but he (Lynch) wasn't interested. He wanted David Bowie, he wanted Marilyn Manson, he wanted whomever he could get. He just said, 'These people are really big. I want this film to be really big.' He didn't give a fuck about the integrity.\"\n\nAfter completion of the score compositions, David Lynch would ask Reznor to handle the release of the soundtrack, which would also include major rock artists personally selected by Lynch, such as David Bowie, Marilyn Manson, The Smashing Pumpkins (who recorded an exclusive song for the soundtrack) and Rammstein, as well as a new song from Nine Inch Nails, entitled \"The Perfect Drug.\" The soundtrack was subsequently slated for release on Nothing Records.\n\nMarilyn Manson also recorded a new song for the soundtrack, “Apple Of Sodom,” even filming a music video for it, which went unreleased at the time, though it later found its way onto YouTube. Band members Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez also filmed cameo appearances in the \"Lost Highway\" film itself. Rammstein, who were largely then-unknown and also major fans of Lynch, had sent him their music from Germany. Lynch, in turn, played Rammstein on set throughout the filming of Lost Highway and selected two of their songs for the soundtrack. A music video for their song \"Rammstein\" heavily featured clips from the film. Nine Inch Nails also completed a music video for \"The Perfect Drug,\" directed by Mark Romanek. Unlike the Rammstein music video, \"The Perfect Drug\" did not feature any film footage from the film.\n\nThe \"Lost Highway\" soundtrack was originally planned for release in late 1996 to coincide with the release of the film. However, the film release was delayed slightly, instead premiering on February 27, 1997. The soundtrack was likewise pushed back, with its official release date set just ahead of the film on February 18, 1997 on Nothing Records. Behind the momentum of the numerous, major rock acts involved, the soundtrack went on to become a commercial success, reaching No. 7 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and receiving Gold certification in the United States.\n\nNine Inch Nails released a single for \"The Perfect Drug\" on May 13, 1997, featuring remixes from Nothing Records act Meat Beat Manifesto and another recent addition to the label's roster; Luke Vibert's Plug project. Fellow Nothing Records act Coil was also invited to do a remix. However, they declined, citing lack of time, due to the recording of their album \"Backwards.\"\n\nIn 2014, David Lynch once again collaborated with Nine Inch Nails, directing their music video for “Came Back Haunted,” from the album \"Hesitation Marks\". On November 7, 2016 the \"Lost Highway\" soundtrack was re-issued as a 180 gram double vinyl by Dutch label Music On Vinyl.\n\nIn 1995, the prolific, British electronic musician Luke Vibert debuted a project called Plug on seminal UK label Rising High Records, where he had previously released material under the name Wagon Christ. The Plug material showcased a different side of Vibert's repertoire, foraying into the genres of drum 'n' bass and jungle, which were reaching their peak in the British club scene. Plug began with a series of 12\" EPs, each an anagram of Vibert's name; \"Visible Crater Funk\", \"Rebuilt Kev\" and \"Versatile Crib Funk\", the latter of which was moved under Rising High's sub-label, Blue Angel Records.\n\nIn 1996, Plug followed up the EPs with a debut full-length through Blue Angel, entitled \"Drum 'n' Bass for Papa\". The following year, Blue Planet Recordings, a sub-label of Silver Planet Recordings, reissued the album, along with the single \"Me & Mr. Sutton\".\n\nIn 1997, Trent Reznor invited Plug to remix the Nine Inch Nails track \"The Perfect Drug\", which had been heavily inspired by UK electronic music. There exists confusion about how Trent had come to know Vibert's work, with Vibert himself stating, \"I could never understand how I got it (\"The Perfect Drug\" remix) in the first place. Somehow, Trent heard my stuff and really liked it.\" He added, \"Someone told me that Alex Paterson from The Orb played my Plug stuff for Trent and someone else told me that Coil played it for him. All I know is that Nothing got in contact with me for the Nine Inch Nails remix and then expressed interest in releasing \"Drum 'N' Bass For Papa\", so I guess I passed the test.\" Nothing Records label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto (who likewise appeared with a remix on Nine Inch Nails' \"The Perfect Drug\" single) credited himself as having introduced Vibert's work to Reznor. Dangers had been a fan of Vibert's, inviting him to remix Meat Beat Manifesto around the same time, on MBM's \"It's The Music\" single (under the Plug moniker) and the \"Original Fire\" EP (as Luke Vibert). At the time, Vibert also had a standing offer from UK label Ninja Tune to re-issue the album. Vibert ultimately opted to accept Reznor's offer with Nothing Records.\n\nOn September 9, 1997, Nothing/Interscope released the double-disc collection, \"Drum 'N' Bass For Papa + Plug EP's 1, 2 & 3\", licensed from Blue Planet Recordings. The album compiled the Plug full-length alongside tracks from the \"Visible Crater Funk\", \"Rebuilt Kev\" and \"Versatile Crib Funk\" EPs. However, there were some differences between the US and UK editions. The tracks \"Cut\" and \"Subtle (In Your Face)\" were replaced on the US edition by new mixes; \"Cut ('97 Remix)\" and \"A Subtle Blend,\" while the track \"The Life Of The Mind\" was omitted altogether, due to concerns over uncleared samples, which included dialogue from the Coen Brothers film Barton Fink. For the second disc of EPs, the songs \"Cheesy (Pic 'N' Mix)\" from \"Rebuilt Kev\" and \"Crib Funk\" from \"Versatile Crib Funk\" were omitted, while the track titles for \"Tuff Rinse\" and \"Versatile\" were reversed.\n\nThe following year in 1998, Vibert would again appear on major labels, returning to his Wagon Christ alias for the \"Tally Ho!\" album, which was released on Virgin Records in the UK and Astralwerks in the US. In the years to follow, Vibert continued to further establish himself as one of the most well-known producers in underground, British electronic music, with releases under a variety of aliases, including Kerrier District, The Ace Of Clubs, Amen Andrews, Spac Hand Luke, Luke Warm and more, for a host of influential electronic labels, including Warp Records, Rephlex Records, Ninja Tune, Planet Mu, Mo' Wax and many more.\n\nVibert would later state that he was unable to continue the Plug project, stemming from his inability to record songs in the same style, due to changes in his equipment and recording techniques. Instead, Vibert created the Amen Andrews alias for Rephlex Records, which explored similar territory as Plug, under the revised recording techniques.\n\nHowever, a wealth of unreleased Plug material still existed, which would slowly find its way out in subsequent years. In 2006, Todd Osborn and Tadd Mullinix's Detroit-based label Rewind Records released Plug's \"Here It Comes EP\", which collected several unreleased tracks from the 90s Plug archives. In early 2011, Luke Vibert would go back to Ninja Tune, the label which nearly released the Plug material in 1997, to inform them that he found some long-lost, never before heard DATs of Plug material, dated from 1995 - 1998. Receptive to the material, Ninja Tune released it as the second, full-length Plug album, \"Back On Time\", on January 9, 2012. To date, it stands as the final release under the Plug moniker.\n\nDue to his propensity to produce under a myriad of monikers and labels, combined with his limited recording window as Plug, Vibert's involvement with Nothing Records did not extend beyond \"Drum 'N' Bass For Papa\", aside from two of the album's tracks featuring on the 1998 Nothing Records compilation, \"Nothing Changes\". Vibert remains a well-known producer in electronic music, regularly releasing new material across a variety of electronic sub-genres.\n\n2wo (alternately written as Two) was the brainchild of heavy metal idol Rob Halford and guitarist John Lowery (better known as John 5). After spending nearly 20 years garnering mainstream success as frontman for heavy metal icons Judas Priest, having recorded 12 studio albums and selling nearly 50 million albums, Halford announced to the band on July 4, 1991 that he would be leaving. However, he wouldn't officially depart from the band until May 1992, due to contractual obligations. That same year, Halford would launch a new heavy metal band, Fight. Fight would release two albums and an EP, before disbanding in autumn of 1995, when they were dropped by their label, Epic Records, due to sales falling below expectations.\n\nThroughout the early 1990s, John Lowery had been working as a guitarist around Los Angeles, where he met producer Bob Marlette. Marlette would produce an EP for Lowery's short-lived band, Red Square Black, entitled \"Square\". The duo also helped write and record much of David Lee Roth's \"DLR Band\" album. The blueprint for 2wo began in October 1995, when Halford first met Lowery. Halford recalled, \"I was at the Foundation Forum a few years back and a journalist friend of mine told me about John Lowery, the guitar player. John and I got in touch. We spent a few days together in Los Angeles and we started to just sit around with some guitars and write.\" Lowery then introduced Halford to producer Bob Marlette and the trio commenced work on some demo songs, which would become the foundation of 2wo. \"I created 'Two' because I wanted to re-capture that tangible rush I experienced when I first launched my career,\" Halford explained. After a few months, the trio had pieced together a cassette demo, which Halford was playing for friends and colleagues.\n\nWhile the project was still without a name, in February 1996, a chance encounter in New Orleans would lead the band onto Nothing Records. While visiting for Mardi Gras, Halford made an impromptu visit to Nothing Studios, where he met Trent Reznor. Halford recalled, “I was in New Orleans at Mardi Gras, where I go every year, and was partying with some friends and they pointed out where Trent’s studio was. One of my friends said, ‘Why don’t you go knock on the door and say hi?’ I never do that kind of thing. For whatever reason, I got out of the car and walked across the street and banged on the door. Rave Ogilvie opened the door and welcomed me in. We’d never met before, but he was just a really nice, cool guy and he showed me around the studio. A little while later Trent showed up and we’d never met before either. We just sat there and talked about this that and the other. He knew I had some demos with me and asked to listen to the music. He listened to it and asked me if I’d leave the cassette, which I did, and that was that really. We hung out together for a couple of more days, because he was in some of the parades and so forth. But then I just went back to Phoenix and didn’t hear anything from him for the longest time.\"\n\nTrent would listen to the songs from Halford's demo and go on to conceive a deeper vision for the work, as well as offer it a home at Nothing Records. Halford explained, \"Suddenly he calls me up and first of all offers me a record deal, which was great because I was looking for one. And then secondly, he gave me then his vision, his ideas of where he could see this music going.\" After the band accepted Reznor's offer, additional work commenced on the album, which was already in near finished form by that time, with the band and Dave Olgivie recording in Vancouver, Canada, while Trent did additional work from Nothing Studios, with parts sent back and forth. Halford stated, \"Trent came in pretty much when the whole first sessions of the songs had been completed. They were well past the demo stage. We had practically mixed it down to where we felt we had something we were almost ready to release. What Trent did was basically strip it all down and re-build it. Essentially the songs are all there intact, but in terms of every aspect of the sound, drums, bass, guitars, vocals. All of that was totally re-developed. All the accessories, all the electronic sounds, samples, all of those came from Reznor and Reznor’s people.\" Reznor received an executive producer credit for his work on the album.\n\nBy September 1997, recording was completed on the album, now titled \"Voyeurs\". With the added collaboration of Reznor and Olgivie, the songs took on more of an industrial rock sound. The band initially announced their name as Gimp. After discovering another band was already using the name, they quickly changed their name to 2wo. \"Voyeurs\" was announced for release on March 10, 1998. One month prior to the release of the album, Halford would gain headlines after confirming his homosexuality to MTV. \"Voyeurs\" was led by the single \"I Am A Pig,\" which filmed a music video, shot by gay porn director Chi Chi Larue. The music video featured various porn stars and depicted non-explicit scenes of S&M. While not banned, the music video received sparse airplay, due to its mature subject matter. 2wo also signed to East West Records for European distribution of \"Voyeurs\". A Japanese edition of the album on DML would include one bonus track, entitled \"In My Head.\" Rob Halford's website would later publish two additional unreleased tracks from the \"Voyeurs\" sessions as MP3s; \"Shout\" and \"Scream.\"\n\nUpon the release of \"Voyeurs\", the band launched a tour in support of the album, though several dates were later cancelled. The live band consisted of Halford, Lowery, Sid Riggs, Ray Riendeau and former Nine Inch Nails keyboardist James Woolley. The album received a polarizing response, as many Halford fans did not enjoy 2wo's industrial sound, favoring his more traditional heavy metal sound. However, other fans embraced his diversity. \"Voyeurs\" went on to sell 47,000 copies, which was considered a commercial disappointment. When asked about his experiences with Nothing, Halford stated:\n\nA second single from \"Voyeurs\", \"Deep In The Ground,\" was considered for commercial release on East West Records in Europe, but plans were later scrapped. Upon completing their tour, Halford went back into the studio with Bob Marlette, recording demos for what was intended to be a follow-up album. One demo from these sessions, \"Silent Screams,\" was published on the 2wo website. However, member John Lowery would soon depart from 2wo, in favor of taking lead guitar duties for Nothing Records label-mates Marilyn Manson. Ultimately Halford's plans for a sophomore album were scrapped, in favor of returning to his heavy metal roots, with a new project simply titled Halford. The debut Halford album, \"Resurrection\", features the final, studio version of \"Silent Screams,\" as well as two other tracks from the original 2wo sessions; \"Slow Down\" and \"Drive,\" both of which were co-written with Bob Marlette. The break-up of 2wo likewise marked the end of the band's time of Nothing Records, with \"Voyeurs\" remaining their only commercial release on the label.\n\nIn 2003, Rob Halford reunited with Judas Priest, where he continues to front the band to wide acclaim. After Lowery's tenure with Marilyn Manson ended in 2004, he continued to perform under the name John 5. In addition to releasing solo material, he has served as guitarist for Rob Zombie since 2005. In the years since, both Halford and much of his fanbase have adopted a warmer disposition in regards to the 2wo material. Halford acknowledged a demand for a reissue of \"Voyeurs\", stating \"Everyone's asking me about the 2wo. The reason that we really haven't gone there yet is because we're trying to figure out all of the business side of that scenario. When I separated from Sanctuary in London, they gave me the opportunity to buy back all of my Halford solo material. You know, obviously the recordings and the photos and the videos and everything else. So we did a really sweet deal there and then Sony BMG have been really cool about me gaining access to all of the Fight material, because that was originally on Epic. The 2wo project was with Trent Reznor's label, Nothing Records, through Interscope. And I wasn't really sure there would be that much demand for it, but the fact is that everybody keeps asking me about it and I'm really pleased about that. 'Cause, to some extent, I think that it was overlooked, because it wasn't metal as people know me for, but it was a fantastic collaboration with Trent and what I would like for people to hear are the original recordings that Trent first listened to. And then when he became involved with Dave \"Rave\" Ogilvie from Skinny Puppy in Vancouver, the three of us put our heads together and created that final CD. So I think that it would be great if everybody had an opportunity to listen to the original songs, because they are a lot tougher, you know, they're a lot edgier. They've got more of a rock/metal vibe going to them.\" Several of these original versions were in fact published on Rob Halford's website in the early 2000s, under the name \"The Pre-Reznor Mixes\" (\"I Am A Pig,\" \"Water's Leaking,\" \"Leave Me Alone,\" \"Deep In The Ground\" and \"Bed Of Rust\"). They continue to circulate on the Internet amongst fans, but to date, neither the pre-Reznor mixes, nor the \"Voyeurs\" album, have been reissued.\n\n12 Rounds is a British rock band formed by Atticus Ross, Claudia Sarne and Adam Holden, after being introduced by mutual friends at a carnival. The trio first began collaborating musically on the 1995 Bomb The Bass album, \"Clear\". Through their time in the studio together, they decided to form their own band, originally named 12 Rounds With Jesus. After appearing with a demo of their song \"Holed\" for a cassette compilation for NME Magazine, entitled \"Past Forward\", the band was offered a deal with Polydor Records. The band then shorted their name to 12 Rounds and brought on drummer Andy Crisp.\n\nThe band's first release came in 1995, in the form of their self-titled \"12 Rounds E.P.\" (also known as the \"Something's Burning E.P.\"). The E.P. featured four tracks from their debut album, \"Jitter Juice\", while the 12\" version also featured an additional remix of \"Something's Burning,\" entitled \"Something Dub.\" The band followed with the album \"Jitter Juice\" in 1996. The \"Personally E.P.\" arrived later that year, which featured two album tracks and two exclusive songs; \"Happy Hour\" and \"Feel My Beard.\" 12 Rounds would also release a double single from the album; \"Business / Pleasant Smell\". Music videos were filmed for three tracks from the album; \"Holed,\" \"Business\" and \"Personally,\" the latter of which was helmed by acclaimed director Chris Cunningham. The track \"Something's Burning\" was also featured on the soundtrack to the film All Over Me.\n\n12 Rounds toured the UK in support of \"Jitter Juice\", opening for Sneaker Pimps. The band also played the UK festival circuit. Despite their touring and support from a major label, the band failed to attain much commercial success in their native country and received no international distribution, therefore remaining largely unknown outside of the UK. The band were ultimately dropped from Polydor and member Adam Holden parted ways with the band. Claudia Sarne recalled, \"We were the antithesis of everything Britpop represents. So we didn't go down a treat here in England when our first record came out. Our first album was rather punk and raw and in the environment of Britpop and trip hop, it really didn't stand a chance.\"\n\nDuring the summer of 1997, the band recorded an album's worth of material in their basement studio, with Atticus's brother Leopold Ross splitting guitar duties with keyboardist / guitarist Mark De Lane Lea, as well as Stanley Adler on cello. Trent Reznor would hear this material and offer them a deal with Nothing Records. However, 12 Rounds was courted by numerous other labels as well. Claudia stated, \"We were shocked by the influx of offers, but Nothing was so right for us because it's so artist-led. It's really the difference between feeling like a handmade Bristol and being on a Ford conveyor belt.\" Their sophomore album, \"My Big Hero,\" featured eight new tracks, alongside two songs from \"Jitter Juice\"; \"Something's Burning\" and \"Pleasant Smell\" (though both would have minor differences from their original versions). \"Pleasant Smell\" was released as a single on Nothing ahead of the album on June 9, 1998, featuring remixes from Trent Reznor, Charlie Clouser and Keith Hillebrandt of Nine Inch Nails, as well as Nothing Records label-mate Clint Mansell. A music video was also released for \"Pleasant Smell.\" The single was followed by the release of \"My Big Hero\" on July 14, 1998. The band then went on their first tours of the United States, with Kirk Hellie joining the band to take over guitar duties. They took opening slots for VAST and Nothing Records label-mates Marilyn Manson, as part of the first leg of their Mechanical Animals tour.\n\nAfter touring \"My Big Hero,\" the band began work on a third album, produced by Ben Hiller. After completing initial recording in England, Claudia and Atticus moved to Los Angeles in 2000 and began to do further production work on the album with Trent Reznor and former Nine Inch Nails drummer Jerome Dillon. During this time, however, Nothing Records was beginning to face an uncertain future as a record label. Nothing's parent label, Interscope, was moved under new management as part of the Vivendi / Universal merger. 12 Rounds found themselves lost in the shuffle of these corporate mergers. The band completed the album, but to date it has never been released. Meanwhile, the band remained under contract with Nothing, unable to release the music elsewhere at that time.\n\nHowever, in 2002, signs of an album release did briefly arise, when artwork for a promo EP surfaced, entitled \"Select New Recordings 2002\". The promo featured four tracks; \"Dead Man,\" \"Conspiracy,\" \"Ring Pull\" and \"Could U Be,\" while the artwork featured reused designs from \"My Big Hero\". Claudia Sarne stated on the 12 Rounds website that the band sent fifteen tracks for mastering from the third album, twelve of which would compose the final tracklist. Though a title for the third album was never revealed, the final track list was later published on the 12 Rounds website; 1. High Times, 2. Conspiracy, 3. Could U Be, 4. Big Love, 5. Ring Pull, 6. Still Water, 7. Xocet, 8. Sioux '86, 9. Chicane, 10. Bits & Pieces, 11. Dead Man, 12. Shine On.\n\nTwo additional tracks mentioned by Claudia as part of these sessions, but not included on the album, were \"Everything I Want (Drown)\" and \"Another Day With My Friend.\" The latter would be released in 2000 on the soundtrack to the Tom Tykwer film The Princess and the Warrior, under the name \"Just Another Day.\" Despite being a 12 Rounds-penned track, the song was credited to composers Pale 3 (a band which included director Tom Tykwer), \"featuring\" 12 Rounds. The song \"Dead Man\" also briefly appeared in the 2007 film . Another track from the band's time on Nothing, \"Freddy's Dead,\" was recorded for a proposed Nothing Records compilation, but the project never materialized. The track has never been officially released, however a live version recorded in 1998 can be found on the internet.\n\nWith 12 Rounds stuck in limbo, due to the eventual collapse of Nothing Records, the band began working on outside projects. Atticus Ross began recording on the Tapeworm project, alongside Reznor, Danny Lohner, Charlie Clouser and Maynard James Keenan, alongside a host of guest collaborators. Photos surfaced on the short-lived Tapeworm website, showing Atticus in the studio with the band. However, the Tapeworm material would likewise never see the light of day.\n\nIn 2004, Atticus joined his brother Leopold Ross in forming the noise rock band Error, though it would be short-lived, with a one-off E.P. being released on Epitaph Records. Atticus also made contributions to another of Leopold's rock bands, Nojahoda, although that project would also be short-lived. Atticus began to deepen his musical collaboration with Trent Reznor, beginning with the Nine Inch Nails album \"With Teeth\" in 2005. Meanwhile, Claudia Sarne would collaborate with Nothing label-mate Clint Mansell, to provide vocals to the main theme to the film The Hole in 2001. She later joined former Nine Inch Nails member Jerome Dillon's band nearLY in 2006. After the completion nearLY's debut album \"Reminder,\" the band played a handful of select live performances. These performances were recorded as a live CD/DVD, entitled \"Reminder Live\", which was self-released by the band. It included a performance of \"Chicane,\" one of the songs from 12 Rounds' unreleased third album. After the release of \"Reminder Live\", Claudia announced her departure from nearLY, with the band as a whole quietly dissolving shortly after.\n\nIn 2005, Claudia and Atticus were married. Atticus continued to emerge as an in-demand producer and programmer, working with the likes of Barry Adamson, Coheed And Cambria, Pink, Bad Religion, Korn, Saul Williams and more. Claudia and Atticus also continued to collaborate musically, shifting their focus to the film world. The couple began composing music for the cable television drama \"Touching Evil\", which was produced by the Hughes Brothers. Allen Hughes subsequently invited Atticus to compose music for his segment of the film \"New York, I Love You\" in 2008, followed by his feature film \"The Book of Eli\" in 2010.\n\nThat same year, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed their first collaborative film score together, for the David Fincher film \"The Social Network\", for which the pair won the Academy Award for Best Original Score. The duo has gone on to recorded numerous additional film scores together to critical acclaim, including \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\", for which the pair won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media, \"Gone Girl\", \"Before The Flood\", \"Patriots Day\", the Ken Burns documentary \"Vietnam\" and more. Atticus likewise garnered acclaim as a solo film composer, composing scores to Love & Mercy, \"Blackhat\", \"Triple 9\", the TV series \"Outcast\" and more, all of which featured contributions from Claudia Sarne as well. The 2013 Allen Hughes film \"Broken City\" was a particularly noteworthy 12 Rounds reunion of sorts, featuring contributions from the entire current line-up of Atticus Ross, Claudia Sarne, Leopold Ross and Kirk Hellie.\n\nOutside of their film compositions, Atticus continued his close musical partnership with Trent Reznor, recording on the Nine Inch Nails albums \"Year Zero\", \"Ghosts I-IV\", \"The Slip\" and \"Hesitation Marks\". In 2010, Ross was announced as a member of How To Destroy Angels, a project with Trent Reznor and his wife Mariqueen Mandig-Reznor. The band derived their name from a song by fellow Nothing Records act Coil. They released a self-titled EP in 2010, followed by \"An Omen EP\" in 2012 and finally a full-length album, \"Welcome Oblivion\" in 2013. The band also did a small tour in support of the album. In 2016, after over a decade of musical partnership with Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross was announced as an official member of Nine Inch Nails, with the arrival of the \"Not the Actual Events\" E.P.\n\nAfter finally reacquiring the rights to their unreleased third album, in 2009, 12 Rounds released two tracks from the album, \"Xecot\" and \"Shine On,\" as digital downloads on their website, followed by a third track, \"Sioux 86,\" in 2010. Trent Reznor was credited with additional recording for the track \"Shine On.\" In 2014, the members of 12 Rounds reunited for a performance at the Grammy Museum in Los Angeles, California, as part of a Q&A event with Atticus Ross and Elvis Mitchell for the Los Angeles Film Festival. It marked the first ever live performance by the current line-up of the band, featuring Atticus Ross, Claudia Sarne, Leopold Ross and Kirk Hellie, as well as the first performance of any kind by the band in over a decade. While not officially billed as a 12 Rounds show, the band played a short set of assorted material from their film scores, before closing their set with a performance of the song \"Chicane\" from their unreleased third album.\n\n12 Rounds was one of the few acts to remain with Nothing Records until the demise of the label, with their third album becoming one of the most oft-requested, unreleased works of the Nothing Records era. Atticus has stated the album will likely one day be released in digital format, but has described it a slow process, due to his full-time commitments to Nine Inch Nails and film composing. While 12 Rounds has never officially disbanded, the members continue to primarily focus their musical collaborations on film compositions, mostly refraining from crediting themselves under their band name.\n\nAfter completing touring in support of \"Subliminal Sandwich\", Meat Beat Manifesto would release a follow-up compilation, entitled \"Original Fire,\" on May 20, 1997. \"Original Fire\" compiled new songs, remixes and updated versions of classic tracks from the band and became a North American exclusive of Nothing Records. Play It Again Sam opted against releasing it in Europe, due in part to the fact that some of the tracks had been previously released by them on earlier, European singles from the band, such as 1996's \"It's the Music\" single, which featured a remix from Nothing Records act Plug. Amongst the remix artists on \"Original Fire\", fellow Nothing Records labelmate Luke Vibert appeared once again, this time under his own name, as well as The Orb. The band would release a music video for the song “Helter Skelter ‘97” in support of \"Original Fire\", which was directed by band member Ben Stokes. Stokes also directed the band's music videos for \"Edge of No Control,\" \"Absestos Lead Asbestos\" and \"Fromage,\" as well as directing an early video for Nothing Records label-mates Nine Inch Nails, for their song \"Down In It\" (in addition to editing their \"Head Like a Hole\" music video). \"Helter Skelter ’97\" would also be pressed as a promo single CD by Nothing Records for radio airplay. Nothing would also release most of the tracks from \"Original Fire\" on vinyl, under the name of the \"Radio Babylon\" promo-only, LP single. The 2xLP version featured an exclusive, bonus remix from Luke Vibert.\n\nThe band then set about recording their next studio album, \"Actual Sounds + Voices\". The album was led by the single \"Acid Again,\" which was released on July 7, 1998 and also received European release via Play It Again Sam. \"Actual Sounds + Voices\" followed on August 28, 1998 on Nothing Records, with a European release through Play It Again Sam. Nothing even released a double LP version of the album on vinyl. \"Actual Sounds + Voices\" featured a more prominent use of jazz, while still maintaining the group's signature sound. One remix from the \"Acid Again\" single, as well as the \"Book of Shadows\" track from \"Actual Sounds + Voices\" also appeared on the Nothing Records compilation \"Nothing Changes\", which was included with a 1998 issue of XLR8R Magazine.\n\nA second single from the album, \"Prime Audio Soup,\" would go on to become a hit for the band, due in part to being featured in the successful action film The Matrix, as well as appearing on the film’s , which also included Nothing Records label-mates Marilyn Manson. \"Prime Audio Soup\" was also released as a CD single in Europe on Play It Again Sam. The single featured remixes by Boards of Canada, The Herbaliser and Biomuse. While Nothing Records did press promo copies of the single, it was never commercially released by the label in the US.\n\nMeat Beat Manifesto is one of the few acts to have seemingly left the label on good terms. As late as 1997, Jack Dangers commented that \"I really appreciate Trent's willingness to put his money where his mouth is. Not many people have had the guts to do this. Everyone should know that Nothing have been incredibly supportive and they never try to manipulate my music. What I give them, they release... no pressure. I have artistic freedom and support from a label that truly has their shit together.. However, the band's departure from the label would amount to nothing more than their contract expiring. All of the band's releases on Nothing Records were licensed via Play It Again Sam. In 1999, the band's contract with PIAS expired, which in turn ended their licensing arrangement with Nothing Records.\n\nIn the wake of their departure from Play It Again Sam, Jack Dangers would found his own label, Tino Corp., alongside frequent MBM members/collaborators Ben Stokes and Mike Powell. There, Meat Beat Manifesto would release the \"Eccentric Objects\" EP on vinyl in 2000, as well as \"Storm The Studio RMXS\" in 2003, featuring remixes by DJ Spooky, Antipop Consortium, Jonah Sharp, Merzbow and more.\n\nHowever, in 2002, when it came time to release their next studio album, \"RUOK?\", the band opted to release it through Run Recordings, a division of Lakeshore Records. The label would also reissue their \"Storm The Studio\" and \"Armed Audio Warfare\" albums in 2003. That same year, the band released \"...In Dub\", a dub remix album of tracks from \"RUOK?\". The band also released their first DVD, \"...In Dub 5.1 Surround\" in 2004.\n\nFor their next album, \"At the Center\", the band would take a departure in sound, recording a full blown jazz album. A collaboration between Dangers and several jazz musicians, the album was released on Thirsty Ear in 2005, as part of their Blue Series. Thirsty Ear would also release the album's companion EP, \"Off-Centre\". The band would release their second DVD, \"Travelogue Live '05\", in 2006.\n\nIn 2007, the band would self-release \"Archive Things 1982-88 / Purged\", a collection of early recordings. This was followed by their next studio album, \"Autoimmune\", in 2008. The album would see a U.S. release via Metropolis Records, with a UK release via Planet Mu. Each version of the album had a slightly different tracklist from one another, as well as different artwork.\n\nIn 2010, the band released their next studio album, \"Answers Come in Dreams\". The album's name is derived from a pair of remixes Jack Dangers did for Nothing Records label-mates Coil in 1991, for their E.P. \"The Snow\". The album was once again released in the U.S. on Metropolis Records, while the UK release was handled by the Hydrogen Dukebox label.\n\nMeat Beat Manifesto's time on Nothing Records was, by all accounts, a positive experience for the band, with their departure primarily due to logistical reasons. In the years since, Dangers has spent his time bouncing from label to label, as well as self-releasing quite a bit of the band's material.\nSince the release of \"Answers Come in Dreams\", the band has kept something of a low profile. However, they have not been entirely dormant, self-releasing a couple of EPs and playing select live dates. Rumors persist of a new album being in the works, though to date, nothing has been announced.\n\nAfter the success of \"Antichrist Superstar\", Marilyn Manson entered the studio with much mainstream attention to record their third full-length album, \"Mechanical Animals\". Unlike their first two albums, \"Mechanical Animals\" would not be shepherded by Trent Reznor, who had shifted his focus back to Nine Inch Nails. Instead, the band enlisted Michael Beinhorn as principal producer, co-producing the record with Marilyn Manson, with Sean Beavan providing additional production duties. During this time, the band would also relocate from Fort Lauderdate, Florida, to Los Angeles, California, where recording commenced on the album.\n\nInspired heavily by David Bowie's \"Diamond Dogs\" album, \"Mechanical Animals\" shifted away from the industrial rock style of the band's earlier work, instead emulating a 1970s glam rock sound, epitomized by artists of that decade such as Bowie, Queen and T. Rex. Conceptually, the album delved into Manson's own struggles with fame and alienation. Manson described the album as being about \"someone who feels like they're in a place where they're not accepted or don't belong. It's more from that perspective. It's much more vulnerable music that I'm making on this new album. Both sonically and lyrically, it's about the depression of alienation, rather than the aggressiveness of it. It's about the emptiness.\" The album was a rock opera and concept album, continuing an overarching story concept, which began with \"Antichrist Superstar\", while the events of \"Mechanical Animals\" precede it.\n\n\"Mechanical Animals\" was released on September 14, 1998 on Nothing / Interscope Records. The cover art depicted an androgynous Manson, naked with breasts, six fingers and airbrushed genitalia, which stirred up more controversy for the band. One month before the album's release, the three largest retailers in the United States at the time—K-Mart, Wal-Mart and Target—refused to stock the album, citing the cover artwork and its Parental Advisory sticker. In spite of this, the album debuted at number one on the \"Billboard\" 200, with first-week sales of 223,000 units, making it the first Marilyn Manson album to top the charts. The album was led by the single \"The Dope Show\", which received heavy video and radio airplay and would go on to become the band's most commercially successful song. The music video was inspired by Alejandro Jodorowsky's film \"The Holy Mountain\", as well as the David Bowie starring film \"The Man Who Fell to Earth.\"\n\nThe band launched a series of tours to promote the album, the first being the Mechanical Animals Tour. Prior to the tour, guitarist Zim Zum opted to part ways with the band, leaving under amicable terms in order to pursue outside projects. He was replaced by Nothing Records label-mate John Lowery, who was fresh off his run with Rob Halford's 2wo project. After joining Marilyn Manson, Lowery assumed the stage name of John 5. The U.S. leg of the tour featured Nothing Records label-mates 12 Rounds performing as openers. The band then announced a co-headlining tour with Hole, called the Beautiful Monsters Tour. The tour would be ill-fated, however, due to conflicts between Manson and Hole singer Courtney Love. This led to Hole departing the tour after just nine dates. Manson subsequently enlisted Jack Off Jill and Nashville Pussy to take over select opening slots. Monster Magnet, who were already opening for Manson, assumed Hole's place on the tour's playbill, with the tour being renamed the Rock Is Dead Tour. The final four dates of the tour were canceled out of respect for the victims of the Columbine High School massacre, which brought Manson arguably the greatest controversy of his career, as the media mistakenly accused him of influencing the shooters.\n\nThe second single from the album, \"I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)\", was another video and radio hit for the band. The third single, \"Rock Is Dead\", was featured in the of the film \"The Matrix\", with the song being played during the film's end credits. The final single from the album was \"Coma White.\"\n\nWhile \"Mechanical Animals\" did garner critical acclaim, it was initially met with disappointment by longtime fans, who disliked the more mainstream sound, as well as the band's departure in style from their darker, more aggressive material. In time though, some fans adopted a warmer disposition to the material. In the wake of the album, tensions also mounted between Marilyn Manson and Trent Reznor, with both sides increasingly criticizing one other in the press. Reznor described Manson as willing to cross anyone in order to succeed, while Manson accused Reznor of destroying masters and mixes to many of the band's early, Reznor-produced songs. The two sides appeared to reconcile for a short time after \"Mechanical Animals\", when Manson appeared in Nine Inch Nails' Starfuckers, Inc. music video and made a surprise appearance at Nine Inch Nails' concert on May 9, 2000 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, performing with the band during \"Starfuckers, Inc.,\" followed by a performance of \"The Beautiful People.\" The reconciliation was short-lived, however, with both sides resuming their verbal barbs at one another through the press and their websites. In more recent years, however, tensions seem to have subsided between the two. In 2011, Reznor described Manson as \"a talented person,\" adding \"we’ve had our problems, but I wear suits... I'm an adult now.\" The following year, Manson expressed similar feelings, adding, \"I don't have any bad feelings towards him (Reznor). I really don't. He helped put me out into the world and I went my way and whatever happened happened. I don't think there is tension.\"\n\n\"Mechanical Animals\" was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on February 25, 1999 and had sold over 1,409,000 copies in the United States. It remains one of the highest selling albums to date for both the band and Nothing Records. The album was followed by the home video \"God Is in the TV\", which chronicled the band's tours in support of the album, as well as compiling all of their music videos to date. It was released on November 2, 1999 on VHS. A live album from the tour, \"The Last Tour on Earth\", followed shortly thereafter on November 16, 1999. The live album ended with a studio outtake from \"Antichrist Superstar\", entitled \"Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes.\" A claymation music video for the song was released as a single, depicting Manson as part of the Celebrity Deathmatch television show.\n\nEinstürzende Neubauten (sometimes written as EN, translated into English as Collapsing New Buildings) is an avant-garde, experimental group formed in West Berlin, Germany in 1980, by members Blixa Bargeld, N.U. Unruh and Alexander Hacke. The band established a following due to their innovative instrumentation, particularly at their live shows, which, in addition to traditional instruments, featured custom instruments built from scrap metal, found objects and power tools. Vocalist Blixa Bargeld also brought added attention by concurrently serving as long-time guitarist and backing vocalist for Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds from 1983 to 2003.\n\nOver the course of the 1980s, the band would rise through the ranks of many established labels, such as Some Bizarre Records and Rough Trade Records, where they released albums such as \"Kollaps\", \"Zeichnungen des Patienten O. T.\" (English translation: \"Drawings of Patient O.T.\"), the best of / rarities compilation \"Strategies Against Architecture 80-83\" and \"Halber Mensch\" (English translation: \"Half Man\"). Fellow, future Nothing Records label-mate Raymond Watts of Pig would also frequently serve as an engineer for the band throughout the 1980s, both in the studio and at live shows. The band capped off the 80s with the albums \"Fünf auf der nach oben offenen Richterskala\" (English translation: \"Five on the Open-Ended Richter Scale\") and \"Haus der Lüge\" (English translation: \"House of the Lie\"), both of which proved to be commercial successes in the U.S. The band's rise through the 1980s paved the way for a deal with Mute Records in the 1990s, beginning with \"Tabula Rasa\" in 1992. The album marked a change in sound for the band, shifting into softer, less abrasive songwriting and featuring expanded use of electronics. The band would also release a sequel compilation, \"Strategies Against Architecture II\", during this time.\n\nThe recording of their next album, \"Ende Neu\" (English translation: \"Ending New\"), would prove to be a difficult one, due to the departure of long-time members Mark Chung, who left at the outset of recording in 1994, as well as F.M. Einheit, who contributed much to the music and sound of the band and left a short time later in 1995, amidst recording of the album. Blixa Bargeld questioned if the band would continue, stating \"There was suddenly only three of us left, which makes it a bit tough.\" The band continued on, however, bringing on Jochen Arbeit and Rudi Moser as permanent members, alongside Ash Wednesday on keyboards for live concerts. \"Ende Neu\" was completed and released on Mute Records in 1996, with the song \"Stella Marris,\" a duet between Bargeld and Hacke's then-wife, singer Meret Becker, garnering particular acclaim. The band supported the album with a world tour.\n\nTrent Reznor had been a long-time fan of the band, openly citing his admiration for their music. Blixa Bargeld recalled meeting him at some Einstürzende Neubauten shows, stating, \"Trent Reznor used to come backstage at (our) 80s concerts.\" In 1997, Reznor successfully arranged to bring the band aboard Nothing Records. The band, which held the copyright to their album, liked the appeal of additional major label support, as well as Reznor's enthusiasm for their body of work and agreed to a licensing deal with Nothing Records. Bargeld recalled, \"Trent Reznor is so kind to contract the band, (which) he always admired.\"\n\nThe road for Einstürzende Neubauten's release on Nothing Records would prove to be a long one, however, with repeated delays pushing the Stateside release of \"Ende Neu\" back until late 1998. The album was finally released in the U.S. on October 20, 1998, featuring a bonus track, \"Bili Ruben.\" A music video for \"Stella Maris\" accompanied the album, which received minor airplay on MTV. Nothing also financed a U.S. tour for the band that autumn, which became expensive, due in part to bringing along all of the band's custom instrumentation from Germany. The tour lost an estimated $40,000 for the label, according to Bargeld.\n\nIn Europe, the band released the companion album \"Ende Neu Remixes\" on Mute Records in 1997, which featured \"Ende Neu\" tracks remixed by artists such as Barry Adamson, Pan Sonic and Darkus (a.k.a. Mark Rutherford). Darkus' remix tracks, alongside others not included on \"Ende Neu Remixes\", were made available separately in the same year on \"The NNNAAAMMM Remixes By Darkus\". Neither of these releases were picked up for licensing by Nothing Records.\n\nEinstürzende Neubauten then set about recording their next album, \"Silence Is Sexy\". By this point, much like fellow Nothing Records act 12 Rounds, the band found themselves victim to the same corporate shake-up. Nothing Records' parent company, Interscope Records, was merged with Geffen Records and A&M Records, after Interscope's owners, Seagram, purchased the other labels. By early 1999, shortly after the release of \"Ende Neu\", Interscope Records began operating under the umbrella of Interscope Geffen A&M Records. The new ownership began actively looking to cut costs and made it clear they did not have any further interest in releasing Einstürzende Neubauten's material, with Bargeld stating, \"Seagrams acquired them (Nothing / Interscope). We gave them the (\"Silence Is Sexy\") album and (Nothing Records) said that Seagrams decided not to release the record. I asked if that was a joke. We make a record deal, then they don't release it, so we left them.\" With Nothing licensing the music directly from the band, Einstürzende Neubauten were able to immediately depart from the situation. The band decided to instead allow Mute Records to handle both the European and American releases of \"Silence Is Sexy\", with the album being released in 2000.\n\n\"Strategies Against Architecture III\" followed soon after in 2001 and the band fulfilled their contract with Mute Records. Beginning in 2002, the band began recording a new album, without support from a major label, relying instead upon fan support in an experiment on their website, offering exclusive audio in exchange for paid membership. An exclusive \"Supporter Album No. 1\" and the \"Airplane Miniatures\" E.P. were made available to supporters in 2003. The band would follow this template for years to come, releasing a myriad of exclusive titles to their fans. The band released the album \"Perpetuum Mobile\" in 2004, once again returning to Mute, in part to help facilitate a world tour. \"Alles wieder offen\" (English translation: \"All Open Again\") followed in 2007, which was self-released on the band's own Potomak label. In 2014, the band returned to a major label for the release of \"Lament\" on BMG Records.\n\nEinstürzende Neubauten's time on Nothing Records would be brief, with \"Ende Neu\" standing as their sole release on the label. In 2009, \"Ende Neu\" was reissued as a remastered CD, with an expanded booklet, on Neubauten's own Potomak label. The band continues strong to this day, having garnered much critical and commercial success. They are considered to be one of the pioneers of industrial music, despite their own apathy to such accreditation. The band continues their formula of releasing major albums on labels, supplemented by a wealth of self-released material direct to fans.\n\nAutechre arrived at Nothing via a licensing deal with their UK label, Warp Records, as part of a package which also included Warp acts Squarepusher and Plaid being picked up by the label. Autechre is the duo of Rob Brown and Sean Booth of Greater Manchester, England. Their sound was considered pioneering within the electronic music scene, with their early work rooted in techno, house, electro and hip hop, while their later efforts ventured into more experimental soundscapes. At the time, Warp was emerging as one of the premier labels for electronic music, with many of their acts being licensed to esteemed labels in the US, such as Sire (Aphex Twin, Jimi Tenor), Matador (Red Snapper, Two Lone Swordsmen) and Wax Trax! (Nightmares On Wax, Autechre). These licensing deals, in addition to Warp's highly acclaimed Artificial Intelligence series, in which Autechre participated, would help cement both Warp Records and their rosters' global presence and influence. Nothing Records became the next in this revered line of labels to collaborate with Warp, after Nothing label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto claimed to have introduced many of the Warp acts' music to Trent Reznor.\n\nPrior to their arrival at Nothing, much of Autechre's back-catalog had seen release through Wax Trax! / TVT, in a similar licensing deal with Warp, which saw the US release of their EP, \"Basscad.EP\", as well as their albums \"Incunabula\", \"Amber\" and \"Tri Repetae++\", the latter of which was packaged as a double-disc set to include their \"Anvil Vapre\" and \"Garbage\" EPs. After the licensing deal with Wax Trax! lapsed, Autechre released their \"Chiastic Slide\" album, which did not receive US release at the time.\n\nBy 1998, Autechre had completed their fifth album, \"LP5\". Upon being picked up by Nothing Records, Autechre's Sean Brown commented on the advantages of being on a major label, stating \"It's really interesting working with him (Trent Reznor). It's a learning exercise as much as anything. I don't know what's going to happen with it (being on Nothing Records). It's a long time going and it's like after that, whatever, if someone comes along and offers you a ridiculous amount of money. It's much more than we needed, but it's like it's turned out really useful, because we've managed to get everything going.\"\n\n\"LP5\" was released on October 26, 1998 on Nothing Records in the US, with the label releasing Plaid's \"Not For Threes\" and Squarepusher's \"Big Loada\" the same day. Two tracks from the album, \"Vose In\" and \"Corc,\" also appeared on the Nothing Records compilation \"Nothing Changes\", which was included with a 1998 issue of XLR8R Magazine. Autechre would continue to be licensed by Nothing Records until 2000, with Nothing working in tandem with Warp to release nearly all of the duo's new material in the US during this period. In 1999, Nothing released Autechre's \"Peel Session\" (a live recording from John Peel's legendary radio show - a second session of which was released by Warp in 2000) and \"EP7\". The Warp CD edition of \"EP7\" included a hidden track 00, which could be heard by starting track one of the CD, then rewinding backwards. Manufacturing issues prevented the hidden track 00 from inclusion on the Nothing Records edition. Also in 1999, Autechre released the \"SplitRmx12\" promo-only 12\", which featured an Autechre cover of Neu!. While \"SplitRmx12\" never received any official release through Nothing Records, Warp pressed 3,000 copies, with 500 assigned to the UK. A portion were assigned to the US, for which Nothing Records assisted in North American distribution to US record stores, on behalf of Warp.\n\nAutechre's time at Nothing Records would conclude when Warp Records established their own US distribution, though a deal with Caroline Distribution (which has since ended), effectively ending all of Warp's licensing to Nothing. Autechre's licensing through Wax Trax! and Nothing Records helped establish a US following for the act and by the time they began receiving direct US release via Warp, the duo had risen in stature to being one of the premier acts in electronic music. All three of their Nothing Records releases were eventually reissued in the US under the Warp umbrella, after the Nothing deal ended. Autechre remain going strong to this day, where they continue to call Warp Records their home, having released numerous albums to critical acclaim in the years to follow, such as \"Confield\", \"Draft 7.30\", \"Untilted\", \"Quaristice\", \"Oversteps\", \"Exai\" and \"elseq 1–5\".\n\nSquarepusher, much like label-mates Autechre and Plaid, came aboard Nothing via a licensing deal with Warp. Squarepusher is Tom Jenkinson of Chelmsford, Essex, England. After learning bass guitar and playing in local bands in his youth, Tom began taking an interest in techno and house music in the early 1990s. Amongst his influences were Aphex Twin and future Nothing Records label-mate Luke Vibert, particularly with his work as Plug. Jenkinson said of Plug's track \"Military Jazz,\" \"This track came on and, amongst the road noise and chatter, I heard what I thought was some sort of hip-hop track being played by a band. As the track progressed, I became more intrigued, as it sounded like they were trying to play as if it had been programmed. Then the Amen [break] came in, and I was floored; it sounded like a drummer playing breakbeats, and made me totally rethink my ideas of programming breaks.\"\n\nJenkinson's first recordings came out under his own name, with the \"Stereotype E.P.\" on the Nothings Clear label in 1994, which was financed by Jenkinson himself, alongside his friend Hardy Finn, the latter of whom would go on to found the Spymania label. The EP did not receive the level of attention Jenkinson had hoped for, but it did catch the ear of Grant Wilson-Claridge of Rephlex Records, who contacted Tom to express his compliments.\n\nJenkinson went on to record a few more releases under his own name, including the \"Crot E.P.\" and \"Bubble And Squeak E.P.\", as well as a split with Dunderhead, called \"Dragon Disc 2\". In 1995, Tom began releasing music under the name Squarepusher, first appearing with the \"\", then following with \"Alroy Road Tracks\" under the name Duke Of Harringay, both on Finn's Spymania label. By 1996, Squarepusher had line up material for release at Rephlex Records, which was operated by Grant Wilson-Claridge and Richard D. James, a.k.a. Aphex Twin. Squarepusher released the \"Squarepusher Plays...\" 12\" for Rephlex, followed by his debut album, \"Feed Me Weird Things\" (Jenkinson later released an album and E.P. under the name Chaos A.D. for Rephlex in 1998).\n\nShortly after the release of \"Feed Me Weird Things\", Squarepusher released his first music for Warp Records in the form of the \"Port Rhombus EP\" in 1996. Jenkinson signed a multi-album deal with Warp and the label would become his long-time and primary home. The \"Vic Acid\" EP was released in 1997, followed by his sophomore full-length, \"Hard Normal Daddy\". Later that year, Warp and Sypmania would co-release \"Burningn'n Tree\", which compiled the \"Conumber E:P\" and \"Alroy Road Tracks\", alongsing three previously unreleased tracks.\n\nAlso in 1997, the \"Big Loada\" EP was released on Warp. By 1998, the Nothing deal had come into place and Squarepusher would receive his first licensing into the United States, after Nothing label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto claimed to have introduced his music to Trent Reznor. Nothing decided to revisit the \"Big Loada\" EP and expand it into album length, adding on all tracks from the \"Port Rhombus EP\" and two tracks (\"Lone Ravers (Live In Chelmsford Mix)\" and \"The Barn (303 Kebab Mix)\") from \"Vic Acid\". The song \"Come On My Selector\" was also moved up to open the album, with a music video for the track directed by Chris Cunningham, which was included as a file on the Nothing edition, as an enhanced CD. Two tracks from \"Big Loada\", \"Tequila Fish\" and \"Massif (Stay Strong),\" also featured on the Nothing Records compilation \"Nothing Changes\", which was included with a 1998 issue of XLR8R Magazine.\n\nNothing did not pick up \"Hard Normal Daddy\" for release, but did pick up most of Squarepusher's output through the remainder of the 1990s. \"Music Is Rotted One Note\" was released on October 13, 1998, the same day as Nothing version of \"Big Loada\". The mini album \"Budakhan Mindphone\" followed on March 1, 1999. The \"Maximum Priest E.P.\" was released July 19, 1999, which featured remixes from Nothing Records label-mates Autechre and Luke Vibert (under the name Wagon Christ). The final Squarepusher album to see release on Nothing Records was \"Selection Sixteen\" on November 8, 1999. Aside from \"Big Loada\", all of the Squarepusher releases on Nothing Records were essentially identical to the Warp editions.\n\nSquarepusher's tenure at Nothing Records concluded when Warp Records established their own US distribution, though a deal with Caroline Distribution (which later expired), effectively ending all of Warp's licensing to Nothing. Squarepusher's licensing through Nothing Records served Jenkinson well in helping to establish his US following. By the time he began receiving direct US release via Warp, Squarepusher had become known as one of the most innovative acts in electronic music. All five of his Nothing Records releases were eventually reissued in the US under the Warp umbrella after the Nothing deal ended, though the album-length version of \"Big Loada\" remains unique to Nothing Records, with Warp opting to keep the releases in their original, EP formats. Squarepusher continues to push new boundaries to this day, where he still calls Warp Records his home, having released numerous albums to critical acclaim in the years to follow, such as \"Go Plastic\", \"Do You Know Squarepusher\", \"Ultravisitor\", \"Hello Everything\", \"Just A Souvenir\", \"Solo Electric Bass 1\", \"Ufabulum\" and \"Damogen Furies\". Also in recent years, Jenkinson has launched a live band, Shobaleader One, which releases both original material and reinterpered versions of Squarepusher classics. They have released two albums to date; \"\" and \"Elektrac\".\n\nPlaid, alongside label-mates Autechre and Squarepusher, was part of a trio of Warp acts picked up for licensing in the United States after their label struck a deal with Nothing Records. Plaid is the British duo of Ed Handley and Andy Turner. Both began as founding members of the electronic group The Black Dog, alongside Ken Downie. Handley and Turner would appear on numerous albums with The Black Dog during the early 1990s, which received critical acclaim, including \"Bytes\", \"Temple of Transparent Balls\", \"Parallel\" and \"Spanners\". In 1991, Handley and Turner released \"Mbuki Mvuki\", their debut under the name of Plaid. The album was self-released on their Black Dog Productions imprint. They followed up in 1994 with a collaboration with Mind Over Rhythm, entitled \"Mind Over Rhythm Meets The Men From Plaid On The Planet Luv\" on Rumble Records.\n\nAfter five years recording with The Black Dog, Handley and Turner opted to pursue recording as Plaid full-time in 1995, while Downie continued The Black Dog as a separate venture. Plaid released the \"Android\" EP that same year for the Clear label, before signing with Warp Records, which had previously worked with them, during their time with The Black Dog. Plaid released their debut album for Warp in 1997, entitled \"Not for Threes\". The album was preceded by the single \"Undoneson\". \"Not For Threes\" featured a notable guest appearance on the track \"Lilith\" from Björk, with whom the duo had collaborated many times over the years, providing remixing and songwriting duties for her on multiple occasions.\n\nIn 1998, Plaid was picked up for licensing on Nothing Records in the United States, after Nothing label-mate Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto claimed to have introduced the Warp acts to Trent Reznor. Nothing released the US edition of \"Not For Threes\" on October 13, 1998. The Nothing version removed the track \"OI\" off the album, while adding on \"Undoneson\" and \"Spudink\" from the \"Undoneson\" single. \"Undoneson\" and an exclusive remix, \"Abla Eedio (Freemix),\" also appeared on the Nothing Records compilation \"Nothing Changes\", which was included with a 1998 issue of XLR8R Magazine.\n\nIn 1999, Plaid released \"Peel Session\", a live recording from John Peel's legendary radio show. Nothing released the \"Peel Session\" in the US on April 20, 1999, which featured no audio alterations from the Warp edition. Plaid followed up with a sophomore album, \"Rest Proof Clockwork\", the same year. The album featured a hidden track called \"Face Me,\" featuring Alison Goldfrapp. The Nothing Records edition was released on June 21, 1999, featuring an identical track list to the Warp edition, including the hidden track. Plaid also announced the \"Booc\" EP in the late 1990s, but it suffered repeated delays, before finally surfacing on Warp in 2000. It was not picked up for US release by Nothing Records.\n\n\"Rest-Proof Clockwork\" would be Plaid's final release on Nothing Records, as Warp Records established their own US distribution in the early 2000s, via a deal with Caroline Distribution (which later expired), effectively ending all of Warp's licensing to Nothing. Warp would later reissue all three of Plaid's Nothing-released titles in the US. Plaid would go on to become known as one of Warp's most critically acclaimed and tenured acts, earning a dedicated, worldwide fanbase within the electronic scene. Plaid went on to release several more albums, including \"Trainer\" (a compilation of early Plaid work, including the complete \"Mbuki Mvuki\" album), \"Double Figure\", \"Spokes\", \"Plaid Remixes (Parts in the Post)\" (a compilation of Plaid remixes), \"Greedy Baby\" (an audio-visual collaboration with Bob Jaroc), \"Scintilli\", \"Reachy Prints\" and \"The Digging Remedy\". Plaid also recorded soundtracks for the films \"Tekkonkinkreet\" (which included a Plaid remix album, \"Tekkonkinkreet Remix Tekkinkonkreet\"), \"Heaven's Door\" and the interactive short film \"The Carp And The Seagull\".\n\nMicko Westmoreland was born in 1971 in Leeds, England and had an ear for music from a very young age, learning guitar, keyboards and bass. Throughout his youth, Micko would dabble in traditional instrumentation, until 1990, when his decks and records were stolen. Using insurance money received as a result of the theft, Micko decided to purchase an Atari and synth and began his first experimentations in electronic music. While still developing his sound, during his time in college, Micko would collaborate with musician Brian Eno and a host of other young artists on the \"Self Storage\" exhibition at Wembley.\n\nBy the mid 1990s, Micko had honed his skills as an electronic producer and began recording as The Bowling Green; the name being derived from the venue on which the sport of bowls is played. The sound of The Bowling Green crossed many styles of electronica, incorporating a distinct sense of retro and nostalgia. Micko's earliest music to reach public ears would be for his brother, Wash Westmoreland, who began as a gay porn director, though he would later transition into an acclaimed independent filmmaker. Micko provided the music to many of his brother's gay porn films, often credited under the name The Bowling Green, including \"Naked Highway\", \"Technical Exctasy\", \"Animus\" and \"The Seven Deadly Sins: Gluttony\".\n\nThe first track from The Bowling Green to see commercial release was on Rising High Records' \"Further Self Evident Truths\" compilation, with the track \"Imparticular\" included on \"Volume 3\" of the series (alongside future Nothing Records label-mate Plug). Around this time, Micko approached numerous labels and several responded with offers. Ultimately, he decided on Blue Planet Recordings, a sub-label of Silver Planet Recordings, on the basis that Blue Planet promised Micko some studio time. Micko recalled, \"So they lent me their studio and I used to go in there on Sundays and work for 23 hours and finish the mixes at about 8 in the morning, which is quite hellish really. The results of his studio time would be The Bowling Green's debut \"Mingle EP\" 12\" in 1996. This was followed by the \"Chaise Longue EP\" in 1997, which featured a remix from Blue Planet and future Nothing Records label-mate Plug.\n\nThe music would catch the attention of Trent Reznor and Nothing Records, which had just licensed Luke Vibert's Plug project from the Blue Planet label. Nothing Records offered to license The Bowling Green from Blue Planet and Micko joined the label in November 1997. The Bowling Green would release \"The Receptionist E.P.\" on Blue Planet in 1998, as well as appear on compilations for electronic labels Law & Auder, Dot and Shadow Records. Micko also began working on a debut album, opting to record in a home studio, appropriately named The Spare Room, in Ladbroke Grove, West London. The resulting album, \"One Pound Note\", was released in the UK on Blue Planet Recordings in June 1998. Shortly after the release, Micko appeared alongside Si Begg on the John Peel Sessions.\n\nIn October 1998, Micko gained further attention for an acting role in filmmaker Todd Haynes' glam rock drama \"Velvet Goldmine\", starring alongside Ewan McGregor, Christian Bale, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Toni Collette and Eddie Izzard. Micko played the mysterious Jack Fairy, who was loosely inspired by musicians Brian Eno and Marc Bolan. The role came about by chance for Micko, as Todd Haynes had been taking residence in the home of Micko's brother, Wash Westmoreland, while shooting his film \"Safe\". Todd had met Micko though his brother and felt there would be a place for him somewhere in his new film, \"Velvet Goldmine\". Initially auditioning for a minor part, Micko was instead cast in the pivotal role of Jack Fairy.\n\nThe first appearance of The Bowling Green on Nothing Records came with two tracks from \"One Pound Note\" being featured on the label sampler \"Nothing Changes\", which was included with an issue of XLR8R Magazine in 1998. Nothing Records then released \"One Pound Note\" in the United States on January 19, 1999. The album contained numerous samples, including dialogue from the 1973 cult horror film, The Wicker Man. The album's samples were left in tact for the U.S. release, with the exception of the song \"Gentleman Reverse,\" which was cut from the U.S. edition, due to sample clearance issues.\n\nThe Bowling Green's run on Nothing Records would be limited to the release of \"One Pound Note\", as the Blue Planet label would go on hiatus shortly thereafter (before eventually going defunct altogether after a brief return from 2004 - 2005). This left The Bowling Green in need of a new UK label and subsequently ended their licensing deal to Nothing Records. In 2002, The Bowling Green signed with Spiky Records in the UK, which released his sophomore album, \"Fabrications\". The album marked a shift in sound for Micko, with many tracks more focused on songwriting. In addition, Spiky released three 12\" singles around the \"Fabrications\" album; \"Pre-Fabrications Vol. One\", \"Pre-Fabrications Vol. Two\" and \"Tigons And Liger\", featuring remixes from µ-ziq and Si Begg's Buckfunk 3000 project.\n\nAfter the release of \"Fabrications\", Micko opted to no longer record as The Bowling Green. In 2001, he recorded music for his brother Wash Westmoreland's film \"The Fluffer\", as well as his 2006 film, Quinceañera. The latter would win both the Audience Award and the Grand Jury Prize at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival. In 2009, Micko Westmoreland would release his first solo album under his own name, entitled \"Wax & Wayne\", on Terry Edwards' Sartorial Records. The album marked a significant change in sound for Micko, leaving electronic music behind, in favor of a British indie rock sound. In 2010, however, Micko released an electronic project known as Wooden Spaceship in the U.S. on I, Absentee. The Wooden Spaceship material, which amounted to a one-off, self-titled EP, hearkened back to the electronic nostalgia and wonky beats of Micko's electronic roots and represented a bridge between The Bowling Green and his later, eponymous solo material.\n\nIn 2015, Micko launched his own label, Landline Records, which released his sophomore album under his own name, entitled \"Yours Etc Abc\". Micko also digitally reissued The Bowling Green albums \"One Pound Note\" and \"Fabrications\" on Landline Records in 2016. The same year, Micko digitally released a collection of both The Bowling Green and Micko Westmoreland remixes, simply titled \"Remixes\" and featuring tracks from the old The Bowling Green 12\"s, which included remixes by Luke Vibert, Mike Paradinas and Si Begg, amongst others. In 2017, Landline Records digitally reissued the \"Wooden Spaceship\" EP. Micko continues to use Landline Records as his primary musical outlet.\n\nFive years after the highly successful release of \"The Downward Spiral\", Nine Inch Nails delivered their third album, \"The Fragile\", in 1999. In the time between albums, Reznor had busied himself with numerous other projects for Nothing, such as Marilyn Manson's \"Antichrist Superstar\" album, the \"Lost Highway\" soundtrack and Rob Halford's 2wo project. Prior to recording the album, longtime drummer Chris Vrenna would part ways from the band, going on to launch his own project, Tweaker. Bill Rieflin and Jerome Dillon would take over drumming duties for the album, with the latter becoming the full-time, replacement drummer for the band, until 2005. \"The Fragile\" was produced by Trent Reznor and Alan Moulder at Nothing Studios in New Orleans.\n\nThe project developed into a major undertaking, becoming a double album. Canadian rock producer Bob Ezrin was consulted on the album's final track listing, in an effort to assemble the songs into a cohesive presentation. Unlike the gritty angst of \"The Downward Spiral\", \"The Fragile\" relied more of melody, ambient noise and atmospheric soundscapes. Thematically, it is a concept album dealing with Reznor's personal issues at that time, which included depression, anger and drug abuse.\n\nThis first single from the album, \"The Day the World Went Away\", was released in North America on July 20, 1999. A music video was shot for the song, but went unreleased at the time (although parts eventually surfaced on 2002's \"And All That Could Have Been\" DVD). A television commercial for the album then aired on the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, with Nine Inch Nails also performing the album's title song, \"The Fragile,\" live on the show. \"The Fragile\" was released on CD, vinyl and cassette on September 21, 1999 and debuted at number 1 on the \"Billboard\" 200 with sales of 228,000 units, making it the first Nine Inch Nails album to top the charts. Each edition of the album featured minor variations in the track listing. The vinyl edition, pressed on 3 LPs, featured two tracks not available on the CD version; \"10 Miles High\" and \"The New Flesh.\" The intros and outros of each sides are also different from the CD, particularly the song \"Ripe,\" which does not have the \"(with Decay)\" section. The cassette edition features an extended version of the song \"Please,\" entitled \"Please (+ Appendage).\"\n\n\"We're in This Together\" was released as a three part CD single in Europe on December 14, 1999. The discs featured the bonus tracks from the vinyl, a Porter Ricks remix and an extended mix of \"The Perfect Drug.\" A music video was also shot and released for the song. The third single from the album, \"Into the Void,\" was released on CD in Australia on May 9, 2000, featuring no exclusive content. Another music video was shot and released for the song.\n\nThe band embarked on a worldwide tour in support of the album, with the first leg, entitled \"Fragility 1.0,\" taking place in Europe, with Atari Teenage Riot performing as openers. Interscope Records reportedly refused to fund the promotional tour, following \"The Fragile's\" lukewarm sales, which had dropped sharply after its first week of release. Reznor instead committed to fund the entire tour himself, which quickly sold out. He concluded that \"the reality is, I'm broke at the end of the tour\", but also added, \"I will never present a show that isn't fantastic.\" A television special, entitled \"Fragilty 1.0,\" aired as a 30-minute special on MTV on December 21, 1999, showcasing the first leg of the tour.\n\nThe North American leg of the tour, entitled \"Fragility 2.0\" followed, with A Perfect Circle serving as guest openers. Rolling Stone magazine named Fragility the best tour of 2000. A music video was shot for \"Starfuckers, Inc.,\" with the song renamed \"Starsuckers, Inc.\" to accommodate mainstream airplay. The music video features Reznor mocking rock stars such as Courtney Love, Billy Corgan, Marilyn Manson and even Reznor himself. Reznor and Manson had been exchanging verbal barbs in the press during this time, so the video marked a brief reconciliation with the pair, with Manson appearing in and co-directing the video. Manson also made a surprise appearance at Nine Inch Nails' concert on May 9, 2000 at Madison Square Garden in New York City, performing with the band during \"Starfuckers, Inc.,\" followed by a performance of Manson's \"The Beautiful People.\"\n\nA remix album for \"The Fragile\", entitled \"Things Falling Apart\", was released on November 21, 2000. The album featured remixes from members of the band, as well as Adrian Sherwood, Dave Ogilvie and Telefon Tel Aviv. The release also includes a cover of the Gary Numan song \"Metal.\" Nine Inch Nails also released a new song, entitled \"Deep,\" on the soundtrack to the film in 2001. The band shot a music video to accompany the song, which did not feature any footage from the film.\n\nNine Inch Nails released their first live album, \"And All That Could Have Been\", on CD, DVD and VHS on January 22, 2002. The CD included a bonus disc of softer renditions of older songs, as well as new material, entitled \"Still\". Some tracks from \"Still\" evolved from rejected themes originally written for Mark Romanek's 2002 film \"One Hour Photo\". The DVD featured live footage shot on the \"Fragility 2.0\" leg of the tour. The DVD also featured a performance of \"The Day The World Went Away\" as a hidden, bonus feature, which was intercut with clips of the song's unreleased music video. Marilyn Manson's guest performance with Nine Inch Nails at Madison Square Garden was also included as a hidden feature.\n\n\"The Fragile\" was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 4, 2000, denoting shipments of two million copies in the United States. The album received a mostly favorable critical reception and has gone on to be considered a favorite amongst fans of the band. In 2017, Nine Inch Nails released a vinyl reissue of the album, as well as \"The Fragile: Deviations 1\"; a 4-LP set assembled by Reznor and Atticus Ross, featuring instrumentals and alternate takes, alongside numerous rare and unreleased tracks from the era.\n\nAt the conclusion of \"The Fragile\" era, Trent admitted himself into rehab and began to sober up, putting Nine Inch Nails on hiatus. It was during this time of recovery that Reznor would begin looking into the finances of Nine Inch Nails, which would lead to a lawsuit against his then-manager and Nothing Records president, John Malm, Jr. Their falling out would become one of the major catalysts in the eventual demise of the label.\n\nFollowing a peak period of activity over the course of the late 1990s, the output of Nothing Records began to slow after 2000. Many of the smaller artists were experiencing trouble with the label, due to increasing corporate interference, as a result of numerous corporate mergers. Since its inception, Nothing Records operated as a division of Interscope Records. While Nothing artists had experienced some issues with Interscope, it wasn't until Seagram's came into the fold that the corporate interference began to cripple the label from operating under its original vision. Interscope was owned by Universal, which in turn was owned by Seagram's. Seagrams acquired Polygram and merged it with Universal, after which Vivendi acquired Seagrams. The new corporate leadership came in looking to cut costs, giving the edict to cut many smaller artists, which affected many labels, including Nothing Records. Bands like Einstürzende Neubauten, Prick and 12 Rounds found their material being declined for release. Many acts would part ways from the label during this time. Warp Records would also establish their own US distribution through Caroline Distribution, resulting in all of their Nothing Records licensed acts departing from the label. Meanwhile during this period, Trent Reznor admitted himself into rehab and focused much of his energy into getting himself healthy. Only one new act arrived on the label during this tumultuous period; The The. Their experiences would lead to a very public departure from the label, serving as example of the greater problems plaguing not only Nothing Records, but the greater music industry as a whole. Their album, \"NakedSelf\", served as something of a death knell for the label, after which only Nine Inch Nails and Marilyn Manson would continue bearing the label's name on their releases.\n\nPrior to arriving at Nothing Records, The The was an established, commercial success, with many critically acclaimed, hit albums, such as \"Infected\", \"Mind Bomb\" and \"Dusk\" over the course of the 1980s and early 1990s. The The is an English rock band, fronted by singer/songwriter Matt Johnson, who has served as the only constant member of the band since its formation. After having spent the majority of their career on Epic Records, the band found themselves at creative odds with their label over the recording of The The's 1997 album \"Gun Sluts\". The songs were more experimental in nature and Epic requested that Johnson revise the album to add more radio-friendly content, to which Johnson refused. Johnson also delivered a second studio album, entitled \"NakedSelf\", to the label. \"They didn't like that either. They asked me if I could make it more commercial and I was outraged. I said 'forget it,'\" Johnson recalled. With both sides at an impasse, Johnson decided it was time to part ways with Epic. After a year of legal wrangling, the band was finally freed from their deal with Epic / Sony. In spite of their creative differences, Johnson stated, \"The split from them was amicable, it wasn't acrimonious. I had a very positive relationship with Epic at that time, but they became really, really pop oriented and I was thoroughly marginalized.\"\n\nFor the first time in eighteen years, The The were free agents, in search of a new label. Nothing Records president John A. Malm, Jr. was a huge fan of The The and became eager to sign them to Nothing Records. Trent Reznor too had been a big fan of the band, stating \"Matt Johnson's music was one of the main reasons I began working on Nine Inch Nails. The passion, the honesty and the nakedness of his work opened doors of possibilities in my head.\" A contract offer from Nothing was accepted by the band in 1999, with Johnson initially very optimistic about the ideology of label and their partnership, commenting at the time, \"The music industry is increasing corporatization, homogenization and general awfulness. It was a simple decision for me to choose Nothing Records, I feel we share many of the same beliefs and passions and already it feels like a natural home to me. I'm feeling galvanized and extremely excited about the next few years.\"\n\nAlthough the band already had \"Gun Sluts\" completed, they opted to leave it unreleased, which is how it remains to this day. Instead Johnson decided to focus on \"NakedSelf\" for Nothing Records. \"NakedSelf\" did, however, feature one track, \"DesielBreeze,\" from the unreleased \"Gun Sluts\" album. Overall, the album was a mature, contemplative piece, released on February 29, 2000 on Nothing Records to wide critical acclaim. A deluxe CD version was also released, featuring an expanded booklet of photography. Instead of a traditional music video to promote the album, the band filmed a trailer for the album. The \"NakedSelf\" trailer featured several excerpts from album set to video footage, as well as interview clips with Matt Johnson. The trailer appeared on The The's website and was released as a promotional piece to press and music video outlets. However, it quietly vanished from circulation in subsequent years and has become sought-after by collectors.\n\n\"NakedSelf\" was led by the single \"ShrunkenMan\". However, instead of featuring remixes, Johnson recruited other musicians to record cover versions of the song, including Foetus, John Parish and DAAU. The resulting single was titled \"Interpretations: Issue 1 - ShrunkenMan\". The single was released on April 10, 2000, exclusively in the UK, with no American release. The title referenced future planned volumes for other singles from the album, which would follow the same cover song format, but their struggles with the label would ultimately result in the series ending at just a single volume. The band also embarked on their \"World Tour of Tiny Spaces\" in support of the album; a fourteen-month trek that would span the globe. While on tour, the band pressed self-released a single for \"Gun Sluts\", which was a one-track single featuring the eponymous song from the unreleased album. The CD single was initially available exclusively on tour, then later through the band's website.\n\nIt was during the promotional stage of the album that Matt Johnson began to feel a heightened frustration with the lack of support from Nothing Records. Johnson recalled, \"In Detroit, I got a call from an NPR station. They said they'd been begging the label for copies of the album and they wouldn't give them one. NPR had to beg and phone and beg and eventually got one. Then the NPR affiliate had to send someone to drive forty minutes to pick me up and take me to the station to do the interview, because the record label wouldn't do it. I've never known anything like it.\" With a great deal of personal, professional and emotional investment in \"NakedSelf\", Johnson began to feel deep unhappiness toward his partnership with Nothing Records and the emerging, corporate conglomerate controlling them, which consisted of Interscope Records, Universal Music Distribution, Seagram's and Vivendi Entertainment. While many of the other acts on the label opted to quietly depart, or fight their battles in private, Johnson elected to make his battle very public, publishing an essay on his website called \"The The Vs. The Corporate Monster.\" The essay detailed Johnson's extreme dissatisfaction over his experiences with the label, although his targets were primarily Seagrams and the larger music corporations as a whole. Johnson wrote in the essay:\n\nIn order to get the green light for the Universal/PolyGram merger, Seagrams promised their shareholders a return on cuts, not profits. They have a huge artist stable raped from three established major labels and two thirds has got to go, bringing it down to a trim, wealthy machine made up of just the plump ripe sellers. Millions of sales are now required to cover the increasing overheads at these labels. Overheads increased through ludicrous executive bonus payouts, inflated expense accounts and the quest for the Porsche. The artist is put to work harder and faster, in order to feed the machine. VivendiUniversalSonyAOLTimeEmiWarnerBMG, all represent a basket of share dividends to holders who are quick to move on when the coming gets tough. After a 7 year lay off, I recently released \"NakedSelf\", an album that is generally considered one of the best of my career to some of the best reviews I've ever had. I've also been on tour since November 1999 selling out shows by word of mouth across Europe and America to fantastic audience response. Yet the reaction from Interscope/Universal has been destructive and negative in the extreme. Their utter dependence on the radio means that the good ship The The is abandoned as soon as the fear of no-play takes hold. They can think of no alternative and why should they when they can swiftly move on to the next act on the plank (step forward Beck, whoops! step forward Nine Inch Nails..oh dear, No Doubt..Ouch! Chris Cornell...?) One act after another has fallen into the ocean. Being signed to the Universal conglomerate has been like being trapped on a cruise on the Mary Celeste. The lights are on but nobody's home.\n\nJohnson also took the time to credit select individuals within these corporations, who were overpowered by the merges, stating \"There are many decent, hard working people in this company who wanted to work in the music business for all the right reasons, but now find their hands are tied behind their backs as they are not allowed to get behind the projects they really believe in.\"\n\nAlong with the essay, Johnson made a bold move at the time, by opting to give away \"NakedSelf\" for free on The The's website, on a track by track, weekly basis. He stated:\n\nAs Universal/Interscope seem either incapable or unwilling (or both) to distribute and promote my album properly, and as they've refused to give it back to me, then I've been forced to consider alternative ways of reaching my audience. After much deliberation I have therefore decided to offer free downloads of \"NakedSelf\" on a song by song/week by week basis from my official site. www.thethe.com. By doing so I hope more people (including the bulk of my audience) will finally get the chance to hear this album and hopefully support me by purchasing this CD and future releases. For me to just walk away from \"NakedSelf\" now would be like leaving a baby on a doorstep and I just can't do it. I believe in this album too much.\n\nIn the wake of the essay, the relationship between The The and Interscope/Universal became very publicly toxic. Plans for a second single for \"TheWhisperers,\" made it as far as a promo single pressing. Plans were in the works for a follow-up \"Interpertations: Issue 2 - TheWhisperers\", but these plans were scrapped. The The then parted ways with Nothing Records.\n\nIn 2002, after their departure from Nothing Records, The The returned to their former label, Epic, with whom Johnson still had an amicable relationship, to revisit the band's back catalogue. The band released a best-of collection, entitled \"\", which included two new songs, \"Pillar Box Red\" and \"Deep Down Truth.\" The band also released the \"London Town 1983 - 1993\" box set, which was composed of remastered reissues of their albums \"Soul Mining\", \"Infected\", \"Mind Bomb\" and \"Dusk\", as well as an exclusive fifth disc, featuring a soundtrack piece called \"In The AM.\" The reissued albums were all also released individually, featuring new cover artwork.\n\nIn June 2002, The The played the Meltdown Festival in at London's Royal Festival Music Hall as guests of David Bowie. The performance consisted of Matt Johnson and J. G. Thirlwell performing tapes and loops before video projections. Also available at the show was an exclusive double CD, entitled \"Film Music\". The first disc, called \"Silent Tongue\", consisted of unreleased film music, while the second disc was the \"45 RPM\" collection. It was never made available again after the show and remains one of the most sought-after releases amongst fans. The performance also remains The The's final show to date, although Johnson has announced a series of new The The shows for 2018; their first in 16 years.\n\nAfter 2002, Johnson entered a long-term, self-imposed exile from the music industry, with only sparse releases of the band, all self-released through Johnson's Lazarus label. In 2007, the band released a single for a new song, entitled \"Mrs Mac\", an autobiographical song about Johnson's first day at school as a child. In 2010, they released a CD soundtrack to the film \"Tony\", which was directed by Matt Johnson's brother, \"Gerard Johnson\". In 2012, they released a soundtrack to the film \"Moonbug\", directed by Nichola Bruce. In 2015, the band released another soundtrack to the film \"Hyena\", also directed by Johnson's brother Gerard. In 2017, the film \"The Inertia Variations\", directed by Johanna St. Michaels began playing the film festival circuit. The documentary chronicles the band's career. To celebrate the release of the film, the band released a new 7-inch single, \"We Can't Stop What's Coming\" for Record Store Day in 2017, collaborating once again with Johnny Marr.\n\nJohnson has become known as a reclusive artist, staying far removed from the public eye for most of the time since \"NakedSelf\". However, he has sporadically released 15-minute broadcasts during his sabbatical, called Radio Cinéola, available for download from the band's website. The Radio Cinéola broadcasts have featured quite a number of rare and unreleased The The songs, including several from the band's era with Nothing Records. Episode 6 of the show, entitled \"Blue Moon in June,\" featured the song \"Justice 4 Jesus,\" which is from yet another unreleased album from the band, entitled \"Karmic Gravity\". Originally announced under the name of \"Two Blocks Below Canal\", the album was later re-titled \"Karmic Gravity\". Alongside \"Gun Sluts\" and \"NakedSelf\", it comprises The The's \"New York Trilogy\" of albums, all of which were recorded while Johnson was living in New York. Of the three, to date, only \"NakedSelf\" has been released. The same, sixth episode of Radio Cinéola also featured a previously unreleased song from \"Gun Sluts\", entitled \"Psychic Sauna,\" as well as an unreleased \"GlobalEyes (Alternate Version)\" from \"NakedSelf\". Episode 11, entitled \"Remember, Remember,\" features the song \"Body Bonfire,\" an unreleased instrumental from \"NakedSelf\", while episode 12, entitled \"Blow, Blow Thou Winter Wind,\" features \"Phantom Walls (Live with Eric Schermerhorn),\" an unreleased live version of the song from \"NakedSelf\". Episode 14, entitled \"Deep Space\", also features \"Shrunken Man (Lunar Version),\" an alternate version of the track from \"NakedSelf\".\n\nRumors have persisted for years of a new studio album being in the works, but to date, nothing has been officially announced. However, in the wake of the success of the \"We Can't Stop What's Coming\" single, The The announced a series of live shows for 2018, which sold out immediately. They also announced a box set, \"Radio Cineola Trilogy: A Broadcast by The The\", featuring three albums. The first, \"The End of the Day\", features songs, interpretations and performances. The second album, \"The Inertia Variations\", features poetry, soundscapes and spoken word. The third album, \"Midnight to Midnight\", features electronic scores, political commentary and broadcasts. The flurry of activity in 2017 and 2018 marks a decided shift for the band, once again stepping forward into the public eye, after nearly two decades of self-imposed seclusion from the mainstream.\n\nThe The's departure from Nothing, in particular, seemed to mirror the greater problems dogging Nothing Records in their later years, as their roster became increasingly depleted and their reputation shifted into being known for corporate red tape and artistic futility, rather than the artistic freedom it was founded upon, signifying the beginning of the end for the label. It was fitting then that The The would become the final band to ever sign with the label.\n\nCoil holds a unique place in history of Nothing Records, being one of the very first acts to sign to the label, as well as remaining one of the final acts at the end of the label, all the while having released no material during their entire tenure on the roster. John Balance and Peter “Sleazy” Christopherson founded Coil in 1982 in London, England, after collaborating on a few side projects and following their departure from Psychic TV. Other collaborators, such as Drew McDowall and Danny Hyde, would frequently record with the band, some becoming members for a time. By the time Coil arrived at Nothing Records, they had released three studio albums. \"Scatology\" and \"Horse Rotorvator\" were released on Force & Form, which was manufactured and distributed by K.422, a sister label of Some Bizzare Records. \"Love's Secret Domain\" was released on Torso in Europe and the seminal Wax Trax! Records in the United States. These albums has helped establish Coil as one of the premiere acts in experimental and industrial, prior to joining Nothing Records.\n\nFollowing the success of \"Love’s Secret Domain\", Coil began work on a new studio album in 1992, entitled \"Backwards.\" In 1993, a tape believed to have been a studio demo intended for the Boudisque/Torso labels was leaked as a bootleg cassette. In 1994, however, Boudisque went bankrupt and Torso shut down operations, leaving the Backwards material without a home. The cassette demo’s tracklist consisted of eight songs; \"Heaven's Blade,\" \"Wir-Click-Wir,\" \"Elves,\" \"Simenon,\" \"In My Blood,\" \"Spastiche,\" \"Crumb Time\" and \"March of Time.\"\n\nTrent Reznor had been a longtime admirer of Coil, stating their “'Tainted Love' video remains one of the greatest music videos of all time. I was always more attracted to Coil than Throbbing Gristle; the darkness and the scatology really chimed with me. If it's not immediately obvious: \"Horse Rotorvator\" was deeply influential on me. What they did to your senses. What they could do with sound. What Jhonn was doing lyrically. The exotic darkness of them permeated their work.”\n\nIn addition to his work in Coil, Peter Christopherson was an established music video and commercial director , having worked with artists such as Rage Against The Machine, Filter, Robert Plant, future Nothing Records label-mates The The and many more. It would be through his directing work that Reznor would first reach out to Christopherson, seeking to hire him as director for Nine Inch Nails’ \"Broken film\". Reznor recalled, “I figured that if I hired (Sleazy) as a director, then I could at least meet him and hang out for a bit. We established a friendship, and that friendship was very valuable to me. Making the \"Broken\" movie was a lot of fun. There was no label involvement or pressure from anyone, it was just he and I talking.\n\nChristpherson accepted Reznor's offer and went off to film material for the \"Broken\" movie, which he felt was so realistic, he informed Reznor, “I'm going to send it to you, but it's going to show up in a paper bag unmarked because there could be... I'm not sure I want the authorities knowing this came from me.\" After reviewing the film, Reznor stated, “It felt like we'd crossed over into territory that was perhaps too far. And to be honest, at that point I was living in the Sharon Tate house recording \"The Downward Spiral\". Anyway, that's where I was living when this package turned up, and I thought, 'Enough. I don't know that I need this kind of thing.' With the house it felt too stunty, and Peter agreed.\"\n\nIn spite of opting to leave the \"Broken\" movie unreleased, it began to surface as a bootleg, eventually making it’s way onto the Internet. \"We shelved it, but little did we know that the Internet would come into existence, and it would find its home on there,\" stated Reznor. In addition to the \"Broken\" movie, Christpherson directed music videos for the Nine Inch Nails songs “Wish” and “Gave Up.”\n\nAmidst these visual collaborations, Reznor also invited Coil to sign with Nothing Records. They are believed to be one of the earliest artists to have joined the label, signing a multi-album deal. Prior to their arrival at Nothing, Coil already had several ties to other acts on the label. Meat Beat Manifesto had remixed Coil's song \"The Snow,\" calling their remix \"Answers Come In Dreams.\" The band would revive this title for their 2010 album of the same name. Peter Christopherson had previously directed several music video for Nothing Records act The The, for their songs \"Infected,\" \"Heartland\" and \"The Mercy Beat.\" Autechre widely praised Coil as one of their primary musical influences, and even planned musical collaborations together at one point.\n\nIn 1992, Trent Reznor also invited Coil to remix the Nine Inch Nails song “Gave Up” for their \"Fixed\" EP and their collaborations would continue with the release of \"The Downward Spiral.\" Christopherson would direct the music video for “March of the Pigs” and also received a director’s credit for the Nine Inch Nails’ home video \"Closure\". Coil would also do remixes for the Nine Inch Nails releases \"Closer to God\" (alongside fellow Nothing Records label-mates Meat Beat Manifesto) and \"Further Down the Spiral\". An alternate version of their “Closer (Precursor)” remix by Danny Hyde was used in the opening credits to the 1995 David Fincher film \"Seven\".\n\nIn 1995, Coil began work on their first release for Nothing Records, which they decided would be the \"Backwards\" album. With the Torso demo material already completed, the band decided to head into Reznor’s Nothing Studios in New Orleans to re-record the material, as well as write new music. Recording at Nothing Studios began in June of 1995 and was completed by January of 1997. Trent Reznor did not perform, produce or write any material for it. John Balance recalled, \"We produced it ourselves, with Danny Hyde as engineer and with excellent help, complete co-operation and enormous investment of time, energy and genuine enthusiasm from all the people at Hot Snakes studio (a.k.a. Nothing Studios). In particular Chris Vrenna, who helped us iron out technical stuff, Brian the studio manager, who kept it running smoothly, and of course Trent himself, who kept out of our way while letting us loose in his secret domain.\"\n\nDuring this time, Reznor would once again invite Coil to do a remix for the Nine Inch Nails song “The Perfect Drug.” This time, however, Coil declined to participate, citing lack of time, due to the recording of \"Backwards.\". In spite of this, Peter Christpherson did assist on two Trent Reznor songs; “Videodrones; Questions” and “Driver Down,” for the soundtrack to David Lynch's \"Lost Highway\", also released on Nothing Records. Reznor had lobbied for Coil to take on a greater role in composing music for Lynch’s films, but Lynch declined. John Balance recalled, “You know, with \"Lost Highway\", Trent literally forced (us) down David Lynch's throat, saying ‘Look, please put this Coil stuff on.' You know, he really did help to get us on that soundtrack, but he (Lynch) wasn't interested. He wanted David Bowie, he wanted Marilyn Manson, he wanted whomever he could get. He just said, 'These people are really big. I want this film to be really big.' He didn't give a fuck about the integrity.\"\n\nInitially abandoning the title of \"Backwards,\" the band announced the album would be called \"International Dark Skies\". However, after NBC announced a TV series named \"Dark Skies\", the band abandoned the name. For a time, they began calling the album \"God Please Fuck My Mind for Good\", then \"Fire of the Mind\" and \"The World Ended a Long Time Ago\", before later returning to the name \"International Dark Skies\", with Balance commenting, \"I'm not letting a bad TV program change my vision of the world.\" However, the band eventually would circle back to referring to the material simply as \"Backwards\".\n\nIn addition to the \"Backwards\" album, a companion remix album was also once in the plans for release on Nothing Records. John Balance commented, “We are planning to involve a whole bunch of people in remixing tracks from our new Nothing album, including Steven Stapleton of Nurse with Wound, Autechre, Charlie Clouser and others we haven't asked yet, so it would be unfair to speculate on.”. In addition, Nothing also planned to re-issue the first two Coil albums, \"Scatology\" and \"Horse Rotorvator\". However, the rights to these albums became caught up in a dispute between Coil and their former label, Some Bizzare Records. John Balance recalled in 1999, \"We have no news over Nothing releasing \"Horse Rotorvator\" and \"Scatology\", because we gave them it about 5 years ago and had it legally able to be released in the U.S., but Nothing's lawyers were unhappy with a slightly less than watertight legal situation, so didn't go ahead.\" Balance would go on to claim that Some Bizzare label owner Stephen \"Stevo\" Pearce initially agreed to the Nothing re-issues, before later demanding more money, stating, \"Since that, that fucking arsehole (sic) Stevo Pearce has reared his very unpleasant head again and asked Nothing for more money and generally thrown a spanner in the works. He originally gave Coil permission to give it to Nothing as part of a half-hearted attempt to be nice to us and make some amends, including financial, for the terrible way he has continued to treat us over the fate of these two records. Actaually he wasn't trying to be nice, he was trying to cover his ass for some early crap he tried to pull off.\"\n\nIn 1997, Some Bizzare reissued both albums in the UK, against the wishes of the band. Coil released a message to fans urging them not to support these reissues, claiming they were unauthorized, due to the fact that Some Bizzare had not settled with them on unpaid royalties for the albums. John Balance even went as far as cursing the reissues. In response to the Some Bizzare reissues, Coil remastered and reissued both albums themselves, on their own Threshold House label. The covers to both albums featured a message to Some Bizzare label owner “Stevo” Pearce, stating “Stevo, pay us what you owe us!”\n\nCoil provided intermit updates on \"Backwards\" over the course of 1997, stating that the album was held up for countless reasons. Meanwhile, the band remained prolific, recording numerous new releases, including \"Moons Milk (In Four Phases)\", \"Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 1\" and \"Musick To Play In The Dark Vol. 2\". Over the following years, while \"Backwards\" never saw a release, the band would occasionally comment on the album and Nothing Records, always insisting they were still a part of the label. \"For the record it is us, Coil, who are delaying over this particular title. Not Trent or Nothing, who have been very, very quiet about it all and have waited patiently for it,” they wrote in 1999.\n\nIn 1999, Coil began performing live for the first time. On June 18, 2001, the entire 1993 \"Backwards\" demo was broadcast on Dutch Radio4, a radio station in Amsterdam, when they hosted Coil as in-studio guests to coincide with a live performance on June 1, 2001. A four disc CD-R set of the entire broadcast, made by the radio station, was released in an unknown quantity as \"Dutch Radio4 Supplement\". The \"Backwards\" demos became widely circulated on the Internet. Three extra tracks, \"Bee Has the Photos,\" \"Egyptian Basses,\" and a different version of \"Spastiche\" became circulated with the demos online over time.\n\nIn 2004, after a legal dispute arose between Trent Reznor and Nothing Records president John Malm Jr., Reznor officially declared the label defunct, with no Coil albums having ever seen release on the label. That same year, John Balance would tragically die in a fall inside of his own home. Peter Christopherson announced that Coil would not continue as a band. However, he would focus on the band’s back-catalogue, which including revisiting the Nothing Records material.\n\nIn 2005, Coil announced the release of \"The Ape of Naples\" on their own Threshold House label. The album was considered to be the final version of their once-intended Nothing Records material, featuring updated versions of five tracks recorded at Nothing Studios; “Fire of the Mind,” “It’s In My Blood,” “I Don’t Get It,” “Heaven’s Blade,” “Cold Cell” and “Amber Rain.” It also featured other songs that are believed to have been originally created around the time of \"Backwards\". The band also included a thank you to Trent Reznor and Nothing Records in the liner notes. In 2007, Important Records reissued \"The Ape Of Naples\" on LP, alongside a companion album of material, called \"The New Backwards\". \"The New Backwards\" was later made available separately as a CD in 2008. The album featured additional material from the Nothing album sessions, remixed by Peter Christopherson and Danny Hyde in 2007.\n\nPeter Christpherson passed away in his sleep on November 25, 2010. Just prior to his death, Christopherson gave permission to Trent Reznor to use the name How To Destroy Angels for his new band he was launching. The name was derived from Coil’s first 12” single. Trent Reznor even stated that prior to his death, Christopherson claimed to be working on music to contribute to How To Destroy Angels, commenting ”Around that time I reached out to him, iPads had just come out and I sent him one (with the music on it), because he was in Thailand and away from technology. I just wanted to make sure that he was ok with it, because clearly I wouldn't have done it without his blessing. He mentioned, 'Hey, I've got some stuff that I'm working on which could be interesting (for How To Destroy Angels)... it could be interesting, but it could also be way outside the realms of anything that you'd be interested in. We could work together, and maybe under the umbrella of How To Destroy Angels.' And I said, 'Please do. Send whatever you have.' And nothing ever showed up - he passed away not long after that. So sadly I didn't get to hear what he had planned.”\n\nIn 2012, members of the Nine Inch Nails fan-site echoingthesound.org were able to raise funds to send to Danny Hyde, who had revealed the existence of outtakes of commissioned work Coil had produced for various Nine Inch Nails singles and EPs. Once a suitable amount had been raised, Hyde torrented the tracks to fans via The Pirate Bay. Danny Hyde later licensed the songs to British label Cold Spring. On February 24, 2014, Cold Spring released the remixes under the name \"Recoiled\" on 12”. The album artwork was created by a member of EchoingTheSound and closely resembles Russell Mills' frayed rope design for \"Further Down the Spiral\". The songs were released and marketed as \"Coil & Nine Inch Nails,\" despite the fact that Trent Reznor is the sole writer on all tracks and remains uncredited in all editions of the release.\n\nOn October 9, 2015, Cold Spring released Coil's original \"Backwards\" album, which was once again arranged through Danny Hyde. This marked the first time the Nothing Records material had been released as was originally intended for the label, with no further remixing or additional songs. No mention of Nothing Records is given on the album, with the liner notes swapping out a Nothing Studios credit with “Magazine Studios, New Orleans” (Magazine Street being the former location of Nothing Studios). In November of that same year, Danny Hyde himself also published the album for download on his website, offering six additional bonus tracks, primarily consisting of alternate versions of the album songs; \"Spactiche,\" \"Heaven's Blade - 98 Jams,\" \"Wur Click - 98 Lo Chords,\" \"Mellotron Song,\" \"Heaven's Blade - 96 Vox Version\" and \"Wur Click - 98 Tk3 Vox Bits.\" Hyde also included a digital insert on his website for the download version, featuring his own liner notes, which give special thanks to Trent Reznor and former Nine Inch Nails member Chris \"Pod\" Vrenna, for their inspiration and tech.\n\nDespite having never released anything on Nothing Records, the band remains widely associated with the label. The vast catalogue of Coil remains highly sough-after by collectors and fans, while their music has gone on to influence countless musicians, such as Alec Empire, Chris Connelly, Autechre, K.K. Null and Nine Inch Nails. Coil's unfulfilled multi-album deal with Nothing Records can be loosely retraced through comments from the band throughout their tenure on the label. \"Scatology\", \"Horse Rotorvator\", \"Backwards\" and an incomplete \"Backwards\" remix album were all intended for release on Nothing at various points. To date, all of the material has seen release outside of Nothing Records, with the exception of the unfinished remix project for \"Backwards\".\n\nThe studios, located at 4500 Magazine Street, were apparently not seriously damaged by Hurricane Katrina. On the Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM, Reznor stated during an interview (\"Breakfast with Kevin and Bean\") that the studio in New Orleans was not a studio anymore. He later put a collection of his photos on nin.com, detailing the aftermath of the hurricane on his former studios and the surrounding area, before his band played a scheduled concert (which had become a benefit for the survivors).\n\nWhile writing \"The Downward Spiral\", Reznor lived in the Tate mansion where the Manson family murders took place. After he moved out, it was demolished, he went back and took the door as a souvenir. It became the front door to Nothing Studios.\n\nAs of 2017, the building that formerly housed the studio has been renovated and is now home to a physical therapy center and a branch of Coldwell Banker.\n\n",

In Sri Lanka Monday to Friday at 10.00 pm on Shakthi TV. It is edited by National award winner Srikanth.N.B and his long time associate C. M. Selvakumar.\n\nGanga is a housemaid residing at a house outside a rich family palace by serving the family. Rajashekar, the owner of the palace, an esteemed man in his early sixties, who lives in a small town with his sister and only son. His family is highly respected among the residents of the town. Despite having many relatives, they like serenity and lead a secluded life in the palatial home.\n\nGanga is very passionate about the snake mound outside the palace. She worships the snake residing in it as ‘Nagamma’; unaware of the fact that the snake is actually an \"Ichchadhaari Nagam\", (Avenging Shapeshifting snake) which has been waiting since many years to avenge the elder’s family and is under the control of a magical bond of a Malayali Nambhoodhiri.\n\nIn case, a drop of blood from a virgin girl’s body, who is the worshiper of the snake, is secreted on the snake’s body, it would regain all its powers. Thereafter, no one could save Rajashekar’s family from the vengeance of the snake.\n\nRajashekar’s health suddenly deteriorates. So he decides to get his son Arun, who is a widower, remarried. His relatives are summoned, who, on arrival don’t care about the family’s welfare but eye the wealth of the family. However, mysterious events take place after the relatives arrive. The Namboodhiri is summoned, and it is revealed that Arun’s first wife Janaki’s spirit causes all the confusion.\n\nIt is also revealed that Janaki’s spirit plays all the tricks to stop the asset-hungry relatives who were trying to cheat her husband Arun. The Nambhoodhiri understands from the spirit of Janaki,that her romantic life with Arun which was like all roses was ended by her death due to childbirth complications was actually killed by Arun’s uncle Dharmaraj, his son Moorthy & Arun's friend Balaji. Meanwhile, Arun learns that Devasena, his child through Janaki, is alive and brings her to the Palace. Janaki kills Arun's friend Balaji as a vengeance of her death.\n\nThe relatives who are already panicked by Janaki’s spirit are further discouraged by Devasena’s arrival, and get away from the marriage arrangements. The Nambhoodhiri advises the family to marry Ganga, who has the divine blessings, to Arun.One day, Ganga's blood accidentally falls onto the snake’s body in the snake mound breaking the supernatural curse which kept the \"Icchaadhaari Nagam\" sealed in the snake mound.\n\nAfter this incident, the snake is now free from its curse and is getting ready to avenge Rajasekar’s family. The Ichchadhari snake mentions to Ganga that it requires a human body to exact its revenge without any suspicions from anyone in the family and while revealing her identity as an individual in the name of Nandini, even though Ganga refuses to accept and allow Nandini (Icchaadhaari Nagam) to continue her vengeance and kill the whole family, Nandini vehemently continues its sole purpose by transmigrating herself into Ganga's body, therefore successfully possessing Ganga.\n\nThe next day was Ganga's and Arun's marriage, which happened while Nandini was in Ganga's body. Therefore, Arun married both Nandini (who became Arun's unsuspecting official third wife) and Ganga (who became Arun's official second wife but she wasn't aware of the marriage until Nandini told her).\n\nNandini learns that her snake form could be attained only for 5 minutes on New Moon night (Amavasya). She has to wait until Chitra Pournami day that comes after 10 months to get her own powers (Shiva Shakti Naga Yogam) that'll let her transform into a human. Janaki enters Devasena's body to save her family and finish the evil Nandini's tricks. After many incidents, Nandini fails to kill Arun and Devasena because of Janaki. Rajashekar and his family try many ways to find out the evil spirit in their house but which were failed by Nandini. \nLater, it is revealed that Rajasekhar and two of his friends (business partners) had stolen three Kalachakram (A powerful yantra that is said to grant unparalleled wealth and powers if an individual comes in control of it) each for themselves which was originally under the idol of snake -goddess by killing Sivanagam/Parvathi & Munisamy's wife. Namboothiri trapped the little snake, Nandini in a snake mound.\n\nMuniappa's biological daughter Gayathri somehow survived this incident and was brought to an orphanage whereby she was later on adopted by her adopted parents and is currently residing in a foreign country. Now, Janaki vows to save her family from Nandini and Bhairavi.\nRemembering her vow that Nandini had given to her mother which is to get back the 3 Kalachakram safely, Nandhini executed her plan by disguising herself as Rajashekar and calling his friend to come to Rajasekhar's home with the Kalachakram.\n\nDuring the journey of Rajashekar's friend she tried to kill him to get one of the Kalachakram, but due to the fear of getting caught by the police officers she couldn't kill him at that moment but managed to injure him. The Police officers took him to the hospital. However she kills Rajasekhar's friend at the hospital and threw the whole blame on innocent Ganga by getting out of her body.\n\nGanga made Nandhini to promise her that the latter would not hurt her husband, child and family to exact her revenge by possessing any other woman's body other than Ganga's own body to which Nandini agrees knowingly that this restriction given by Ganga to her is temporary and after Chitra Pournami, Nandini will acquire her own powers (Shiva Shakti Naga Yogam) that'll transform her into a human.\n\nAfter this the police arrested Ganga who then goes to the jail for the crime that Nandini committed. Arun and Devasena told Ganga to say the truth but she was not ready. Later,Janaki came in front of Ganga while she was inside Devasena's body to convince her about the evil works and plans of Nandini but Ganga still refused to admit the truth and decides to go to jail for the good future of the palace and the residential members of the palace.\n\nAn evil dwarf woman whose name is Chamundi comes as a maid to work in the palace but her ulterior motives was to obtain the Kalachakram but the evil was unable to continue her plans because of Janaki's spirit that is currently protecting the palace and its members. So Chamundi acted out her plan by becoming friends with Devasena and cheated Janaki by capturing and restricting Janaki with her power into Janaki's own photo. Thus Janaki can't come out from it.\n\nAfter this, Maya, Dharmaraj's daughter got discharged from the hospital after recovering from her (amnesia and mental disorder), she come to know that Arun and Ganga got married and currently Ganga is in jail serving the punishment that she never did.\n\nUsing this ill-fated incident as a chance, therefore, she tries to convince the whole family into letting her marry Arun when they went to Nagadevi temple for prayers only after she, Arun and Devasena are the ones chosen by Nagadevi Amman to uplift the ill fate that has fallen on the family. Arun agrees to her condition. When Devasena inquires her father with the decision he has taken, he tells her that it's the only way that he could do to make sure Ganga agrees to speaks the truth and bails her out of the jail.\n\nAt this time Devi decides to kill Ganga in the jail but she fails to do so. During her time in jail Ganga comes to know about Bhairavi (whose intentions is to kill Arun). During this period of time a Thirunangai in the name of Sena Nayagi (Riyaz Khan) comes to the palace to warn the family about something important but the family members that is Dharmaraja, Leela and Manju disregards her as a beggar and insults her which makes the Thirunangai to leave the family without informing the important information that she was about to say.\n\nChamundi was also successful in capturing Nandhini whom she traps her into a giant chameleon's body before the former (Nandini) was captured by the Namboothiri (who already knew about Nandhini's escape from the snake mound) and was currently enacting a poojai to capture Nandhini. Since Chamundi emerged successful in capturing Nandhini, The Namboothiri added some strength to Chamundi's power.\n\nLater on it is revealed that he has some ulterior motive that is to discover the main culprit (Chamundi) whom captured Nandini and make sure he will get his hand and control over Nandhini overtime. The Namboothiri told Rajashekar that he would be continuing the Amavasya Poojai and warned Ganga to refrain herself from having any kind of relationship (sexually) with Arun to prevent Nandhini from escaping once again.\n\nChamundi exacted her plan the following night to acquire the Kalachakram but fails to it in the palace even though she was successful in discovering the exact place where the Kalachakram was hidden. After some severe penance she did she discovered the exact reason why she couldn't get the Kalachakram was because of the curse she obtained after killing her master known as (Guru Dosham). To get rid of this curse Chamundi ask her Goddess known as Kugai Natchiyar for vimorchanam (a solution to get rid of the curse) by which Chamundi has to offer Devasena as a sacrifice before her holy goddess.\n\nAt this tremendous situation, here a new twist arises in the form of Seeta (a woman with the exact facial features of Janaki) who will be making an intro again in Arun's, Ganga and Devasena's life. Sena Nayagi gets a clairvoyance of something very bad that is going to happen to Ganga that will cost her life and Sena Nayagi predicts that the bad is not coming from Ganga's common enemy (Nandini) but from the people who cares about her wellbeing (Namboothiri) and her relatives (Devi and Dharmaraj) which will make it difficult for Karuppanasamy to protect Ganga and after that Seeta will be a challenge for Ganga who will take over Ganga's place as Arun's wife.\n\nAfter this Arun and Ganga leaves to Kerala to celebrate their Honeymoon and they stayed in a Hotel arranged by Unnikrishnan. Unnikrishnan also arranged the same Hotel for Dharmaraj and his son to stay. He also arranged Devi and Bhairavi to stay in the same hotel with the former (Dharmaraj and his son) knowing the presence of the later (Devi and Bhairavi).\n\nDharmaraj and his son pre-planned without the knowledge of Arun and Ganga to stay in the same Hotel was to make sure that they both get to keep their eyes on Ganga so they can kill her. Their first plan was to drown Ganga while she and Arun was on their trip on a boat house but their plans failed as Ganga was rescued by her husband. On that same day Arun discovers someone who looks like his first wife Janaki but before he can confront her she disappears. Dharmaraj son executes his plan which was to film Arun and Ganga's nuptial night but fails. Both of them are not ready to give up as they're finding for the slightest chance to execute their plan which is to murder Ganga.\n\nWhereas Devi is completely relying on Bhairavi to kill Ganga, but Bhairavi has her own ulterior motive that is to kill Arun. During Bhairavi's first try she fails to kill Arun because her powers was prevented by the Kalachakram that is currently with Venu who came to visit Bhairavi. Later on Bhairavi discovers from her assistant Neelakanthan that Venu is having the Kalachakram which prevented her powers and so she's vying to get her hands on the Kalachakram.\n\nBack at the palace in Chennai, Sena Nayagi have come to the house to eat and stay as ordered by Karuppanasamy so that Karuppanasamy can protect the family from any evil powers. Rajashekar has already enrolled Devasena to school. On a weekend, Sena Nayagi came to know about Chamundi's evil intentions and she successfully prevented her evil powers of transforming Devasena into a rose flower and offering her as a sacrifice to Kugai Natchi Amman by reflecting Chamundi's powers back to herself and transformed Chamundi into a rose flower. Devasena then placed the rose flower given to her by Sena Nayagi in front of her mother's portrait. On seeing what happened to Chamundi, Janaki laughed and mocked Chamundi for having a similar fate as her.\n\nArun comes across four men's who was finding for the girl name Seeta and when they inquire him about that girl, Arun tells them that he will inform them about her whereabouts when he sees her once again (without knowing anything about the girls background and the four men's ulterior motive that is to catch and murder her).\n\nThe following day Bhairavi's second attempt to murder Arun by hypnotising a Hotel worker into killing him also fails as Arun was lucky enough (sheer luck) to prevent that from happening. On that same night, Amavasya and Ganga insisted Arun who also agreed to follow her to the Bhagavathy Amman Temple in Kerala to perform prayers.\n\nGanga never tells Arun the main purpose on why she insisted Arun to go to the temple, but it was revealed later on that Rajashekar have told Ganga to perform a Pariharam Poojai as ordered by the Namboothiri in that temple by immersing some flowers and a statue of a snake goddess made of soil in the temple's pond to get rid of Nandini and her curse. By successfully doing so Nandini will be powerless permanently.\n\nEven though the Namboothiri is successful in doing the Amavasyai Poojai to prevent Nandini from escaping her trap, Ganga somehow subsequently fails to perform the Pariharam Poojai for the Amman in the Bhagavathy Amman Temple due to a heavy thunderstorm. This was observed by Viswanathan aka Vichu (Rajashekar's friend) who then informs this incident to the Namboothiri.\n\nAt that moment Rajashekar calls the Namboothiri and asks him if there is any other way to permanently stop Nandini from seeking her vengeance, to which the Namboothiri says that they need to wait for the next Amavasyai to repeat what they failed to do.\n\nAfter the Namboothiri informs Rajashekar about that, Vichu asks the Namboothiri whether is it possible for them to prevent Nandini from exacting her revenge by doing anything before the next Amavasyai and the Namboothiri says that it is possible and the only way is to murder Ganga.\n\nThis fact shocks Vichu but he agrees to help the Namboothiri without the knowledge of Rajashekar because they know that Rajashekar will not agree with this as he cares for the life of his son Arun who in turn loves his second wife Ganga.\n\nOn that night Arun discovers the presence of Seeta in the Bhagavathy Amman Temple, and he informs the four men's about her whereabouts. Arun confronts Seeta and he comes to know about her exact life flashback and decides to help her out from the four bad guys by running away from them.\n\nLater Arun, Seeta and the four henchmen are confronted by Kerala Police whereby the policewoman questions the four henchmens about why they were chasing both Arun and Seeta, the four henchman confuses the policewoman who then questions Seeta and she says that the four guys were chasing her and her husband Arun came to her rescue (a likeable story Seeta adds to save herself).\n\nThe policewoman then asks for the prove to a confused Arun, who shows Janaki's photo and says that she (Seeta) is his wife. The Kerala policewoman was not convinced because she saw that there wasn't a thali on Seeta's neck which Arun later said that he has it with him and because of a misunderstanding she removed the thali from her neck (a likable story Arun creates to save Seeta from the four goons).\n\nAt this juncture, one of the goons challenges Arun by saying that he (Arun) might be lying, and so the policewoman decides that Arun ties the thali on Seeta's neck which Arun (reluctantly) does it. This shocks the goons and they leave the place once and for all. Before Arun can ask back for his first wife thali from Seeta, he comes to know that Seeta has also left the place and he decided to return to the hotel he currently is residing in.\n\nThe next day Ganga decided to go for shopping to get clothes and souvenirs for Devasena on the way she was confronted by the goons set up to murder her by Vichu. She tells Arun about what is happening to her and also manages to escape from the goons who in return failed to kill her. Vichu comes to know about this and he informs the Namboothiri who tells him to return to Chennai as fast as possible, so that he doesn't get caught by the police officers in Kerala.\n\nOn that day, Arun receives a call while he was in the hotel with his wife that a policewoman wanted to meet him and on seeing the policewoman, she returned Seeta back to him who was in her custody of protection. Arun then brings Seeta back to his room and surprises Ganga who was astonished to see someone who looks exactly like Janaki and also she comes to know about her background and decided to help her out.\n\nBack at the palace Sena Nayagi manages to heal Rajashekar's sister and assures him that his sister will recover back to normal in a few days time. On that night, Chamundi jinxes Devasena's slippers that almost brought Devasena to Chamundi's location but was prevented by the timely intervention of Sena Nayagi with the help of Karuppanasamy.\n\nAn enraged Chamundi summons her chameleon which takes a giant form to attack Sena Nayagi but Sena Nayagi crushed the chameleon to death with her feet. When Sena Nayagi was about to finish off Chamundi, Janaki manages to breakout of her photo (which she was tied into by Chamundi) and captures Chamundi. This shocks Sena Nayagi, who then warns Janaki of her gravely mistake and tells her to hold Chamundi for 1 mandalam (48 days) without letting her go to totally destroy Chamundi or if she fails to do so then Chamundi will seek her revenge on the whole family. After saying that Sena Nayagi captures both of them in a container and save guards it.\n\nOn the next day they (Arun, Ganga and Seeta) vacated their room and they lodge a police report in Coimbatore to arrest Thuraipaandi for ill treating the orphan girls who was staying in the orphanage. The police arrest Thuraipaandi who warned Arun that he would definitely have his revenge on him. After this Arun, transfers all the orphans to Janaki's Orphanage Home, whereby Ganga expresses her interest in having Seeta brought back to the palace which at first Seeta refuses but later on agrees to accompany.\n\nBefore Arun, Ganga and Seeta arrived at the palace Sena Nayagi predicted the arrival of the third person (Seeta) along with Arun and Ganga and told Rajashekar, Manju and Ganga's father about her prediction before she left the palace. \n\nAfter Arun and Ganga arrived, Rajashekar, Manju and Ganga's father were astonished by the arrival of Seeta who is an exact doppelgänger of Janaki. While Rajashekar and Manju was happy with her arrival, Ganga's father wasn't very happy because he feared that she might be a threat to his daughter's place as the wife of Arun.\n\nThe family decided to give Seeta a place to stay in the palace but Arun decided that she stays in the house near the palace which Seeta openly agrees to. Later in the afternoon, Devasena arrived from school and was very pleased and excited to see Seeta (thinking that she is her mother, Janaki) was back home. \n\nEventually, Ganga clears Devasena's doubts by explaining to her about Seeta's background story. Nevertheless, Devasena asked Seeta's permission if she can call her \"Amma\" (mother) as (Seeta resembles exactly like Janaki), to which Seeta and the whole family agrees.\n\nOn the next day, Devi and Neelakanthan (both who have stolen the Kalachakram from Bhairavi) arrived at the palace. Devi introduces Neelakanthan to the family as Kasi Swamiyar a powerful Maharishi from Kasi. Most of the family members cannot remember Neelakanthan who was in his new disguise except for Arun who suspected him but decided to remain quiet and catch him at the right moment. \n\nThe family brought Neelakanthan aka Kasi Swamiyar to Rajashekar's sister's room to cure her whereby Neelakanthan puts the Kalachakram powers into a test and decides that it will take time and money for him to cure Rajashekar's sister \nand Rajashekar agrees to pay a huge some of money to Neelakanthan aka Kasi Swamiyar. \n\nDevi and Neelakanthan received a threatening call from Bhairavi that she will have her revenge on them which both of them scoffed at sighting that they have the Kalachakram which is powerful enough to protect them both.\n\nThe following day, while Seeta was mopping the house Arun discovered that she is still wearing his first wife Janaki's Thali. Before he can confront Seeta, his father Rajashekar, both his aunt Manju and Devi and also his wife Ganga was walking into the hall at different timing. \n\nArun somehow manages to divert them one by one from Seeta before they notice the Thali on her neck by telling them that he has something important to inform them while buying time for Seeta to hide the Thali. He tells them that they should be doing the Sumangali Poojai on the next day for Ganga which everyone agreed to carry out.\n\nAt Arun's bedroom, Ganga asks Arun for Janaki's Thali for the Sumangali Poojai, whereby Arun lies to Ganga by telling her that he might have lost it in Kerala during the boathouse incident. Ganga decided to find the Thali in the room while Arun goes into the house near the palace where Seeta is currently living in to ask her back for the Thali. Seeta gives an appropriate reason to Arun. Later, Arun said to Seeta that if his respect for Janaki is higher than her's he should get back Janaki's Thali. \n\nThe next day, the whole family commenced the Sumangali Poojai for Ganga. Before they could begin, Ganga trips and fall while injuring her hand. Somehow she manages to complete the Sumangali Poojai with the help of Seeta. At the final stage of the poojai when they were getting the blessings of the goddess the \"Aarthi\" suddenly extinguishes by itself. \n\nOn seeing this the woman who was conducting the poojai asked for the Amman if she was missing to provide the respective procedure for any \"Sumangali\" (married woman) to which the Amman signaled as a \"Yes\" by dropping a flower. After this the poosari woman told Ganga and Arun to provide the new saree and thali to Seeta which both of them gave happily unsuspectingly.\n\nThe following day Dharmaraj, Moorthy and his daughter Maya arrived to the palace with their own plans and ulterior motives. They apologies to Rajashekar for misbehaving with him on their last argument which Rajashekar forgived after much pesters from the three of them.\n\nWhen Dharmaraj, Moorthy and Maya was about to enter their own room they was really shocked to see Seeta as she's Janaki's doppelgänger. They was frightened by the very sight of her thinking that she was Janaki to which Arun came and cleared their doubts by introducing herself to them. After introducing herself, Moorthy initially took a great liking for her (which is confirmed that he is in love with Seeta) whereby he is unaware that she's already secretly married to Arun.\n\nAfter this, Devi received a archanai from a poosari from a temple telling that this belongs to Arun. She came and hands over the archanai to Arun and tells him the truth. When Arun was puzzled about knowing who had did an \"Archanai\" in his name, he was even surprised that this mysterious someone had did it in a few temples and is currently in a temple near his place. The curious Arun decided to uncover who is this person by going to the temple with Ganga accompanying him.\n\nTo his surprise he discovered that this person was none other than Bhairavi and so he confronted her and she said that she had recovered and have no longer the intentions to kill him after which he said that he was not the cause of her sister's death. Since she was from Janaki's village, he decided to give her a place to stay in his palace.\n\nIt is then revealed that Bhairavi's main plan is to arrive at the palace to regain the \"Kalachakram\" that was stolen by the duo Devi and Neelakanthan. Arun and Ganga arranged Bhairavi to stay in the next room of Devi. Bhairavi's arrival shocks Devi and also Neelakanthan. \n\nWhile Bhairavi was being brought to her room by Ganga she comes across Seeta and is really shocked to see her appearance which is akin to Janaki she was introduced to Seeta by Ganga after which she arrived at her room where Seeta helps Bhairavi by putting some medication ointment on the soles of Bhairavi's feet. \n\nSeeta brings Bhairavi to Devi's room where Neelakanthan aka Kasi Swamiyar is also residing to provide Bhairavi with some medications which he agrees to give and after that she leaves the three of them in Devi's room. After Seeta left the room Bhairavi demands Devi and Neelakanthan to return the Kalachakram back to her but they arrogantly refused. \n\nThis act enrages Bhairavi and she uses her siddhis (supernatural powers) on Neelakanthan but it backfires to Bhairavi. Devi and Bhairavi both of them challenges one another that they will succeed their own self purpose motives without the help of one another.\n\nBoth Arun and Ganga are now at peace seeing that Bhairavi has no more intentions to kill Arun. At this moment, when Arun was about to make his move with Ganga, Ganga tells Arun that she has to go and collect the clothes outside as it was raining heavily. \n\nWhen she was collecting the clothes she discovers Nandini's adopted father calling out to her thinking that Nandini is still residing in her body. Ganga screams and runs into the palace while informing Arun about Muniswamy's appearance. \n\nArun decided to catch the old man but misses to catch him this time also. After this incident, Muniswamy correctly deduces the fact that Nandini is not in Ganga's body but she is trapped somewhere else without knowing the true original place that is in (Chamundi's chameleons body in Kugai Natchiyar cave).\n\nIn the latest episodes, it's revealed that Bhairavi has managed to get her hands on one of the Kalachakram (which was in the possession of Devi and Neelakanthan) and also she have come to know more information of the Kalachakram from Muniappa and now currently is seeking for the other two Kalachakram: one is with Rajashekar and the other one is with Vichu. \n\nIn addition, there's another new person in the name of Bala who is threatening Arun to give him money so that he would not reveal the photos he had taken during Arun's secret marriage with Seeta in Kerala to his family members whereby Arun decided to give Bala the amount of money he is asking for.\n\nThe next day Rajashekar and everyone in the family has decided to arrange a marriage for Seeta and also Rajashekar personally has decided to give half of his property for Seeta which made Devi and Dharmaraj to plot and enact a plan in order to obtain that property. \n\nOn the same day, Chamundi's disciples tried to contact Chamundi with their Kagapujandar Guru Mantra but they discovered that she's in a danger and that they can only bring her out on an Amavasya day (New moon day) which also indicates the same day as to when Nandini will gain her full power to escape her trap. \n\nIn the recent episodes, it has been revealed that Siva Nagam/Parvati has survived her death by entering the samadhi state and she is back to have her revenge on Rajashekar, his friends and his family. She secretly meets Ganga and mentions to Ganga about all the injustices committed by Rajashekar and his friends to herself and the Kattu Amman which is why Nandini possesses a vengeful character in person. She also mentions that in two days time when the new moon and solar eclipse is bound to happen naturally, Nandini will be successful in breaking the trap and will come to seek revenge. \n\nAfter mentioning this, she disappears. Ganga became very worried about her family's safety and decided to tell what had happened to Rajashekar who became very shocked but obediently listens and agrees to Ganga to return the Kalachakram to the Kattu Amman not before telling her that he will inform his friends and decide the proper circumstances and time to return it. \n\nOn the next day Devasena invited her teacher Parameshwari to her house and once she arrived Ganga was literally shocked to notice that Parvati and Parameshwari look identical (which is confirmed later that both are the same person). Before Parvati aka Parameshwari leaves the house she already knows what happened to Nandini and also she promises Rajashekar that she will return to seek her vengeance.\n\nOn the following day, early in the morning hours before the Surya Graghanam and Amavasai begin Parvati visits Seiyanayagi and gifts Karuppan her Nagamani/Nagarathinam (King Cobra Pearl) which Karuppan accepts for keeping Chamundi in her control. But later on, Seiyanayagi says that Chamundi is no longer in her control after Janaki was forced to leave her and rescue her daughter by bringing back Seeta who is been kidnapped but Thuraipaandi and his goons. This fact surprises Parvati and she begins to tell her flashback about how she came to know Chamundi/Selvi who wanted to take the Kalachakram for herself but failed to take and was instead diminished in size by the wrath and powers of Parvati.\n\nSeiyanayagi uses her powers and Karuppan's blessings to inform her about Nandini's exact place where she's trap. After revealing to Parvati about the place Seiyanayagi comes to know the exact reason why Parvati is seeking to release Nandini (that's to exact her revenge for what had happened). Even-though Seiyanayagi tried to reason out with Parvati not to harm Ganga and her life (family) but Parvati was really headstrong in her decision which makes Seiyanayagi to challenge Parvati that she will protect Ganga and her family from Parvati, after which Parvati disappears. \n\nAfter that Seiyanayagi comes to know through a premonition that something very bad is going to happen to Ganga and her family. At the same time, Devasena succeeds in getting her fathers permission to go to school so that she and her friends can witness the solar eclipse. While on her journey to school, Chamundi sabotages and kidnaps Devasena to her place. Janaki somehow comes to know about this and tries to save her daughter but alas she again gets herself trapped by Chamundi at Kugai Natchiyar cave. \n\nThrough a phone call Arun comes to know about what had happened to Devasena and he arrived at the place but is shocked to discover that Devasena is no where to be found. Suspecting that this has got to do something with her school teacher Parameshwari (yes, Arun suspects accurately that Parvati and Parameshwari is the same person after he inquired about her in school whereby he comes to know that the Parvati is using the identity of Parameshwari teacher from Devasena school), he rushes to meet his father and informs him that he will soon find out the real problem in between Parvati and Rajashekar even if Rajashekar refuses to tell him the truth. \n\nNow the story focuses onto the poojai conducted by Chamundi, just before she is about to sacrifice Devasena for Kugai Natchiyar Amman, Parvati comes and stops Chamundi from committing such a heinous crime act. This incident shocks Chamundi aka Selvi who challenges Parvati into a duel (a fight involving supernatural magic powers). After both of them displaying their supernatural powers Parvati was able to defeat Chamundi and with the help of Janaki, Chamundi was temporarily tied to the banyan tree (Aalamaram).\n\nAfter this intense battle between good and bad, Parvati tried to bring Nandini out of her trap but then only she comes to know that Namboothiri has also set Nandini in his fire curse trap (Sarpa Agni Sabham). With the blessings of Kattu Amman, Parvati summoned a thirusoola and chops off the chameleon's head thereafter releasing Nandini from her trap. Parvati then instructs Nandini to destroy Chamundi which results in the death of Chamundi aka Selvi. \n\nLater on Janaki thanked Parvati for saving her daughter whereby Parvati says that she came mainly to save her own daughter but also in return saved Devasena. She instructed Janaki to return to her palace because she knows that everyone are anxiously waiting for Devasena's arrival. Janaki arrived home with Devasena and told her to tell the family that she was walking back to home after the accident which Devasena does ending the worries of the family.\n\nSince after this Surya Grahanam Amavasai had happened and Nandini was successful in coming out of the trap with Parvati's help, Namboothiri came to know what had happened (when he noticed that his yagna was a failure), he immediately informs Vichu and Rajashekar about this, which worries the two of them. Namboothiri pacifies them to not worry because Nandini had not yet succeeded in her mission. When Rajashekar and Vichu inquires further about this, Namboothiri informs both of them that Nandini can only fulfill her revenge if she completely takes the form of a human on the next pournami and it's their mission to stop and trap her back before the next pournami. If they are successful in catching her off guard then Nandini will lose all her powers and she will be put to sleep forever. Rajashekar then informs Namboothiri about how Ganga discovered about the Kalachakram from Parvati and asks Namboothiri's help to which the Namboothiri tells him that he will ready three fake Kalachakram to be given to Ganga.\n\nAt the same time, Parvati who successfully managed to save Nandini mentions to Muniappa that Nandini must be safeguarded for the next 10 days until the arrival of Margazhi Pournami whereby according to the prophecy involved, if Nandini is successfully safeguarded until this day (Margazhi Pournami) she would gain her full powers, and then only can she fulfill the stated prophecy or not she will fail forever. After saying this, she passes the duty of safeguarding Nandini to Muniappa and tells him to contact her through prayers if there is any serious problems.\n\nThe next day, Muniappa discovers a reckless Nandini leaving the house to seek revenge whereby he made sure that she promises to him not to leave again until she gains her full powers and potential on the Margazhi Pournami. At first she was hesitant but later she obliged to his orders and promises to wait for the right time and right moment. On the same night Rajashekar invited Namboothiri and Vichu to his house and after entering his room, Namboothiri passes him the fake Kalachakram that looks and warns him to not allow Ganga to enter the Kattu Amman temple as that will reveal the Kalachakram is fake. After this, both of them leaves the house, and Rajashekar passes the Kalachakram to Ganga. Ganga asked about the place but Rajashekar lied to her that he can't really remember but assumes that it is somewhere\nnear Nagore. Ganga then takes the Kalachakram and secretly hides it in her cupboard.\n\nThe next following day, Ganga asks her father about Parvatipuram but her father says that he has heard about it but doesn't know the exact place. After this, Ganga brings Serra to the temple for prayers, during which a new conflict arises for Seeta whereby a woman and her husband claims that Seeta is their sister in law married to the woman's brother. No matter how much Seeta tells them that they have been mistaken her for the wrong person they still refuse to back down on their decision. That's when Ganga comes to her rescue defending Seeta and bringing her back to the palace. \n\nAfter arriving at the palace, Ganga meets Arun and asks him about Parvatipuram and he tells her that it's 20km to 40km away from Chengalpattu and advises her not to go to any temples at that area because earlier when Arun sets a detective to investigate the mystery case about his father's past life, the detective ended up dead. After coming to know about this Ganga decided to execute her plan in a safe by discovering more of the mysterious secrets before taking actions (going to Parvatipuram Kattu Amman temple). \n\nThe unnamed woman, her husband, and her brother came to the palace to bring back Seeta but with the combined efforts of Ganga, Arun and Manju they managed to send the group of family back to where they came from while deciding to investigate even deeper about Seeta's secret husband. On the same night, Arun secretly visits Seeta and tells her that he will investigate about who have sent them here (his prime suspect is No.1. Devi and No.2. Dharmaraj) and while he is investigating he tells her not to take any abrupt decision that will end up with her being in danger. She agrees to that condition but she says some of her suggestions like Bala and Thuraipaandi to which Arun says that both of them will not be the ones as he has given them a strict warning. Seeta then tells her decision to Arun after which he agrees and leaves (we will know in the next few episodes what are her decisions that she have taken). Don't forget to take a note that the possible suspect that is currently trying to discover Seeta's husband, might be Ganga as she has told Seeta that she will find out who her husband is even if she doesn't want to say it in the previous episodes.\n\nThe next day, Ganga wakes up Devasena and tells her to take a bath and get ready to go to school. Devasena pretends to take a bath because she is allergic to cold water but her plans failed when her mother Janaki splashes the water from the shower on Devasena. \n\nAfter sending Devasena to school, Ganga visited the family that confronted Seeta earlier in the temple (the woman and her family are Ganga's friends) and it's revealed that Ganga had planned all this along as a way to find out who is Seeta's husband. \n\nJust as she was about to leave the house she was surprised to see her husband Arun and Seeta entering the house. Before they find out about her presence at the house she decided to hide and also find the purpose why both of them are here. \n\nArun then reveals himself as the legitimate husband of Seeta and shows the photo taken in Kerala as a prove. Alas Ganga was surprised by the shocking revelation told by her husband. She didn't confront them at her friends house because she was in a great dilemma and depression.\n\nAfter Arun has left the house, he arrived at the palace and warned all of his family members (Manju, Dharmaraj, Moorthy and Devi) not to interfere in Seeta's life anymore. After this Seeta returned to the outhouse just to discover Ganga waiting for her arrival. Seeta then confronted a tearful Ganga and asked her why is she tearing to which Ganga said it was nothing important. Seeta then decided to tell the truth about who is her real husband to Ganga. At first, Ganga refused to listen telling to Seeta that some truths are better not to be known.\n\nThe next day, Seeta persuades Ganga to know who her husband is, but indirectly lies to Ganga by telling her that she is going to go to London not only for her further studies but mainly because her husband Annamalai is working there. Ganga who really knows who is Seeta's husband (that's Arun) quietly listens to Seeta's lies and made sure that Seeta doesn't suspect that she (Ganga) already learned the truth about Seeta's secret marriage and her husband.\n\nOn the same day, Ganga decided to go to Parvatipuram to return the Kalachakram to the Kattu Amman but before she can leave the palace, Devasena was about to enter the room to spend some time with Ganga. On discovering Devasena's presence, Ganga quickly hides the bag containing the 3 Kalachakram before Devasena enters the room. Devasena then meets Ganga and tells her about her wishes. \n\nAt the same time, Seeta enters the room and when Ganga sees her she told Seeta to dress up Devasena in a wedding saree while she waits outside of the room. The whole family who discovered Ganga waiting outside asked her what's the reason but Ganga remains tight-lipped and tells them all to wait for the surprise. After Seeta has completed the makeup for Devasena the whole family was astonished to discover Devasena in her saree. \n\nWhen everyone asks Arun how did Devasena looked, he describes her as similar to Seeta (which he corrected it by mentioning the similarity between Seeta and Janaki appearance wise) much to Ganga's disappointment. When the family was busy in taking photos with Devasena, Ganga made her move by taking the bag containing 3 Kalachakram and leaving the house. Just as she was about to go her father asked her to where she is going and she said that she is going to a temple and she gets her fathers blessings. \n\nJust before she leaves the house front gate she was confronted by Janaki who told her that she (Ganga) is not the one who should leave the palace but Seeta. Ganga still refused to listen to Janaki but before she left Janaki told her that she might return to the palace because of her love for Devasena. \n\nAfter completing his business meetings, Rajashekar returned home and was at his room reading a newspaper. Just about time, Ganga's father entered the room and gives him the cup of coffee. When he inquired about Ganga, Ganga's father told him that she had when to do her prayers at a temple while taking along a bag with her but he doesn't know the name of the temple. \n\nGanga then pays Seiyanayagi a visit to inform her that she is going to Parvatipuram but is warned by Seiyanayagi not to go. In front of Seiyanayagi she listens to her advise but in reality, she stubbornly goes to Parvatipuram. She asked directions to Parvatipuram from an old woman who warned her about the dangers lurking around that area but still she decided to go even after that warning. \n\nJust then Ganga gives a call and informs Rajashekar that she has found Parvatipuram that is 40 km away from Chengalpattu. Rajashekar who already knows that Ganga is going to Parvatipuram quickly informs Namboothiri. Namboothiri then tells Rajashekar to stop Ganga from going closer towards the Kattu Amman (if she does she will discover that they have given her the fake Kalachakrams) to which Rajashekar agrees with him and takes his actions. Namboothiri then says to himself that Ganga is digging her own grave by going to Parvatipuram.\n\nThe time shown on the clock is 2.30pm, which also is the moment she has already reached Parvatipuram. She is then confronted and stopped by Karuppan's Aruvaal which was sent by Seiyanayagi to stop Ganga from going but Ganga asks for forgiveness to Seiyanayagi saying that it's her duty to make sure that nothing bad will happen to her family even at the cost of her own life and steps forward into Parvatipuram. \n\nSeiyanayagi who comes to know about the impetuous decision taken by Ganga, tells to her disciples that she can no longer save Ganga after this but she can only do her best prayers to Karrupanasamy and be hopeful that nothing bad happens to Ganga for the next 2 hours. \n\nThis is because, the moment Ganga set her foot on the soil of Parvatipuram was on an Ashtami tithi which is prone to bring harm, especially to Ganga because her maranam (death) strongly can happen only in this tithi as the people that she had trusted all this while will turn against her during this time.\n\nOn her way searching for the Kattu Amman temple she comes across two men's (either Rajashekar or Namboothiri or Vichu's gang) who chases after her for the bag she is having while running away from them, Arun calls her only to discover that she cut the line which she will never do whenever he calls her. \n\nArun who discovers that something fishy is happening to Ganga, calls Ganga's father and inquires about the place Ganga had went to which her father tells him that she went to a temple but is unsure of the temples name or the exact place she had gone because he forgot to ask her. \n\nArun says that there isn't any problem when Ganga's father inquired about the reason why Arun called him. Arun then calls his friend in order to track her phone location and in 5 minutes time his friend mentioned that this person is 30 km to 40 km away from Chengalpattu. \n\nWhen Arun asked for the exact location, his friend tells him that this person (Ganga) is in Parvatipuram. He remembers of telling Ganga not to go to Parvatipuram because it's a very dangerous place to visit but she still visits the place by herself. Arun then rushes to Parvatipuram in order to save Ganga from any life-threatening situations.\n\nGanga who managed to escape from the two pursuers (who is not very far behind), discovers the Kattu Amman temple and starts her prayers by cleaning up the place that's filled with many overgrown grasses and start to perform the formal procedures of prayers for the Kattu Amman. \n\nOnce she's done with her prayers she lights up the vilakku (sacred lamp) but the fire goes off because of a strong wind (a symbolism to show that the goddess Kattu Amman is not accepting her prayers). After this she offered the 3 Kalachakrams at the feet of the goddess to which the 3 Kalachakram begins to vibrate in a very unstable manner. Ganga was very shocked after discovering this incident.\n\nKattu Amman exposed that the 3 Kalachakram given by Rajashekar to Ganga are fake ones by burning all the 3 fake Kalachakrams. Ganga who came to know the truth decided to confront Rajashekar about this conspiracy but on her way she was confronted by the two goons who was chasing her earlier. \n\nNandhini who has observed this all along decided to leave her house and rescue Ganga who is about to be in a big danger. Before she can even leave she was stopped by her promise that she made with Muniappa. When Muniappa came into the house, he was shocked to see the condition of the house which was messy and asked Nandhini what had happened. \n\nNandhini told him what was happening to Ganga in Parvatipuram and tells him to take back his promise so that she can save Ganga from her fated doom that is about to happen any minute. Muniappa assumes that Ganga's family member (Rajashekar) will not harm her and tells this fact to Nandhini but Nandhini who knows what is going to happen tells him that she is in a grave danger that could even end up with her own death.\n\nHowever, Muniappa stubbornly refuses to take back his promise saying that no matter what will happen he will not let Nandhini go out and invite trouble to herself until after Margazhi Pournami (the day Nandhini gains her full powers and also the ability to have her own human form) because he has already promised to Parvati (Nandhini's mother) that he will make sure to take good care of Nandhini until the day the prophecy happens.\n\nOn the same time, Ganga runs away but trips and falls in front of Rajashekar. When she asked him for the real Kalachakram he together with Namboothiri and Vichu refuses to give the real ones to her. At this moment, Ganga realizes that she has been cheated all along by the three of them whom she trusted and was led into the trap set by them (Rajashekar, Namboothiri and Vichu). \n\nGanga then threatens Rajashekar by saying that she will inform his son Arun (Arun is already in Parvatipuram searching for Ganga) about their conspiracies. Rajashekar then pleads her not to say a word about this to his son but Ganga stubbornly refuses to listen to his pleas (while silently recording the video in her phone), which in return made Rajashekar to stab her brutally in her belly with a sharp knife provided by Vichu in an effort to silence her.\n\nWith her last burst of energy Ganga pushes away Rajashekar and runs for her life while taking out the knife which was protruding from her stabbed wound (chances of Ganga to survive are even lesser) and throwing it away onto the ground. While she is running away from all of them, she tried to call Arun to inform him about what had transpired, but one of the goons threw a log at her leg making her to trip and fall which makes her phone to slip out of her hands and falls a few distance away from her. \n\nThis bought the three of them enough time to catch-up with Ganga and both the goons managed to capture her (even though she tries to wriggle out of their grasp she fails to do so) while the other three (Rajashekar, Namboothiri and Vichu) surrounded Ganga to settle their scores by killing her. \n\nThe time is shown to be 3.10pm with another 1 hour 20 minutes more time for Ashtami to come to an end. At the same moment, Seiyanayagi who have been observing all that had already happened calls out to Ganga with an opened arms (hinting that she is powerless and cannot do anything to prevent Ganga's predicted death).\n\nIn the latest episode, it is shown that after the goons captured Ganga, they covered her mouth tightly so that she doesn’t make any noise worrying Arun (already inside the Parvatipuram forest looking for Ganga) whom might possibly hear her and comes to her rescue. At the same time, Arun calls out for Ganga whereas Nambothiri tells Rajasekhar to call him now and ask him to leave this place immediately. According to him, he is being a hindrance to them to kill Ganga. \n\nRajasekhar then calls Arun by his phone and acts by telling him lies as if he is going to meet the doctor in the hospital due to cardiac arrest. Arun then says he will come back to him after finding Ganga. Rajasekhar again lied to him saying Ganga have already called and informed him that she had already left Parvatipuram and is on the way coming back to home. By hearing this, Arun is excited and relieved to hear that Ganga is safe and leaves the forest with his vehicle immediately. \n\nMeanwhile, at Muniappan’s house Nandhini is urging him to take back his promise as she needs to save Ganga from being killed by the evil people. Muniappa again refuses to listen by saying Nandhini’s safety is important to him compared to Ganga’s life. While this argument is going on, Ganga is being beaten mercilessly by the goons of Vichu with weapons. It is then revealed that Nambothiri wants the goons to torture and beat Ganga so that Ganga will be in pain which will enrage Nandhini. Therefore, Nandhini will come to rescue Ganga and when she comes Nambothiri can tie up Nandhini forever this time. \n\nHe ordered to beat Ganga even more so that Nandhini must be even more enraged and comes out from her hideout. They tied Ganga to a tree and beat her. Whenever Ganga fell unconscious, they will splash water on Ganga to awake her and beat her again. Rajasekhar leaves the place telling them to bury her body after she dies and not to burn her body as Ganga is like a loving daughter to him and she's unable to withstand the heat from the fire. \n\nAs Rajasekhar is leaving, Ganga shouts at him saying he and his gang will never be spared by Nandhini’s wrath and that Nandhini will come back after Margazhi Pournami to avenge them as a Nagakanni. She also said Nandhini will kill all of them for all the sins they have committed. Ganga also warns Rajasekhar that he will face severe consequences for betraying Ganga as he is the one Ganga believed the most. Rajasekhar just leaves the place silently and speechless. \n\nBy seeing all this, Nandhini, on the other hand, pleading to Muniappa to take back his promise and accuses him for being so inhumane. To appease Nandhini, Parvathi (Sivanagam) appears in front of them and warns Nandhini not to go as it is their trick to lure Nandhini and are using Ganga as bait to trap her forever. Nandhini doesn’t seem to care much about it and keep on insisting to rescue Ganga. Furthermore, she also blames Parvathi for Ganga’s current condition as only because of Parvathi revealed all the truth to Ganga she is going to die. \n\nParvathi disagrees with Nandhini’s accusation and said she only revealed the truth to make Ganga realize Nandhini is innocent and she never wanted Ganga to return the 3 Kalachakrams to Kaatu Amman herself. Finally, Parvathi gives up by Nandhini’s stubborn act and allows Nandhini to go rescue Ganga. She asks Muniappan to take back his promise. Thereafter, Muniappan also takes back his promise and allows Nandhini to go. \n\nAs Nandhini is about to leave to rescue Ganga, Ganga while being beaten ruthlessly by the goons shouts out loud pleading Nandhini not to come here and all these are Nambothiri’s plan to make Nandhini tied up forever. She also warns Nandhini if she comes she will never able to avenge these evil people. Ganga made a promise on herself that Nandhini should never come to rescue her by saying “idhu ye mele sathiyam” which means “I'm swearing upon myself to make sure you should not come to rescue me”. \n\nJust as how Muniappan’s promise forbade Nandhini to rescue Ganga, now Ganga’s swear/promise made Nandhini unable to come near to Ganga or rescue her. At the same time, Nambothiri sits on the ground near Ganga and chants some mantras as an early preparation to imprison Nandhini. \n\nIn the end, Ganga dies from the beatings of the goons. Nambothiri learns that Nandhini will never come after this as Ganga already died and no use of waiting for Nandhini anymore. The goons, Vichu and Nambothiri digs a very deep hole in the ground and buries Ganga’s dead body. \n\nThey left the place after making sure no other evidence of the murder is left out (but they never knew about Ganga's phone which slipped out from Ganga’s hand and inside the phone there is a video recording of Rajasekhar stabbing Ganga with knife). \n\nIn the mean time, Seiyanayagi learns about Ganga’s death and feels very sad and disappointed. Sad because she is unable to save Ganga, disappointed because even her Karuppusamy can’t save Ganga’s life from the danger. She laments about how Ganga could have heeded to her advice and not going to Parvatipuram. \n\nAt the last scene of the episode, Bhairavi comes to the Parvathipuram forest as well to see Kaatu Amman and asks her permission to possess all three Kalachakrams. As she is finding the statue of Kaattu Amman, Bhairavi accidentally trips into Ganga’s phone. Bhairavi opens the phone and finds out that it is Ganga’s phone by seeing the wallpaper of the phone (picture of Ganga and Arun together). \n\nBhairavi suspects what Ganga’s phone is doing in the Parvatipuram forest. Assuming that it is a hint given by Kaatu Amman alias Selli Amman to reveal something, she searches for the files in the phone to find out something interesting. \n\nAs she suspected, she found the video record of Rajasekhar stabbing Ganga with a knife to kill her. The episode ends with a smiling face and a very happy look on Bhairavi hinting that she is going to do something beneficial to her by using the video as an evidence to threaten Rajashekar and get hold of the 3 Kalachakrams.\n\nBhairavi feels very happy that she found the video as now she can possess all three Kalachakras using the video record which will serve as the proof for Rajasekhar murdering Ganga. She plans to blackmail Rajasekhar and obtain all the Three Kalachakras. At the same time, Bhairavi wonders what could have happened in between which caused Rajasekhar to the extent of killing his own daughter in law.\n\nBhairavi later thanks Kaatu Amman alias Selli Amman for showing her the video proof which is going to facilitate the process of her possessing the kalachakras. Bhairavi assumes that maybe Kaatu Amman wants her to visit the Amman only when she has all the Three Kalachakras. She vows to obtain all three Kalachakras and will present them infront of the Goddess. After that, Bhairavi greets the Goddess in an honorable gesture as a sign of gratitude facing North Side (the side Kaattu Amman statue is situated).\n\nMeanwhile, in the palace Ganga’s father, Manickam worries about Ganga and her whereabouts. In the living room, Devi, Dharmaraj and his son Moorthy was enquiring Manickam about some pending houseworks that needs to be sorted out but Manickam stays still deeply thinking about Ganga only. When Devi raised her voice, Manickam realized they were standing beside him and apologised for ignoring them. He said he is very worried about Ganga. Dharmaraj and Devi then persuade him by telling Ganga will be back home and she knows her way home. \n\nRajasekhar enters the palace and sees the crowd. He then knows what has happened after Manickam explained his worry to him. Rajasekhar asks everyone else to leave Manickam alone and persuades Manickam by telling Ganga will be back home by today and not to worry. Rajasekhar climbs upstairs to his room while Manickam in a partially convinced state leaves the hall. \n\nDay turns night, Arun finally arrives at the palace and went to Rajasekhar’s room at once. He was extra worried about his father’s cardiac arrest. Rajasekhar then told him that it was just a mild attack and it is him who unnecessarily exaggerated the matter. Arun then tells Rajasekhar that it is enough of him toiling hard for the company. Now it is Arun’s turn to take care of the company management. Rajasekhar notices the tension face on Arun and asked him why he is so tension. Arun explains his tension to him saying Ganga is still no where to be found and that he is extremely worried about that. \n\nAs Arun about to leave the room, he asked Rajasekhar whether he is the one who sent Ganga to Parvatipuram because during their last conversation she mentioned she is going to visit Kattu Amman in Parvatipuram. Moreover, since Rajasekhar knows the place very well, Arun asks Rajasekhar whether he has anything to do with Ganga’s disappearance or knows about her whereabouts. Rajasekhar said he don’t know anything and maintains silence. When Arun keeps on nagging him, Rajasekhar puts up an act as if he has chest pain in order to end the conversation. Arun then apologies to Rajasekhar for asking him all these questions and should not have nagged him knowing he is unwell. \n\nArun goes downstairs and meets his relatives and Manickam who were anxiously waiting for him. Manickam enquired Arun about Ganga and Arun gives a disappointing answer to Manickam which he did not want to hear. Arun promises Manickam that he will find Ganga very soon and bring her back home in a confident mode as he knows her last known location through his friend which is Parvatipuram forest. Manickam leaves with a hopeful heart. \n\nArun’s aunt, Manju asked Arun that Manickam can be pacified but how to pacify Devasena? Devasena was looking for Ganga the first thing she came back home from school and even refused to change school uniform without Ganga, she added. But somehow Manju managed to convince Devasena and at last put her to sleep. Manju requested Arun to expedite the process of finding Ganga, otherwise it will be very hard to pacify Devasena later on. As all of them disperse, Moorthy is happy that Ganga is lost and he does not want Ganga to come back into the house ever again. \n\nArun leaves and enters his bedroom seeing Devasena sleeping soundly on the bed. He feels very pity for Devasena and worries about what is going to happen to Devasena if he fails to find Ganga. He then walks to Janaki’s photo and pours out all his emotions and sorrows to Janaki’s photo assuming he is conversing with Janaki herself. He prays hard to God that he has to locate Ganga very soon. On the other hand, Janaki’s spirit is hearing all these and she worries about Arun and Devasena. She feels Ganga will never leave Devasena alone at any cost and suspects something fishy must have happened. In a distant, Janaki promises Arun that she will find Ganga too and unite Ganga with Arun. \n\nAll of the sudden, Janaki’s spirit gets a vision related to Ganga’s current condition. (Janaki gets the vision just like how she got a vision about Devasena’s whereabouts after being abducted by Chamundi during the Suriya Grahana Ammavasya Day). In the vision, Janaki sees all the injustice happened to Ganga starting from the moment she left the house until the moment she was buried. She also sees the persons who were involved in this heinous crime. Janaki is shocked to see Rajasekhar is involved too since she could not believe her father in law whom she assumed to be good but is actually evil. She burns in fury and enrages after knowing the truth. \n\nJanaki decides to teach Rajasekhar a lesson for killing his own daughter in law. She furiously starts off to Seetha’s room to possess her body. Seetha was worried too about Ganga’s condition before getting possessed by Janaki’s spirit. Seetha who is now possessed by Janaki’s spirit goes to Rajasekhar’s room and locks the door after her. She shouts at sleeping Rajasekhar to wake him up. \n\nRajasekhar is shocked to see Seetha in his room in the middle of the night. Unknowing Seetha’s body is possessed by Janaki’s spirit he asked her how did she enter his locked room. Janaki confronted Rajasekhar directly without beating around the bush. She asked how Rajasekhar can sleep peacefully after committing a sin. She asked why and how did he had the heart to kill Ganga. Rajasekhar still acts innocent and says he himself is worried about Ganga and how can Seetha blame him unnecessarily for killing Ganga. \n\nJanaki then shouts out loud, exclaiming, “I am not Seetha! I am Janaki!” while breaking a furniture near to her. This shocks Rajasekhar even more. Janaki said she will make Rajasekhar feel the pain of death. She created a barrier made of fire around Rajasekhar’s bed. The blazing fire surrounded Rajasekhar completely, preventing him from escaping from his bed. The episode ends with Rajasekhar crying in fear, trapped inside the fire barrier formed by Janaki.\n\nThe episode continues with Rajasekhar trembling in fear and it is showed he is unable to withstand the heat from the fire. Janaki then pulls Rajasekhar from the firey barrier and throws him to a sofa without Rajasekhar getting hurt. Now from this it is evident that Janaki only wants to make Rajasekhar realise the pain of how it feels like being killed and she has no intention to kill him. Nevertheless, Janaki confronts Rajasekhar again, demanding a valid reason from him for killing Ganga, this time in a more furious grip. Rajasekhar apologies to Janaki and said that he regrets for what he had done. He pleaded to Janaki to not conceal the truth to Arun. \n\nJanaki seems to not buying the lies of Rajasekhar and said she will definitely tell Arun about all Rajasekhar’s wrongdoings. Rajasekhar pleads again, saying rather than Arun comes to know that his father is a murderer it is better for Janaki to kill him herself. Janaki replies that rather than killing him, the deserving punishment for him will be revealing Rajasekhar’s true colors to Arun. Rajasekhar then said to Janaki, if Arun comes to know of the truth, he can’t bear it hence he will die heartbroken. He adds, if Janaki wants Arun to die and Devasena to become an orphan then by all means she can reveal Rajasekhar’s dirty secret. Janaki is startled by hearing this and realizes that what Rajasekhar said has some truth. But still, her reaction seems to be hinting that she thinks Rajasekhar is justifying his crime. \n\nRajasekhar then explains more about so-called his side of justice. According to him, initially he stole the Three Kalachakras from Kaatu Amman is only because for the welfare of his family especially his only son, Arun. And not because he is selfish or greedy. According to him also, the fact that he gave Ganga those fake Kalachakras is not because that he did not want to give the original Kalachakras. But it is because Nambothiri had warned him if he gives out the Kalachakra that he has, Arun and Devasena’s life will be in danger. (Viewers has to note that the words Rajasekhar mentioned about Nambothiri’s warnings has not been showed in any of the previous episodes) \n\nMoreover, Ganga kept threatening Rajasekhar that she will reveal Rajasekhar’s secrets to Arun. He was not able to take it as for 20 years he kept his secret from Arun and now Ganga is going to break it. So he had no choice but to kill Ganga but he swears he did that unwillingly and his conscience did not allow him to do it. Rajasekhar then tells Janaki to punish him and he will take any punishment Janaki gives him for the sin that he has committed. Janaki says she came to live in that house and wishes everyone to live only and not to die. As per Janaki, she will not do anything that will cause death in her in law’s house. (So this scene obviously shows Janaki is not going to reveal anything to Arun for now).\nAfter hearing Rajasekhar’s justification, Janaki’s spirit told him not to tell anyone else about her existence and left Seetha’s body. \n\nSeetha who is now no more possessed is clueless on how she got into Rajasekhar’s room. Rajasekhar manages the situation by telling he had asked Seetha for water and Seetha is the one who brought him water flask to drink. Seetha is still clueless however is sent back to the outhouse by Rajasekhar later on. \n\nThe next day morning, Devasena wakes up from sleep and searches for Ganga thinking Ganga is back home. She wants Ganga to help her on bathing and brushing teeth. By seeing this, Janaki decides to help Devasena herself on behalf of Ganga. She brings toothbrush and towel to Devasena invisibly. Devasena found out that is must be her mother, Janaki’s doing and says she can bath and brush independently. Janaki brings Devasena’s school uniform and packs her school bag for her to get ready to school. Devasena is now ready to go school and Janaki appears before her. Devasena is happy to see her but enquires about Ganga. Janaki lies to her by saying Ganga had gone to temple tour for three days and let her enjoy this time as she only sits at home. \n\nDevasena agreed and she said she will manage just like how she survived when Ganga went to Kerala for honeymoon. On the other hand, Arun is trying hard to find Ganga by contacting his friends and Parvatipuram forest officer. Arun then feels surprised and proud to see Devasena who have gotten ready to school by herself. Devasena tells Arun that since Ganga had gone to temple tour for three days so she has to prepare herself to be independent. Arun assumes maybe Manju aunty is the one who told Devasena this. \n\nArun then sends Devasena into their car while Seetha also joins them. Seetha is also surprised to see how Devasena managed to be calm without Ganga. Arun explains maybe Manju aunty is the one who told Devasena that Ganga had went for three days temple tour. Seetha prays hard to God that Ganga should be found. \n\nMeanwhile, Manickam visits the family which Ganga sought help to put up a drama to find out Seetha’s husband. (It seems the family is Ganga’s relatives and not only friends). Manickam was warmly received by the family and one of the women asked whether Ganga did not come along with him? Manickam began to shed tears in front of them. The husband of the woman asks why he is crying and Manickam told them everything that had happened. He still could not figure out why Ganga went to the deserted forest temple and what made her to go there suddenly. \n\nThe family doubts it has got to do with Arun and Seetha’s illegal relationship so they revealed all the truth to Mancikam as they had no choice. They felt there is no point hiding the truth anymore after what had happened. After knowing Arun is the one who tied Thaali (auspicious marital insignia) on Seetha, Manickam feels disappointed and very angry. The family rendered to help Manickam to ask justice for Ganga but he refused and went to palace to ask justice for himself. \n\nAt the palace, Manickam furiously arrives at the living room where Arun is standing and pulls his shirt. He scolded and cursed Arun with bad words. Arun was shocked to see Manickam’s behaviour. Manickam accuses Arun of destroying Ganga’s life and because of him, Ganga’s life has been ruined. He pulls his shirt again and angrily scolds him again. Moorthy pushes Manickam away by telling how dare he behaves rudely with Arun, the boss of this house. Manju also asks Manickam how can he behave like this to his own son in law. Unknowing Manickam had learned the truth, Arun becomes more worried and is totally clueless on why he is behaving in such a way. \n\nJust as the argument is heating up, Seetha comes to the crowd to make the situation even worse. Moorthy again hits Manickam to chase him from the house but Manickam pushes Moorthy away and shouts, “Yes! Chase me from the house! Chase me like how all of you had chased Ganga from the house!” The episode ends with the shocking faces of Seetha and Arun after hearing Manickam’s statement.\n\nManju is shocked after hearing what Manickam has said. She asked him what happened until it made him to accuse Arun in such a way. Manickam says Arun is the one who planned and chased Ganga out of the house to get rid off her, again pulls his shirt. Rajasekhar enters the scene seeing all the commotion and intervenes. He asks why Manickam is treating Arun like this and Manickam spilled the beans to him. He revealed Arun is the one who married Seetha and that Ganga already knew this. He accuses Arun saying Arun fell in love with Seetha due to her similar looks as Janaki, so Ganga is like an obstacle for him to get Seetha. Hence, Arun sent Ganga to Parvatipuram forest and killed her. \n\nEveryone including Rajasekhar was shocked to hear this especially Rajasekhar who now has mixed feelings of guilt and disappointment, stood there completely speechless. He maintained silence throughout the commotion. Manju then backed up Arun saying Manickam is accusing Arun unnecessarily as Ganga is now absent in the home. But, Arun then admitted he is the one who married Seetha. It gave a double shock to everyone else but Seetha interrupted in telling it is all her fault and please do not blame Arun. Manickam said he won't believe the stories that they are telling, hence he requested Rajasekhar to reprimand Arun for his wrongdoings. But Rajasekhar still stood there silently which angered Manickam even more, and he assumes it is because Arun is his son so that is why he is not reprimanding Arun and supports him. \n\nArun refuses Manickam's accusation and said how will he kill Ganga when he loves her dearly. Manickam keeps saying that Arun is the one who did something bad to Ganga. Meanwhile, Janaki's spirit is watching all this and decided to throw the letter (the letter which Ganga wrote before leaving the house) which she saw falling from Ganga's cupboard into the middle of the crowd. She did this to avoid Arun from being blamed as a murderer and obviously the real murderer is Rajasekhar. Manju picked up the letter and read the content in it, written, \n\"Due to some reasons, I have decided to serve God for a while so I am leaving the house. This is my own decision without of anyone's influence and please do not search for me. Yours Truly, \nGanga\" \n\nManickam did not believe the letter and said Arun could have forced Ganga to write it or created the letter by himself. He curses the family and says from now on he is severing all the ties with the family and leaves the house. Seetha and Arun plead to Manickam to not leave the house but he did not listen. He said one day God will severely punish this family for what they done to Ganga, and angrily leaves the house. Before Manickam left the house, Arun tried to explain his side of justice too by saying he did not marry Seetha vountarily, but was forced to marry her due to circumstances and was afraid to reveal it to Ganga. Again Manickam ignored his so-called explanations. Manickam now left the house. \n\nThe remaining people go to their respective rooms. Arun and Seetha, feels bad for not revealing the truth to Ganga in the first place and regrets. Especially Seetha who thinks she is the one Ganga believed the most and that now she has no rights to stay in the house anymore. She then packs her things to get out from the outhouse just as then Janaki appears before her. \n\nJanaki told Seetha that she should not leave the house yet otherwise there will be no one to explain the truth about what really happened. According to her, Seetha is selfish if she leaves the house just like that after creating problems in the family. It is because of Seetha that Manickam accused Arun as a murderer. She demanded Seetha to stay and sort out the family's problems which caused by her first and wait until Ganga comes back home. (Janaki has a point, because if Seetha leaves the house now then Manickam and others will surely assume that both Arun and her did cheat Ganga, so Seetha escapes from the house as the truth is exposed. Hence, it will be falsely considered that Arun is the one who sent her to Parvatipuram.) \n\nSeetha agreed and Janaki vanished into thin air. Meanwhile, as Rajasekhar is resting in his room he receives a phone call from Bhairavi. When he picked up the call, Bhairavi said that she had sent a video to him and asks him to view it first. Rajasekhar then clicks open the video sent by her and was extremely shocked to see it. He called back Bhairavi and asked how did she got the video. Bhairavi replied that the video is a gift presented by Selli Amman to her. She blackmails Rajasekhar saying he is now in Bhairavi's grip and he is unable to escape from her. \n\nRajasekhar said he will talk to Bhairavi personally about this but Bhairavi has other plans. She told him that tomorrow she will be arriving at his palace herself once again. Bhairavi wants Rajasekhar to welcome her in a very grand manner and give her full respect when she comes to the palace. She wants back the same respect which she lost in the palace previously. Rajasekhar agreed and ended the phone call. Bhairavi is confident that she can obtain all the Three Kalachakras by using the video she has. \n\nIn the meantime, Manickam visits Seiyanayagi and pours out his feelings to her. He said that Ganga is nowhere to be found and seeks help from her to locate Ganga. Seiyanayagi replies Ganga is still alive and will definitely return home. She assured Manickam that even though Ganga went to a place she not supposed to go, she will be back home at the right time. Seiyanayagi told Manickam not to worry about Ganga anymore. Manickam is so pleased to hear this and greets Seiyanayagi before leaving. On the other hand, Seiyanayagi's disciples are confused by what Seiyanayagi has said. One of them asked that Ganga has already died, so did Seiyanayagi lied to Manickam to console him? The episode ends with Seiyanayagi saying, \" No, I did not lied. Ganga is really alive\"\n\nSeiyanayagi also tells her disciples that Ganga will be back at the right time without delaying neither arrive too early. The next scene is showed Arun is driving his car next to him is a police inspector. They are on their mission to find Ganga in Parvatipuram. The police inspector said, with the help of Parvatipuram forest officer they have searched the whole forest but still unable to locate Ganga. He also added that he has lost confidence that Ganga will be found and is not believing that Ganga is still at the forest. He suggested maybe Ganga had already left the forest. But Arun said he believes his intuition which strongly says Ganga is still at the forest. He requested the police officer to search for Ganga again, and the inspector agrees to search again. \n\nAs they arrive at Parvatipuram, they asked whoever that passed by and enquired them whether they have seen Ganga by showing her photo. All of them did not know her at all until Arun and the police inspector came across an old lady. The old lady is the same lady which Ganga had asked for directions to go to Kaattu Amman temple previously. The lady recognized Ganga after Arun showed her the photo and said she saw her, and also showed her the direction to Kaatu Amman temple. Arun said he is Ganga's husband and Ganga have not yet come back home. The old lady said that she had warned Ganga before to not to enter the temple as there are snakes guarding the temple. \n\nArun asked about Parvati too by showing her Parvati's photo. The lady knew Parvati too and begins to narrate the story of Muniappan's family. She recalled all the incident happened 20 years ago including Parvati's speciality in curing illnesses and doing wonders in their village. She said the whole family died bitten by the two snakes guarding the temple. (The Parvatipuram villagers are unaware of the fact that Parvati and Nandhini are the two snakes).\nThe old lady told Arun maybe Ganga has been bitten by the snakes and died. \n\nArun and the inspector left the old lady and went to their vehicle. Arun begins to doubt Rajasekhar whether he has something to do with Parvati's death. He has now learned Parvati is actually dead and not alive but still is unsure of the truth. He also thinks Rajasekhar is the one who imprisoned Nandhini inside the snake mound for 20 years. So, Rajasekhar must have done something evil to Parvati's family and so on. The police inspector saw Arun in a disturbed state and consoles him by saying Ganga can't be bitten by those snakes and the forest temple is only deserted but not dangerous at all. Arun clears his mind and both of them continue their journey. \n\nBack in the palace, Bhairavi arrives and Rajasekhar welcomes her in a very respectful manner by asking Manju to take 'arathi' for Bhairavi. Bhairavi enters the palace as Devi just watches her and wonders how Bhairavi is able enter the palace again but this time with Rajasekhar's special hospitality. She thought to herself maybe Bhairavi used black magic and bound-spelled Rajashekar to dance to her tunes. \"I will definitely find out the truth because there is something fishy as Bhairavi keeps coming back to palace\", she says. \n\nMeanwhile, Rajasekhar and Bhairavi enter his room and he locks the door after him. He requested Bhairavi to give the video record to him in exchange of lump sum money. Bhairavi laughed and said that she is not an ordinary human to desire on money. She only desires incredible powers which is the kalachakras. Rajasekhar takes out a gun and says to Bhairavi that it is better for her to surrender to him. Bhairavi laughed again and she turned the point of the gun to Rajasekhar's chest using the power rays of her eyes. Rajasekhar trembles in fear and Bhairavi tells him not to mess with her because she can do anything by using her eyes only. Rajasekhar becomes afraid and asks some more time frame to Bhairavi to collect the Three Kalchakras. Bhairavi gives him two days grace and after two days she must get the kalachakras. \n\nBhairavi leaves the palace but insults and mocks Devi in the middle. Devi is very angry about this and promises to find the truth. In the next scene, it is showed Nambothiri and his three disciples are gathered in a forest. The disciples are digging three separate holes respectively. Rajasekhar comes to Nambothiri and asked why they are digging the holes. Nambothiri replies these are the special traps to catch Nandhini and prevent her from taking human form during the Margazhi Pournami (December Full Moon Day) and episode ends.\n\nNambothiri assures Rajasekhar he can successfully trap Nandhini and prevent her from taking Nagakanni form (human female form) during the Margazhi Pournami. Rajasekhar said he is very much indebted to Nambothiri as he is striving so hard to save Rajasekhar's family from danger and feels proud of their friendship. He is also very confident that Nandhini will be imprisoned by Nambothiri. \n\nBack in the palace, Devi, Leela, Dharmaraj & Moorthy are fun chatting in the living room while Seetha passes by. Dharmaraj requested Seetha to make him a coffee but turned down by Seetha. She said Devasena will be back home from school anytime now so she needs to make food for her and asks him to approach Lakshmi instead. Devi intervenes, saying that Seetha is now Arun's wife and she is also the lady boss of this house. They should not treat Seetha as a servant anymore in a mocking tone. Dharmaraj agrees and laughs sarcastically. Seetha just leaves silently. \n\nLeela leaves to make coffee instead leaving Devi, Dharmaraj and Moorthy. Three of them plans to disclose the fact that Arun married Seetha to Devasena after she comes back. Devi also plans to create ruckus in the family by telling Devasena that because Arun married Seetha only Ganga left the house and will never come back. Devasena comes home and they tell her what they had planned. Dharmaraj opens up by first saying Arun had married Seetha. To their astonishment, Devasena is happy that Seetha and Arun married as she wished the same to happen. Devasena runs to her room happily before Dharmaraj could tell her that Ganga left the house because of this only. Devi is disappointed and angry with Dharmaraj for not telling her the matter quickly. \n\nDevasena hurries to Arun to thank him for marrying Seetha and it is her wish came true. Arun just listens to her speechlessly. Meanwhile, Manickam is walking alone at the roadside and is spotted by Rajasekhar who asks him to come back home. Manickam said he won't come back to the house whereby the household members (particularly Arun - who have married Seeta) have betrayed his daughter, Ganga. Rajasekhar angrily replies why is he so concerned about Ganga who is not his biological daughter. He then recalls the incident, that many years ago Manickam and his wife did not have any child so he brought an orphan Ganga who was still a baby to Rajasekhar to ask him permission if Manickam can adopt her and raise her as his own child. Rajasekhar also tells that he loves Ganga dearly too. Manickam says even though she is not his own daughter, but he treats Ganga as his own blood. Manickam leaves Rajasekhar and walked away. \n\nIn the mean time, Arun is driving and sees their family doctor. He asks the doctor how is his father's condition after the gastric attack assumed as a cardiac arrest. The family doctor is confused and says he has not met his father since two months. Arun learns that Rajasekhar had lied to him about the cardiac arrest and leaves home to question Rajasekhar. Arun keeps asking why he lied to Arun that Rajasekhar had a heart attack. But Rajasekhar managed the situation by saying he wanted to meet their family doctor but ended up visited another doctor instead. Rajasekhar tells Arun to stop suspecting him as it is breaking his heart. \n\nThe next day, Devasena cries in front of Janaki's photo and laments about Ganga's disappearance. She said Ganga left the house sulking and will never come back. Arun asked her who told her this and she said that it was Manju aunty who said that to her. Arun goes to Manju and asks why he told Devasena Ganga left the house sulking and will not come back. Manju replied that is the truth and she has to know about it one day. Arun asks Manju to persuade Devasena now for making her cry. Manju then consoles Devasena by telling she lied to her about Ganga leaving home. She tells Ganga went to temple tour only. Devasena is pacified and they both goes to the dining hall to eat. \n\nArun is now worrying about Ganga and is started to recall back the memories when Ganga was still living with him in the palace. He recalls back an incident where Ganga and Devasena wants to shave off his beard but Ganga changed her mind by telling the beard is the beauty of her husband. Rajasekhar then comes and sees an extremely worried Arun. He asks him to rest and leaves the house. After Rajasekhar left, Arun goes to Rajasekar's room to find any evidence regarding Parvatipuram. But as he busy searching in the room, Rajasekar enters the room and is shocked by his behaviour. He questions Arun and Arun replies he has to find out the truth by digging up Rajasekhar's past. Rajasekhar said it is his personal matter and unnecessary for Arun to know. This angers Arun and says he is going to Parvatipuram forest now to search for Ganga and he will not return home until she is found. He said he will search the whole forest and every part of it to locate Ganga. Rajasekhar tried to stop him but Arun leaves the house. \n\nMeanwhile, Muniappan and Nandhini are seen sitting under a tree in a jungle. Muniappa says in order to keep Nandhini safe always, they have to keep migrating from one place to another. He said if they stayed at one place then Nambothiri can easily find Nandhini to capture and trap her. Muniappa requests Nandhini to be patient until the Margazhi Pournami where during the eve of full moon day he will keep Nandhini in a more secure place. Nandhini and Muniappa start to walk in the jungle and Muniappa clears any pathway that is blocked with thorns and branches. While they are walking, Nambothiri is seen walking in the same jungle but at a different area. \n\nNambothiri is suddenly stop by a group of tribals. It is then revealed the head of the tribal group is Nambothiri's disciple. His name is Chala. Nambothiri wants a special herb to make a Shakti Nagam fall unconscious. Chala replies he has a very special herb to make any Shakti Nagam(s) to fall unconscious and it will take 10 days for the snake to regain consciousness. Chala askes Nambothiri where is the Shakti Nagam that he needs to trap. The scenes cuts and shows Nandhini and Muniappa travelling in the jungle. \n\nAt the final scene of the episode, Arun is now in Parvatipuram forest finding Ganga while recalling back a lovely scene where Arun helps Ganga to cut vegetables but accidentally cuts his hand. Ganga cries and says she can't stand her husband is hurt. Arun now thinks to himself, but now Ganga had hurt him by leaving the house. The episode ends with Arun tearing and eventually crying in the forest.\n\nArun sees illusions of Ganga in the forest, smiling and calling out to him. Whenever Arun goes near her, the image will disappear. He cries out loud, shouting when will Ganga ever return to him. Meanwhile, Muniappa and Nandhini is tired of walking, feeling thirsty. They stop by a tree, Muniappa then asks Nandhini to stay under the tree while he is going to drink water at rivers nearby. He starts off to search for any water source. \n\nChala and his tribal group are seen searching for Nandhini in the same forest. Chala said to his tribal group that they must get hold of Nandhini as per Nambothiri's order. He concludes that currently Nandhini is definitely inside the same forest that they are in now by tracing Nandhini's trailings on the ground and by sensing her smell (a special snake odour that a Shakti Nagam emits, that can be smelled by powerful magicians like Nambothiri & Chala). Fortunately, Muniappa who passes by overheard the conversations among the tribal group and watches them from distant. \n\nChala takes out from a magic candle and lights it up. A smoke is released and disperses into the atmosphere. Chala said this is a magic smoke specified to spot Nandhini and will make her unconscious by its smell. Then they can easily capture her while she is unconscious. The smoke flows rapidly into the air, searching for Nandhini. The tribals follow the smoke to trace Nandhini. Muniappa learns Nandhini is now in danger and hurries to Nandhini to inform her about the tribals. \n\nBoth of them quickly runs away from the tribals, at the same time making sure that they don't get caught by the tribals. Muniappa and Nandhini find a snake mound and Nandhini gets inside the mound to hide while Muniappa hides behind a tree. Arun, on the other hand, who was looking for Ganga now spotted Muniappa and catches him from behind. Muniappa asks him to be silent and requests him to help him from the tribals. Arun then finds a way to help Muniappa from the tribal group. He then saw a beehive on top of a tree branch. He gets a stone and targets the beehive. Just as the tribals got near to the tree, he hits the beehive causing a swarm of bees flying out from the beehive and attacks the tribals. The tribals got heavily stung by the bees and ran away. \n\nSeeing Muniappa is saved by the tribals, he thanked Arun and tried to escape from him. Arun catches him and angrily asks him where is he going. He assumes Muniappa is the one who did something to Ganga and pulls his shirt. He shouts at Muniappa, asking him what did he do to Ganga. But Muniappa explains that he has nothing to do with Ganga and pleads to let him free. Nandhini comes out from the snake mound and calls out to Muniappa. Muniappa and Arun sees Nandhini. Arun is shocked to meet Nandhini first time personally. The same Nandhini who possessed Ganga long time back. \n\nMuniappa managed to escape from Arun and both Nandhini and he quickly flee. Arun watches them run away from him in dismay. Meanwhile, back in the palace, Nambothri arrives to meet Rajasekhar and is welcomed by Leela. Rajasekhar and Nambothiri go into Rajasekhar's room where inside Devasena is seen sleeping on the bed. Inside the room, Nambothiri asks Rajasekhar to be more patient as he is currently making some complex preparations and arrangements for special rituals. The special rituals will take some time to complete and he needs Rajasekhar to follow him for a while. \n\nNambothiri then sees Devasena on the bed and applies a holy ash on her forehead. After he applied the holy ash on Devasena's forehead, he smiles weirdly, hinting that there is something wrong going to happen. Rajasekhar just thinks Nambothiri applied the holy ash for Devasena's welfare. Both of them leaves the house. After they left, Leela enters the room to wake up Devasena for lunch. But Devasena is not waking up which worries Leela. Devasena seems to be in either a deep sleep or fell unconscious. \n\nLeela phones Rajasekhar to inform him about this. Rajasekhar who is travelling in car together with Nambothiri receives the call by Leela but is stopped by Nambothiri. He said that Rajasekhar should not answer any calls for the time being. Rajasekhar cancels the call but Leela keeps calling him, again cancelled by him. This worries Leela even more and wonders why he is not picking up the phone. She is scared now and worries about Devasena. \n\nThe scene now shows Arun walking inside the forest, still searching for Ganga. At the same time, accompanied by Ganga's sweet memories. As he walks, he comes near to Ganga's burial ground. Scenes of Ganga being buried by the goons are showed as flashback. The episode ends just when Arun steps on the ground where Ganga's dead body is buried beneath it.\n\nJust as Arun steps on the ground, he receives a call from Leela informing about Devasena's condition. Arun rushes home after hearing the news. Arun arrives at the palace where he sees a doctor is checking Devasena. Leela said that she called a doctor to check Devasena and Rajasekhar was not picking up her calls. Arun notices Devasena is perspiring and wipes off the sweat using a cloth. As he wipes the sweat drops, the holy ash on her forehead got wiped off too. Immediately Devasena regained consciousness and opened her eyes. Doctor said Devasena is now alright.\nNambothiri, on the other hand, realized Devasena woke up and Arun is back home. He asked Rajasekhar to go back home because Arun has come back. Nambothiri made Arun come back home from Parvatipuram forest by using Devasena. He intentionally applied the holy ash on the little child to make her fall in a deep sleep. Now that Arun came back home, Rajasekhar goes back to the palace to meet him.\nRajasekhar arrives at the palace seeing his servant Lakshmi. Lakshmi said Devasena just now was not conscious and the doctor had treated her. Rajasekhar rushes upstairs to see Devasena. Arun and Manju is with Devasena, Manju is feeding Devasena food. Rajasekhar inquired about her condition and Manju said that she is now perfectly alright. After Manju and Devasena left, Arun interrogated Rajasekhar. He asked why Rajasekhar did not answer the calls from Leela. Rajasekhar said he was busy and to stop suspecting him. Arun then said he is going back to Parvatipuram forest again to find Ganga. Arun leaves the palace and goes to the forest to find Ganga again.\nRajasekhar phones Nambothiri and tells him that Arun is going back to the forest to find Ganga. Nambothiri asks Rajasekhar to relax as Arun could not find Ganga anyway. He said Bhairavi's issue is bigger than this and they need to settle her issue first. Nambothiri asks Rajasekhar to come with him to meet Bhairavi.\nNambothiri, Vichu and Rajasekhar are now gathered in an old, deserted factory to meet Bhairavi. Bhairavi arrives and meets them. Nambothiri praises Bhairavi for disguising as himself to obtain the Kalachakras. He said a person who can shapeshift is definitely an invincible person and he is happy to meet Bhairavi. Bhairavi also praises Nambothiri for successfully obtaining the Three Kalachakras from Kaatu Amman which is a very difficult and dangerous task. At last they discusses about the main issue.\nBhairavi wants all the Three Kalachakras from them and she blackmails them if she does not get them, she will reveal the video evidence of Rajasekhar killing Ganga to everyone. Nambothiri requests Bhairavi to show him the video first before he can give the Kalachakras. Bhairavi plays the video record from her phone and shows to Vichu too. All of them are shocked until Nambothiri used his powerful firey laser rays from his eyes to burn Bhairavi's phone to ashes. Nambothiri, Rajasekhar and Vichu laugh and suddenly stopped by Bhairavi's laughter. She said she is not fooling – to bring the video evidence only to meet them. She said they can erase the evidence by burning the phone but they can't burn the evidence on her hand.\nBhairavi shows her palm to everyone and on her palm, the exact scenes recorded in Ganga's phone is showed. She said she already magically imprinted the video record on her palm knowing something like this can happen. Bhairavi said she can easily screen the video scenes in front of Rajasekhar's palace in a theatrical mode, for everyone to see. To prevent that, she needs the Kalachakras immediately. Nambothiri asks Bhairavi what is she going to do with the Kalachakras anyway. Bhairavi replies she is definitely not going to keep the Kalachakras uselessly like how Rajasekhar kept his Kalachakra locked in a room for 20 years.\nShe said she is going to extract the powers of Kalachakras and experiment the uses of the powers contained in the Kalachakras. She also asked Nambothiri what he had achieved by obtaining the Kalachakras so far. Nothing! Just nothing! But Nambothiri disagrees with her. He said he does not need to achieve anything in his life as he already attained the position of eternal fulfillment. He had fulfilled all his needs. Since Nambothiri has nothing to achieve, Bhairavi asks him to give her the Kalachakras.\nRajasekhar then tells Bhairavi that initially it is true that they took the Kalachakras due to greed and money. But now they need the Kalachakras to save themselves from Nandhini. The kalachakras are the ones that can save them from Nandhini and if they give them to Bhairavi, they will be killed by Nandhini. So Nambothiri arranges an agreement with Bhairavi. The agreement is if Bhairavi successfully catches Nandhini and bring the snake to Nambothiri, he will give Bhairavi the Kalachakras.\nBhairavi laughs and says that Nambothiri is intentionally making her to fight with Nandhini, so that Nandhini will kill her, and this is a plan to get rid of Bhairavi. Nambothiri said he has no such intention because he knows Bhairavi is invincible and Nandhini's power has less impact on Bhairavi. He challenged Bhairavi to catch Nandhini and bring her to him if Bhairavi is truly a Selli Amman's ubashini and a powerful yogini. He said this is a task for Bhairavi to prove that she is indeed Selli Amman's ubashini and a powerful yogini.\nBhairavi accepts the challenge and agrees to capture Nandhini. But she asks Nambothiri to swear upon his 'Manthira Sastra' (sacred Spiritual Scriptures of Nambothiri/ Bible of Magics) that he will give the Kalachakras to her after she give Nandhini to him. The 'Manthira Sastra' suddenly shows up in the hands of Bhairavi which shocks Namboothiri.\n\nNambothiri swears upon his 'Manthira Sastra' that he will handover the Three Kalachakras to Bhairavi after she brings Nandhini to him. Bhairavi leaves them saying she will come back with Nandhini. Vichu and Rajasekhar question Nambothiri on why did he make such promise to Bhairavi as they might lose the Kalachakras to her. Nambothiri says he has a valid reason on why he made such promise and that they will understand it when the time comes. \n\nIt is now the day time of Margazhi Pournami. Muniappan and Nandhini rests under a tree for a while after a long distance of walking. Muniappa asks Nandhini to be patient until night falls and then she can get her human form. Nandhini replies she will abide by Muniappa's words until she gets her human form. \n\nMeanwhile, Bhairavi arrives at Chellamma's (Her Master/Guru) house. Chellamma greets Bhairavi and is glad to meet her after a long time. Bhairavi asks Chellamma for a way to capture Nandhini but Chellamma refuses to tell. According to Chellama, Nandhini is also an element derives from Kaatu Amman's divine powers just like the Kalachakras and being a Selli Amman's ubashini, she can't betray Nandhini. She advises Bhairavi to stop this whole idea and change her mind. But Bhairavi is not listening to her advice and threatens her if she is not going to disclose the way to catch Nandhini, Bhairavi will kill herself by making her own head burst using the Kundalini chakra in her body. Bhairavi then sits down and brings up the Kundalini chakra to her head to make it burst but is stopped by Chellamma. \n\nChellamma said she will disclose the secret as she had no choice. Bhairavi stops and stands up. Chellamma said she do not know the direct way to catch Nandhini but she knows a person who can tell how to catch Nandhini. Bhairavi tells that the details are sufficient for her. Chellamma says the person is Nagavanchiyan who resides in Naga Kugai (Divine Snake Cave) and he is the only one who knows the way to catch Shakti Nagam(s). Bhairavi thanks Chellamma and leaves to meet Nagavanchiyan. Chellamma and one of her other disciple are worried and Chellamma asks forgiveness from Nandhini as she had betrayed her. \n\nBhairavi arrives at the Naga Kugai and demands the way to catch Nandhini. Nagavanchiyan refuses to tell as he learns that Bhairavi is an evil person and she will harm that poor snake. Bhairavi said to him that if he do not disclose the way to catch Nandhini, she will stand naked in front of him. Bhairavi knows sitthars like Nagavanchiyan respect women and would not want to see a nude woman. Bhairavi then starts to disrobe her saree but stopped by Nagavanchiyan. \n\nHe was forced by Bhairavi to tell her the way. Nagavanchiyan gives Bhairavi his magic flute and says if she plays this flute, the music produces by it will reach Nandhini and mesmerize her, bringing her to Bhairavi no matter where she is. Bhairavi leaves with the magic flute but before that Nagavanchiyan said that he had made a big blunder and he does not deserve to live anymore. He said the sin of him dying will belong to Bhairavi only, before taking a sharp wooden stick and pierces himself on his chest. Nagavanchiyan dies and Bhairavi leaves the place with a smile.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Rajasekhar's palace, Rajasekhar sees Arun is sleeping on the living room's sofa and tried to wake him up. But was taken back by the thoughts if he wakes him up, Arun might unnecessarily question Rajasekhar and just leaves him alone. After Rajasekhar leaves, Seetha comes and wakes Arun up. Seetha said that Arun should be strong and move on. Arun hears her preach angrily. Seetha added that it is he who has to be an example for Devasena but if he continues to be like this, Devasena will be sad and broken too. Arun then shouts at Seetha, \"Shut up! It is because of you Ganga left the house! If only I had not married you, if only I did not bring you to this house, Ganga would have stayed here along with me. \" \nSeetha goes away crying while Janaki's spirit is sad watching the argument by Arun. \n\nNight of Margazhi Pournami falls, Bhairavi arrives at the forest where Nandhini is estimated to be hiding. She plays the magic flute and the music coming from the flute lures Nandhini to Bhairavi's pathway. Muniappa tried to stop Nandhini but Nandhini just could not control herself. She was totally bounded by the magic sound played by the flute. Muniappa calls out to Parvathi, asking her for help. Parvathi appears and produces a very loud bell sound to counter-attack the flute sound. Nandhini can't hear the flute music anymore due to the extremely loud music of the bells' sound. Nandhini realizes herself and goes back to Muniappa immediately. \n\nParvathi breaks the magic flute in Bhairavi's hands and laughs. Bhairavi recognises the Sivanagam for the first time and says all the Three Kalachakras belong to her only. Parvati replies that in just few hours, Nandhini is going to get her human form and after that, Bhairavi, Vichu, Rajasekhar, and Nambothiri will not be alive anymore. Parvati laughs and vanishes into thin air. \n\nThe scene cuts and shows the scene whereby Nambothiri and his other disciples are doing the Vishwalingam Rudra Pooja to prevent Nandhini from getting her human form, hence make her a normal snake forever. There is a big Shivalinga statue situated in the middle of their pooja. Back in the forest, Muniappa and Nandhini say they should leave to a hill named Nagamalai, where the Snake Goddess resides. Inside the Nagamalai, there will be an optimum environment for Nandhini to take her human form easily under the lights of the full moon. But at a point of walking, Muniappa says he is very tired and asks Nandhini to continue to Nagamalai by herself. Nandhini agrees and continues her journey to Nagamalai by herself. Muniappa says he will wait for Nandhini at their usual meeting place. \n\nNambothiri on the other hand successfully completed the pooja and by the help of full moon's lights, the Shivalinga statue transforms into a cage full of thousands of mongooses. Nambothiri said these mongooses have been instilled in Nambothiri's special powers. Nambothriri opens the cage and demands the mongooses to kill Nandhini by tearing her into pieces. The mongooses run to Nandhini furiously and Nandhini runs as quickly as she can to save herself from the mongooses.\n\nNandhini runs from the mongooses but gets hurts by them in the way. The mongooses bite Nandhini's tail until she bleeds. But Nandhini did not give up and rushed to the Snake Goddess Temple. After she entered the temple, the mongooses are now unable to enter the temple's boundaries due to the temple's divinity. Inside the temple itself, there were a few sitthars shown chanting some mantras surrounding the Snake Goddess statue. A few fire homams were also seen, brightening up the temple. Nandhini then stands under the lights of the full moon to begin her transformation. After the lights has fully covered her body, she quickly hides behind the statue of Snake Goddess. \n\nNandhini then slowly takes the human form of a female body. In just few minutes, Nandhini transformed into a human completely. The female form that she took is of Ganga's form. Ganga's face and body is given to Nandhini by the Snake Goddess. There was a special orange-colored silk saree beside the statue which then worn by Nandhini. The sitthars worshipped Nandhini and poured flowers on her. Nandhini took a Trisoolam which was in front of the temple and dug into the fire homams. Then she took out the Trisoolam and aimed at the mongooses standing outside the temple. Fire blazes out from the Trisoolam and burns the mongooses. The burning mongooses runs to Nambothiri for help. \n\nNambothiri, Rajasekhar and Vichu on the other hand are happy that by now Nandhini would have been killed by the mongooses sent by Nambothiri. But as the burning mongooses arrive at Nambothiri, all of them are shocked. All the mongooses that have been sent by Nambothiri are now dead. Nambothiri learns that Nandhini already succeeded in transforming into human. All of them are extremely worried plus shocked. Nambothiri said he is helpless now and cannot do anything else to save them. Right now, the Three Kalachakras are the only ones that can save them from Nandhini. \n\nNambothiri asked Rajasekhar to give him one of the Kalachakras that he has to safeguard his life. Now all three of them must possess a Kalachakra each to safeguard their life from Nandhini otherwise even Nambothiri might get killed by Nandhini since Nandhini has now acquired mighty powers and became invincible. Rajasekhar then asked Nambothiri which form that Nandhini took and how will the human form of Nandhini look like. Nambothiri does not even know about Nandhini's human appearance and they must be extra careful if they see any new faced girl. (Nambothiri is unaware that Nandhini took Ganga's human form). They disperse immediately to their houses from the forest. \n\nThe next day morning, Nandhini arrives at Muniappa's house. Muniappa was praying to God that Nandhini should succeed in her human transformation. After seeing Nandhini, Muniappa asked her why she came to his place, thinking it is Ganga. Nandhini replied she is not Ganga but Nandhini. Muniappa said to Nandhini she looks exactly like Ganga. Then he brings her a mirror for Nandhini to look at herself. Nandhini was surprised to see herself as Ganga on the mirror. She feels very happy and proud to take Ganga's form as her human form because Ganga is a true devotee of Snake Goddess. Nandhini plans on how to avenge their enemies and retrieve those 3 Kalachakras. \n\nMeanwhile at Rajasekhar's palace, Devasena wakes up from sleep and begins to cry thinking about Ganga. It has been very long time since Ganga had gone and Devasena wants to see Ganga at once. She cries non stop and even Arun and Manju are unable to pacify her. Janaki's spirit is so devastated to see Devasena's current state. Janaki decides that she has no choice left but to do 'this'. She must do 'this' for Devasena's welfare. Janaki rushes to the outhouse to possess Seetha again. Seetha gets possessed by Janaki and the episode ends.\n\nAfter Janaki possessed Seetha, she calls the landline number of the palace using Seetha's phone and speaks to Devasena and Manju in Ganga's voice. She did this to avoid Devasena to yearn for Ganga. In Ganga's voice, Janaki residing in Seetha's body, says that she will come back home very soon and she needs to visit more temples. After visiting the temples, she will come back home. Janaki also said that she (Ganga) is not angry at anyone and she did not leave home sulking. Devasena is very happy after listening to Janaki's lies and is pacified. She starts to believe Ganga is the one who spoke to her. Janaki disconnects the phone and leaves Seetha's body. \n\nDevasena rushes to Arun and told her that Ganga had called and she will be back home soon. Arun is happy and tries to trace Ganga's location from the phone number that she called. When he dialled the number and traced the phone call location, he found out that it was called from Seetha's phone. Arun rushes to the outhouse to meet Seetha thinking Seetha is the one who called the palace number. Arun angrily asked Seetha that why she had did such a thing, and cheated Devasena. Seetha denies the act but Arun did not believe her. Arun gives warning to Seetha that she should not do such things and cheat Devasena. Seetha assumes that Arun is deliberately accusing her to chase her out from the house. Seetha then decides to go out from the house forever. \n\nMeanwhile, Nambothiri and Vichu arrive at Rajasekhar's palace. Three of them goes the secret room where the two Kalachakras is placed. Rajasekhar asks Nambothiri to take any one of the Kalachakras. Nambothiri changes his own form to another form of a man. Rajasekhar asked the reason. Nambothiri answered he only changed his appearance into another man's face but inside he still the same Nambothiri. The reason was to prevent Nandhini from killing him. According to him, Nandhini will first kill Nambothiri as he is the one who imprisoned her. To avoid Nandhini from identifying Nambothiri, he had to take this new form. Moreover, Nandhini won't able to recognize him in this new form. In addition, it is even easier for Nambothiri to find out Nandhini's human form by this. \n\nNambothiri took the Kalachakra of their late friend, Kumar's from Rajasekhar. All three of them leaves the place. Meanwhile, Seetha who plans to leave the house, goes to her cupboard to pack her things. But surprisingly, her clothes and bags are missing from the cupboard. She wonders who may have took it and goes to the palace to ask Lakshmi about it. Inside the palace, seeing Seetha's worried look, he asks her whether she is finding her belongings. Seetha asks him how did he knew about that and Rajasekhar said he is the one who took her things and put it inside Arun's room. He said Seetha should stay in Arun's room from now. Seetha disagrees. \n\nRajasekhar said that since Seetha and Arun are married, she might as well stay with Arun. Seetha said to Rajashekar that you are talking as if Ganga is not going to come back to palace anymore Rajasekhar just stands speechless. Seetha assures Rajasekhar that Ganga will definitely come back and her place is always the outhouse, not the palace. Seetha also adds that she is carrying the 'Thali' tied by Arun due to the respect she gives to the family and not because she wants to become Arun's wife. Seetha then goes to Arun's room to take back all her belongings. \n\nMeanwhile in Arun's room, Arun is crying in front of Janaki's photo. It is Devasena's birthday as well as Janaki's death anniversary. It has been seven years since Janaki had died. He cries thinking of Ganga and wants her to come back soon. Janaki's spirit watches Arun's cries and apologizes to Arun from distant. Even though, she knows the truth that Ganga had died, but she could not reveal it to Arun and Devasena. She does not have the courage to reveal Ganga's death news to her loved ones. But instead, Janaki plans to do something useful to make the family members happy by using Devasena's birthday occasion.\n\nArun wished happy birthday to Devasena and asked his aunts and uncles to purchase dresses for Devasena. Arun then leaves the house. Janaki again possessed Seetha in the outhouse and spoke to Devsena in Ganga's voice. Devasena was very happy and Janaki said that she (Ganga's voice) will be back soon. She also spoke to Manju told her to celebrate Devasena's birthday grandly without worrying about Ganga's whereabouts. Manju asks her to come back home soon as everyone is missing her. She told Janaki in the phone that she cried a lot thinking about Ganga. Devi who is listening besides Manju, thinks to herself that when did ever Manju cried. Devi wants to speak to Ganga also but the line got disconnected by Janaki. Devi sarcastically provoked Manju that she is deliberately preventing Devi from speaking to Ganga. Manju denies it. Janaki leaves Seetha's body. \n\nSeetha enters the palace and learns about the birthday celebration. The elders of the house, including Manju, Devi and Dharmaraj are leaving to a shopping mall to purchase dresses for Devasena and asks Seetha to look after Devasena. Seetha wants to do something special for Devasena as well. She recalls the incident whereby she received a beautiful saree from Arun and Ganga during the Sumangali pooja long time ago. She decides to gift Devasena something using the saree. \n\nMeanwhile, in Parvatipuram forest, Nandhini is doing some special pooja to Kaatu Amman. Nandini asked Kaatu Amman in her prayers, that why did she receive the form of Ganga instead of a new face. Kaattu Amman silently replies within herself that the answer to this question can be only given by Nandhini's mother, Parvati. Nandhini then realises from her prayers and swears in front of the blindfolded Kaatu Amman statue, that she will get that Nambothiri to untie the same fold which he tied to Kaatu Amman's eyes 20 years back. She said tomorrow itself she will make that Nambothiri come to the Kaatu Amman temple and untie the blindfold from the Goddess's eyes by his own hands. Nandhini leaves the temple to execute her promise to the Goddess. \n\nIn the mean time, Rajasekhar, the new faced Nambothiri and Vichu arrive at a forest called Thiruvallan Forest. Inside the Thiruvallan forest, Nambothiri's sister, Madhavi is conducting a special penance towards Lord Shiva for years in order to attain the position as a Shivaganam. Shivaganam is a position held by someone who has magnificent powers and invincibility which equals to Lord Shiva. Nambothiri finds Madhavi doing her penance in a snake mound surrounding her and chanting Lord Shiva's mantras. Nambothiri asks Madhavi for help to save them from Nandhini. He said he had lost all his powers during the Vishwalinga pooja the moment Nandhini burned all the mongooses sent by him. \n\nWhile chanting the mantras, Madhavi's shadow appeared and it is her shadow that will help Madhavi to speak for her while she is in the penance. The shadow said she can't oppose a divine power like Nandhini until Sivarathiri comes as it will affect her process in becoming a Shivaganam. After Sivarathiri, she can definitely destroy Nandhini as she will become a Shivaganam only after Sivarathiri. She asks three of them to be patient and wait until Sivarathiri. Till then, the Kalachakras will serve as life guardians for them and protect them like a barrier. All three of them believe in Madhavi and leave the forest. Madhavi thinks to herself that she will be rejoicing after she destroys Nandhini in a few days time.\n\nAll three of them go to Rajasekhar's car to get back to palace. Nambothiri then tells the other two that he needs to go back to Madhavi again and talk to her personally. He goes back to Madhavi and says he is guilty after seeing the snake mound surrounded Madhavi and he wants to gift her the Kalachakra that he possesses. Madhavi's shadow appears and says to Nambothiri that she is going to obtain more incredible powers than Kalachakra which is the position of Shivaganam. She does not need the Kalachakra at all and adds that Nambothiri is the one who needs the Kalachakra to protect his life from Nandhini. Nambothiri forces Madhavi to take it but unconditionally refused by Madhavi until Nambothiri gave up and left the place. \n\nNambothiri goes to Rajasekhar and Vichu and three of them start to get into their car, just then the wind starts to blow strongly. Bhairavi appears and demands the 3 Kalachakras again otherwise she will send three of them to jail using the video evidence she has. Nambothiri says Bhairavi already lost in their agreement due to the inability of Bhairavi to capture Nandhini on the Margazhi Pournamj night. He also said she had lost the right to possess the Kalachakras too after losing the agreement. Bhairavi denies and said Nandhini escaped because of Parvati. She challenges them again that she will find Nandhini again and kill her. Other three of them just laughs at her. Nambothiri said Nandhini has now taken human form and none of them knows in which form Nandhini is in. Bhairavi can't face Nandhini as Nandhini has now achieved invincible powers and became Maha Shakti Nagam. \n\nBhairavi says she will definitely succeed in killing Nandhini and will prove that she is a true ubashini and yogini of Selli Amman. Three of them laughs again and left the place with their car. Bhairavi wonders what they are doing in the Thiruvallan forest and decides to find the reason they came to the forest. After thorough searching, she found Madhavi. She touched Madhavi's snake mound but she got electrocuted and was thrown away from her. Bhairavi falls on the ground and shouts at Madhavi that she is going to face the consequences for this. Madhavi's shadow appears. Bhairavi asks her to stop chanting Lord Shiva mantras and start chanting Goddess Shakti mantras. The shadow said she will not chant any mantra other than of Lord Shiva's. Bhairavi gets angry and says she must chant Shakti's mantras instead of Shiva's mantras and gives her some time. She said she will go for a while and when she comes back Madhavi must chant Shakti mantras. Bhairavi leaves the place. \n\nMeanwhile, in the palace, Seetha stitches a special dress from the saree she got from Sumangali pooja. Then she puts the beautiful blue dress on Devasena. Seetha asked her to play while she is going to make milk payasam for her at the kitchen. Devasena goes to Rajasekhar's room to play. Devasena accidentally saw the main switch for the secret basement room where the Kalachakra is kept. She twists the switch and a door is opened. Devasena enters the door and goes down to the basement. The door closes behind her. She sees a Goddess statue and the Kalachakra too. Meanwhile, Manju, Devi, Dharmaraj, and Moorthy comes back to palace after purchasing dresses for Devasena. \n\nThey realize Devasena is missing and start to blame Seetha. Seetha said she is not aware of Devasena went missing as she was making milk payasam in the kitchen. They start to search the whole house for Devasena. Meanwhile, Arun arrives at the detective agency which he assigned a detective agent to investigate Rajasekhar's past. He managed to get the file which contains all the details collected by the late detective agent regarding Parvathi and Rajasekhar's past life. He takes the file and leaves to the palace after getting phone call from the palace that Devasena is missing. \n\nWhen Arun arrives at the palace, Devi plans to blame Seetha in front of Arun for Devasena's disappearance. Devi did exactly what she planned and Arun gets angry on Seetha. Now all of them starts to search for Devasena without knowing that Devasena is now trapped inside the secret basement room. At the basement, Devasena feels thirsty and dizzy and tried to open the door to get out from there but the door does not open. Devasena eventually faints in front of the statue. Janaki's spirit tries hard to find out Devasena's location by using her supernatural powers but fails due to the power of Kalachakra beside Devasena which is blocking Janaki's supernatural powers. Janaki is very worried now.\n\nMeanwhile, Rajasekhar, Vichu and Nambothiri are on their way to palace. Nambothiri said Madhavi's husband is killed by a snake a few years back. That is why she started to hate snakes and sworn to eliminate the whole snake species from the world. That brought her to this state. According to him, Madhavi assumed that because they killed Parvathi, the snake avenged Madhavi by killing her husband.\n\nBack in the palace, Devi decided to complain to the police and make the police come to the palace to investigate after Devasena is unable to be found. The family including Arun suspected Seetha and told police Seetha has something to do with Devasena’s disappearance. The police inspector interrogated Seetha but Seetha denied their accusation and explain her side of justice. She started to cry as the police kept forcing Seetha to tell the truth. Rajasekhar enters the palace and was told what had happened. Manju also added that in the morning Ganga had phone them and wished Devasena happy birthday. \n\nRajasekhar was shocked to hear this and wonders how can Ganga speak as she already died. He asked Manju whether Ganga did reveal her whereabouts. But apparently she did not reveal anything, says Manju. The shocked state of Rajasekhar upon hearing Ganga’s existence gave Arun suspicion. He is confused and suspects Rajasekhar again even more for Ganga’s disappearance. Rajasekhar quietly entered his room and thinks deeply on how this could have happened. \n\nMeanwhile, at the basement, Devasena regain consciousness but feels dizzy and thirsty. She moves her hand slightly at the same time saying “I’m thirsty and feeling dizzy! Help me someone, I need to go out!” As her hand touched the Kalachakra beside her, she was generated with new energy. Thirst and dizziness left from her, surprising Devasena. The door also opened. She thinks the Goddess statue is the one who helped her and thanked it. She finally gotten out from the room and rushed to Rajasekhar. She told Rajasekhar whatever she saw and happened. He, in turn, told Devasena that she should keep this matter as secret and lied to her as if the basement room should be kept as secret or else the Goddess statue will lose its powers, hence the family will be in trouble. Devasena agreed and promised to Rajasekhar under Janaki’s name that she will not reveal the secret to anyone. \n\nRajasekhar brought Devasena to the living room where other family members are. The police inspector stopped interrogating Seetha after he saw Devasena. Arun is pleased and relieved to see Devasena. Rajasekhar lies to them that Devasena was locked inside his bathroom all this while. The police scolded the family for unnecessarily blaming Seetha whilst the child is still inside the house. The police leaves and Seetha looks sadly at Arun. Arun feels guilty for making Seetha cry and blaming her. Seetha goes away from the incident even though Arun tried to stop her to pacify her but fails. \n\nMeanwhile, Rajasekhar phone calls Nambothiri and told him Ganga had called the palace and wished everyone to be happy. Nambothiri said it could not be Ganga because if it is really Ganga she will reveal the truth about them first to the family members, but she didn’t. He believes that it must be someone else who had impersonated as Ganga and spoke like her on the phone. He strongly believes this because the moment they started to kill Ganga, she already hated them to the core and swore that Nandhini will come to avenge them, In such a case, Ganga will first reveal the truth about their dirty act first instead of wishing happy birthday to Devasena. Rajasekhar still wants to meet Nambothiri at least to make him clear his mind. Nambothiri asks Rajasekhar to come to his house. \n\nAt Nambothiri’s house, he decides to clear his part of doubts too regarding Ganga. He required his deity, Goddess Ammey Bhagavathiyamma to help him resolve any mysteries related to Ganga’s death. Nambothiri rolls some magic dices to see Ganga’s existence. He does it repetitively and was shocked at the final result. The invisible pattern drew by the magic dices indicates that Ganga is still alive. Nambothiri checks Ganga’s horoscope to double confirm it again. But Ganga’s horoscope strongly shows that Ganga is already dead and no chance of being alive as her longevity in her horoscope is very weak. \n\nTo clear his confusion, Nambothiri decides to go to Ganga’s burial ground in Parvatipuram forest and dig it out for himself. Nambothiri arrives at the Parvatipuram forest and heads to Ganga’s burial ground with a hope to dig the ground. \n\nNambothiri starts to dig the ground where Ganga is buried. After he finishes digging, he found that Ganga’s dead body is not there anymore. He was shocked to see this and doubts whether Ganga is really alive. He then decides to return home and takes off with his car. As he was driving, a young woman cladd in a pink saree was walking in front of his car, blocking his path. He hones the woman but she keeps walking away. Finally, Nambothiri gets down from his car to ask the woman to move away. But then he suspects whether she is Ganga. He follows that woman and she stopped walking. As she turns to face Nambothiri, it turns out to be Ganga (actually it’s Nandhini). Nandhini lured him to kill him. \n\nAt first, Nandhini pretends to Nambothiri that she lost her memory and could not recall who is she. Nambothiri assumes that maybe Ganga was saved by someone but lost her memory due to heavy beatings to her head that day. Nambothiri feels relieved that Ganga does not remember anything from the past and told her (Nandhini) that she is Ganga and he knows her very well. Nandhini said she is very thirsty and hungry. Nambothiri brought Nandhini to his car to buy Nandhini some food. When they are at his car, Nambothiri saw the reflection of Nandhini, who was behind him, on the car’s glass window which showed a snake. After seeing the snake reflection, Nambothiri learns that that Ganga is actually Nandhini and confronts her. \n\nNandhini finally admits that she is Nandhini and she wanted to kill him. Nandhini changed to her snake form and tried to kill Nambothiri but she got blocked by a special band tied on his wrist. Nandhini changed back to human form and wonders why she can’t get near to Nambothiri. Nambothiri said the magic band that he has tied on his wrist is a Pathalamuni’s band. Since,\nNambothiri has lost all his powers at the Vishvalingam pooja and has chances of being easily attacked by Nandhini, he tied the Pathalamuni band to this wrist beforehand as a protective shield for him. Nambothiri said now Nandhini can’t do anything to him but he will destroy Nandhini using the power given to him by the magic band. Nandhini quickly thinks of a plan to escape from him. \n\nNandhini quickly runs back to a forest nearby and Nambothiri chases after her. Nandhini arrives at the middle of the forest and Nambothiri is still chasing her. There are a group of Indian army soldiers having their training in the middle of the forest. Nandhini then tore her blouse and saree to make her look like a molest victim. She ran to the soldiers and told them that Nambothiri is chasing after her to rape her. The soldiers saw Nambothiri coming to them and stopped him. Nambothiri said she is lying and she is dangerous if left alone. The soldiers fights with Nambothiri and the fight between them becomes intense. \n\nNandhini shouts to the soldiers in the middle of the fight to take off the magic band on Nambothiri’s wrist and throw it away, as if then only Nambothiri can be controlled. The soldiers snatched the magic band form his wrist and threw it away. Now, Nambothiri is powerless again. Nambothiri and Nandhini disappears from the place after this which surprises the soldiers but they continued their training afterwards. \n\nNambothiri managed to get into his car and go back to his house. On his way, he saw a letter box at a pavement beside the road. He thinks that maybe sooner or later he will surely get killed by Nandhini, so Rajasekhar and the others needs to know that Nandhini is now in Ganga’s form. Fearing he might die before telling others the truth, he wrote a letter to Rajasekhar stating that Nandhini has taken Ganga’s form to avenge them and asked him and Vichu to be careful with her. He stated Madhavi will protect them after him. He also stated that he had kept his Kalachakra in a secret place which no one knows. \n\nTo help Rajasekhar locate the Kalachakra that he kept, he writes a clue in the same letter. The clue is “ 4 Shadows” and below the words he drew four different figures adjoined together. First is mountain, second is a snake, third and fourth is like a curved end figure. These are the clues to the hidden location of the third Kalachakra that Nambothiri kept. He also wrote in the letter that Madhavi is the one who can resolve the clue and asked Rajasekhar to seek help form her. After finishing writing the letter, he wrote Rajasekhar’s palace address on the cover and posted it into the letterbox. \n\nNambothiri goes back to his house and planned to get himself another Pathalamuni band. In order to obtain that, he needs to shower first and conduct a special meditation. So he removed all his protective talismans and Rudhartcha chains from his neck and placed them on his table. This indicates that he is totally defenceless and can easily be victim to Nandhini. Soon after he removed the talismans, some girl’s shadow is seen to be loitering around Nambothiri’s house continuously, while laughing loudly. Nambothiri seem to be afraid but still embraced himself with courage. \n\nAt last, Nambothiri goes to the backyard of his house to take shower from the bathtub. While he is showering, Nandhini is watching him from the water inside the bathtub. After finishing shower, he takes a towel to rub his face. As he finished rubbing his body and face, he removed the towel from his face. To his astonishment, Nandhini is standing right in front of him. Nambothiri gave a shocked look.\n\nNambothiri pleads to Nandhini to let him go but Nandhini again says that she is Ganga and showed the stab wound on her stomach as proof (the site where Rajasekhar stabbed her). Nambothiri believes that she is Ganga and also said that Goddess Bhagavathiyamma’s dices did indicate Ganga is alive. Nandhini now claims that she remembers everything but has forgiven them for their wrongdoings. Nandhini said she wants to speak to Rajasekhar and asks Nambothiri to phone call him. Nambothiri believes Nandhini that she is indeed Ganga and brought her to the landline phone to make a call. \n\nThere is a mirror placed right beside the phone and again Nandhini’s snake reflection on the mirror is seen by Nambothiri and learns it is Nandhini and not Ganga. Nambothiri lies to Nandhini that he can’t get signal here and is going upstairs to make phone call. Nambothiri goes upstairs and straight away went to his pooja room. He took a small Trisoolam from his deity’s chamber and requested the Trisoolam to kill Nandhini. Nandhini started to know about this and made the Trisoolam to stab Nambothiri instead. The small Trisoolam stabbed Nambothiri at his back creating small wound. \n\nNambothiri shouts in pain and decides to take back the magic talismans which he removed from his neck previously to save him. When he went back downstairs to take his talismans and Rudratcha chains, Nandhini stopped him and transformed the talismans into snakes. Nambothiri becomes even more afraid and clueless about what to do. Finally he plans to take his Kalachakra which is the only weapon he has to protect his life from Nambothiri. But again Nandhini stopped him and threw him on the ground floor. Nandhini wants Nambothiri to go to Parvatipuram forest to untie the blindfold on Kaatu Amman’s eyes which he tied 20 years ago. \n\nNambothiri ran away from Nandhini but Nandhini chases after him until he reached Parvatipuram forest. Both of them are now in Parvatipuram forest, where Nambothiri is running away from Nandhini while Nandhini is chasing after him (to lead him to Kaatu Amman’s statue ). While running, Nandhini uses her power to change Nambothiri back to his old form again. Now Nambothiri changes back to his old form. Nandhini wants him to get punished by Kaatu Amman in the same form he tied the Goddess’s eyes 20 years ago. \n\nNambothiri shouts Madhavi’s name for help but in vain because Madhavi is only concentrating in her intense penance and doesn’t seem to care about the occurrences of her surroundings. Nambothiri finally arrives in front of Kaatu Amman’s temple and pleads to Nandhini to let him go. Nandhini said he need to get punished by Kaatu Amman herself for all his sins he had committed. Flashback scenes of 20 years ago is shown including the scenes of Rajasekhar’s gang killing Parvati and burning her alive. Scenes of Nambothiri tying Kaatu Amman’s eyes with leaves and Rudratcha chain, and scenes of Parvathi making promise to Nandhini to get all the 3 Kalachakras before she died, are shown in the episode. \n\nAt the last scene of the episode, Nandhini says to Nambothiri that the time for him to face God (his punishment) and the time for Kaatu Amman to open her eyes had finally arrived.\n\nNambothiri is now totally helpless and does not have even slight chance to escape from Nandhini. Nandhini asks Nambothiri to untie the fold on the Goddess’s eyes. Nambothiri untied the blindfold and Kaatu Amman is back to her eyesight again. Nandhini asks Kaatu Amman to punish him. Nambothiri pleads to Kaatu Amman to let him go but then Nandhini recalls back an incident many years ago. The incident where Parvathi controlled Kaatu Amman’s anger and demanded her to preserve patience (Shanta Swaroopani) all the times and never get angry or punish humans. So Kaatu Amman just kept silent and did nothing to Nambothiri. \n\nNandhini knows that Kaatu Amman won’t do anything to Nambothiri so she decides to kill him herself. As Nambothiri pleads to Kaatu Amman to let him go, a heavy rain pours. Nandhini laughed and said this rain brings the meaning Kaatu Amman did not forgive Nambothiri and wants him to be punished. Nambothiri runs and takes a big Soolam in-front of Kaatu Amman and tried to stab Nandhini but Nandhini smartly moved away from his attack. And the Soolam accidentally stabbed Kaatu Amman. \n\nSuddenly a thunder hit on Nambothiri’s eyes and he went blind. Nambothiri cries that he went blind and could not see while trying to walk away from Nandhini. Nandhini creates a quicksand in front of the walking Nambothiri and Nambothiri stepped on the quicksand. \n\nThe quicksand immediately drowned the whole body of Nambothiri and tightened his body, leaving only his head on the surface. Nandhini explained to him that this sand is the same sand from the snake mound which Nandhini was imprisoned in by Nambothiri. He must drown and die in the sand of the snake mound which he created to torture Nandhini for 20 years, she added. \n\nThe quicksand tightened Nambothiri’s body really hard until his nerves and blood vessels began to burst. Nambothiri cried out for Parvathi’s name now for help. Nandhini said her mother Parvathi won’t come unless he calls her name 108 times. But before Nambothiri could utter Parvathi’s name 108 times, his vocal chords were tightened also and blood started to ooze out from his mouth. \n\nFinally, Nambothiri died after his entire blood vessels and nerves inside his body burst out. His head also drowned in the quicksand and now Nambothiri is completely drowned and died. Nandhini laughs and happily said to Kaatu Amman that she had killed their first enemy. She said she will get Nambothiri’s Kalachakra next. \n\nNandhini goes to Nambothiri’s house to search for the Kalachakra but could not be found. She searches the pooja room first but she could not find it. Rajasekhar also enters Nambothiri’s house and looks for him. But Nandhini is unaware of Rajasekhar’s arrival and is busy searching. She entered Nambothiri’s bedroom and closed the door behind her. Rajasekhar then comes to pooja room to find Nambothiri but in vain. He confirms that Nambothiri is not in the house after searching some places and starts to leave the house. \n\nMeanwhile Nandhini is searching for the Kalachakra inside Nambothiri’s bedroom by messing up the place but she could not find it anywhere. Rajasekhar leaves the house and Nandhini saw him leaving the house. Nandhini follows him behind his car to kill him too but stopped by Muniappan. Muniappan said Nandhini should first locate the 3 Kalachakras first before killing Rajasekhar and killing him will make it even difficult to find the Kalachakra that he kept. Muniappa also said within 3 Full Moon Days, Nandhini must produce all the 3 Kalachakras before Kaattu Amman otherwise she will lose her powers slowly and the status of Maha Shakti Nagam.\n\nNandhini told Muniappa that she tried to find Nambothiri's Kalachakra but it is not in his house. Muniappa says the Kalachakra must be kept in Rajasekhar's house also and ask Nandhini to go to his palace as Ganga. He asked her to impersonate as Ganga to enter the palace and find the Kalachakras. Nandhini agreed. \n\nMeanwhile back in the palace, Seetha is heartbroken due to Arun's behavior towards her. Janaki's spirit appears before her to console her. Seetha said after all the embarrassment and humiliation she faced because of Arun in the house, she should have left the house. But only because of Ganga she is staying in the house as a sign of gratitude. Janaki thought to herself, that she knows Ganga is dead and will never come back. If she tell the truth to Seetha, then Seetha will definitely leave the house. If Seetha leaves the house, Devasena will suffer without a mother to take care of her. As a loving person for Devasena and Seetha, Janaki made Seetha promise that she will never leave the house before Ganga comes to the house. \n\nMeanwhile in Thiruvallan forest, Bhairavi arrives again to Madhavi's penance place. Bhairavi noticed Madhavi is still chanting Lord Shiva's mantras and gets angry. She tries to abort Madhavi's penance by creating strong hurricanes and heavy rain but failed. None of them nullified Madhavi's penance. Bhairavi got even more enraged.\n\nBhairavi tried to attack her again with earthquake and giant fire ball but failed again. None of her powers affected Madhavi’s penance. At last, Madhavi’s shadow appeared and said all the 5 elements (Fire, Earth, Water, Wind, Sky) are under her mantra’s control and Bhairavi can do nothing to destroy her. Madhavi demanded Bhairavi to leave the place, but Bhairavi was adamant on aborting her penance which caused Madhavi to take away all the powers possessed by Bhairavi. Bhairavi is now totally powerless and only a normal human being. She is no longer a yogini and Selli Amman’s ubashini. Madhavi said this is her punishment for trying to abort her penance. \n\nBhairavi left Thiruvallan forest and searched for her mentor, Chellamma at her place. Chellamma said it is her karma for all the sins she had committed which includes trying to capture Nandhini and forced Nagavanchiyan to kill himself. Nagavanchiyan’s pet snakes are still crying for him and it is their wrath which made Bhairavi powerless, according to Chellamma. Bhairavi apologised to her and asked Chellamma to make her a yogini again by giving her ‘deeksha’. Chellamma refused to give her ‘deeksha’ and said Bhairavi has lost the rights to become a Selli Amman’s ubashini. Chellamma left her alone while Bhairavi leaves with a disappointing face. \n\nMeanwhile, back in the palace, Arun looks through the file which he obtained from detective agency, which was prepared by the late detective agent, Ravi. He finds out some truth from the file. He comes to know that 20 years ago, Rajasekhar and his gang went to Parvatipuram and visited Parvathi and Muniappa’s family at Muniappa’s house. Also he found out that Rajasekhar complained to a forest officer and asked him to inspect Muniappa’s house saying there’s a snake (baby Nandhini) in their house. The very next day, all of the family members died (Parvathi and Muniappa’s wife only) but somehow their little daughter, Gayathri escaped from the tragedy. According to the villagers, they died due to snake bite but in the file Ravi wrote Rajasekhar has a strong connection with Parvathi’s death. \n\nArun begins to connect all the clues that he got and finally concluded that Rajasekhar must have did something bad to the family and has taken something which belongs to Kaatu Amman’s temple. So that is why Ganga went to the temple to return whatever thing which Rajasekhar took. Arun suspects if that’s the case then Rajasekhar and Ganga must have been in the Parvatipuram forest together. He called his friend to trace the phone call log history of Rajasekhar and Ganga on the same day where Ganga went to the temple. His friend met Arun and gave him the phone call log history list. To his astonishment, he found out that Ganga had called Rajasekhar first then Rajasekhar arrived at Parvatipuram forest to meet Ganga. \n\nAnother shocking information to Arun is that Rajasekhar’s location when he called Arun saying he had cardiac arrest was Parvatipuram forest. Now Arun is convinced that Rajasekhar lied to him about the cardiac arrest, only to make him get out from the forest and prevent him from seeing Ganga. Arun got very angry and confronted Rajasekhar himself. He asked what Rajasekhar did to Ganga. Rajasekhar lied that he don’t know anything. But Arun showed him the phone call log history list as his evidence and proved Rajasekhar is lying. Arun said if Rajasekhar does not spit out the truth, he will make a police complaint against Rajasekhar and arrest him.\n\nRajasekhar lied to Arun that he is the one who sent Ganga to Parvatipuram forest to do an atonement pooja for Kaatu Amman using the excuse of the disappearance of Devasena during the Grahana Ammayasya Day (solar eclipse full moon day). He said to Arun that he did not told Arun about it and made him to leave the forest because he was afraid that Arun will not agree to it and spoil the atonement pooja. \n\nRajasekhar claims that he did asked Ganga to come back after the pooja, but Ganga said she will go to Kasi (Hindu pilgrimage) first to be at peace after knowing Arun cheated her by marrying Seetha. Arun feels guilty but still unable to believe Rajasekhar's story. Arun demanded Rajasekhar to bring Ganga back to the house himself if what he narrated all is true. Otherwise, he will lodge a police complaint against Rajasekhar. Rajasekhar is confused on what to do next and calls Nambothiri to seek help from him but his phone is always switched off. Nambothiri has been killed by Nandhini and Rajasekhar is still unaware about this. He calls Vichu to ask him if whether Nambothiri has other contact numbers, but apparently Nambothiri has only one contactable phone number. \n\nSince Rajasekhar is in an emergency situation, and unable to seek help from Nambothiri, he decides to seek help from Bhairavi instead. He took his Kalachakra to Bhairavi (called her personally to meet up) and requested her to use her shapeshifting power to help him. Rajasekhar asks Bhairavi to shapeshift into Ganga's form and enter the palace as Ganga to make Arun believe her as real Ganga. Bhairavi agrees but with the condition he needs to handover all the 3 Kalachakras to her. Otherwise, she will give the video record of Rajasekhar murdering Ganga to the police. Rajasekhar agrees and Bhairavi asks Rajasekhar for the Kalachakra that he brought so that she can shapeshift successfully with the help of Kalachakra's powers. \n\nRajasekhar handed over the Kalachakra to Bhairavi. Bhairavi on the other hand uses this opportunity to regain back all her lost powers through the Kalachakra. As per her plan, she regains back all her lost powers and changed her form into Ganga's appearance. Rajasekhar took back the Kalachakra saying he will give back all 3 Kalachakras to Bhairavi after she completes impersonating as Ganga. Bhairavi made Rajasekhar to swear upon Arun's name so that he will not cheat Bhairavi by breaking his promise. Rajasekhar swears. Bhairavi told Rajasekhar that now he swore upon Arun's name, he has no choice but to give her the Kalachakras. \n\nRajasekhar assured Bhairavi that he will certainly keep up his promise. Meanwhile, Muniappa is eavesdropping their conversation from distant. He learns that Rajasekhar is going to make Bhairavi to impersonate as Ganga which is going to interfere in Nandhin's plan to enter the palace as well. He is about to warn Nandhini regarding this matter. \n\nIn the mean time, Nandhini calls the palace and says she is Ganga and will come home soon. Leela picks up the phone and is excited to hear about her. She gave the receiver to Arun for him to speak. Initially, Arun thought it is Seetha again who is speaking as Ganga, but later he sees Seetha in the living room of the house and got shocked. He then assumes that it is the real Ganga who is speaking to him on the phone and apologises to her. Arun requested her to forgive him for concealing the truth of him married Seetha. Nandhini is clueless and does not understand what Arun is talking about. Arun asked her to come home right away and misses her badly.\n\nNandhini disconnects the call. Leela consoles Arun and tells him to be cheerful as Ganga is coming home soon. Seetha thinks to herself that now Ganga is going to come back home, and it is the time for her to leave the house. While Janaki wonders who had called in the name of Ganga since the real Ganga is already dead. Devasena all set for school, comes to Arun and Arun tells her that Ganga will be back home soon. Devasena said she will attend school first otherwise Ganga will scold her for playing truant. Rajasekhar on the hand feels contented and misinterprets that Bhairavi is the one who called as Ganga as per their plan. He asked Arun to at least realize the truth now and that Rajasekhar is innocent. \n\nArun asked forgiveness from his father and both of them reconcile again. Meanwhile, Nandhini feels guilty for using Ganga's name under pretext of obtaining Kalachakras. Muniappa advised her not to feel guilty and the atrocities done to Kaatu Amman and Parvathi are even bigger. He also tells him about Bhairavi's plan to enter the palace as Ganga for the Kalachakras. Bhairavi (in Ganga's form) is picked up by Rajasekhar's driver and the car broke down in the way. The driver went off to get a mechanic. \n\nAfter he went, Nandhini enters the car and sits beside Bhairavi. Nandhini revealed herself as the Nagakanni Nandhini and has taken Ganga's female form. Bhairavi also reveals her true form and mocks Nandhini for getting trapped by her. Nandhini wants Bhairavi to forget the idea of possessing Kalachakras and also she should not enter the palace. It is because Nandhini is going to enter the palace as Ganga to obtain the Kalachakras. Bhairavi refuses to listen and said she will go to the palace and disguise as Ganga, only then Rajasekhar will give the Kalachakras to her willingly. \n\nNandhini made the car to drive on its own with extreme high speed to scare Bhairavi. Bhairavi shouts at Nandhini to stop the car. The car arrives at a beach and swirls around with high speed. Bhairavi inside the car couldn't bear the speed and asked Nandhini to stop. During this incident, Ganga's phone slipped away from Bhairavi's hands and fell on the car's floor. Bhairavi did not notice this. In the mean time, Arun managed to find Ganga's location by tracking her phone's location through his friend again. He drives the car to the beach area where Ganga's phone is (inside the car), as informed by his friend. \n\nOutside the car, Bhairavi and Nandhini start to fight. Bhairavi is adamant on possessing the Kalachakras and asks Nandhini, who is she to stop her from obtaining them. Nandhini said the Kalachakras belong to her only.\n\nNandhini changes into her giant snake form to attack Bhairavi but Bhairavi trapped her instead within her magic barrier. But Kaatu Amman saved Nandhini from Bhairavi's barrier. Nandhini tried to kill Bhairavi but was stopped by Muniappa who came running towards them. Muniappa said Bhairavi is Yogini element of Kaatu Amman alias Selli Amman, while Nandhini is Nagakanni element of Selli Amman. Bhairavi is also a part of Kaatu Amman's powers and all of them belong to the same class, so Nandhini should refrain from killing Bhairavi. \n\nNandhini then leaves Bhairavi but instead, traps Bhairavi with her magic threads. Bhairavi is now trapped in magic threads of Nandhini and under Muniappa's supervision. Nandhini drives the car to the previous spot where the car stopped in the first place. While she was driving away from the beach, Bhairavi shouts at her to release her from the magic threads, but Nandhini turns deaf on it. As Nandhini arrived at the spot, Arun's car coincidentally arrived at the same place too. Arun saw Nandhini as Ganga and begged her for forgiveness. He told her to give him any punishment and he will accept it. Nandhini said Arun should take her to the palace.\n\nArun happily brings Nandhini to the palace where all the family members and relatives of the palace was eagerly waiting for Ganga's arrival. Rajasekhar particularly waiting for Bhairavi's arrival. Ganga's father, Manickam was present too. When Arun and Nandhini arrived at the palace, they were warmly welcomed by them, especially Devasena who was very happy to see Ganga after a long time. Rajasekhar assuming that she is Bhairavi, welcomes her too. Nandhini enters the palace with the determination of getting the Kalachakras.\n\nManickam apologises to Arun for mistaking him and abusing him regarding Ganga’s disappearance previously. Arun said he didn’t take it to heart and they reconcile again. Seetha decides to go away from the house since Ganga has already came. She writes a “goodbye letter” and puts it on the table in the outhouse. Seetha then takes her belongings and leaves the house. Inside the house Nandhini sees Janaki’s spirit and thinks to herself that Janaki can never identify Nandhini’s true self but she knows that she is indeed Janaki’s spirit. It is because Janaki’s supernatural powers are weak compared to Nandhini’s divine powers. \n\nRajasekhar thanked Nandhini thinking her as Bhairavi for making everyone believe that she is Ganga. Rajasekhar then continues to tell his plan. He asks Bhairavi (Nandhini) to intentionally fight with Arun and make Arun to chase her out of the house by himself. Then only others will believe that Ganga left the house forever sulking and the fact that Rajasekhar murdered Ganga will be forever unknown. After Bhairavi succeeds to execute his plan, he will give all the Kalachakras to Bhairavi. Nandhini thinks to herself that she knows how to get the Kalachakras on her own and she does not need Rajasekhar’s alms. Nandhini verbally agreed to his plan but doesn’t want to do it actually. \n\nOn the other side, Janaki is trying to figure out who is the person who came to the house impersonating as Ganga. Rajasekhar killed Ganga and she is dead, so this new person could never be Ganga at all. Meanwhile, all the family members including Nandhini are gathered at the living room, chatting happily. Except for the two faced, Dharmaraj, Moorthy and Devi of course. Arun goes to his room to freshen up while Manikcam goes to the outhouse to look for Seetha. At the outhouse, he finds out Seetha’s goodbye letter and realises she left the house. \n\nManickam decides to conceal the truth of Seetha left the house because according to him Ganga’s life is now free of troubles and hindrances after Seetha’s departure. If the family members knows about this, they will start finding Seetha again, troubling all of them. He teared apart the letter and threw it into rubbish. Manickam goes back to the palace to join in the crowd. \n\nMeanwhile, at Muniappan’s house, Bhairavi is seen lying on the bed, trying to escape from the clutches of the magic thread, which have surrounded her body. Muniappan said she can never be released from the thread unless Nandhini herself removes it. He asked Bhairavi to be patient and wait until Nandhini comes back to release her, after finishing avenge their enemies and obtain the Kalachakras. \nBhairavi keeps on saying she will use her powers to break free from the magic thread. Muniappa said it is impossible and goes into kitchen to prepare food for Bhairavi. \n\nBack in the palace, Leela and Maya asks Nandhini on how was the temple tour and the experience. Nandhini didn’t know anything about it and managed them by saying she needs some time to relax first, hence will reply them after some time. To create ruckus in the family, Devi starts to provoke the people in the house. Devi says Manickam should feel sorry for accusing Arun for making Ganga to leave the house. Then Devasena intervenes by saying to Nandhini, that Seetha should remain in the house and Ganga should agree to it. \n\nNandhini didn’t understand what Devasena is talking about. She asked them who is Seetha. Everyone is shocked to hear the question. Devi pretends to support Ganga by telling it is fair for Ganga to ask such question, after the betrayal Seetha had done to Ganga by marrying Arun. Nandhini now learns that Arun had married a girl named Seetha before this. She feels pity for Ganga’s unfortunate life and the betrayal Ganga had endured. Rajasekhar seeing all this, asks Devi to keep quiet (worried that Bhairavi might be exposed if further questions are imposed to her). \n\nJanaki confirms the person who had came as Ganga is definitely not Ganga, but a stranger. She wants to find out who is this person and considers her (Nandhini) as a threat to the family. Janaki wants to separate Devasena from the newcomer to protect her child, as she can get into danger any time. While Devasena goes to the outhouse to invite Seetha to the palace (unknowing that Seetha had already left the house). Nandhini is eager to meet Seetha whom Arun had married by betraying Ganga.\n\nDevasena discovers Seetha is not inside the outhouse and runs back to Nandhini saying, Seetha is not in and maybe she went out for shopping. Rajasekhar doubts whether Seetha left the house forever assuming Ganga had came back. Janaki learns Seetha had left the house and feels that Seetha made a mistake in a hurry by leaving the house unnecessarily. Nandhini and Devasena goes back to their room and the crowd disperses. \n\nRajasekhar secretly met Nandhini. Assuming her as Bhairavi, he asked her to start argument with Arun as soon as possible and make Arun to chase her out. Nandhini just agreed to whatever Rajasekhar was saying. Night sky falls, Nandhini and Devasena is inside Arun's room. Nandhini asks Devasena what happened in the house in absence of her (Ganga). At a point of time, Devasena revealed to Nandhini that she got trapped in a secret place (Kalachakra's basement room) during her birthday but Rajasekhar asked her to keep the matter as secret. Nandhini found out that the secret place is none other than the place where Rajasekhar had kept his Kalachakra. \n\nNandhini asked Devasena where is the secret place but before Devasena could answer, Arun entered the room and asked Devasena to sleep with Seetha in outhouse. Devasena left to be with Seetha. Arun tries to make a romantic move with Nandhini and Nandhini feels it is sometimes difficult to act as Ganga. Next time, whenever Arun tries to get near to Nandhini, Nandhini decides to use the Arun - Seetha marriage as an excuse to stay away from him. Arun explains to Nandhini that soon Seetha will be sent off to London and flight tickets has been booked. \n\nDevasena comes back to the room saying Seetha is not at the outhouse and sleeps with them. After a few hours, Nandhini wakes up to see the snake mound outside the palace. She seems to be missing the snake mound a lot and considers it as her womb. Arun wakes up and finds Ganga is not around and begins to search for her. He saw Nandhini standing infront of the snake mound and asks her to go back to bed. He holds her hand but is taken back by Nandhini indicating she doesn't like Arun touching her hands. \n\nThe next day morning, Devasena is preparing to go to school and sees Janaki. She hugs her mother. Janaki said to Devasena that she is doubtful with the person who came as Ganga and asked Devasena to test the newcomer whether she is really Ganga. Devasena gets angry with Janaki for unnecessarily suspecting Ganga and goes to school. Janaki is now sad and clueless on what to do next. \n\nMeanwhile, at Vichu’s company, he is interviewing his candidates for his company’s job position. A lady comes to attend the interview held by Vichu and enters his office room. The lady says that her name is Nandhini. It seems the lady is actually Nandhini who came to seek revenge on Vichu. Vichu is shocked to see the lady transforming into a snake in front of him.\n\nBut it was all Vichu’s imagination after all. He immediately chased away all the ladies who came to interview and told his manager to only appoint male staffs. Vichu remembered Nambothiri’s words to be extra careful with any new females they encounter. He quickly drives off to Rajasekhar’s palace. \n\nMeanwhile Manickam met Seiyanayagi at her place and thanked her for Ganga’s arrival. Seiyanayagi already knew that it is Nandhini who is the one impersonating as Ganga but hides the truth from Manickam. According to her, she had stopped worshiping Karuppusamy due to her failure to protect Ganga when she was in danger. She said she is unable to face Karuppan due to her failed task, nevertheless her powers given by Karuppan will still be retained in her body. Manickam invites Seiyanayagi to their palace and Seiyanayagi replies she will come at the right time. \n\nBack in the palace, everyone is gathered at Devi’s room because Devi’s husband, Eshwar fell sick due to food poisoning. Rajasekhar tried to call doctor but doctor seems to be busy. Nandhini said she will try to check Eshwar’s fever. Once Nandhini’s hands touched Eshwar’s forehead, Eshwar’s sickness was cured immediately. Everyone was surprised including Nandhini herself. But others assumed that Nandhini got this positive energy as a result from her temple tour. But in reality Nandhini naturally possesses healing power inherited from her mother, Parvathi. Rajasekhar again silently warns Nandhini to not to do such things again. \n\nVichu comes to the palace and sees Nandhini. Thinking her as Ganga, he runs to Rajasekhar’s bedroom and told him about it. Rajasekhar convinced him by saying it is actually Bhairavi who is in the disguise of Ganga. He made this arrangement to make Arun to believe him and escape from police. Vichu was relieved and explained that he is now afraid of Nandhini as they don’t know her human form. Vichu wants to stay at Rajasekhar’s palace for the time being for his safety. \n\nSince Nambothiri is not available at the moment to help them, both of them plans to catch Muniappan as they know Muniappan would definitely aware of Nandhini’s human form. According to Rajasekhar and Vichu, if they managed to catch Muniappan, they can get the details about Nandhini’s whereabouts. In the mean times, Seiyanayagi arrives at the palace and meets the family members. All the family members including Rajasekhar and Vichu greet her and seek blessings from her. \n\nManju called out for Ganga (Nandhini) to seek blessings from Seiyanayagi too. Seiyanayagi is already aware that she is Nandhini. Nandhini comes to them and greets Seiyanayagi. Dharmaraj asks Nandhini to seek blessings from her as well but Nandhini doesn’t want to. Seiyanayagi said, “I know why Nandhini doesn’t want to do it. It is because she is not Ganga at all.”\n\nEveryone was shocked by hearing this. But Seiyanayagi managed the situation by saying, “Ganga is not the cheerful and positive girl as before. She is now a new girl with grief and depression”. Seiyanayagi asked permission from Rajasekhar to talk privately with Nandhini. Both Seiyanayagi and Nandhini goes to the outhouse to talk. \n\nSeiyanayagi told Nandhini to stop her disguise and knows that she is Nandhini. She asked Nandhini to stop seeking revenge and hurting Ganga’s family. She also emphasised the divine purpose of Ganga’s form given to Nandhini. It is none other than to serve Kaatu Amman and do good deeds only, instead of seeking revenge and murdering people. Seiyanayagi added, it is already enough number of people killed by Nandhini (Eshwar Tambooran, Kumar, Chamundi & Nambothiri). Nandhini refused to listen, and said it is her lifetime goal and responsibility to avenge their enemies for their sins. \n\nSeiyanayagi confronts her by saying it is God’s decision to give punishment for them and it is not Nandhini’s business. Nandhini said she intends to seek vengeance on behalf of Ganga as well for Rajasekhar’s heinous crimes. It was Ganga’s last wish before she died . Seiyanayagi exclaimed, that Ganga is still alive and will definitely come back. Before she left, her last words, “ Ganga will come back. You will know the reason why you have got Ganga’s form as your human form from your mother, Parvathi” kept disturbing Nandhini’s mind. \n\nRajasekhar confirmed with Nandhini that Seiyanayagi is unaware that she is Bhairavi or else things will get worse. Nandhini gave favourable answer to him to shut his mouth. At the dining hall, Arun tries to impress Nandhini thinking her as Ganga, by showing all his love and concern towards her. Nandhini just ignores him. After seeing all this, Rajasekhar told Nandhini (assuming as Bhairavi) to be patient and endure Arun’s attitude for the time being. He requested her to never reveal herself as Bhairavi to Arun, if she gets angry at any situation. \n\nMeanwhile, Janaki’s spirit met Devasena outside Arun’s bedroom and said that she is still doubtful with the newcomer (Nandhini). Janaki asked Devasena to test her whether she is really Ganga or an imposter. Devasena agreed at last but this time, Janaki asked Devasena to unite Arun with Ganga. According to Janaki’s plan, if the newcomer is really an imposter, she wouldn’t want to be with Arun. Devasena tried some mischievous ways to unite Ganga (Nandhini) with Arun. Obviously Arun liked it, but not Nandhini. Nandhini tries to escape from the situation and thinks of a way to exit the room.\n\nNandhini managed to escape from the situation. Night sky falls, Nandhini goes to Vichu's room to take his Kalachakra from him. Vichu kept the Kalachakra under his pillow. Nandhini made Vichu to fall in a deep sleep using her magic powers. She searched the whole room but after she couldn't find the Kalachakra, she decided to find it under Vichu's pillow. The Kalachakra slides into the other side of the bed when she lifted up the pillow, hence Nandhini could not see it. Just then, the Kalachakra made Vichu to wake up and save him from Nandhini. \n\nWhen Vichu woke up, Nandhini transformed into a snake form and attacked him. (Vichu did not saw her human form). Vichu shouted loud in fear which made the whole family members came to his room. Rajasekhar said he will take care of Vichu and asked others to go back to sleep. Inside the room, Vichu said Nandhini is still in snake form and have not attained human form. Rajasekhar said to Vichu, it is just a normal snake not Nandhini. After Rajasekhar left, Vichu still strongly believes it was Nandhini and she is still in snake form. In the mean time, Nandhini plans to attempt again next time. \n\nThe next day morning, Vichu meets Rajasekhar again and told him he indeed saw Nandhini and it was her snake form, but Rajasekhar still refuses to beileve him. Meanwhile, Nandhini arrives at the snake mound seeing it is all cleaned up and well decorated with flowers. Arun came to her and said he is the one who did all this for Ganga's sake. Nandhini continues to do pooja for the snake mound after Arun left. \n\nMuniappa silently watches Nandhini and shows up infront of her. Nandhini is shocked to see Muniappa and asked him to go away. Nandhini is worried that Rajasekhar might spot Muniappa. Vichu saw Muniappa talking to Nandhini and showed to Rajasekhar to catch him. Rajasekhar sees both of them talking and are about to catch Muniappan.\n\nRajasekhar and Vichu gets down to the snake mound to catch Muniappan. Muniappan escapes from them. Rajasekhar asked Nandhini whatever things Muniappan had said to her. Nandhini uses Rajasekhar’s assumption of her as Bhairavi as a bait to trick him, by saying she was about to ask Muniappan regarding Nandhini’s whereabouts but both of you spoiled it. Rajasekhar apologises to Nandhini and pleads to help them. Nandhini then falsely regards her as Bhairavi, asks them to come to a special place to do special pooja to trap Nandhini. Vichu and Rajasekhar believed her lies and prepares for the pooja. \n\nMeanwhile, Devasena coming back from school asks other family members to unite Ganga (Nandhini) and Arun. Dharmaraj gives an idea to Arun to make Ganga fall for him again. Arun goes to Ganga’s room and tries Dharmaraj’s idea. The idea is, Arun should hold Ganga’s hip and hug her from behind, so that Ganga will be smitten by him. Arun fantasises for a while, imagining Ganga kissing and hugging him. But afterwards he realises it was just an imagination. \n\nArun, in reality, approaches Ganga (Nandhini) and tries to hug her from behind. Nandhini turned back quickly, disallowing Arun to touch her. Arun managed the situation by saying he was just going to help her tidy up the bed. Nandhini angrily said she will do it by herself. Arun left her alone knowing she is still angry. \n\nSun is about to set, Nandhini is conducting a pooja as Bhairavi to trap Vichu and Rajasekhar to kill them. But Rajasekhar arrives by wearing “Ayyappa’s garland”. He said Seiyanayagi is the one who gave Rajasekhar the idea to wear “Ayyappan Garland” to prevent Arun from getting near to Bhairavi (Nandhini). Nandhini learns Seiyanayagi deliberately did this to prevent her from killing Rajasekhar. Nandhini thought at least she can kill Vichu but he went off with Rajasekhar. Nandhini’s plan to kill them fails. \n\nBack in the palace, Rajasekhar conducts a special Ayyappan pooja and invites some of the Ayyapan’s devotee of Sabarimala to the palace. They began to chant Ayyappan’s holy mantra, which caused Janaki’s spirit to be expelled from the house. Nandhini plans to make Rajasekhar remove his garland so that she can kill him. She plans to kill a family member from the house, so that Rajasekhar will have to remove the garland if a death occurs at the house. \n\nDevasena comes to Nandhini to talk to her. Initially, Nandhini plans to kill Devasena but later she refrained from it, because previously Parvathi had saved her once. Devasena pleads to Nandhini to talk to Arun and unite with him again. Nandhini recalls the incident where Devasena spilled out the beans regarding the secret basement room, in which she got trapped during her birthday. Nandhini said to Devasena, that she will talk to Arun again but Devasena has to take her to the secret place.\n\nDevasena brings Nandhini to the secret place but Vichu saw both of them entering the basement room. He quickly went to tell Rajasekhar about it. Inside the secret room, there Kalachakra was no more. Disappointed, Nandhini and Devasena went up to Rajasekhar's room. Rajasekhar and Vichu arrives at the room and discovers them. Devasena left the room while Vichu and Rajasekhar interrogated Nandhini. \n\nRajasekhar said he had kept the Kalachakra in another place knowing something like this will happen. He said he will definitely give the Kalachakras to Bhairavi (Nandhini) after solving their problems. Nandhini assured them something like this will not happen again. Janaki's spirit came back to house after the Ayyapan pooja ended. She told Devasena to test the newcomer (Nandhini) one last time. Devasena agreed and asked Nandhini questions regarding Janaki's first meeting with Ganga and her initial marital status. \n\nNandhini answered the questions correctly, knowing Janaki is the one who instigated Devasena to ask such questions. Nandhini already read Ganga's mind fully, when she possessed Ganga previously. Devasena finally concludes it is indeed Ganga and Janaki is the one who is unnecessarily suspecting her. Janaki is still not convinced and wants to dig out some more truth. Nandhini learns Janaki has started to suspect her and begins to be more cautious. In the mean time, Arun brought some Kanchipuram silk sarees to Nandhini saying it is her's (Ganga's) favourite sarees. Nandhini said she didn't like any of those sarees.\n\n\n\n\nIn the table below, the blue numbers represent the lowest ratings and the red numbers represent the highest ratings.\nThe Series was released on 23 January 2017 on Sun TV, the series also airs on Sun TV HD.

                "Andrew Reynolds (skateboarder)\n\nAndrew Michael Reynolds (born June 6, 1978) is a professional street skateboarder. He is the co-founder and owner of Baker Skateboards; a part owner of Brigada Eyewear; a partner in Bakerboys Distribution (distributors of Baker Skateboards, Shake Junt, Deathwish Skateboards, Heroin Skateboards, Palace Skateboards, Hammers Skateboards, Death Lens, and Ashbury Eyewear), and head designer at Altamont Apparel.\n\nReynolds was a competitor in the 2014 Street League Skateboarding (SLS) contest series and finished with an overall ranking of 25.\n\nHe first picked up a board when he was 9 years old. Influenced by Powell videos at the time, Andrew began to skate jump ramps as well as wall rides.\n\nHe's got good style, too. Yeah, yeah, I used to see him when he was, like, eleven, twelve years-old—he lived in Lakeland and I lived in Fort Myers, like, three hours away. Yeah, I remember he killed it, and, ah, everybody knew it, too. He was, he was always great.\n\nReynolds emerged in the skateboarding scene in the early 1990s. Following a phone call from professional skateboarder and ex-Bones Brigade member Tony Hawk, Reynolds joined the Birdhouse (Hawk's company) skateboard team; Reynolds has stated that Hawk contacted Reynolds with little knowledge about the latter's skateboarding. Reynolds explained in 2008:\nTo me, that was such a trip when they told me, \"The ams [amateurs] on Birdhouse are gonna be you and Ocean Howell.\" And I'm, like, \"Me! And the guy, from the H Street video, with, like, the Doors song, and everything?!\" I was, like, \"Oh my god!\", like, it's not even right. Like, some little kid from a hick town, and the other am is Ocean Howell? It's, like, wrong; it's just ... it just was so wrong. At first when I met him I was, like, just a fan. But then, like, we became friends, you know? He, like, would get a girl at every demo, almost, and I'm just, like ... amazed! I was just, like, \"Man, how does he do it? He's so cool!\", you know? ... He was sick; he was so cool.\n\nProfessional skateboarder and Emerica team manager Heath Kirchart revealed in 2007 that he perceived Reynolds as his competition, as Reynolds was recruited to Birdhouse after he joined the team. Kirchart further explained:\n... I don't tell many people this. But there was point, I remember when were filming \"The End\", and I would see footage of him—when he kickflip noseslided the UCI ten-stair, I was just, like, \"Holy shit! Hopefully, I'll do that.\" And I didn't. But it was, like, my coming to, like, \"Wow! He's better than me.\" And, since that time, it's been, like ... it's like, \"way\" better than me. He's not just better than me—he's, like, \"way\" better than me.\n\nIn 1998, Reynolds was featured in the fourth Birdhouse video \"The End\", with a section of his footage from the Bro Bowl in Tampa.\n\nIn 2000, Reynolds left Birdhouse and started the Baker brand with Jay Strickland; the company was named after a lifestyle in which a person \"gets baked\" (smokes and experiences the effects of the drug cannabis) and skateboards every day. In 2007, Reynolds provided a detailed account of the company's beginnings:\nWell, I was living in Huntington, riding for Birdhouse. We just thought to ourselves, all these companies are really lame. Like, Birdhouse doesn't promote piles, you know what I mean? Like, Zero's [skateboard deck brand] not promoting, like, what we're all about. You know, we met up with Jay Strickland, we started telling him about our ideas, like, \"We wanna do something. We wanna do a company.\" And we're, like, \"All of us, together.\", you know? It was just, like, a big mess, you know? I went and talked to Tony [Hawk] and Per [Welinder]—\"It's either, I quit, and take a bunch of guys and do something, or, you guys help me start a company, you know?\"\n\nThe skateboard deck brand signed a distribution deal with Blitz Distribution, the company that, at the time, was distributing Birdhouse and other brands, such as Fury and Hook-Ups (Blitz had originally been formed by Per Welinder and Hawk to distribute their own products). As of 2008, the brand was the top-selling brand under the Blitz Distribution umbrella. Reynolds has publicly disclosed that all of the Baker team members, including himself, receive the same amount of remuneration: \"I get paid the same as Braydon. Dustin tried to ask for more money one time…I had to tell him, like, everybody gets paid the same…There’s no favoritism.\"\n\nThe company parted ways with Blitz and, in 2007, Reynolds and fellow professional skateboarders, Jim Greco and Erik Ellington, established Bakerboys Distribution to distribute the Deathwish brand—Baker's distribution was then newly managed by Bakerboys in 2011. As of July 2014, Bakerboys distributes seven brands, some of which are owned by past and current Baker riders. These companies are:\n\n\nAs of July 2016, the Baker team consists of: Reynolds, Riley Hawk, Bryan Herman, Dustin Dollin, Don \"Nuge\" Nguyen, Terry Kennedy, Sammy Baca, Justin \"Figgy\" Figueroa, Cyril Jackson, Dee Ostrander, Tristan Funkhauser, and Theotis Beasley. Former riders include Kevin \"Spanky\" Long, Braydon Szafranski, Jeff Lenoce, Shane Heyl, Jim Greco, Erik Ellington, and Leo Romero (Greco and Ellington left to form the Deathwish brand, while Romero moved to the Toy Machine team and subsequently received a \"Skater of the Year\" award from \"Thrasher\" magazine). Reynolds formed Baker Boys Distribution with Greco and Ellington in 2007, and the company distributes both Baker and Deathwish, in addition to the Heroin, Vol 4, Brigada, and Shake Junt brands.\n\nFor the \"Fall 2014\" catalog, released in September/October 2014, Reynolds collaborated with Australian musician Nick Cave for the production of a skateboard deck. The design on the bottom of the skateboard deck features an image of Cave in the process of lighting a cigarette (repeated three times), while wearing a T-shirt that reads \"Suck My Dick.\" Reynolds said: \"NICK CAVE HAS BEEN ONE OF MY FAVORITE ARTISTS FOR YEARS NOW, AND I AM SUPER EXCITED TO DO THIS BOARD WITH HIM!!!\"\n\nAs of November 2014, Reynolds has released eleven signature shoe models with skateboarding shoe company Emerica: The Reynolds 1, The Reynolds 2, The Reynolds 3, The Boss, The Reynolds Light, The AR Slim, Reynolds Cruisers, The Reynolds Classics, The Reynolds, The Reynolds low and the Reynolds Low Vulc.\n\nIn 2006, Reynolds collaborated with Sole Technology, the owner of the Emerica shoe brand, on the joint skateboard clothing venture Altamont Apparel. During the launch event, held at the Altamont Speedway car-racing venue, Reynolds stated that he had been inspired by the spirit of rebellion and freedom that had defined the Rolling Stones concert at the speedway in 1969. For the launch, a select group of retailers, journalists, and members of the skateboarding community were driven in limousines to the Altamont Speedway, where they listened to Reynolds speak about the brand and participated in the brand's launch.\n\nIn collaboration with the creative direction of Reynolds, the head designer for the brand is English artist FOS, who is also the owner of the Heroin skateboard brand. As of October 2012, the brand's team includes Mike Watt, Brian Hansen, Neen Williams, Kenny Hoyle, Jon Dickson, Justin Figeroa, and Bryan Herman. Former riders have included Garrett Hill and Theotis Beasley, with a signature Beasley clothing line released in early 2012.\n\nAs of April 2017, Reynolds is sponsored by Baker Skateboards, Spitfire Wheels, RVCA, Brigada, Independent, Shake Junt, Emerica, Stance, and Nixon.\n\nCalled \"Madness\" by Reynolds himself, the skateboarder experiences a \"condition\" while skateboarding that has been perceived as a mild form of obsessive compulsive disorder(OCD), even though an official diagnosis has not been confirmed. In a 2007 episode of the online show \"Epicly Later'd\" the Vice YouTube channel depicted an example of the \"Madness\" while Reynolds was filming a trick in San Francisco, California.: \"And he's gonna walk right up to the top and tap the wall three times. And then he comes and checks it [the area where the trick is being performed] again. He's gonna say, 'Lance, Beagle, Mike' ... ready? [Reynolds] 'Lance?' ... 'Beagle?' ... 'Mike?'\n\nReynolds explained in the Vice interview:\nLike, before I go to bed at night, I go to the door, and I, and I, I lock it ... nine times, but, like, three, three, three; three, three, three; three, three, three; and I do that ... three times. And, then, sometimes I'm layin' down, and I'm, like, \"Did I do it?\", and I go back. And then it's, like, once I do that, then it has to be the nine, the whole thing—three, three, three, three, three, three—three time. And, then, if I messed up and did it, then I have to do that whole thing three times. You know what I mean?\n\nAs part of the DVD release of the Emerica video \"Stay Gold\", a bonus section on the \"Madness\" was included. While watching footage of his pre-trick behaviour, Reynolds states, \"I don't know what I'm doing right here. Ha ha. I don't know. Like, if you would've told me, if someone would've told me, 'You rolled up, without trying a noseslide, twenty times, or thirty times, I woulda said, \"Nuh. You're wrong.\" Professional skateboarder and teammate Jerry Hsu explained in the same video:\nWell, lately, he's been, like, really, like, he's really into being healthy, and exercising, like, I'm rooming with right now, and it's, like, we're in, like, a gym; the room is like a gym, where he's just constantly eating bananas, and, like, only healthy stuff, and he's stretching all the time, and, like, it's only to get tricks. Like, that what he says. He's just, like, \"I just gotta do whatever I can to get tricks.\" Do everything he possibly can to do it just the way he pictured it. He's, like, totally obsessive about it and it's, like, really rad; I like it.\n\nIn an interview for the online series \"Free Lunch\", produced by Hawk's RIDE Channel, Reynolds stated:\n... and then Tony's just, like, Tony Hawk—he's like, basically, to me it says, \"You can be a skater and take over everything and be, you know ... and use skateboarding to be ... a businessman, a ... role model to young people\", um, he's just the best. And, he called my house when I was fifteen, and was, like, \"Do you wanna do something with us?\", not knowing anything about me. Yeah, Tony's the man, sure, he's the best.\n\nIn 2012, Reynolds recruited Hawk's son Riley for the Baker brand and he explained the process in an online interview:\n... I was just, kinda like, \"it's kinda touchy, you know what I mean, like?\" It's kinda weird, you know? Tony's kid, he rides for Birdhouse. But I look at it, like, I picture him on Baker, you know what I mean? So we just approached Tony, \"Yeah, we wanna talk to Riley about maybe gettin' some Baker boards, or something like that.\" And Tony's like, \"Man, he's rippin', he's nineteen years-old, he can, you know, it's really up to him. You guys talk to him, you know?\" So we just kinda said, \"You wanna get some boards?\", he's like, \"I'm down, man!\" And I look at it, like, there would be no Baker without Tony and Birdhouse. I know it's an ongoing process, you know? Tony quits to start Birdhouse; I quit to start Baker; my guys quit to start a new brand, you know? It's just an ongoing thing.\n\nOn Mark Gonzales, Reynolds has stated:\nGonz is the most influential skater of all times, no question. Mark Gonzales created how to street skate, for doing handrails and things that no one has ever done. When people were doing a boardslide on the rail and people thought that was super crazy, he was doing 180 nosegrinds and 180 fakie 50-50s. The best and most technical skater today doing the hardest tricks beyond what anyone could think of is not doing what Gonz was doing then. It’s just not the same. He was an alien or something. \n\nIn 2012, Reynolds explained Gonzales' influence in further detail:\nGonz, to me, is, like, the reason that we do handrails, and the reason we jump stairs and kick flip in the street; it's, Gonz. Besides what Rodney Mullen did, to me, he, like, opened up the doors for, like, street skating. One of my first videos was \"Ohio Skateout\"; all the top pros were board-sliding the handrail—that was like a big deal. And he comes up, and 180 [degree] to fifty-fifty down it; first try. It wasn't like he did just, like, a front [side] board, you know? He did, like, a whole entirely different thing that they, no-one even knew what it was. His brain ... I don't even know.\n\nReynolds has also been a vocal supporter of Flip professional skateboarder Tom Penny and stated in a 2009 article, entitled \"The Church of Tom Penny\":\nThe switch flip. It’s unexplainable. That whole thing is just like the Penny package. It’s like a display. Not many people have got kickflip, frontside flip, switch frontside flip, and switch flip all looking exactly the same. It wasn’t even really that common to do tricks over handrails at that point. He just killed it.\n\nIn December 2011, Reynolds was identified as the tenth most influential skateboarder of all time by \"Transworld Skateboarding\" magazine.\n\nProfessional skateboarder, friend, and teammate Braydon Szafranski has stated, \"You're a complete fucking moron if you don't think that Andrew is the best skater in the world. Every single day he does tricks that I've never seen him do, and I've known him, like, six years.\" Professional skateboarder, teammate, artist, and company owner Ed Templeton has stated: \"I don't know how he does it. I don't know how he jumps down the stuff he jumps down, year after year, and, and, still be like ... I don't know—to me, it's shocking. He's been number one for so long, that it's mind-blowing at this point.\" Emerica teammate Jerry Hsu has also expressed his admiration of Reynolds:\nHe just has, like, a really cool obsession with skating... it's like being around a little kid... as long as you are focused about skating, you can do whatever you want. You can... he is pretty nice. He does a lot of crazy shit in skating. Like, you wouldn't believe it. All he, all he eats is fruit. I don't know how he skates when he just eats fruit and salad... oh, he eats tons of vegetables. He's crazy.\n\nIn April 2013, Artist and Skateboarder Logan Yuzna made \"Skate Like Andrew Reynolds\", a music video dedicated to Reynolds influence in Skateboarding that was featured on Reynolds Skateboard company Baker Skateboards website and social media platforms.\n\nIn July 2013, professional skateboarder Paul Rodriguez included Reynolds in his \"top ten\" list of favorite professional skateboarders, explaining: \"If you ask me, nobody jumps huge stairs and gaps better than Reynolds. Nobody does it with better style, more grace, or more control ... He’s another guy with amazing style. He is everything you could ever ask in the most pristine pro skateboarder.\"\n\nReynolds' skating profile was featured in the original \"Tony Hawk's Pro Skater\" video game. He has subsequently been involved with \"Pro Skater 2\", \"Pro Skater 3\", \"Pro Skater 4\", \"Underground\", \"American Wasteland\", \"Proving Ground\", \"Pro Skater HD\", and most recently, \"Pro Skater 5\". Outside of the \"Tony Hawk's\" series, Reynolds was featured in EA's\" Skate 3\".\n\nReynolds won Thrasher Magazine's \"Skater of the Year\" award in 1998. For his video part in the 2010 skateboard video \"Stay Gold\", produced by the Emerica brand, Reynolds received \"Transworld Skateboarding\" magazine's award for \"Best Video Part\" in 2011.\n\nAs of October 2012, Reynolds has not drunk or taken drugs for ten years following a period of problematic illicit and licit drug use in his early twenties. He also stopped smoking cigarettes after his daughter was born. Justin Regan, a member of the skateboard industry, has explained: \"... But, in his early twenties, like, he definitely hit a rough period, with, like, partying... boozing, getting involved with drugs, and just kind of, like, living the lifestyle to the fullest.\" Friend, bandmate, and former Baker team rider Shane Heyl referred to him as a \"cop magnet\" in a 2008 interview, stating that \"... we'd be having a good time and he'd just step it up to another level, just act... just act crazy!\"\n\nIn response to the question \"What in particular triggered you going sober?\" in a 2011 interview, Reynolds replied:\nUm, cocaine - just messing with hard drugs and not being able to stop. My drinking was way out of control; I couldn't drink one beer without ending up blacking out and doing drugs. It would happen over and over again. Probably from like seventeen years old to twenty-four, I just didn't know how to control my intake of drugs or alcohol. It just happens to certain people. You are either that way or you aren't that way, you know? I smoked weed like my life depended on it. Then one day, I woke up and I knew it was a problem. The hard stuff - I knew I shouldn't be messing with it.\n\nHe has expressed that his inspiration is his family, like his mother Laura, his father Paul and his brother David and sister Maria. In a September 2014 interview, Reynolds expressed concern over the influence that the recorded behavior of \"Baker, Pissdrunx and our whole crowd\" might have exerted upon young viewers and fans. Reynolds explained that he'd \"like to try and repair that\" as much as possible, and added: \"I feel like that’s a good job for me.\"\n\nIn 2008, Reynolds resided in Hollywood, California, U.S. with his daughter Stella. However, in 2012, a report stated that Reynolds had undergone a divorce and subsequently sold the Hollywood house, as well as his Cadillac, in a process of simplification. In response to the life changes that Reynolds has undergone in his older years, Regan has stated, \"That’s how he simplifies things down. If you want what he’s got, do what he does.\"\n\nIn a 2012 interview, Reynolds revealed the origin of his nickname \"The Boss\":\nIt's just a nickname that [professional skateboarder] Jim Greco came up with. I guess growing up watching mob movies and mob documentaries, there's always like has to be a boss. I had a Cadillac, it was just little stuff. I had an apartment; Jim was, like, \"He's the Boss\". That's it. And then he just kind of stuck with it after that. I don't take part in it. I don't go around, like, \"I'm the Boss\", you know? I don't care, whatever.\n\nReynolds has been involved with film projects on a minor level. He starred in the short film \"Shadows\" (2000) and the feature film \"Cop and 1/2\" (1993), appearing as \"The Skateboard Kid\" in the latter. He was also a stunt performer in the documentary \"Collage\" (2001).\n\n\n"

                "Supreme court\n\nA supreme court is the highest court within the hierarchy of courts in many legal jurisdictions. Other descriptions for such courts include court of last resort, apex court, and highest (or final) court of appeal. Broadly speaking, the decisions of a supreme court are not subject to further review by any other court. Supreme courts typically function primarily as appellate courts, hearing appeals from decisions of lower trial courts, or from intermediate-level appellate courts.\n\nHowever, not all highest courts are named as such. Civil law states tend not to have a single highest court. Additionally, the highest court in some jurisdictions is not named the \"Supreme Court\", for example, the High Court of Australia; this is because decisions by the High Court could formerly be appealed to the Privy Council. On the other hand, in some places the court named the \"Supreme Court\" is not in fact the highest court; examples include the New York Supreme Court, the Supreme Courts of several Canadian provinces/territories and the former Supreme Court of Judicature of England and Wales and Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland, which are all subordinate to higher courts of appeal.\n\nSome countries have multiple \"supreme courts\" whose respective jurisdictions have different geographical extents, or which are restricted to particular areas of law. Some countries with a federal system of government may have both a federal supreme court (such as the Supreme Court of the United States), and supreme courts for each member state (such as the Supreme Court of Nevada), with the former having jurisdiction over the latter only to the extent that the federal constitution extends federal law over state law. However, other federations, such as Canada, may have a supreme court of general jurisdiction, able to decide any question of law. Jurisdictions with a civil law system often have a hierarchy of administrative courts separate from the ordinary courts, headed by a supreme administrative court as is the case in the Netherlands. A number of jurisdictions also maintain a separate constitutional court (first developed in the Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920), such as Austria, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Portugal, Russia, Spain and South Africa. Within the former British Empire, the highest court within a colony was often called the \"Supreme Court\", even though appeals could be made from that court to the United Kingdom's Privy Council (based in London). A number of Commonwealth jurisdictions retain this system, but many others have reconstituted their own highest court as a court of last resort, with the right of appeal to the Privy Council being abolished.\n\nIn jurisdictions using a common law system, the doctrine of \"stare decisis\" applies, whereby the principles applied by the supreme court in its decisions are binding upon all lower courts; this is intended to apply a uniform interpretation and implementation of the law. In civil law jurisdictions the doctrine of \"stare decisis\" is not generally considered to apply, so the decisions of the supreme court are not necessarily binding beyond the immediate case before it; however, in practice the decisions of the supreme court usually provide a very strong precedent, or \"jurisprudence constante\", for both itself and all lower courts.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Bangladesh is created by the provisions of the Constitution of Bangladesh, 1972. There are two Divisions of the Supreme Court, i.e. (a) Appellate Division and (b) High Court Division. Appellate Division is the highest Court of Appeal and usually does not exercise the powers of a court of first instance. Whereas, the High Court Division is a Court of first instance in writ/judicial review, company and admiralty matters.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Canada was established in 1875 but only became the highest court in the country in 1949 when the right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was abolished. This court hears appeals from the courts of appeal from the provinces and territories, and also appeals from the Federal Court of Appeal. The Supreme Court is a \"General Court of Appeal.\" It can decide any question of law considered by the lower courts, including constitutional law, federal law, and provincial law. The court's decisions are final and binding on the federal courts and the courts from all provinces and territories. The title \"Supreme\" can be confusing because, for example, the Supreme Court of British Columbia does not have the final say and controversial cases heard there often get appealed in higher courts - it is in fact one of the lower courts in such a process.\n\nIn Hong Kong, the Supreme Court of Hong Kong (now known as the High Court of Hong Kong) was the final court of appeal during its colonial times which ended with transfer of sovereignty in 1997. The final adjudication power, as in any other British Colonies, rested with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) in London, United Kingdom. Now the power of final adjudication is vested in the Court of Final Appeal created in 1997. Under the Basic Law, its constitution, the territory remains a common law jurisdiction. Consequently, judges from other common law jurisdictions (including England and Wales) can be recruited and continue to serve in the judiciary according to Article 92 of the Basic Law. On the other hand, the power of interpretation of the Basic Law itself is vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC) in Beijing (without retroactive effect), and the courts are authorised to interpret the Basic Law when trying cases, in accordance with Article 158 of the Basic Law. This arrangement became controversial in light of the right of abode issue in 1999, raising concerns for judicial independence.\n\nIn India, the Supreme Court of India was created on January 28, 1950 after adoption of the Constitution.\nArticle 141 of the Constitution of India states that the law declared by Supreme Court is to be binding on all Courts within the territory of India. It is the highest court in India and has ultimate judicial authority to interpret the Constitution and decide questions of national law (including local bylaws). The Supreme Court is also vested with the power of judicial review to ensure the application of the rule of law.\n\nNote that within the constitutional framework of India, Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) has a special status vis-a-vis the other states of India. Article 370 of the Constitution of India carves out certain exceptions for J&K. However, the Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order 1954 makes Article 141 applicable to the state of J&K and hence law declared by the Supreme Court of India is equally applicable to all courts of J&K including the High Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court is the highest court in the Republic of Ireland. It has authority to interpret the constitution, and strike down laws and activities of the state that it finds to be unconstitutional. It is also the highest authority in the interpretation of the law. Constitutionally it must have authority to interpret the constitution but its further appellate jurisdiction from lower courts is defined by law. The Irish Supreme Court consists of its presiding member, the Chief Justice, and seven other judges. Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President in accordance with the binding advice of the Government. The Supreme Court sits in the Four Courts in Dublin.\n\nIsrael's Supreme Court is at the head of the court system in the State of Israel. It is the highest judicial instance. The Supreme Court sits in Jerusalem. The area of its jurisdiction is the entire State. A ruling of the Supreme Court is binding upon every court, other than the Supreme Court itself. The Israeli supreme court is both an appellate court and the high court of justice. As an appellate court, the Supreme Court considers cases on appeal (both criminal and civil) on judgments and other decisions of the District Courts. It also considers appeals on judicial and quasi-judicial decisions of various kinds, such as matters relating to the legality of Knesset elections and disciplinary rulings of the Bar Association. As the High Court of Justice (Hebrew: Beit Mishpat Gavoha Le'Zedek בית משפט גבוה לצדק; also known by its initials as Bagatz בג\"ץ), the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, primarily in matters regarding the legality of decisions of State authorities: Government decisions, those of local authorities and other bodies and persons performing public functions under the law, and direct challenges to the constitutionality of laws enacted by the Knesset. The court has broad discretionary authority to rule on matters in which it considers it necessary to grant relief in the interests of justice, and which are not within the jurisdiction of another court or tribunal. The High Court of Justice grants relief through orders such as injunction, mandamus and Habeas Corpus, as well as through declaratory judgments. The Supreme Court can also sit at a further hearing on its own judgment. In a matter on which the Supreme Court has ruled - whether as a court of appeals or as the High Court of Justice - with a panel of three or more justices, it may rule at a further hearing with a panel of a larger number of justices. A further hearing may be held if the Supreme Court makes a ruling inconsistent with a previous ruling or if the Court deems that the importance, difficulty or novelty of a ruling of the Court justifies such hearing. The Supreme Court also holds the unique power of being able to order \"trial de novo\" (a retrial).\n\nIn Nauru, there is no single highest court for all types of cases. The Supreme Court has final jurisdiction on constitutional matters, but any other case may be appealed further to the Appellate Court. In addition, an agreement between Nauru and Australia in 1976 provides for appeals from the Supreme Court of Nauru to the High Court of Australia in both criminal and civil cases, with the notable exception of constitutional cases.\n\nIn New Zealand, the right of appeal to the Privy Council was abolished following the passing of the Supreme Court Act (2003). A right of appeal to the Privy Council remains for criminal cases which were decided before the Supreme Court was created, but it is likely that the successful appeal by Mark Lundy to the Privy Council in 2013 will be the last appeal to the Board from New Zealand.\n\nThe new Supreme Court of New Zealand was officially established at the beginning of 2004, although it did not come into operation until July. The High Court of New Zealand was until 1980 known as the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has a purely appellate jurisdiction and hears appeals from the Court of Appeal of New Zealand. In some cases, an appeal may be removed directly to the Supreme Court from the High Court. For certain cases, particularly cases which commenced in the District Court, a lower court (typically the High Court or the Court of Appeal) may be the court of final jurisdiction.\n\nThe Supreme Court has been the apex court for Pakistan since the declaration of the republic in 1956 (previously the Privy Council had that function). The Supreme Court has the final say on matters of constitutional law, federal law or on matters of mixed federal and provincial competence. It can hear appeals on matters of provincial competence only if a matter of a constitutional nature is raised.\n\nWith respect to Pakistan's territories (i.e. FATA, Azad Kashmir, Northern Areas and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT)) the Supreme Court's jurisdiction is rather limited and varies from territory to territory; it can hear appeals only of a constitutional nature from FATA and Northern Areas, while ICT generally functions the same as provinces. Azad Kashmir has its own courts system and the constitution of Pakistan does not apply to it as such; appeals from Azad Kashmir relate to its relationship with Pakistan.\n\nThe provinces have their own courts system, with the High Court as the apex court, except insofar as where an appeal can go to the Supreme Court as mentioned above.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is the ultimate court for criminal and civil matters in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and for civil matters in Scotland. (The supreme court for criminal matters in Scotland is the High Court of Justiciary.) The Supreme Court was established by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005 with effect from 1 October 2009, replacing and assuming the judicial functions of the House of Lords. Devolution issues under the Scotland Act 1998, Government of Wales Act and Northern Ireland Act were also transferred to the new Supreme Court by the Constitutional Reform Act, from the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council.\n\nIn respect of Community Law the Supreme Court is subject to the decisions of the European Court of Justice. Since there can be no appeal from the Supreme Court, there is an interlocutory procedure by which the Supreme Court may refer to the European Court questions of European law which arise in cases before it, and obtain a definitive ruling before the Supreme Court gives its judgment.\n\nThe Supreme Court shares its members and accommodation at the Middlesex Guildhall in London with the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council which hears final appeals from certain smaller Commonwealth countries, admiralty cases, and certain appeals from the ecclesiastical courts and statutory private jurisdictions, such as professional and academic bodies.\n\n(The Constitutional Reform Act also renamed the \"Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland\" to the Court of Judicature, and the rarely cited \"Supreme Court of Judicature for England and Wales\" as the Senior Courts of England and Wales).\n\nThe Supreme Court was set up in 2009; until then the House of Lords was the ultimate court in addition to being a legislative body, and the Lord Chancellor, with legislative and executive functions, was also a senior judge in the House of Lords.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United States, established in 1789, is the highest Federal court in the United States, with powers of judicial review first asserted in \"Calder v. Bull\" (1798) in Justice Iredell's dissenting opinion. The power was later given binding authority by Justice Marshall in \"Marbury v. Madison\" (1803). There are currently nine seats on the US Supreme Court.\n\nEach U.S. state has a state supreme court, which is the highest authority interpreting that state's law and administering that state's judiciary. Two states, Oklahoma and Texas, each have two separate highest courts that respectively specialize in criminal cases and civil cases. Although Delaware has a specialized court, the Court of Chancery, to hear cases in equity, it is not a supreme court because the Delaware Supreme Court has appellate jurisdiction over it.\n\nThe titles of state supreme court vary, which can cause confusion between jurisdictions because one state may use a name for its highest court that another uses for a lower court. In New York, Maryland, and the District of Columbia the highest court is called the Court of Appeals, a name used by many states for their intermediate appellate courts. Further, trial courts of general jurisdiction in New York are called the Supreme Court, and the intermediate appellate court is called the Supreme Court, Appellate Division. In West Virginia, the highest court of the state is the Supreme Court of Appeals. In Maine and Massachusetts the highest court is styled the \"Supreme Judicial Court\"; the last is the oldest appellate court of continuous operation in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe Roman law and the Corpus Juris Civilis are generally held to be the historical model for civil law. From the late 18th century onwards, civil law jurisdictions began to codify their laws, most of all in civil codes.\n\nIn Austria, the Austrian Constitution of 1920 (based on a draft by Hans Kelsen) introduced judicial review of legislative acts for their constitutionality. This function is performed by the Constitutional Court (\"Verfassungsgerichtshof\"), which is also charged with the review of administrative acts on whether they violate constitutionally guaranteed rights.\nOther than that, administrative acts are reviewed by the Administrative Court (\"Verwaltungsgerichtshof\"). The Supreme Court (\"Oberste Gerichtshof (OGH)\"), stands at the top of Austria's system of \"ordinary courts\" (\"ordentliche Gerichte\") as the final instance in issues of private law and criminal law.\n\nIn Brazil, the Supreme Federal Tribunal (\"Supremo Tribunal Federal\") is the highest court. It is both the constitutional court and the court of last resort in Brazilian law. It only reviews cases that may be unconstitutional or final \"habeas corpus\" pleads for criminal cases. It also judges, in original jurisdiction, cases involving members of congress, senators, ministers of state, members of the high courts and the President and Vice-President of the Republic. The Superior Court of Justice (\"Tribunal Superior de Justiça\") reviews State and Federal Circuit courts decisions for civil law and criminal law cases, when dealing with federal law or conflicting rulings. The Superior Labour Tribunal (\"Tribunal Superior do Trabalho\") reviews cases involving labour law. The Superior Electoral Tribunal (\"Tribunal Superior Eleitoral\") is the court of last resort of electoral law, and also oversees general elections. The Superior Military Tribunal (\"Tribunal Superior Militar\") is the highest court in matters of federal military law.\n\nIn Croatia, the supreme jurisdiction is given to the Supreme Court, which secures a uniform application of laws. The Constitutional Court exists to verify constitutionality of laws and regulations, as well as decide on individual complaints on decisions on governmental bodies. It also decides on jurisdictional disputes between the legislative, executive and judicial branches.\n\nIn Denmark, all ordinary courts have original jurisdiction to hear all types of cases, including cases of a constitutional or administrative nature. As a result, there exists no special constitutional court, and therefore final jurisdiction is vested with the Danish Supreme Court (\"Højesteret\") which was established 14 February 1661 by king Frederik III.\n\nIn France, supreme appellate jurisdiction is divided among three judicial bodies:\n\nWhen there is jurisdictional dispute between judicial and administrative courts: the Court of Arbitration (\"Tribunal des conflits\"), which is empanelled half from the Court of Cassation and half from the Council of State and presided over by the Minister of Justice, is called together to settle the dispute or hand down a final decision.\n\nThe High Court (\"Haute Cour\") exists only to impeach the President of the French Republic in case of \"breach of his duties patently incompatible with his continuing in office\". Since a constitutional amendment of 2007, the French Constitution states that the High Court is composed of all members of both Houses of Parliament. As of 2012, it has never been convened.\n\nIn Germany, there is no \"de jure\" single supreme court. Instead, cases are handled by numerous federal courts, depending on their nature.\n\nFinal interpretation of the German Constitution, the \"Grundgesetz\", is the task of the \"Bundesverfassungsgericht\" (Federal Constitutional Court), which is the \"de facto\" highest German court, as it can declare both federal and state legislation ineffective, and has the power to overrule decisions of all other federal courts, despite not being a regular court of appeals on itself in the German court system. It is also the only court possessing the power and authority to outlaw political parties, if it is deemed that these parties have repeatedly violated articles of the Constitution.\n\nWhen it comes to civil and criminal cases, the \"Bundesgerichtshof\" (Federal Court of Justice) is at the top of the hierarchy of courts. The other branches of the German judicial system each have their own appellate systems, each topped by a high court; these are the \"Bundessozialgericht\" (Federal Social Court) for matters of social security, the \"Bundesarbeitsgericht\" (Federal Labour Court) for employment and labour, the \"Bundesfinanzhof\" (Federal Fiscal Court) for taxation and financial issues, and the \"Bundesverwaltungsgericht\" (Federal Administrative Court) for administrative law. The so-called \"Gemeinsamer Senat der Obersten Gerichtshöfe\" (Joint Senate of the Supreme Courts) is not a supreme court in itself, but an ad-hoc body that is convened in only when one supreme court intends to diverge from another supreme court's legal opinion or when a certain case exceeds the authority of one court. As the courts have well-defined areas of responsibility, situations like these are rather rare and so, the Joint Senate gathers very infrequently, and only to consider matters which are mostly definitory.\n\nIn the Netherlands, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands is the highest court. Its decisions, known as \"arresten\", are absolutely final. The court is banned from testing legislation against the constitution, pursuant to the principle of the sovereignty of the States-General; the court can, however, test legislation against some treaties. Also, the ordinary courts in the Netherlands, including the Hoge Raad, do not deal with administrative law, which is dealt with in separate administrative courts, the highest of which is the Council of State (Raad van State)\n\nThe Supreme Court of Iceland (, lit. \"Highest Court of Iceland\") was founded under Act No. 22/1919 and held its first session on 16 February 1920. The Court holds the highest judicial power in Iceland, where the court system has two levels.\n\nThe Supreme Court of India, also known colloquially as the 'apex court', is the highest judicial body in the Republic of India. Any decision taken by it is final and binding, and can only be modified in some cases (death sentence, etc.) by the President of India. It has several jurisdiction like \n1. Original\n2.Appellate \n3. Advisory\n\nIt is also known as court of records, i. e. all judgements are recorded and printed. These are cited in lower courts as case - law in various cases.\n\nItaly follows the French system of different supreme courts.\n\nThe Italian court of last resort for most disputes is the \"Corte Suprema di Cassazione\". There is also a separate constitutional court, the \"Corte costituzionale\", which has a duty of judicial review, and which can strike down legislation as being in conflict with the Constitution.\n\nIn Japan, the Supreme Court of Japan is called (Saikō-Saibansho; called 最高裁 Saikō-Sai for short), located in Chiyoda, Tokyo, and is the highest court in Japan. It has ultimate judicial authority within Japan to interpret the Constitution and decide questions of national law (including local by laws). It has the power of judicial review (i.e., it can declare Acts of Diet and Local Assembly, and administrative actions, unconstitutional).\n\nIn Luxembourg, challenges on the conformity of the law to the Constitution are brought before the \"Cour Constitutionnelle\" (Constitutional Court). — The most used and common procedure to present these challenges is by way of the \"\"question préjudicielle\"\" (prejudicial question). The Court of last resort for civil and criminal proceedings is the \"\"Cour de Cassation\"\".\nFor administrative proceedings the highest court is the \"\"Cour Administrative\"\" (Administrative Court).\n\nThe supreme court of Macau is the Court of Final Appeal (; ).\n\nWhile the Philippines is generally considered a civil law nation, its Supreme Court is heavily modelled after the American Supreme Court. This can be attributed to the fact that the Philippines was colonized by both Spain and the United States, and the system of laws of both nations strongly influenced the development of Philippine laws and jurisprudence. Even as the body of Philippine laws remain mostly codified, the Philippine Civil Code expressly recognizes that decisions of the Supreme Court \"form part of the law of the land\", belonging to the same class as statutes. The 1987 Philippine Constitution also explicitly grants to the Supreme Court the power of judicial review over laws and executive actions. The Supreme Court is composed of 1 Chief Justice and 14 Associate Justices. The court sits either en banc or in divisions, depending on the nature of the case to be decided.\n\nIn the judicial system of mainland China the highest court of appeal is the Supreme People's Court. This supervises the administration of justice by all subordinate \"local\" and \"special\" people's courts, and is the court of last resort for the whole People's Republic of China except for Macau and Hong Kong\n\nIn Portugal, there are several supreme courts, each with a specific jurisdiction:\n\nUntil 2003, a fifth supreme court also existed for the military jurisdiction, this being the Supreme Military Court (\"Supremo Tribunal Militar\"). Presently, in time of peace, the supreme court for military justice matters is the Supreme Court of Justice, which now includes four military judges.\n\nIn the Republic of China (Taiwan), there are three different courts of last resort:\n\nThe Council of Grand Justices, consisting of 15 justices and mainly dealing with constitutional issues, is the counterpart of constitutional courts in some countries.\n\nAll three courts are directly under the Judicial Yuan, whose president also serves as Chief Justice in the Council of Grand Justices.\n\nFounded by papal bull in 1532, the Court of Session is the supreme civil court of Scotland, and the High Court of Justiciary is the supreme criminal court. However, the absolute highest court (excluding criminal matters) is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.\n\nSpanish Supreme Court is the highest court for all cases in Spain (both private and public). Only those cases related to human rights can be appealed at the Constitutional Court (which also decides about acts accordance with Spanish Constitution). \nIn Spain, high courts cannot create binding precedents; however, lower rank courts usually observe Supreme Court interpretations. In most private law cases, two Supreme Court judgements supporting a claim are needed to appeal at the Supreme Court.\nFive sections form the Spanish Supreme court:\n\nIn Sweden, the Supreme Court and the Supreme Administrative Court respectively function as the highest courts of the land. The Supreme Administrative Court considers cases concerning disputes between individuals and administrative organs, as well as disputes among administrative organs, while the Supreme Court considers all other cases. The judges are appointed by the Government. In most cases, the Supreme Courts will only grant leave to appeal a case (\"prövningstillstånd\") if the case involves setting a precedent in the interpretation of the law. Exceptions are issues where the Supreme Court is the court of first instance. Such cases include an application for a retrial of a criminal case in the light of new evidence, and prosecutions made against an incumbent minister of the Government for severe neglect of duty. If a lower court has to try a case which involves a question where there is no settled interpretation of the law, it can also refer the question to the relevant Supreme Court for an answer.\n\nIn Switzerland, the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland is the final court of appeals. Due to Switzerland's system of direct democracy, it has no authority to review the constitutionality of federal statutes, but the people can strike down a proposed law by referendum. According to settled case law, however, the Court is authorised to review the compliance of all Swiss law with certain categories of international law, especially the European Convention of Human Rights.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka was created in 1972 after the adoption of a new Constitution. The Supreme Court is the highest and final superior court of record and is empowered to exercise its powers, subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The court rulings take precedence over all lower Courts. The Sri Lanka judicial system is complex blend of both common-law and civil-law. In some cases such as capital punishment, the decision may be passed on to the President of the Republic for clemency petitions. However, when there is 2/3 majority in the parliament in favour of president (as with present), the supreme court and its judges' powers become nullified as they could be fired from their positions according to the Constitution, if the president wants. Therefore, in such situations, Civil law empowerment vanishes.\n\nIn South Africa, a \"two apex\" system existed from 1994 to 2013. The Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) was created in 1994 and replaced the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of South Africa as the highest court of appeal in non-constitutional matters. The SCA is subordinate to the Constitutional Court, which is the highest court in matters involving the interpretation and application of the Constitution. But in August 2013 the Constitution was amended to make the Constitutional Court the country's single apex court, superior to the SCA in all matters, both constitutional and non-constitutional.\n\nHistorically, citizens appealed directly to the King along his route to places out of the Palace. A Thai King would adjudicate all disputes. During the reign of King Chulalongkorn, an official department for appeals was set up, and, after Thailand adopted a western-styled government, Thai Supreme Court was established in 1891.\n\nAt present, the Supreme Court of Thailand retains the important status as the highest court of justice in the country. Operating separately from the Administrative Court and the Constitutional Court, the judgement of the Supreme Court is considered as final.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, the Federal Supreme Court of the United Arab Emirates was created in 1973 after the adoption of the Constitution. The Supreme Court is the highest and final superior court of record and is empowered to exercise its powers, subject to the provisions of the Constitution. The court rulings take precedence over all lower Courts. The Emirati judicial system is complex blend of both Islamic law and civil law. In some cases such as capital punishment, the decision may be passed on to the President of the country (currently Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan).\n\n\nLaw of Indonesia at the national level is based on a combination of civil law from the tradition of Roman-Dutch law and customary law from the tradition of Adat. Law in regional jurisdictions can vary from province to province, including even Sharia law, for example Islamic criminal law in Aceh, though even at the national level, individual justices can cite sharia or other forms of non-Dutch law in their legal opinions.\n\nThe Supreme Court of Indonesia is the main judicial arm of the state, functioning as the final court of appeal as well as a means to re-open cases previously closed. The Supreme Court, which consists of a total of 51 justices, also oversees the regional high courts. It was founded at the country's independence in 1945.\n\nThe Constitutional Court of Indonesia, on the other hand, is a part of the judicial branch tasked with review of bills and government actions for constitutionality, as well as regulation of the interactions between various arms of the state. The constitutional amendment to establish the court was passed in 2001, and the court itself was established in 2003. The Constitutional Court consists of nine justices serving nine year terms, and they're appointed in tandem by the Supreme Court, the President of Indonesia and the People's Representative Council.\n\nIn most nations with constitutions modelled after the Soviet Union, the legislature was given the power of being the \"court of last resort\". In the People's Republic of China, the final power to interpret the law is vested in the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPCSC). This power includes the power to interpret the basic laws of Hong Kong and Macau, the constitutional documents of the two special administrative regions which are common law and Portuguese-based legal system jurisdictions respectively. This power is a legislative power and not a judicial one in that an interpretation by the NPCSC does not affect cases which have already been decided.\n\n",
                "Precedent\n\nIn legal systems based on common law, a precedent, or authority, is a principle or rule established in a previous legal case that is either binding on or persuasive for a court or other tribunal when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or facts . Common law legal systems place great value on deciding cases according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar and predictable outcomes, and observance of precedent is the mechanism by which that goal is attained. The principle by which judges are bound to precedents is known as stare decisis. Black's Law Dictionary defines \"precedent\" as a \"rule of law established for the first time by a court for a particular type of case and thereafter referred to in deciding similar cases\". Common law precedent is a third kind of law, on equal footing with statutory law (statutes and codes enacted by legislative bodies), and delegated legislation (in U.K. parlance) or regulatory law (in U.S. parlance) (regulations promulgated by executive branch agencies).\n\nCase law, in common law jurisdictions, is the set of decisions of adjudicatory tribunals or other rulings that can be cited as precedent. In most countries, including most European countries, the term is applied to any set of rulings on law which is guided by previous rulings, for example, previous decisions of a government agency.\n\nEssential to the development of case law is the publication and indexing of decisions for use by lawyers, courts and the general public, in the form of law reports. While all decisions are precedent (though at varying levels of authority as discussed throughout this article), some become \"leading cases\" or \"landmark decisions\" that are cited especially often.\n\n\"Stare decisis\" (Anglo-Latin pronunciation: ) is a legal principle by which judges are obligated to respect the precedent established by prior decisions. The words originate from the phrasing of the principle in the Latin maxim Stare decisis et non quieta movere: \"to stand by decisions and not disturb the undisturbed\". In a legal context, this is understood to mean that courts should generally abide by precedent and not disturb settled matters. The principle of \"stare decisis\" can be divided into two components.\n\nThe first is the rule that a decision made by a superior court, or by the same court in an earlier decision, is binding precedent that the court itself and all its inferior courts are obligated to follow. The second is the principle that a court should not overturn its own precedent unless there is a strong reason to do so and should be guided by principles from lateral and inferior courts. The second principle, regarding persuasive precedent, is an advisory one that courts can and do ignore occasionally.\n\nIn the common law tradition, courts decide the law applicable to a case by interpreting statutes and applying precedent which record how and why prior cases have been decided. Unlike most civil law systems, common law systems follow the doctrine of \"stare decisis\", by which most courts are bound by their own previous decisions in similar cases, and all lower courts should make decisions consistent with previous decisions of higher courts. For example, in England, the High Court and the Court of Appeal are each bound by their own previous decisions, but the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom is able to deviate from its earlier decisions, although in practice it rarely does so.\n\nGenerally speaking, higher courts do not have direct oversight over day-to-day proceedings in lower courts, in that they cannot reach out on their own initiative (\"sua sponte\") at any time to reverse or overrule judgments of the lower courts. Normally, the burden rests with litigants to appeal rulings (including those in clear violation of established case law) to the higher courts. If a judge acts against precedent and the case is not appealed, the decision will stand.\n\nA lower court may not rule against a binding precedent, even if the lower court feels that the precedent is unjust; the lower court may only express the hope that a higher court or the legislature will reform the rule in question. If the court believes that developments or trends in legal reasoning render the precedent unhelpful, and wishes to evade it and help the law evolve, the court may either hold that the precedent is inconsistent with subsequent authority, or that the precedent should be \"distinguished\" by some material difference between the facts of the cases. If that judgment goes to appeal, the appellate court will have the opportunity to review both the precedent and the case under appeal, perhaps overruling the previous case law by setting a new precedent of higher authority. This may happen several times as the case works its way through successive appeals. Lord Denning, first of the High Court of Justice, later of the Court of Appeal, provided a famous example of this evolutionary process in his development of the concept of estoppel starting in the \"High Trees\" case: \"Central London Property Trust Ltd v. High Trees House Ltd\" [1947] K.B. 130.\n\nJudges may refer to various types of persuasive authority to reach a decision in a case. Widely cited non-binding sources include legal encyclopedias such as \"Corpus Juris Secundum\" and \"Halsbury's Laws of England\", or the published work of the Law Commission or the American Law Institute. Some bodies are given statutory powers to issue Guidance with persuasive authority or similar statutory effect, such as the Highway Code.\n\nIn federal or multi-jurisdictional law systems there may exist conflicts between the various lower appellate courts. Sometimes these differences may not be resolved and it may be necessary to distinguish how the law is applied in one district, province, division or appellate department. Usually only an appeal accepted by the court of last resort will resolve such differences and, for many reasons, such appeals are often not granted.\n\nAny court may seek to distinguish its present case from that of a binding precedent, in order to reach a different conclusion. The validity of such a distinction may or may not be accepted on appeal. An appellate court may also propound an entirely new and different analysis from that of junior courts, and may or may not be bound by its own previous decisions, or in any case may distinguish the decisions based on significant differences in the facts applicable to each case. Or, a court may view the matter before it as one of \"first impression,\" not governed by any controlling precedent.\n\nWhere there are several members of a court, there may be one or more judgments given; only the ratio decidendi of the majority can constitute a binding precedent, but all may be cited as persuasive, or their reasoning may be adopted in argument. Quite apart from the rules of precedent, the weight actually given to any reported judgment may depend on the reputation of both the court and the judges.\n\nGenerally, a common law court system has trial courts, intermediate appellate courts and a supreme court. The inferior courts conduct almost all trial proceedings. The inferior courts are bound to obey precedent established by the appellate court for their jurisdiction, and all supreme court precedent.\n\nThe Supreme Court of California's explanation of this principle is that\n\nAn Intermediate state appellate court is generally bound to follow the decisions of the highest court of that state.\n\nThe application of the doctrine of \"stare decisis\" from a superior court to an inferior court is sometimes called \"vertical stare decisis\".\n\nThe idea that a judge is bound by (or at least should respect) decisions of earlier judges of similar or coordinate level is called horizontal \"stare decisis\".\n\nIn the United States federal court system, the intermediate appellate courts are divided into thirteen \"circuits,\" each covering some range of territory ranging in size from the District of Columbia alone up to seven states. Each panel of judges on the court of appeals for a circuit is bound to obey the prior appellate decisions of the same circuit. Precedent of a United States court of appeals may be overruled only by the court \"en banc,\" that is, a session of all the active appellate judges of the circuit, or by the United States Supreme Court, not simply by a different three-judge panel.\n\nWhen a court binds itself, this application of the doctrine of precedent is sometimes called \"horizontal stare decisis\". The state of New York has a similar appellate structure as it is divided into four appellate departments supervised by the final New York Court of Appeals. Decisions of one appellate department are not binding upon another, and in some cases the departments differ considerably on interpretations of law.\n\nIn federal systems the division between federal and state law may result in complex interactions. In the United States, state courts are not considered inferior to federal courts but rather constitute a parallel court system.\n\n\nIn practice, however, judges in one system will almost always choose to follow relevant case law in the other system to prevent divergent results and to minimize forum shopping.\n\nPrecedent that must be applied or followed is known as \"binding precedent\" (alternately \"metaphorically precedent\", \"mandatory\" or \"binding authority\", etc.). Under the doctrine of \"stare decisis\", a lower court must honor findings of law made by a higher court that is within the appeals path of cases the court hears. In state and federal courts in the United States of America, jurisdiction is often divided geographically among local trial courts, several of which fall under the territory of a regional appeals court. All appellate courts fall under a highest court (sometimes but not always called a \"supreme court\"). By definition, decisions of lower courts are not binding on courts higher in the system, nor are appeals court decisions binding on local courts that fall under a different appeals court. Further, courts must follow their own proclamations of law made earlier on other cases, and honor rulings made by other courts in disputes among the parties before them pertaining to the same pattern of facts or events, unless they have a strong reason to change these rulings (see Law of the case re: a court's previous holding being binding precedent for that court).\n\nIn law, a binding precedent (also known as a mandatory precedent or binding authority) is a precedent which must be followed by all lower courts under common law legal systems. In English law it is usually created by the decision of a higher court, such as the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, which took over the judicial functions of the House of Lords in 2009. In Civil law and pluralist systems precedent is not binding but case law is taken into account by the courts.\n\nBinding precedent relies on the legal principle of \"stare decisis\". \"Stare decisis\" means to stand by things decided. It ensures certainty and consistency in the application of law. Existing binding precedent from past cases are applied in principle to new situations by analogy.\n\nOne law professor has described mandatory precedent as follows:\n\nIn extraordinary circumstances a higher court may overturn or overrule mandatory precedent, but will often attempt to distinguish the precedent before overturning it, thereby limiting the scope of the precedent.\n\nUnder the U.S. legal system, courts are set up in a hierarchy. At the top of the federal or national system is the Supreme Court, and underneath are lower federal courts. The state court systems have hierarchy structures similar to that of the federal system.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has final authority on questions about the meaning of federal law, including the U.S. Constitution. For example, when the Supreme Court says that the First Amendment applies in a specific way to suits for slander, then every court is bound by that precedent in its interpretation of the First Amendment as it applies to suits for slander. If a lower court judge disagrees with a higher court precedent on what the First Amendment should mean, the lower court judge must rule according to the binding precedent. Until the higher court changes the ruling (or the law itself is changed), the binding precedent is authoritative on the meaning of the law.\n\nLower courts are bound by the precedent set by higher courts within their region. Thus, a federal district court that falls within the geographic boundaries of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals (the mid-level appeals court that hears appeals from district court decisions from Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the Virgin Islands) is bound by rulings of the Third Circuit Court, but not by rulings in the Ninth Circuit (Alaska, Arizona, California, Guam, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Northern Mariana Islands, Oregon, and Washington), since the Circuit Courts of Appeals have jurisdiction defined by geography. The Circuit Courts of Appeals can interpret the law how they want, so long as there is no binding Supreme Court precedent. One of the common reasons the Supreme Court grants certiorari (that is, they agree to hear a case) is if there is a conflict among the circuit courts as to the meaning of a federal law.\n\nThere are three elements needed for a precedent to work. Firstly, the hierarchy of the courts needs to be accepted, and an efficient system of law reporting. 'A balance must be struck between the need on one side for the legal certainty resulting from the binding effect of previous decisions, and on the other side the avoidance of undue restriction on the proper development of the law (1966 Practice Statement (Judicial Precedent) by Lord Gardiner L.C.)'.\n\nJudges are bound by the law of binding precedent in England and Wales and other common law jurisdictions. This is a distinctive feature of the English legal system. In Scotland and many countries throughout the world, particularly in mainland Europe, civil law means that judges take case law into account in a similar way, but are not obliged to do so and are required to consider the precedent in terms of principle. Their fellow judges' decisions may be persuasive but are not binding. Under the English legal system, judges are not necessarily entitled to make their own decisions about the development or interpretations of the law. They may be bound by a decision reached in a previous case. Two facts are crucial to determining whether a precedent is binding:\n\n\"Super \"stare decisis\"\" is a term used for important precedent that is resistant or immune from being overturned, without regard to whether correctly decided in the first place. It may be viewed as one extreme in a range of precedential power, or alternatively, to express a belief, or a critique of that belief, that some decisions should not be overturned.\n\nIn 1976, Richard Posner and William Landes coined the term \"super-precedent,\" in an article they wrote about testing theories of precedent by counting citations. Posner and Landes used this term to describe the influential effect of a cited decision. The term \"super-precedent\" later became associated with different issue: the difficulty of overturning a decision. In 1992, Rutgers professor Earl Maltz criticized the Supreme Court's decision in \"Planned Parenthood v. Casey\" for endorsing the idea that if one side can take control of the Court on an issue of major national importance (as in \"Roe v. Wade\"), that side can protect its position from being reversed \"by a kind of super-stare decisis\". The controversial idea that some decisions are virtually immune from being overturned, regardless of whether they were decided correctly in the first place, is the idea to which the term \"super \"stare decisis\"\" now usually refers.\n\nThe concept of super-\"stare decisis\" (or \"super-precedent\") was mentioned during the interrogations of Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Samuel Alito before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Prior to the commencement of the Roberts hearings, the chair of that committee, Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, wrote an op/ed in the \"New York Times\" referring to \"Roe\" as a \"super-precedent\". He revisited this concept during the hearings, but neither Roberts nor Alito endorsed the term or the concept.\n\nPersuasive precedent (also persuasive authority) is precedent or other legal writing that is not binding precedent but that is useful or relevant and that may guide the judge in making the decision in a current case. Persuasive precedent includes cases decided by lower courts, by peer or higher courts from other geographic jurisdictions, cases made in other parallel systems (for example, military courts, administrative courts, indigenous/tribal courts, state courts versus federal courts in the United States), statements made in dicta, treatises or academic law reviews, and in some exceptional circumstances, cases of other nations, treaties, world judicial bodies, etc.\n\nIn a \"case of first impression\", courts often rely on persuasive precedent from courts in other jurisdictions that have previously dealt with similar issues. Persuasive precedent may become binding through its adoption by a higher court.\n\nIn civil law and pluralist systems, as under Scots law, precedent is not binding but case law is taken into account by the courts.\n\nA lower court's opinion may be considered as persuasive authority if the judge believes they have applied the correct legal principle and reasoning.\n\nA court may consider the ruling of a higher court that is not binding. For example, a district court in the United States First Circuit could consider a ruling made by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit as persuasive authority.\n\nCourts may consider rulings made in other courts that are of equivalent authority in the legal system. For example, an appellate court for one district could consider a ruling issued by an appeals court in another district.\n\nCourts may consider \"obiter dicta\" in opinions of higher courts. Dicta of a higher court, though not binding, will often be persuasive to lower courts. The phrase \"obiter dicta\" is usually translated as \"other things said\", but due to the high number of judges and individual concurring opinions, it is often hard to distinguish from the \"ratio decidendi\" (reason for the decision). For these reasons, the obiter dicta may often be taken into consideration by a court. A litigant may also consider \"obiter dicta\" if a court has previously signaled that a particular legal argument is weak and may even warrant sanctions if repeated.\n\nA case decided by a multi-judge panel could result in a split decision. While only the majority opinion is considered precedential, an outvoted judge can still publish a dissenting opinion. Common patterns for dissenting opinions include:\nA judge in a subsequent case, particularly in a different jurisdiction, could find the dissenting judge's reasoning persuasive. In the jurisdiction of the original decision, however, a judge should only overturn the holding of a court lower or equivalent in the hierarchy. A district court, for example, could not rely on a Supreme Court dissent as a basis to depart from the reasoning of the majority opinion. However, lower courts occasionally cite dissents, either for a limiting principle on the majority, or for propositions that are not stated in the majority opinion and not inconsistent with that majority, or to explain a disagreement with the majority and to urge reform (while following the majority in the outcome).\n\nCourts may consider the writings of eminent legal scholars in treatises, restatements of the law, and law reviews. The extent to which judges find these types of writings persuasive will vary widely with elements such as the reputation of the author and the relevance of the argument.\n\nThe courts of England and Wales are free to consider decisions of other jurisdictions, and give them whatever persuasive weight the English court sees fit, even though these other decisions are not binding precedent. Jurisdictions that are closer to modern English common law are more likely to be given persuasive weight (for example Commonwealth states such as Canada, Australia, or New Zealand). Persuasive weight might be given to other common law courts, such as from the United States, most often where the American courts have been particularly innovative, e.g. in product liability and certain areas of contract law.\n\nIn the United States, in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the concept of a U.S. court considering foreign law or precedent has been considered controversial by some parties. The Supreme Court splits on this issue. This critique is recent, as in the early history of the United States, citation of English authority was ubiquitous. One of the first acts of many of the new state legislatures was to adopt the body of English common law into the law of the state. See here. Citation to English cases was common through the 19th and well into the 20th centuries. Even in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, it is relatively uncontroversial for American state courts to rely on English decisions for matters of pure common (i.e. judge-made) law. \n\nWithin the federal legal systems of several common-law countries, and most especially the United States, it is relatively common for the distinct lower-level judicial systems (e.g. state courts in the United States and Australia, provincial courts in Canada) to regard the decisions of other jurisdictions within the same country as persuasive precedent. Particularly in the United States, the adoption of a legal doctrine by a large number of other state judiciaries is regarded as highly persuasive evidence that such doctrine is preferred. A good example is the adoption in Tennessee of comparative negligence (replacing contributory negligence as a complete bar to recovery) by the 1992 Tennessee Supreme Court decision \"McIntyre v. Balentine\" (by this point all US jurisdictions save Tennessee, five other states, and the District of Columbia had adopted comparative negligence schemes). Moreover, in American law, the \"Erie\" doctrine requires federal courts sitting in diversity actions to apply state substantive law, but in a manner consistent with how the court believes the state's highest court would rule in that case. Since such decisions are not binding on state courts, but are often very well-reasoned and useful, state courts cite federal interpretations of state law fairly often as persuasive precedent, although it is also fairly common for a state high court to reject a federal court's interpretation of its jurisprudence.\n\nNon-publication of opinions, or unpublished opinions, are those decisions of courts that are not available for citation as precedent because the judges making the opinion deem the case as having less precedential value. Selective publication is the legal process which a judge or justices of a court decide whether a decision is to be or not published in a reporter. \"Unpublished\" federal appellate decisions are published in the Federal Appendix. Depublication is the power of a court to make a previously published order or opinion unpublished.\n\nLitigation that is settled out of court generates no written decision, and thus has no precedential effect. As one practical effect, the U.S. Department of Justice settles many cases against the federal government simply to avoid creating adverse precedent.\n\nSeveral rules may cause a decision to apply as narrow \"precedent\" to preclude future legal positions of the specific parties to a case, even if a decision is non-precedential with respect to all other parties.\n\nOnce a case is decided, the same plaintiff cannot sue the same defendant again on any claim arising out of the same facts. The law requires plaintiffs to put all issues on the table in a single case, not split the case. For example, in a case of an auto accident, the plaintiff cannot sue first for property damage, and then personal injury in a separate case. This is called \"res judicata\" or claim preclusion (\"'Res judicata'\" is the traditional name going back centuries; the name shifted to \"claim preclusion\" in the United States over the late 20th century). Claim preclusion applies whether the plaintiff wins or loses the earlier case, even if the later case raises a different legal theory, even the second claim is unknown at the time of the first case. Exceptions are extremely limited, for example if the two claims for relief must necessarily be brought in different courts (for example, one claim might be exclusively federal, and the other exclusively state).\n\nOnce a case is finally decided, any issues decided in the previous case may be binding against the party that lost the issue in later cases, even in cases involving other parties. For example, if a first case decides that a party was negligent, then other plaintiffs may rely on that earlier determination in later cases, and need not re-prove the issue of negligence. For another example, if a patent is shown to be invalid in a case against one accused infringer, that same patent is invalid against all other accused infringers—invalidity need not be re-proved. Again, there are limits and exceptions on this principle. The principle is called collateral estoppel or issue preclusion.\n\nWithin a single case, once there's been a first appeal, both the lower court and the appellate court itself will not further review the same issue, and will not re-review an issue that could have been appealed in the first appeal. Exceptions are limited to three \"exceptional circumstances:\" (1) when substantially different evidence is raised at a subsequent trial, (2) when the law changes after the first appeal, for example by a decision of a higher court, or (3) when a decision is clearly erroneous and would result in a manifest injustice. This principle is called \"law of the case\".\n\nOn many questions, reasonable people may differ. When two of those people are judges, the tension among two lines of precedent may be resolved as follows.\n\nIf the two courts are in separate, parallel jurisdictions, there is no conflict, and two lines of precedent may persist. Courts in one jurisdiction are influenced by decisions in others, and notably better rules may be adopted over time.\n\nCourts try to formulate the common law as a \"seamless web\" so that principles in one area of the law apply to other areas. However, this principle does not apply uniformly. Thus, a word may have different definitions in different areas of the law, or different rules may apply so that a question has different answers in different legal contexts. Judges try to minimize these conflicts, but they arise from time to time, and under principles of 'stare decisis', may persist for some time.\n\nA matter of first impression (known as \"primae impressionis\" in Latin) is a legal case in which there is no binding authority on the matter presented. Such a case can set forth a completely original issue of law for decision by the courts. A first impression case may be a first impression in only a particular jurisdiction. In that situation, courts will look to holdings of other jurisdictions for persuasive authority.\n\nIn the latter meaning, the case in question cannot be decided through referring to and/or relying on precedent. Since the legal issue under consideration has never been decided by an appeals court and, therefore, there is no precedent for the court to follow, the court uses analogies from prior rulings by appeals courts, refers to commentaries and articles by legal scholars, and applies its own logic. In cases of first impression, the trial judge will often ask both sides' attorneys for legal briefs.\n\nIn some situations, a case of first impression may exist in a jurisdiction until a reported appellate court decision is rendered.\n\nThe different roles of case law in civil law and common law traditions create differences in the way that courts render decisions. Common law courts generally explain in detail the legal rationale behind their decisions, with citations of both legislation and previous relevant judgments, and often an exegesis of the wider legal principles. These are called \"ratio decidendi\" and constitute a precedent binding on other courts; further analyses not strictly necessary to the determination of the current case are called \"obiter dicta\", which have persuasive authority but are not technically binding. By contrast, decisions in civil law jurisdictions are generally very short, referring only to statutes. The reason for this difference is that these civil law jurisdictions apply legislative positivism — a form of extreme legal positivism — which holds that legislation is the only valid source of law because it has been voted on democratically; thus, it is not the judiciary's role to create law, but rather to interpret and apply statute, and therefore their decisions must reflect that.\n\n\"Stare decisis\" is not usually a doctrine used in civil law systems, because it violates the legislative positivist principle that only the legislature may make law. Instead, the civil law system relies on the doctrine of \"jurisprudence constante\", according to which if a court has adjudicated a consistent line of cases that arrive at the same holdings using sound reasoning, then the previous decisions are highly persuasive but not controlling on issues of law. This doctrine is similar to \"stare decisis\" insofar as it dictates that a court's decision must condone a cohesive and predictable result. In theory, lower courts are generally not bound by the precedents of higher courts. In practice, the need for predictability means that lower courts generally defer to the precedent of higher courts. As a result, the precedent of courts of last resort, such as the French Cassation Court and the Council of State, is recognized as being \"de facto\" binding on lower courts.\n\nThe doctrine of \"jurisprudence constante\" also influences how court decisions are structured. In general, court decisions of common law jurisdictions give a sufficient \"ratio decidendi\" as to guide future courts. The ratio is used to justify a court decision on the basis of previous case law as well as to make it easier to use the decision as a precedent for future cases. By contrast, court decisions in some civil law jurisdictions (most prominently France) tend to be extremely brief, mentioning only the relevant legislation and codal provisions and not going into the \"ratio decidendi\" in any great detail. This is the result of the legislative positivist view that the court is only interpreting the legislature's intent and therefore detailed exposition is unnecessary. Because of this, \"ratio decidendi\" is carried out by legal academics (doctrinal writers) who provide the explanations that in common law jurisdictions would be provided by the judges themselves.\n\nIn other civil law jurisdictions, such as the German-speaking countries, \"ratio decidendi\" tend to be much more developed than in France, and courts will frequently cite previous cases and doctrinal writers. However, some courts (such as German courts) have less emphasis on the particular facts of the case than common law courts, but have more emphasis on the discussion of various doctrinal arguments and on finding what the correct interpretation of the law is.\n\nThe mixed systems of the Nordic countries are sometimes considered a branch of the civil law, but they are sometimes counted as separate from the civil law tradition. In Sweden, for instance, case law arguably plays a more important role than in some of the continental civil law systems. The two highest courts, the Supreme Court (\"Högsta domstolen\") and the Supreme Administrative Court (\"Högsta förvaltningsdomstolen\"), have the right to set precedent which has persuasive authority on all future application of the law. Appellate courts, be they judicial (\"hovrätter\") or administrative (\"kammarrätter\"), may also issue decisions that act as guides for the application of the law, but these decisions are persuasive, not controlling, and may therefore be overturned by higher courts.\n\nSome mixed systems, such as Scots law in Scotland, South-African law, and the law of Quebec and Louisiana, do not fit into the civil vs. common law dichotomy because they mix portions of both. Such systems may have been heavily influenced by the common law tradition; however, their private law is firmly rooted in the civil law tradition. Because of their position between the two main systems of law, these types of legal systems are sometimes referred to as \"mixed\" systems of law. Louisiana courts, for instance, operate under both \"stare decisis\" and \"jurisprudence constante\". In South Africa, the precedent of higher courts is absolutely or fully binding on lower courts, whereas the precedent of lower courts only has persuasive authority on higher courts; horizontally, precedent is \"prima facie\" or presumptively binding between courts.\n\nLaw professors in common law traditions play a much smaller role in developing case law than professors in civil law traditions. Because court decisions in civil law traditions are brief and not amenable to establishing precedent, much of the exposition of the law in civil law traditions is done by academics rather than by judges; this is called doctrine and may be published in treatises or in journals such as \"Recueil Dalloz\" in France. Historically, common law courts relied little on legal scholarship; thus, at the turn of the twentieth century, it was very rare to see an academic writer quoted in a legal decision (except perhaps for the academic writings of prominent judges such as Coke and Blackstone). Today academic writers are often cited in legal argument and decisions as persuasive authority; often, they are cited when judges are attempting to implement reasoning that other courts have not yet adopted, or when the judge believes the academic's restatement of the law is more compelling than can be found in precedent. Thus common law systems are adopting one of the approaches long common in civil law jurisdictions.\n\nJustice Louis Brandeis, in a heavily footnoted dissent to \"Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co.\", 285 U.S. 393, 405-411 (1932), explained (citations and quotations omitted):\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has stated:\n\nThe United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit has stated:\n\nJustice McHugh of the High Court of Australia in relation to precedents remarked in \"Perre v Apand\":\n\nPrecedent viewed against passing time can serve to establish trends, thus indicating the next logical step in evolving interpretations of the law. For instance, if immigration has become more and more restricted under the law, then the next legal decision on that subject may serve to restrict it further still. The existence of submerged precedent (reasoned opinions not made available through conventional legal research sources) has been identified as a potentially distorting force in the evolution of law.\n\nScholars have recently attempted to apply network theory to precedent in order to establish which precedent is most important or authoritative, and how the court's interpretations and priorities have changed over time.\n\nEarly English common law did not have or require the \"stare decisis\" doctrine for a range of legal and technological reasons:\n\nThese features changed over time, opening the door to the doctrine of \"stare decisis\":\n\n\"Stare decisis\" applies to the holding of a case, rather than to obiter dicta (\"things said by the way\"). As the United States Supreme Court has put it: \"dicta may be followed if sufficiently persuasive but are not binding.\"\n\nIn the United States Supreme Court, the principle of stare decisis is most flexible in constitutional cases:\n\nFor example, in the years 1946–1992, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed itself in about 130 cases. The U.S. Supreme Court has further explained as follows:\n\nThe United States Supreme Court has stated that where a court gives multiple reasons for a given result, each alternative reason that is \"explicitly\" labeled by the court as an \"independent\" ground for the decision is not treated as \"simply a dictum\".\n\nThe doctrine of binding precedent or \"stare decisis\" is basic to the English legal system. Special features of the English legal system include the following:\n\nThe British House of Lords, as the court of last appeal outside Scotland before it was replaced by the UK Supreme Court, was not strictly bound to always follow its own decisions until the case \"London Street Tramways v London County Council [1898] AC 375\". After this case, once the Lords had given a ruling on a point of law, the matter was closed unless and until Parliament made a change by statute. This is the most strict form of the doctrine of \"stare decisis\" (one not applied, previously, in common law jurisdictions, where there was somewhat greater flexibility for a court of last resort to review its own precedent).\n\nThis situation changed, however, after the issuance of the Practice Statement of 1966. It enabled the House of Lords to adapt English law to meet changing social conditions. In \"R v G & R\" 2003, the House of Lords overruled its decision in \"Caldwell\" 1981, which had allowed the Lords to establish mens rea (\"guilty mind\") by measuring a defendant's conduct against that of a \"reasonable person,\" regardless of the defendant's actual state of mind.\n\nHowever, the Practice Statement has been seldom applied by the House of Lords, usually only as a last resort. As of 2005, the House of Lords has rejected its past decisions no more than 20 times. They are reluctant to use it because they fear to introduce uncertainty into the law. In particular, the Practice Statement stated that the Lords would be especially reluctant to overrule themselves in criminal cases because of the importance of certainty of that law. The first case involving criminal law to be overruled with the Practice Statement was \"Anderton v Ryan\" (1985), which was overruled by \"R v Shivpuri\" (1986), two decades after the Practice Statement. Remarkably, the precedent overruled had been made only a year before, but it had been criticised by several academic lawyers. As a result, Lord Bridge stated he was \"undeterred by the consideration that the decision in \"Anderton v Ryan\" was so recent. The Practice Statement is an effective abandonment of our pretention to infallibility. If a serious error embodied in a decision of this House has distorted the law, the sooner it is corrected the better.\" Still, the House of Lords has remained reluctant to overrule itself in some cases; in \"R v Kansal\" (2002), the majority of House members adopted the opinion that \"R v Lambert\" had been wrongly decided and agreed to depart from their earlier decision.\n\nA precedent does not bind a court if it finds there was a lack of care in the original \"Per Incuriam\". For example, if a statutory provision or precedent had not been brought to the previous court's attention before its decision, the precedent would not be binding.\n\nOne of the most important roles of precedent is to resolve ambiguities in other legal texts, such as constitutions, statutes, and regulations. The process involves, first and foremost, consultation of the plain language of the text, as enlightened by the legislative history of enactment, subsequent precedent, and experience with various interpretations of similar texts.\n\nA judge's normal aids include access to all previous cases in which a precedent has been set, and a good English dictionary.\n\nJudges and barristers in the U.K use three primary rules for interpreting the law.\n\nUnder the literal rule, the judge should do what the actual legislation states rather than trying to do what the judge thinks that it means. The judge should use the plain everyday ordinary meaning of the words, even if this produces an unjust or undesirable outcome. A good example of problems with this method is \"R v Maginnis\" (1987), in which several judges in separate opinions found several different dictionary meanings of the word \"supply\". Another example is \"Fisher v Bell\", where it was held that a shopkeeper who placed an illegal item in a shop window with a price tag did not make an offer to sell it, because of the specific meaning of \"offer for sale\" in contract law. As a result of this case, Parliament amended the statute concerned to end this discrepancy.\n\nThe golden rule is used when use of the literal rule would obviously create an absurd result. The court must find genuine difficulties before it declines to use the literal rule. There are two ways in which the golden rule can be applied: the narrow method, and the broad method. Under the narrow method, when there are apparently two contradictory meanings to a word used in a legislative provision or it is ambiguous, the least absurd is to be used. For example, in \"Adler v George\" (1964), the defendant was found guilty under the Official Secrets Act of 1920. The act said it was an offence to obstruct HM Forces in the vicinity of a prohibited place. Adler argued that he was not in the \"vicinity\" of a prohibited place but was actually \"in\" a prohibited place. The court chose not to accept the wording literally. Under the broad method, the court may reinterpret the law at will when it is clear that there is only one way to read the statute. This occurred in \"Re Sigsworth\" (1935) where a man who murdered his mother was forbidden from inheriting her estate, despite a statute to the contrary.\n\nThe mischief rule is the most flexible of the interpretation methods. Stemming from \"Heydon's Case\" (1584), it allows the court to enforce what the statute is intended to remedy rather than what the words actually say. For example, in \"Corkery v Carpenter\" (1950), a man was found guilty of being drunk in charge of a carriage, although in fact he only had a bicycle.\n\nIn the United States, the courts have stated consistently that the text of the statute is read as it is written, using the ordinary meaning of the words of the statute.\n\nHowever, most legal texts have some lingering ambiguity—inevitably, situations arise in which the words chosen by the legislature do not address the precise facts in issue, or there is some tension among two or more statutes. In such cases, a court must analyze the various available sources, and reach a resolution of the ambiguity. The \"Canons of statutory construction\" are discussed in a separate article. Once the ambiguity is resolved, that resolution has binding effect as described in the rest of this article.\n\nAlthough inferior courts are bound in theory by superior court precedent, in practice a judge may believe that justice requires an outcome at some variance with precedent, and may distinguish the facts of the individual case on reasoning that does not appear in the binding precedent. On appeal, the appellate court may either adopt the new reasoning, or reverse on the basis of precedent. On the other hand, if the losing party does not appeal (typically because of the cost of the appeal), the lower court decision may remain in effect, at least as to the individual parties.\n\nOccasionally, a lower court judge explicitly states personal disagreement with the judgment he or she has rendered, but that he or she is required to do so by binding precedent. Note that inferior courts cannot evade binding precedent of superior courts, but a court can depart from its own prior decisions.\n\nIn the United States, \"stare decisis\" can interact in counterintuitive ways with the federal and state court systems. On an issue of federal law, a state court is not bound by an interpretation of federal law at the district or circuit level, but is bound by an interpretation by the United States Supreme Court. On an interpretation of state law, whether common law or statutory law, the federal courts are bound by the interpretation of a state court of last resort, and are required normally to defer to the precedent of intermediate state courts as well.\n\nCourts may choose to obey precedent of international jurisdictions, but this is not an application of the doctrine of \"stare decisis\", because foreign decisions are not binding. Rather, a foreign decision that is obeyed on the basis of the soundness of its reasoning will be called \"persuasive authority\" — indicating that its effect is limited to the persuasiveness of the reasons it provides.\n\nOriginalism is an approach to interpretation of a legal text in which controlling weight is given to the intent of the original authors (at least the intent as inferred by a modern judge). In contrast, a non-originalist looks at other cues to meaning, including the current meaning of the words, the pattern and trend of other judicial decisions, changing context and improved scientific understanding, observation of practical outcomes and \"what works,\" contemporary standards of justice, and \"stare decisis\". Both are directed at \"interpreting\" the text, not changing it—interpretation is the process of resolving ambiguity and choosing from among possible meanings, not changing the text.\n\nThe two approaches look at different sets of underlying facts that may or may not point in the same direction--\"stare decisis\" gives most weight to the newest understanding of a legal text, while originalism gives most weight to the oldest. While they don't necessarily reach different results in every case, the two approaches are in direct tension. Originalists such as Justice Antonin Scalia argue that \"\"Stare decisis\" is not usually a doctrine used in civil law systems, because it violates the principle that only the legislature may make law.\" Justice Scalia argues that America is a civil law nation, not a common law nation. By principle, originalists are generally unwilling to defer to precedent when precedent seems to come into conflict with the originalist's own interpretation of the Constitutional text or inferences of original intent (even in situations where there is no original source statement of that original intent). However, there is still room within an originalist paradigm for \"stare decisis\"; whenever the plain meaning of the text has alternative constructions, past precedent is generally considered a valid guide, with the qualifier being that it cannot change what the text actually says.\n\nOriginalists vary in the degree to which they defer to precedent. In his confirmation hearings, Justice Clarence Thomas answered a question from Senator Strom Thurmond, qualifying his willingness to change precedent in this way:\n\nPossibly he has changed his mind, or there are a very large body of cases which merit \"the additional step\" of ignoring the doctrine; according to Scalia, \"Clarence Thomas doesn't believe in stare decisis, period. If a constitutional line of authority is wrong, he would say, let's get it right.\"\n\nProfessor Caleb Nelson, a former clerk for Justice Thomas and law professor at the University of Virginia, has elaborated on the role of \"stare decisis\" in originalist jurisprudence:\n\nThere are disadvantages and advantages of binding precedent, as noted by scholars and jurists.\n\nIn a 1997 book, attorney Michael Trotter blamed over-reliance by American lawyers on binding and persuasive authority, rather than the merits of the case at hand, as a major factor behind the escalation of legal costs during the 20th century. He argued that courts should ban the citation of persuasive precedent from outside their jurisdiction, with two exceptions:\n\nThe disadvantages of \"stare decisis\" include its rigidity, the complexity of learning law, the differences between some cases may be very small and appear illogical, and the slow growth or incremental changes to the law that are in need of major overhaul.\n\nAn argument often used against the system is that it is undemocratic as it allows judges, which may or may not be elected, to make law.\n\nRegarding constitutional interpretations, there is concern that over-reliance on the doctrine of \"stare decisis\" can be subversive. An erroneous precedent may at first be only slightly inconsistent with the Constitution, and then this error in interpretation can be propagated and increased by further precedent until a result is obtained that is greatly different from the original understanding of the Constitution. \"Stare decisis\" is not mandated by the Constitution, and if it causes unconstitutional results then the historical evidence of original understanding can be re-examined. In this opinion, predictable fidelity to the Constitution is more important than fidelity to unconstitutional precedent. See also the living tree doctrine.\n\nA counter-argument (in favor of the advantages of \"stare decisis\") is that if the legislature wishes to alter the case law (other than constitutional interpretations) by statute, the legislature is empowered to do so. Critics sometimes accuse particular judges of applying the doctrine selectively, invoking it to support precedent that the judge supported anyway, but ignoring it in order to change precedent with which the judge disagreed.\n\nThere is much discussion about the virtue of using \"stare decisis\". Supporters of the system, such as minimalists, argue that obeying precedent makes decisions \"predictable\". For example, a business person can be reasonably assured of predicting a decision where the facts of his or her case are sufficiently similar to a case decided previously. This parallels the arguments against retroactive (ex post facto) laws banned by the U.S. Constitution.\n\n",
                "Last resort rule\n\nIn Constitutional law, the Last Resort Rule is a largely prudential rule which gives a federal court the power to avoid a constitutional issue in some circumstances. This rule dictates that, even if all other jurisdictional and justiciability obstacles are surmounted, federal courts still must avoid a constitutional issue if there is any other ground upon which to render a final judgment. The last resort rule can function as a distinct barrier to Constitutional avoidance. It is articulated by Justice Brandeis in Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\nBrandeis cited two examples in Ashwander of the \"most varied application\" of the last resort rule. First, as between two potential grounds, one involving a constitutional question, the other a question of statutory construction or general law, the Court will only decide the latter. To the extent the question involves statutory construction and a plausible interpretation of the statute might obviate the need for constitutional review, this example replicates the seventh rule of the avoidance doctrine.\n\nTo illustrate this first application, Brandeis relied primarily on Siler v. Louisville & Nashville Railroad Co. In Siler, a railroad company challenged an order by the Kentucky railroad commission setting maximum rates on commodities transported by rail within the state. The company asserted a takings claim and a Commerce Clause claim under the United States Constitution, as well as state law claims, including a claim that the commission had exceeded its statutory authorization in making such an order. The Supreme Court upheld the lower federal court's order enjoining enforcement of the maximum rate order. The Court indicated, however, that the lower court should have enjoined the rate order on state law grounds, without reaching the federal constitutional grounds.\n\nThe Court in Siler confirmed that once the lower court properly determined that it had federal question jurisdiction, the court had the right to decide either all questions or only the state law questions. The Siler Court stated that where a case can be decided without reference to questions arising under the federal Constitution, that course is \"usually pursued and is not departed from without important reasons.\" The Court declared it better to decide the case with regard to the construction of the state statute, and the authority therein given to the Commission to make the order in question, rather than to unnecessarily decide the various constitutional questions appearing in the record.\n\nThe Siler Court offered no case precedent or doctrinal ground for this policy decision. The discretionary nature of the Court's decision limits the extent to which Siler serves as a primary basis for an absolute last resort rule. After recognizing the lower court's authority to decide the constitutional questions, the Court decided to follow the \"usual course\" of avoiding such questions if questions of local law would resolve the dispute. This purely prudential formulation of the rule allows courts to dispense with the rule for \"important reasons.\" 1 Although Brandeis prefaced his avoidance doctrine discussion in Ashwander by casting the seven rules as prudential, his formulation of the last resort rule omits this \"important reasons\" qualification. Thus, an evaluation of the proper scope of the last resort rule requires a determination of whether the qualifying phrase should be employed, or whether the rule should be viewed as an absolute.\n\n\"Pullman abstention\" represents the most prominent development of this initial application of the last resort rule after Ashwander. \n\nThe second application Brandeis furnished to demonstrate the last resort rule in Ashwander is the adequate and independent state ground doctrine: \"Appeals [to the United States Supreme Court] from the highest court of a state challenging its decision of a question under the Federal Constitution are frequently dismissed because the judgment can be sustained on an independent state ground.\" When reviewing judgments of state courts, the United States Supreme Court only reviews questions of federal law. The Court will decline to hear a case if an adequate and independent state ground supports the judgment of the state court. The Court reasons that, if a state ground independently supports the judgment, a decision by the Court on federal law grounds will have no effect on the outcome of the case and will amount to an advisory opinion.\n\nThe Supreme Court has provided six closely related justifications for the general doctrine of avoiding constitutional questions, noting their grounding in \"the unique place and character . . . of judicial review of governmental action for constitutionality.\"\n\nThe Court has often called judicial review of legislative acts the most important and delicate of its responsibilities. The Court's characterization of judicial review of legislative acts as a \"delica[te]\" function, \"particularly in view of possible consequences for others stemming also from constitutional roots,\" fundamentally justifies the general avoidance doctrine. An evaluation of the force of this assertion as a justification for avoiding constitutional questions must be linked to evaluation of a second justification offered for the avoidance doctrine, that such review is a \"final\" function. If the Court renders a final, binding conclusion as to constitutional interpretation each time it speaks on a constitutional issue, the arduous task of amending the Constitution may provide the only counter to the Court's ruling. If, however, the Court acts as more or less an equal participant with other political actors in an ongoing dialogue, those other non-judicial actors can reinterpret and reapply a constitutional provision.\n\nThe avoidance doctrine is also premised on \"the inherent limitations of the judicial process, arising especially from its largely negative character and limited resources of enforcement.\" Additionally, federal courts are vulnerable to the extent their jurisdiction and the work of their judges are subject to control by the other branches. Proponents of avoidance techniques such as the last resort rule believe that the federal judiciary must exercise its powers cautiously to conserve the fragile credibility of the least dangerous branch. \n\nIn 1947, evaluating the avoidance doctrine generally, the Supreme Court speculated that to pursue another policy -- a policy of \"accelerated decision\" -- \"might have put an end to, or seriously impaired, the distinctively American institution of judicial review.\" The Court continued: \"It is not without significance for the [avoidance] policy's validity that the periods when the power [of judicial review of legislative acts] has been exercised most readily and broadly have been the ones in which this Court and the institution of judicial review had their stormiest experiences.\"\n\nAckerman notes that Bickel's countermajoritarian difficulty \"recalls the Old Court's long, and ultimately futile, judicial struggle against the New Deal.\" By using the last resort rule frequently, the Court can live with a constitutional problem and let a solution simmer until widespread acceptance is at hand. Bickel argued that the avoidance doctrine, by allowing the judiciary to render unpopular decisions cautiously, rather than suddenly or haphazardly, preserves judicial credibility and increases public acceptance of Court decisions. The last resort rule allows judges to determine when widespread acceptance is at hand or when more simmering is necessary.\n\nAnother justification for the avoidance doctrine is the \"paramount importance of constitutional adjudication in our system.\" This justification overlaps to some extent with the delicate and final nature of the constitutional function, discussed above, but it also implicates the role of constitutional rights. The Court sometimes claims that the ability to declare constitutional rights is the most important power the federal judiciary wields. But many individual rights depend on administrative and statutory claims. Justice Antonin Scalia has argued that not \"every constitutional claim is ipso facto more worthy, and every statutory claim less worthy, of judicial review.\" A decision by a court clarifying a statutory or procedural entitlement to relief may have a tremendous effect on a great number of individuals, or on the workings of an administrative agency.\n\nTwo forceful justifications for the avoidance doctrine are \"the necessity, if government is to function constitutionally, for each [branch] to keep within its power, including the courts\" and \"the consideration due to the judgment of other repositories of constitutional power [*1048] concerning the scope of their authority.\" These justifications are grounded in the separation of powers principle in a constitutional and prudential sense.\n\nIn addition to maintaining appropriate power relations among the national branches, the final two justifications for the avoidance doctrine also encompass federalism concerns. Federal courts must defer appropriately to the powers retained by states and their courts. This comity concern implicates two important applications of the last resort rule: Pullman abstention and the adequate and independent state ground doctrine.\nIn Railroad Commission of Texas v. Pullman Co., the Texas Railroad Commission issued an order requiring that white Pullman conductors, not black Pullman porters, operate sleeping cars. Several railroad companies, and the intervening Pullman porters, challenged the order as unauthorized by state law and unconstitutional under the Equal Protection, Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the federal Constitution. The Court acknowledged that the \"complaint of the Pullman porters undoubtedly tendered a substantial constitutional issue.\" But the Court avoided the issue by abstaining from decision. Justice Frankfurter wrote:\n\nIf the Texas Commission had acted beyond the scope of its authority, the order would be declared invalid under Texas law and no court would need to reach the equal protection issue. Finding the state law unclear, the Court balked at \"making a tentative answer\" regarding Texas law which the Texas Supreme Court could displace the next day. So the Court handed the politically explosive case to the state court for resolution of state law issues.\n\nToday, if a federal court were presented with a case identical to Pullman and the parties chose not to press the nonconstitutional claims, the court, relying on Zobrest, could reach the equal protection claim. Relying on Siler, the court could decide the state law issues itself; or, alternatively, it could apply Pullman abstention. The Court in Pullman used abstention both to avoid wasting federal resources on a \"tentative\" state law decision and to avoid the \"friction of a premature constitutional adjudication.\" Abstention furthered harmony between state and federal courts \"without the need of rigorous congressional restriction of those powers.\" \n\nIn contrast to Pullman abstention, one branch of the adequate and independent state ground doctrine constitutes appropriate application of the last resort rule. The branch dealing with parallel state and federal constitutional provisions has developed in a manner that accords sufficient regard for comity interests while preserving adequate federal court review of constitutional claims. The branch of the doctrine dealing with state procedural foreclosure, however, is more problematic.\n\nThe Supreme Court is entitled to review all federal issues, including constitutional issues, on appeal from a final judgment of the highest state courts in order to preserve federal supremacy and advance uniformity in federal law. The Court will refuse to hear a case, however, if an adequate and independent state ground supports the decision. By deferring to state court decisions based on an adequate and independent state ground, the doctrine addresses Brandeis' concern of federal judicial interference with state authority. The doctrine is generally grounded in efforts to avoid advisory opinions and unnecessary constitutional rulings, and the premise of according sufficient respect to the authority of state courts. It applies only when litigation begins in state courts rather than the lower federal courts. This could be because of a desire to proceed in state court or because Congress has limited the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts.\n\nThe first branch of the doctrine commonly applies where state and federal constitutional provisions are implicated. The application of the adequate and independent state ground doctrine in cases involving state procedural foreclosure is more troublesome. In such instances, failure to adhere to a state procedural rule is often deemed an adequate basis to avoid Supreme Court review of a federal constitutional claim. State procedural law is thus allowed to frustrate federal constitutional rights because of the decision to respect state procedural rules. The second major criticism of the adequate and independent state ground doctrine is that it contributes to inaccuracy and inconsistency in federal law because state courts' erroneous interpretations of federal law remain on the books as long as the judgment is supported by an adequate and independent state ground. The state court's rulings on federal law, however, arguably amount to no more than dicta because those rulings do not provide the basis for the judgment. The Supreme Court might promote uniformity by addressing constitutional claims even when a judgment is supported by adequate and independent state grounds. The ability of the Court, however, to promote uniformity effectively is questionable in our large nation. In any event, uniformity may not always be desirable. The constitutional dialogue may be advanced by a multiplicity of pronouncements from state and federal courts on federal constitutional law.\n\nLike Pullman abstention, the adequate and independent state ground doctrine may disrupt and delay the vindication of federal rights, and make litigation of federal rights less efficient because of prolonged state proceedings and federal review. These concerns are less troubling in this context because the litigation begins in state court. Either that choice is voluntary and litigants could avoid the adequate and independent state ground doctrine by going to federal court initially, or that initial choice is restricted by congressional jurisdictional allocations and deference to state law in particular areas. Congress can alter such allocations in light of restrictions imposed by the adequate and independent state ground doctrine.\n\nBecause the Supreme Court may ultimately review state decisions denying relief under the federal Constitution based on parallel state constitutional grounds, the first branch of the doctrine is a more easily justified application of the last resort rule.\n\n"
